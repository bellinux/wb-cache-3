Professionals in the field of recreation have long recognized the potential problem of increasing amount of leisure time and how it will affect individuals and society. Of particular note are those people who are unable to use their free time beneficially. One witnesses patients suffering the ???<b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> <b>syndrome,???</b> returning again and again to the institutional atmosphere because they cannot adjust to the outside world. After studying various leisure counseling theories and delivery modes, a handbook was developed to be used in actual leisure counseling situations with psychiatric, alcoholic, stroke, and cardiac patients at several Veteran's Administration Hospitals. The handbook design was formulated to allow the participant to visualize and assimilate leisure information and values through involvement in a group counseling process. (See more in text. ...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. {{health care}} system suffers from a chronic malady [...] the <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> <b>syndrome</b> at its hospitals. It is so bad that the federal {{government}} says one in five elderly patients is back in the hospital within 30 days of leaving. Some return trips are predictable elements of a treatment plan. Others are unplanned but difficult to prevent: patients go home, new and unexpected problems arise, and they require an immediate trip back to the hospital. But many of these readmissions can and should be prevented. They are the result of a fragmented system of care that too often leaves discharged patients to their own devices, unable to follow instructions they didn't understand, and not taking medications or getting the necessary follow-up care. The federal government has pegged the cost of readmissions for Medicare patients alone at $ 26 billion annually, and says more than $ 17 billion of it pays for return trips that need not happen if patients get the right care. This is one reason the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has identified avoidable readmissions as one of the leading problems facing the U. S. {{health care system}} and now penalizes hospitals with high rates of readmissions for their heart failure, heart attack, and pneumonia patients. This report is being released in conjunction with the Robert Wood John Foundation's Care About Your Care initiative, which is devoted to improving care transitions when people leave the hospital. It looks at the issue of readmissions in two ways: by the numbers and {{through the eyes of the}} people who live them...|$|E

40|$|Though {{concern about}} student {{attrition}} and failure {{is not a}} new phenomenon, higher education institutions (HEIs) have struggled to significantly reduce the <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Open distance learning higher education is particularly susceptible to high student attrition. Despite a great deal of research into the student journey and factors impacting on likely success, we are not necessarily closer to understanding and being able to mitigate against student attrition. Learning analytics as emerging discipline and practice promises to help penetrate the fog… This case study describes work undertaken at the Open University in the UK to investigate how a learning analytics approach allows the University to provide timely and appropriate student support in a cost-effective manner. It includes a summary of the establishment of curriculum-based student support teams and a framework which defines more standardised student support informed by both student data and an enhanced knowledge of the curriculum. The primary aim of student support teams is to proactively support students through their study journey and to optimise their chances of reaching their declared study goals. Higher education institutions (HEIs) are making increasing use of learning analytics to support delivery of timely and relevant student support. The Open University in the UK, like other HEIs, knows a great deal about its students before they start to study and is able to track student behaviours once study has begun. Until recently, the university has not taken full advantage of the additional insight offered by such information. This paper describes the framework of support interventions established for all student support teams and describes the learning analytics approach used to support that framework...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Criminal Justice, Washington State UniversityPrisons can {{no longer}} be an end gate to incarcerate and {{incapacitate}} people who have broken the law. As exemplified by The Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI), Washington State Institute for Public Policy (WSIPP), and Washington States Senate Bill 6157, prisons must repair and prepare offenders for a successful return to their communities. With the backdrop of the nothing works retributive paradigm, rising incarceration rates, and <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the emergence of evidenced based practices introduces a new paradigm that offers an alternative management and intervention system for prison administration. Evidenced based practices reduce reoffending while supporting corrections goals of safety and security. The implementation of evidenced based practices within the current correctional paradigm of retribution is complex and challenging. Introducing and upholding this new rehabilitative paradigm is dependent upon a systemic, cognitive restructuring of the criminal justice system, specifically prisons. Prisons must undergo a cultural shift in balancing control management and coercion with rehabilitation. This conflict between the two paradigms has resulted in a precarious tipping point for research-based implementation and the ability to achieve sustainability while avoiding paradigm paralysis. This process evaluation analyzes the transition of a large male (2035 inmate) multi- custody level prison from a traditionally managed facility into a Therapeutic Community (Right Living) Reentry Center. The current study will expand on the limited research available on actual day-to-day organizational development, collaboration, and therapeutic community implementation. The purpose is twofold: (1) to examine the implementation of an evidenced based practice in a prison-based reality, and (2) identify the sustainability of the model in the current prison paradigm. This evaluation is important because it demonstrates why evidenced based practices proven effective in changing criminogenic behavior and reducing recidivism struggle for sustainability within prisons. Results indicate that utilization of sound implementation processes and evidenced based practices will not be sustained unless implemented within a system-wide integrated model. When the mission and goals of the organization identify offender change practices as extrinsic and not intrinsic to correctional goals, alternative management and therapeutic systems will continue to be expendable, and therefore unsustainable.

40|$|The University of South Africa (Unisa) as {{comprehensive}} open {{distance learning}} institution (ODL institution) in South Africa is fulfilling a critical social mandate to serve {{people who would}} otherwise {{not have access to}} education, either for financial reasons, being employed, living in remote areas, or because they cannot access residential universities owing to disability (Unisa, 2008 [a]: 15). In facilitating the entrée of the previously identified groups into tertiary education, Unisa has an open admission policy where students mostly have unlimited access to the system. The policy aims to cross the time, geographical, economic, social, educational, and communication distance between students, academics, courseware, and their peers and to accommodate these prospective students from diverse backgrounds (Unisa, 2008 : 2). Unisa’s self-evaluation portfolio for the Commonwealth Audit during 2008 mentioned that this policy leads to the <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> <b>syndrome</b> where students have unlimited access to the system but then often without success (Unisa, 2008 [a]: 27). Open access poses a challenge for the training of student social workers within an ODL context. The Department of Social Work at Unisa, currently trains 70 % of all social workers in South Africa (Department of Social Work - Unisa, 2008 : 5). Coupled with the former, is the fact that Unisa is regarded in the tertiary landscape of South Africa as the most affordable university with the result that it attracts large number of students who have come straight from school (Kilfoil cited in Schenck, 2009 : 299). In coping with the large student numbers the Department of Social Work at Unisa is challenged, apart from addressing the theoretical social work programme, to also meet the practical work requirements as set out by the Standard Generating Body of Social Work, in that it needs to provide practical placements for students to conduct their social work practical work training in completion of their Bachelor’s degree in Social Work (BSW) (Lawlor, 2008 : 19). The current state of affairs is that the numbers of students requiring practical placements for social work practical work training outnumber the number of practical placements available. In responding to and addressing these challenges, the Bright Site of Sunnyside Service-learning Centre (hereafter called “Bright Site” or the Bright Site”) was established in October 2008 as a strategic project by Unisa’s Department of Social Work. The Bright Site was developed in accordance with the service-learning model proposed by the Council for Higher Education (CHE) with the emphasis on service through learning, and learning through service (Department of Social Work Unisa, 2008 : 6).
