The MRI criteria of <b>reparability</b> were a peripheral rim smaller than 4 mm and a lesion longer than 10 mm. At arthroscopy the menisci were considered as reparable when the lesion was located in red–red or red–white zones and when it was more than 1 cm in length. A heterogeneous or homogeneous aspect of the meniscus body was also considered. The length of the meniscus lesion averaged 17. 6 mm and the thickness of the rim 3. 4 mm. A heterogeneous signal of the axial fragment and of the rim was found in 11 cases and in 48 cases, respectively. In 90 cases, {{there was no difference between}} the MRI-predicted <b>reparability</b> and the arthroscopic findings. Global sensitivity of MRI to determine <b>reparability</b> of full-thickness meniscus lesions was 94 %, increasing to 96 % for the medial meniscus and dropping to 83 % for the lateral meniscus.

A heterogeneous aspect of the rim did not compromise arthroscopic <b>reparability</b> whereas a heterogeneous aspect of the axial fragment indicated an irreparable meniscus. The described MRI criteria can predict meniscus <b>reparability.</b> Their accuracy is limited for lateral meniscus lesions close to the popliteal hiatus and for very young active patients in whom repair of white–white lesions can be attempted.

40|$|Background: Historically, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) has been very useful in diagnosing meniscal tears but not as valuable in predicting whether a meniscal tear is reparable. Given that several recent studies suggested that MRI {{can be used to}} predict tear <b>reparability,</b> the topic has resurfaced as a controversy in the orthopaedic and radiology literatures. Hypothesis: Experienced musculoskeletal radiologists can use MRI to predict the <b>reparability</b> of meniscal tears with good to excellent accuracy using the same arthroscopic criteria used by surgeons intraoperatively. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Fifty-eight patients with meniscal tears treated with repair were matched by age and sex with 61 patients with tears treated with meniscectomy. Two senior musculoskeletal radiologists independently and blindly reviewed preoperative MRI of these 119 meniscal tears. Using established arthroscopic criteria, the radiologists were asked to grade each tear 0 to 4, with 1 point for each of the following: a tear larger than 10 mm, within 3 mm of the meniscosynovial junction, greater than 50 % thickness, and with an intact inner meniscal fragment. Only a tear with a score of 4 would be predicted to be reparable. Results: The 2 radiologists' ability to correctly estimate <b>reparability</b> was poor, with 58. 0 % and 62. 7 % correct predictions (k = 0. 155 and 0. 250, respectively). Interrater reliability assessment showed that the raters agreed on a score of 4 (reparable) versus < 4 (not reparable) 73. 7 % of the time (k = 0. 434) but came to identical scores only 38. 1 % of the time (k = 0. 156). Determining the status of the inner fragment was the most predictive individual criterion and the only one to reach statistical significance (χ 2 = 14. 9, P <. 001).

This paper proposes a rational method, coupling the Performance Loss (PL), obtained with simplified analyses for Reinforced Concrete (RC) building classes, with available cost database, to gain insight on the convenience of repairing buildings that have been damaged by an earthquake. RC plane frames models, representative of existing building classes of varying storey number and construction age, are obtained with simulated design and taking into account the variation of mechanical and structural properties within each class. PL, that is a measure of deteriorated seismic performance for buildings having sustained damaging earthquakes, is determined with a mechanism based analysis applied to the structure in its intact and damaged state. Damaged structure is modeled after suitable modification, depending on the global spectral based ductility demand for the equivalent Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) system, of plastic hinges for the elements involved in the mechanism. The cost database accounts for the repair costs of more than 1900 RC buildings that were damaged after the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake.

Most Electric Light Trucks existing already in the market still adopt the classic powertrain lay-out used in thermal engine vehicles. The EC co-funded OPTIBODY project is developing new modular structure architecture for a European L 7 e category vehicle focused on safety improvement and exploring the capabilities of modularity applied to safety and <b>reparability.</b> The OPTIBODY vehicle has been designed using a modular structure architecture composed of a chassis, a cabin and several add-ons. The cabin will provide improved levels of comfort, protection and ergonomics to the user and the addons will provide protection in case of frontal, side and rear impact, including also crash compatibility and interaction with vulnerable road users. Europe, U. S. A., Canada, Japan and Australia were targeted for the initial analysis of the electric light vehicle worldwide situation to achieve the objectives of the project. The current light trucks fleet, accidentology and the requirements to be fulfilled by the vehicles were analyzed in the previous regions. The chassis, the cabin and the materials and a modular concept to improve self and partner protection safety. The thermal engine has been removed and substituted by electrical inwheels engines, and the extra space has been use to improve frontal impact and vulnerable road users protection. The requirements for certification of both L 7 e and low-speed vehicle categories in Europe and North America are very low in terms of safety and there is no mandatory crash test to evaluate neither pedestrian protection nor impact performance. OPTIBODY project has proposed frontal, side, rear and pedestrian impact tests and they have been use as targets to design the OPTIBODY vehicle to improve self and partner protection. Frontal crash test simulations showed an improvement in the cabin integrity and self and partner protection, as well as an improved pedestrian protection due to the extra space available, the use of new materials and the design of the add-on. The OPTIBODY vehicle adhered to the US commitment of Part 581 Zone, improving the crash compatibility of the vehicle. The use of modular architectures and new materials also improved the <b>reparability</b> of the vehicle.

Conventional frames (moment resisting, concentric/eccentric braced frames) are not well positioned with regard to <b>reparability.</b> It is therefore advisable to develop structural systems that are simple to repair, i. e. to introduce the <b>reparability</b> as a new property. Two innovative systems of seismic resistant steel frames with dissipative fuses were developed. (1) Fuseis 1 consists of two closely spaced strong columns, rigidly connected to multiple beams. The beams run from column to column or alternatively are interrupted and connected by short pins. (2) Fuseis 2 devices are seismic fuses for steel and composite steel–concrete moment resisting frames. The fuse is obtained by means of plates bolted/ welded to the web and the flanges of the beam. In case of strong earthquakes damage concentrates only in the fuses, which are exchangeable. Repair work after a strong seismic event, if needed, is limited only to replacing the fuses. The Fuseis system is able to dissipate energy by means of inelastic deformation and combines ductility and architectural transparency with stiffness. Experimental and theoretical investigations were performed to study the response of the fuses and the overall frames to cyclic loading. The investigations conclude with a design guide for practical application, including design examples.
