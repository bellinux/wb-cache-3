40|$|Abstract: Cancer {{support and}} {{rehabilitation}} are suggested {{to be an}} integral part of cancer care strategies. This study focuses on comparativeness of cancer support and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes.</b> The aim of this study was to analyse available cancer support and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> in Sweden presented as complementary to cancer rehabilitation at cancer clinics. A multiple case study design was chosen in order to inquire the small number of existing supportive and rehabilitative cancer programmes. Based on the structures, processes and outcomes of the nine included programmes, three types of cancer support and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> were identified: multimodal rehabilitation, comprehensive cancer support and art therapy. Cancer support and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> offer a variety of activities and therapies which are highly valuable and relevant for people with cancer. The typology of cancer support and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> and comparability between programmes need further inquiry...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} various types of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> on {{different}} labour market and health related outcomes are estimated. The main feature of this study, compared to previous research, is that it jointly evaluates multiple treatments by nonparametric matching estimators. The study is based on a sample of 6287 persons in western Sweden who are long-term sick ob-served during 1991 to 1994 and could participate in <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes.</b> Our results sug-gest that work-place training is superior to the other <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> with respect to labour market outcomes.

40|$|Whilst {{the overall}} {{effectiveness}} of offender <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> in reducing recidivism is now well established, {{there has been}} less discussion {{of the reasons why}} <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> may be unsuccessful for some offenders. In this paper we suggest that models of change developed in counselling and psychotherapy may have utility in explaining how offender <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> bring about change, and argue that the dominance of cognitive-behavioural treatments in the rehabilitation field means that those offenders who have particularly low levels of problem awareness may be at increased risk of treatment failure. Understanding more about the mechanisms by which programmes help offenders to desist from offending is likely to lead to the development of more responsive and, ultimately, more effective programmes. Some suggestions for those involved in the delivery of offender <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> include: being mindful of the sequence of components of programmes, the development of preparation (or readiness) programmes and offering a broad suite of programmes to cater for different stages of problem awareness and assimilation among offenders. <br /...|$|R

25|$|Dravid {{compensated}} for the below par performance in tests in 2001–02 season with a good show in the ODIs. On the tour to Zimbabwe, he scored an unbeaten 72 of 64 balls while chasing a target of 235 against Zimbabwe in the 3rd match of the tri-series guiding India to a 4-wicket win with 4 balls to spare. He was adjudged man of the match for his match winning knock. He {{ended up with a}} series aggregate of 121 runs from 5 matches at a decent average of 40.33 and a strike rate of 101.68. He was the only batsman with a strike rate of more than 100 among those who managed to aggregate more than 100 runs in the series. In the triangular series in Sri Lanka, India lost 3 consecutive matches and was on the brink elimination from the series. In the absence of injured Tendulkar and Zaheer and suspended Ganguly, Dravid captained the side in the 4th match and led them to their first win in the series. He played crucial innings in the last three league matches contributing to three consecutive victories, thus helping India qualify for the Finals which they eventually lost to Sri Lanka. Dravid topped India's run chart for the series scoring 259 runs at an average of 51.80 and a strike rate of 59.81. Dravid followed it up with another decent show in Standard Bank tri-series in South Africa, scoring 214 runs at an average of 53.50 and a strike rate of 71.81 including 3 fifties. He also kept wickets in the final two ODIs including the Final of the series effecting 3 stumpings. By the end of the South African tour, Dravid had started experiencing problem in his right shoulder. Although he played the ensuing home test series against England, he pulled out of the 5-match ODI series against England to undergo shoulder <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programme</b> in South Africa. He returned for the home series against Zimbabwe and had a forgettable outing in the ODI series barring the one inning of 66 not out from 59 balls in the 2nd match.|$|E

40|$|Aims: The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review {{was to investigate the}} factors that infl uence the efficacy of community-based <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> in improving the quality of life and daily functioning of adults with severe traumatic brain injury. Methods: A {{systematic review}} of the literature was conducted. In keeping with the principles of best evidence synthesis, the findings from the studies were analysed according to their methodological quality. Findings: Eleven studies were included in the review; synthesis of these studies revealed that the outcomes of community <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes</b> are mediated by a complex interaction between programme characteristics, participant characteristics and the methods used to assess outcomes. Variations in study methodology and quality further impact the extent to which treatment effectiveness can be demonstrated. There was evidence to support the use of telephone counselling and interdisciplinary team rehabilitation. There was moderate strength evidence indicating the psychosocial benefits of engaging in group <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes.</b> Conclusions: Outcome measures designed specifically for use with traumatic brain injury clients in community settings need to be validated.

A survey questionnaire was administered to capture the farmers’ perception on the most problematic weeds and the challenge they pose to <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes.</b> Experimental plots were laid out under simulated rainfall (sprinkler system). Three perennial grasses; Cenchrus ciliaris, Eragrostis superba, and Enteropogon macrostachyus, were used.

Results from this survey showed Ipomoea kituensis posed the greatest challenge to <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programmes.</b> Results also showed an inverse relationship in biomass yields between the weeds and established grasses across the three phenological stages.
