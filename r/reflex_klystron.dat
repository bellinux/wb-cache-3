2500|$|Right {{after the}} war, AT used 4 watt klystrons in its brand new network of {{microwave}} relay links {{that covered the}} US continent. The network provided long distance telephone service and also carried television signals for the major TV networks. [...] Western Union Telegraph Company also built point-to-point microwave communication links using intermediate repeater stations at about 40 mile intervals at that time, using 2K25 <b>reflex</b> <b>klystrons</b> in both the transmitters and receivers.|$|R
25|$|The {{solution}} {{was provided by}} well-known tube expert Robert W. Sutton at the Admiralty Signals Establishment. He designed a new tube for this purpose, today known as the Sutton tube but then more widely known as a <b>reflex</b> <b>klystron.</b> This was essentially a conventional two-cavity klystron with one cavity removed. The remaining cavity was fed a tiny amount of the output from the magnetron, causing the electrons passing by it {{to take up the}} pattern of the radio signal (this is the basis of all klystrons). Normally this would then pass the second resonator where the output would be tapped, but in the Sutton tube, the electrons instead approached a high-voltage plate that reflected them back towards their source. By carefully controlling the voltage of the reflector, the electrons would arrive having gained or lost a controlled amount of velocity, thus inducing a different frequency signal in the cavity as they passed it the second time. The combination of the original and new frequency produced a new signal that was sent to the conventional receiver. Sutton delivered an example producing 300mW in October 1940.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>reflex</b> <b>{{klystron}}</b> (also {{known as}} a Sutton tube after one of its inventors, Robert Sutton) was a low power klystron tube with a single cavity, which functioned as an oscillator. [...] It {{was used as a}} local oscillator in some radar receivers and a modulator in microwave transmitters the 1950s and 60s, but is now obsolete, replaced by semiconductor microwave devices.|$|E
2500|$|In the <b>reflex</b> <b>klystron</b> the {{electron}} beam {{passes through a}} single resonant cavity. The electrons are fired into {{one end of the}} tube by an electron gun. After passing through the resonant cavity they are reflected by a negatively charged reflector electrode for another pass through the cavity, where they are then collected. [...] The electron beam is velocity modulated when it first passes through the cavity. The formation of electron bunches takes place in the drift space between the reflector and the cavity. The voltage on the reflector must be adjusted so that the bunching is at a maximum as {{the electron}} beam re-enters the resonant cavity, thus ensuring a maximum of energy is transferred from the electron beam to the RF oscillations in the cavity. The reflector voltage may be varied slightly from the optimum value, which results in some loss of output power, but also in a variation in frequency. This effect is used to good advantage for automatic frequency control in receivers, and in frequency modulation for transmitters. The level of modulation applied for transmission is small enough that the power output essentially remains constant. At regions far from the optimum voltage, no oscillations are obtained at all.|$|E

In September 1942, he returned to Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, where he continued the development of cavity magnetrons and <b>reflex</b> <b>klystrons</b> for radar sets. In May 1944, he became one of three Australian physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project, which created the first atomic bombs.|$|R
40|$|A {{tool for}} the {{simulation}} of high frequency <b>reflex</b> <b>klystrons</b> is presented. Based on the Monte Carlo technique, this simulation includes loss mechanisms (due to the opacity of the grids) and {{takes into account the}} main peculiarities expected for device operation at millimeter and submillimeter wave frequencies. The tool has been used to study the effects of device parameters which are critical to the optimization of output power in a prototype 100 GHz micromachined structure based on a field emission electron source, namely, the electric field in the drift region and the grid distance. The results also show that this device can be used for direct generation of useful amounts of power at these frequencies...|$|R
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for aerial photography. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on microwave radar at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney. Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a cavity magnetron on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia. In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and <b>reflex</b> <b>klystrons</b> from prototypes into production models. Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.|$|R

40|$|Quiet (or sub-Poissonian) {{oscillators}} {{generate a}} number of dissipation events whose variance {{is less than the}} mean. It was shown in 1984 by Golubev and Sokolov that lasers driven by regular pumps are quiet in that sense. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that, as long as the laser-detector system is strictly stationary, quantization of the optical field is not required to explain such phenomena. The theory presented here is semi-classical, yet exact. Previous theories considering excited-state atoms regularly-injected in resonators, on the other hand, do require in principle light quantization. Specifically, we consider a laser involving a single electron permanently interacting with the field and driven by a constant-potential battery, and point out a similarity with <b>reflex</b> <b>klystrons.</b> The detected noise is found to be only 7 / 8 of the shot-noise level. It is therefore sub-Poissonian. Our calculations are related to resonance-fluorescence treatments but with different physical interpretations. Comment: 7 pages, submitted to Phys Rev...|$|R
50|$|An {{electron}} beam which enters an RF excited cavity with approximately synchronous velocity will receive cumulative velocity modulation at each gap. After some distance into the resonator, repeatedly accelerated electrons will be {{catching up with}} electrons repeatedly decelerated, and bunches will form. These bunches will have a velocity close to the beam velocity. If the electron velocity is somewhat greater than synchronous, the bunches will start to cross gaps when the field is retarding, rather than zero. When this happens, the electrons are slowed; their lost energy is gained by the cavity and sustained oscillations become possible. As the velocity of the beam entering the cavity is increased further, more energy is transferred to the cavity {{and the frequency of}} oscillation rises somewhat. Eventually, however, the bunches punch through the retarding fields and oscillations cease abruptly. Reducing the beam velocity (voltage) will cause the tube to resume oscillation. However, it is necessary to reduce the beam velocity below the value at which oscillations ceased before oscillation will start again. This phenomenon is known as hysteresis and is similar to that observed in many <b>reflex</b> <b>klystrons.</b>|$|R
40|$|The high {{temperature}} of the surface of Venus poses many difficulties. Previous Venus landers have only operated for short durations before succumbing to the heat. NASA Glenn Research Center conducted a study on communications for long duration Venus surface missions. I report the findings in this presentation. Current technology allows production of communications transceivers that can operate {{on the surface of}} Venus, at temperatures above 450 C and pressures of over 90 atmospheres. While these transceivers would have to be relatively simple, without much of the advanced signal processing often used in modern transceivers, since current and near future integrated circuits cannot operate at such {{high temperature}}s, the transceivers will be able to meet the requirements of proposed Venus Surface mission. The communication bands of interest are High Frequency or Very High Frequency (HFNHF) for communication between Venus surface and airborne probes (including surface to surface and air to air), and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) to Microwave bands for communication to orbiters. For HFNHF, transceivers could use existing vacuum tube technology. The packaging of the vacuum tubes may need modification, but the internal operating structure already operates at high temperatures. Using metal vacuum structures instead of glass, allows operation at high pressure. Wide bandgap transistors and diodes may be able to replace some of the thermionic components. VHF communications would be useful for line-of- sight operations, while HF would be useful for short-wave type communications using the Venusian ionosphere. UHF and microwave communications use magnetically focused thermionic devices, such as traveling wave tubes (TWTs), magnetron (M-type) amplifiers, and klystrons for high power amplifiers, and backward wave oscillators (BWOs) and <b>reflex</b> <b>klystrons</b> for oscillators. Permanent magnets are already in use in industry that can operate at 500 C. These magnets could focus electron beam tubes on the surface of Venus. While microwave windows will need to be designed for the high pressure, diamond windows have already been demonstrated, so high-pressure microwave windows can be designed and built. Thus, all of these devices could be useful for Venus surface missions. Current electronic power conditioners to supply the high voltages used in these microwave devices cannot operate at high temperatures, but earlier electronic power conditioners that used vacuum tubes can be modified to work at high temperature. Evaluating the various devices in this study, the M-type traveling wave tube (where a traveling wave structure is used in a crossed-field device, similar to the Amplitron used on the Apollo missions) stood out for the high power amplifier since it requires a single high voltage, simplifying the power supply design. Since the receiver amplifier is a low power amplifier, the loss of efficiency in linear beam devices without a depressed collector (and thus needing a single high voltage) is not important; a low noise TWT is a possible solution. Before solid-state microwave amplifiers were available, such TWTs were built with a 1 - 2 dB noise figure. A microwave triode or transistor made from a wide bandgap material may be preferable, if available. Much of the development work needed for Venusian communication devices will need to focus on the packaging of the devices, and their connections, but the technology is available to build transceivers that can operate on the surface of Venus indefinitely...|$|R

50|$|As work on radio-location {{gradually}} returned, {{a mobile}} system began development in 1938. Initially called Radio Ulavlivatel Samoletov (RUS, Radio Catcher of Aircraft),it was soon designated as RUS-1.

The two receivers, separately located {{some distance from the}} transmitter, allowed an estimation of range by using triangulation. Under Bonch-Bruevich's direction, scientists at NII-9 developed two types of very advanced microwave generators. In 1938, a linear-beam, velocity-modulated vacuum tube (a klystron) was developed, followed the next year by a simpler, single-resonator device (a <b>reflex</b> <b>klystron).</b>|$|E
50|$|In late 1940, the Soviet Air Forces {{developed}} {{a requirement for}} an on-board enemy aircraft radio-location system. The NII-9 was directed to design such a set for the new Petlyakov Pe-2 dive bomber. With size and weight restrictions, a microwave design using a recently developed <b>reflex</b> <b>klystron</b> (as it was later called) was selected. The experimental set was called Gneis (Origin) and operated at 16 cm (1.8 GHz). When the war started and the NII-9 radio-location capabilities went to Moscow, NII-20 took over the development of Gneis. Tikhomirov was assigned Chief Designer, and retained this role through all future upgrades.|$|E
50|$|In late 1940, the VVS {{developed}} {{the requirement for}} an on-board enemy aircraft detection system. The radio-location group at NII-9 in Leningrad was directed to design such a set for the Pe-2. Most of radio-location equipment {{at that time was}} large and heavy, and for this aircraft, a small, lightweight set was needed. Also, limitations on antenna size drove the design to frequencies as high as possible. The <b>reflex</b> <b>klystron</b> (as it was later called) had just been developed by Nikolay Devyatkov. Using this, design was started on a set designated Gneis (Origin) and operating at 16 cm (1.8 GHz).|$|E
50|$|When the NII-9 was {{evacuated}} to Moscow in July 1941, this greatly {{affected the}} schedule. Also, the <b>reflex</b> <b>klystron</b> {{had not been}} put into production and its availability in the future was doubtful; therefore, the project was terminated. The need, however, for an airborne radio-location set was now even more important; the Pe-3, a heavy fighter variant of the Pe-2, was in production. Some of these aircraft were being configured as night-fighters, and the radar (as it was now called) was urgently needed. The NII-20 and Factory 339 took up the design, led by the Technical Director, Victor Tikhomirov.|$|E
50|$|A Sutton tube, or <b>reflex</b> <b>klystron,</b> {{is a type}} of {{vacuum tube}} used to {{generate}} microwaves. It is a low-power device used primarily for two purposes; one is to provide a tuneable low-power frequency source for the local oscillators in receiver circuits, and the other, with minor modifications, as a switch that could turn on and off another microwave source. The second use, sometimes known as a soft Sutton tube or rhumbatron switch, was a key component in the development of microwave radar during World War II. Microwave switches of all designs, including these, are more generally known as T/R tubes or T/R cells.|$|E
5000|$|Oskar Heil and Agnesa Arsenjewa-Heil {{in their}} {{pioneering}} paper developed {{the concept of}} the velocity-modulated tube, in which a beam of electrons could be made to form into [...] "bunches" [...] and thereby generate with reasonable efficiency radio waves of considerably higher frequency and power than were possible with conventional vacuum tubes/thermionic valves. This resulted in production of the [...] "Heil tube", the first truly-practicable microwave generator, which slightly predated the (independent) invention of the klystron and subsequently the <b>reflex</b> <b>klystron</b> based on the same operating principle. These devices were a significant milestone in the development of microwave technology (particularly radar), and velocity-modulated tubes are still very much in use at the present day.|$|E
50|$|At the NII-9 under Bonch-Bruyevich, {{scientists}} developed {{two types}} of very advanced microwave generators. In 1938, a linear-beam, velocity-modulated vacuum tube (a klystron) was developed by Nikolay Devyatkov, based on designs from Kharkiv. This device produced about 25 W at 15-18 cm (2.0-1.7 GHz) and was later used in experimental systems. Devyatkov followed this with a simpler, single-resonator device (a <b>reflex</b> <b>klystron).</b> At this same time, D. E. Malyarov and N. F. Alekseyev were building a series of magnetrons, also based on designs from Kharkov; {{the best of these}} produced 300 W at 9 cm (3 GHz). Also at NII-9, D. S. Stogov was placed in charge of the improvements to the Bistro system. Redesignated as Reven (Rhubarb), it was tested in August 1938, but was only marginally better than the predecessor. With additional minor operational improvements, it was made into a mobile system called Radio Ulavlivatel Samoletov (RUS, Radio Catcher of Aircraft), soon designated as RUS-1. This continuous-wave, bi-static system had a truck-mounted transmitter operating at 4.7 m (64 MHz) and two truck-mounted receivers.|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} {{was provided by}} well-known tube expert Robert W. Sutton at the Admiralty Signals Establishment. He designed a new tube for this purpose, today known as the Sutton tube but then more widely known as a <b>reflex</b> <b>klystron.</b> This was essentially a conventional two-cavity klystron with one cavity removed. The remaining cavity was fed a tiny amount of the output from the magnetron, causing the electrons passing by it {{to take up the}} pattern of the radio signal (this is the basis of all klystrons). Normally this would then pass a second resonator where the output would be tapped, but in the Sutton tube the electrons instead approached a high-voltage plate that reflected them back towards their source. By carefully controlling the voltage of the reflector, the electrons would arrive having gained or lost a controlled amount of velocity, thus inducing a different frequency signal in the cavity as they passed it the second time. The combination of the original and new frequency produced a new signal that was sent into the conventional receiver. Sutton delivered an example producing 300 mW in October 1940.|$|E
