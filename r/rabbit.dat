5|$|In 2012, Thompson wrote The Further Tale of Peter <b>Rabbit</b> as an {{addition}} to the Peter <b>Rabbit</b> series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of The Tale of Peter <b>Rabbit.</b> She was approached by the publishers to write it, the first authorised Peter story since 1930 {{and the only one}} not written by Potter. The book falls {{in the middle of the}} earlier series, rather than at the end, and takes Peter <b>Rabbit</b> outside of Mr. McGregor's garden and into Scotland. It was a New York Times Best Seller. In 2013, Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled The Christmas Tale of Peter <b>Rabbit.</b>|$|E

5|$|The predilection of the Welsh for roasted cheese led to {{the dish}} of Welsh rarebit, or Welsh <b>rabbit,</b> {{seasoned}} melted cheese poured over toasted bread. The cheese {{would need to be}} a harder one, such as chedder or similar. Referred to as Welsh <b>rabbit</b> as early as 1725, the name is not similar to the Welsh term caws pobi. Welsh folk rarely ate <b>rabbit</b> due to the cost and as land owners would not allow <b>rabbit</b> hunting, so the term is more likely a slur on the Welsh. The name evolved from <b>rabbit</b> to rarebit, possibly to remove the slur from Welsh cuisine or due to simple reinterpretation of the word to make menus more pleasant.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Infrared video {{observations}} {{were used to}} study behaviour in the nestboxes of both adult wild and domestic <b>rabbits.</b> A total of 1080 hours of observations of wild <b>rabbits</b> and 1008 hours of observations of domestic <b>rabbits</b> kept in two enclosures with free access to two nestboxes and some other hiding-places were analysed. Both wild and domestic adult <b>rabbits</b> spent a considerable part of their time (54. 9 % in wild and 30. 6 % in domestic <b>rabbits)</b> in pairs or in groups of three and voluntarily were in body contact between 65. 3 % (domestic <b>rabbits)</b> and 80. 4 % (wild <b>rabbits)</b> of the time. While crouching together, both wild and domestic <b>rabbits</b> used {{only a very small}} nestbox space: 0. 08 to 0. 125 m 2 /animal in wild and 0. 14 to 0. 21 m 2 /animal in domestic <b>rabbits.</b> Between 7 a. m. and 4 p. m., an average of 2. 9 animals from a maximum of 3 wild <b>rabbits</b> stayed in the nestboxes. Domestic <b>rabbits</b> used nestboxes less: an average of 0. 9 adults were in the nestbox between 7 a. m. and 4 p. m. Adult domestic <b>rabbits</b> spent much more time than wild <b>rabbits</b> resting outside the nestbox including a wooden tube leading to the nestbox. The use of a small area for resting is a species-specific behaviour both in wild and domestic <b>rabbits.</b> Key Words: Wild <b>rabbits,</b> domestic <b>rabbits,</b> testing behaviour, social behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Nutritional-induced hypercholesterolaemia in New Zealand <b>rabbits</b> causes {{increased}} {{susceptibility to}} experimental infections. <b>Rabbits</b> fed cholesterol (0. 5 g%) for 8 weeks were injected intravenously with varying doses of Escherichia coli 0127 : B 8 lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 3 - 100 micrograms/kg). The levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and the survival rates of treated <b>rabbits</b> were then measured. <b>Rabbits</b> fed either normal chow or chow impregnated with sesame oil {{were used as}} controls. LPS induced higher serum TNF levels in hypercholesterolaemic <b>rabbits</b> than in normal <b>rabbits</b> or <b>rabbits</b> fed with chow containing sesame oil. TNF levels rose faster in hypercholesterolaemic <b>rabbits</b> than in normal <b>rabbits,</b> reaching maximum levels at 60 min and 120 min, respectively, after LPS injection. The survival rate of hypercholesterolaemic <b>rabbits</b> (1 / 11) was lower than in normal <b>rabbits</b> (6 / 7) or <b>rabbits</b> fed with the sesame oil chow (4 / 4) at the higher LPS doses. No death occurred at lower doses. One possible interpretation of these results, also supported by neutralization experiments, is that increased TNF secretion in hypercholesterolaemic <b>rabbits</b> raises the host's susceptibility to experimental endotoxaemia and possibly to Gram-negative infection...|$|R

40|$|Thirty-two {{different}} {{strains of}} Escherichia coli isolated from diarrheic commercial <b>rabbits</b> showing intestinal attachment of bacilli were studied. None of the strains produced thermostable or thermolabile enterotoxins, and none was invasive. Strains isolated from suckling <b>rabbits</b> attached in vitro to the brush borders of intestinal villi, whereas strains from weanling <b>rabbits</b> did not. After experimental infection of 5 -week-old <b>rabbits,</b> the 26 strains isolated from weaned diarrheic <b>rabbits</b> {{attached to the}} epithelium of ileum, cecum, and colon, whereas only slight attachment was found after infection with the six strains isolated from suckling diarrheic <b>rabbits.</b> The former strains induced diarrhea in 87 % of the <b>rabbits,</b> whereas the latter induced diarrhea in only 9 % of inoculated <b>rabbits.</b> E. coli isolated from healthy <b>rabbits</b> did not cause diarrhea. Strains isolated from diarrheic suckling <b>rabbits</b> all belonged to serotype O 109 :K-:H 2, whereas strains from diarrheic weaned <b>rabbits</b> belonged to at least eight different serogroups.

40|$|One million pet <b>rabbits</b> {{are kept}} in The Netherlands, {{but there are no}} data {{available}} on their behaviour and welfare. This study seeks to assess the welfare of pet <b>rabbits</b> in Dutch households and is a first step {{in the development of a}} welfare assessment system. In an internet survey, housing systems, general up-keep and behaviour of pet <b>rabbits</b> were reported by their owners. The answers of 912 respondents were analysed with behavioural observations carried out on 66 <b>rabbits</b> in as many households. The <b>rabbits</b> were observed in their home cage and during three fear-related tests: a contact test, a handling test and an open-field test. The survey revealed that the average lifespan of the <b>rabbits</b> is approximately 4. 2 years (the maximum potential lifespan is 13 years) and solitary housing appears to reduce lifespan. Close to half of respondents subjected their <b>rabbit(s)</b> to solitary housing and the majority housed them in relatively small cages (< 5, 000 cm 2). Health risks may arise from a failure to inoculate <b>rabbits</b> and via inappropriate diet. During the contact test, solitary-housed <b>rabbits</b> made more contacts with a human than group-housed <b>rabbits</b> and <b>rabbits</b> in a small housing system made more contacts than those in a large system. Observations in the home cage differed greatly compared with the natural time budget of <b>rabbits,</b> ie displaying increased stereotypic behaviour and decreased foraging and, in solitary-housed <b>rabbits,</b> a complete lack of social behaviour. Nearly 25 % of <b>rabbits</b> displayed strong resistance to being picked up, indicating socialisation problems. During the open-field test, solitary-housed <b>rabbits</b> sat up more than social-housed <b>rabbits</b> suggesting increased fearfulness. These findings indicate that the conditions in which pet <b>rabbits</b> are kept often have a negative impact on their welfare, further underlining the need to study this in greater detai...|$|R
5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a feral cat carrying a <b>rabbit</b> corpse (<b>rabbit</b> bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami <b>rabbit</b> needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this <b>rabbit</b> is not likely to inhabit it.

5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{purchased}} the film rights to Gary K. Wolf's novel Who Censored Roger <b>Rabbit?</b> shortly after its publication in 1981. Ron W. Miller, {{then president of}} Disney, {{saw it as a}} perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982, but Disney declined as his two previous films (I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Used Cars) had been box office bombs. Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director, Paul Reubens voicing Roger <b>Rabbit,</b> Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, and Russi Taylor as Jessica <b>Rabbit.</b> The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner, the then-new CEO of Disney. Amblin Entertainment, which consisted of Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, were approached to produce Who Framed Roger <b>Rabbit</b> alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive.|$|E
5|$|While Oliver & Company and {{the next}} feature The Little Mermaid were in production, Disney collaborated with Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and master {{animator}} Richard Williams to produce Who Framed Roger <b>Rabbit,</b> a groundbreaking live-action/animation hybrid directed by Robert Zemeckis, which featured licensed animated characters from other animation studios. Disney {{set up a new}} animation studio under Williams' supervision in London to create the cartoon characters for Roger <b>Rabbit,</b> with many of the artists from the California studio traveling to England to work on the film. A significant critical and commercial success, Roger <b>Rabbit</b> won three Academy Awards for technical achievements. and was key in renewing mainstream interest in American animation. Other than the film itself, the studio also produced three Roger <b>Rabbit</b> shorts during the late 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E
