An unexplored explanation is that <b>resident</b> <b>trust</b> of police and perceptions of police legitimacy may depend on neighborhood levels of social capital.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a review {{on the role}} played by civil society organisations (CSOs) in urban planning advocacy in Zimbabwe. To demonstrate this, the article draws on the cases of the residents, associations and other CSOs from Zimbabwe’s major cities and towns namely Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru and Mutare. CSOs such as Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA), Harare <b>Residents</b> <b>Trust</b> (HRT), Gweru <b>Residents</b> Association, Bulawayo Progressive Residents Association, Mutare Resident and Ratepayers Association (MURA) and Zimbabwe Homeless People’s Federation and Dialogue on Shelter (ZHPFDS) are instrumental in championing the interests of the urban poor, so that their concerns are represented in the urban development discourse. CSOs are also critical in bringing good urban governance and social justice in cities. Other Civil Society Organisations such as ZHPFDS specialise solely on advocacy for housing land and, within their ambit, work towards ensuring that the housing poor and homeless have a roof over their head. This is an emphasis on the ‘hard infrastructure’ provision. On the other hand, there are CSOs concerned almost purely on the ‘soft infrastructure’ like public awareness campaigns on making city authorities account for their service provision and other related urban governance issues. These groups, like Harare <b>Residents</b> <b>Trust</b> (HRT) often use threat to organise protests and campaigns against bureaucratic injustices and making the resident empowered in informational terms. The paper suggests mutuality and close linkage between CSOs in development and CSOs in the advanced agendas for social justice towards urban sustainability and meaningful governance. Such an approach can be replicated within Zimbabwe, and ultimately across Africa and beyond...|$|R

40|$|The Netherlands has {{dozens of}} {{disadvantaged}} neighbourhoods where residents lack the ‘collective efficacy’ to guard themselves against disorder and crime. A multitude of interventions {{are used to}} try to improve the situation, but it is unknown if these interventions work. This book is a so called ‘realist evaluation’ of interventions implemented by local organizations such as municipalities, housing corporations and police in order to make disadvantaged neighbourhoods more liveable and safe. As such, this book is intended to make clear which interventions are promising. A realist evaluation means that an hypothesis about the effectiveness of interventions that has been formulated on the basis of theory, is further sharpened (where needed) on the basis of empirical research (Tilley 2010). One of today's major criminological theories, is collective efficacy theory by Sampson et al. (1997). Drawing and improving on this theory we state that the collective efficacy of a neighbourhood is its residents capability to exercise informal social control on incidents of disorder and crime. This capability is based on the <b>residents</b> <b>trust</b> in each other and on their trust in professionals working for local organizations. Where there’s distrust, collective efficacy is weakened. This means that a improvement of a neighbourhoods liveability and safety calls for a strengthening of collective efficacy – which in the first place demands regaining trust. Our hypothesis about the strengthening of collective efficacy, is that <b>residents</b> <b>trust</b> can be regained because professionals - through their collaboration on interventions – exercise formal social control on incidents of disorder and crime. On the basis of their regained <b>trust</b> <b>residents</b> will subsequently be more willing and able to act against disorder and crime themselves. This theoretical reasoning of how interventions could have the foreseen effect, is followed by empirical research on their implementation in order to ascertain to what extent this effect actually can take place. To this end we have developed a qualitative research design. The field research has been done from two complementary perspectives. One is focused on professionals who collaborate on interventions (Verwer), the other is focused on residents who live together in four disadvantaged neighbourhoods (Walberg). Comparing the two perspectives makes it possible to ascertain to what extent three requirements have been met for regaining trust...|$|R

50|$|For most of Crundwell's tenure, <b>residents</b> <b>trusted</b> her {{despite the}} city's perilous {{economic}} conditions. They assumed that either she inherited wealth and/or that her award-winning quarter horse breeding business was profitable {{in its own}} right. By the late 2000s, with the financial crisis and economic recession, as city maintenance and equipment suffered, there were some suspicions that she was stealing money, which went as high as Mayor James G. Burke. However, the city's outside auditors, Clifton Gunderson (now CliftonLarsonAllen after merging with LarsonAllen in 2012) and local accountant Sam Card, dismissed his concerns, as they presumed that Crundwell was honest and signed off on Crundwell's financial statements annually without concern. For small American cities similar to Dixon, lack of sufficient outside audits was a recurring problem, as third-party auditors at best could only give limited attention. For most of her tenure as comptroller, Crundwell had nearly complete control over the city's accounts, while few if any city employees {{had access to the}} city financial statements.|$|R
40|$|Among {{the social}} costs of {{urbanization}} and work in urban environments is that they leads to more mistrust among strangers, {{making it more difficult}} to reap the many social and organizational benefits of trust. Past research has proposed greater population density, size, and diversity as explanations for why city <b>residents</b> <b>trust</b> strangers less than small town residents. We argue that past research overlooked one simple difference between more and less urban environments—the amount of cues of nature that people encounter in their everyday lives. The habitat preference model suggests that humans acquired preferences for natural habitats over the course of their evolutionary history, causing people to feel safer in environments that resemble their natural habitats. We reasoned that the relative absence of nature cues in cities decreases people’s sense of safety. This, in turn, makes them less likely to make themselves additionally vulnerable in interpersonal interactions by trusting strangers. Three studies, using experimental and correlational field methods, found results consistent with the theory...|$|R
30|$|Thirdly, we {{find that}} some key {{indicators}} of the respondents’ social status have an important impact on police trust. Our analysis proves correlations between police trust and gender, ethnicity (minority or majority), education level, and Hukou. That is to say, male respondents have lower police trust than females; Han nationality’s police trust is lower than ethnic minority’s; young people trust police less than the elder; police trust of higher educated individuals is {{lower than that of}} lower educated; and urban <b>residents</b> <b>trust</b> police less than rural residents. Social vulnerable groups are usually those who perform dissatisfaction and distrust to the system, while as mentioned above, males, Han nationality, youth, highly educated people, and urban residents do not belong to social vulnerable groups in a traditional sense. Social reform and sustained economic growth may impelled the expectations of these groups towards the government continuously, as well as their discontent with the government, meanwhile their trust to government presents a declining tendency. Such phenomenon was quite similar to “critical citizens” observed in Western democracy countries since the 1990 s (Norris 1999). The relationship between these groups and police trust needs to be discussed in the next stage.|$|R

40|$|Using a {{multilevel}} study design, {{this study}} examined the associations between social characteristics of individuals and neighbourhoods and physical activity among women. Women (n = 1405) recruited from 45 Melbourne (Australia) neighbourhoods of varying socioeconomic disadvantage provided data on social factors and leisure-time: physical activity; walking; and walking in one’s own neighbourhood. Individual level social factors were number of neighbours known and social participation. Neighbourhood-level social characteristics (interpersonal trust, norms of reciprocity, social cohesion) were derived by aggregating survey data on these constructs within neighbourhoods. Objective data on crimes within neighbourhoods were obtained from Victoria Police. In bivariable regression models, all social variables at both the individual and neighbourhood level were positively associated with odds of physical activity, walking, and walking in one’s own neighbourhood. Associations with individual social participation (associated with all three physical activity variables) and neighbourhood interpersonal trust (associated with overall physical activity only) remained significant in multivariable models. Neither neighbourhood crime against the person nor incivilities were associated with any form of physical activity. These results demonstrate that women who participated in local groups or events and, less consistently, women living in neighbourhoods where <b>residents</b> <b>trusted</b> one another, were more likely to participate in leisure-time physical activity. While redressing macro-level social and economic policies that contribute to neighbourhood inequalities remains a priority, public health initiatives aimed at promoting physical activity could consider focusing on fostering social interactions targeting both individuals and communities. Further investigation of causal mechanisms underlying these associations is required. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{citizens}} and <b>residents</b> <b>trust</b> the government is crucial {{for the maintenance of}} democracy and a stable civil society. Trust in government generates willingness to conform to rules and regulations, as well as to work within the democratic system rather than turning to more confrontational or even violent political action. The {{degree to which}} immigrants trust the government has symbolic importance, reflecting how well we are staying true to our history as a melting pot and to our history as a nation of immigrants. Residents need to feel safe to contact authorities in case of emergency, without threat of deportation or other negative reprisals related to their immigration status. Existing research finds that Latinos in the United States are increasingly cynical, threatening various negative consequences for the political system. The health of our democracy thus demands a good understanding of the causes and consequences of Latino immigrant trust in government (or lack thereof). This article compares Latino trust in government {{in the context of the}} 2012 presidential election campaign—one in which outreach to Latino citizens in pursuit of their votes signaled that they were important and powerful members of the polity—to Latino trust in government in the context of the 2006 immigration marches—one in which Latinos found themselves taking to the streets to protest anti-Latino and anti-immigrant legislation. Latino political trust is sensitive to this shifting context, suggesting that how U. S. society treats Latino immigrants has powerful effects on their political socialization and attitudes...|$|R
40|$|Marketing {{of cities}} and places {{is in many ways}} common to {{marketing}} of products and services. The difference is that places are more multidimensional than products, which makes the marketing of them more complex. In marketing of places factors like cultural heritage, traditions and local stakeholders need to be kept in mind. This study examines how residents perceive the place marketing of their municipality. The study focuses on <b>resident’s</b> <b>trust</b> in the municipality and how this may be affected by various types of marketing from the municipality or municipal companies. To create understanding to this, one municipality was chosen as case study and 7 residents were interviewed. During the interviews, chosen parts of the municipalitys latest years’ marketing was shown. The respondent then were asked to describe his or hers perception of the marketing and how this might affect the perception of the municipality and the trust to it. The material from the interviews was transcribed and interpreted by models of how trust and confidence is built up or broken down. Four main themes of how place marketing affects residents’ trust was identified: Transparency, truth, consequence and benevolence. Transparence means the municipality’s openness and tendency to show uncensored representation. Truth is about to which extend the messages seems to be truthful. Consequence means how well reality matches the communicated message, and to which extent promises and expectations are fulfilled. Benevolence stands for the intention behind the message and the aim and purpose of it. The study shows examples of how the municipality’s marketing are able to affect all four factors in both positive and negative direction. Trust {{is an important factor in}} the community and a prerequisite for all kinds of interactions between people, organizations or institutions. This study provides understanding to the role of place marketing in <b>trust</b> between <b>residents</b> and their municipality...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many {{nursing home}} {{residents}} suffer from multimorbidity, frailty and dementia. A number of ethical challenges are connected to living and dying in nursing homes. Objective/purpose: This thesis investigates ethical challenges, decision-making and end-oflife care in nursing homes. The research focuses on the views of residents, relatives and staff on these topics. Materials and methods: The studies relied on a mixed methods approach. Qualitative research was based on qualitative description and interpretive description. In-depth interviews with {{nursing home residents}} and focus group interviews with relatives and nursing home staff were conducted. Questionnaires were used {{to collect data on}} ethical challenges in nursing homes and to document ethics discussions in five institutions in Austria, Germany and Norway. Results: From the perspective of residents and relatives, ethical challenges in nursing homes are mostly connected to everyday ethical issues. <b>Residents</b> <b>trust</b> relatives, physicians and nurses to make important decisions on their behalf, but many relatives do not know the resident’s wishes, and experience decision making as a burden. Many staff members describe ethical challenges as a burden and appreciate systematic ethics work. The most frequent ethical challenges are lack of resources, end-of-life issues, advance care planning and coercion. Ethics meetings can help to reach consensus in over three-quarters of cases. To implement systematic ethics work in nursing homes, time for reflection, ethics education and support from the management are needed. Residents were entirely absent in the documented ethics meetings. Conclusion and consequences: Both end-of-life issues and everyday ethical challenges are important in nursing homes. As relatives are often insecure about the wishes of residents, preparatory conversations about treatment preferences and advance care planning should be offered. Systematic ethics work should be implemented in all nursing homes. The regular participation of relatives, physicians and residents in ethics discussions should be encouraged. The participation of residents may strengthen their feelings of autonomy and dignity. Future perspectives: Further research should aim to investigate strategies to improve the participation of residents in ethics discussions. Research into the views of residents with cognitive impairment is lacking, due to methodological and ethical barriers. The advantages and disadvantages of different models for systematic ethics work in nursing homes need to be explored in more detail. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} social capital impacts of a large-scale, community-driven {{development}} {{project in the}} Philippines in which communities competed for block grants for infrastructure investment. The analysis uses a unique data set of about 2, 100 households collected before the project started (2003) and after one cycle of sub-project implementation (2006) in 66 treatment and 69 matched control communities. Participation in village assemblies, {{the frequency with which}} local officials meet with <b>residents</b> and <b>trust</b> towards strangers increased {{as a result of the}} project. However, there is a decline in group membership and participation in informal collective action activities. This may have been because households were time-constrained, so that in order to participate in project activities, they needed to temporarily reduce their participation in informal activities. An alternative explanation is that the project improved the efficiency of formal forms of social capital and thus households needed to rely less on informal forms. Finally, the results indicate that, in the short run, the project might have reduced the number of other investments.
