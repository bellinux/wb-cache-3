25|$|EastEnders is the BBC's most {{consistent}} programme {{in terms of}} ratings. It has proved highly popular and Appreciation Indexes reflected this, rising from 55–60 at the launch to 85–95 later on, a figure which was nearly ten points {{higher than the average}} for a British soap opera. Research suggested that people found the characters true to life, the plots believable and, importantly in the face of criticism of the content, people watched as a family and regarded it as viewing for all the family. Based on market research by BBC commissioning in 2003, EastEnders is most watched by 60- to 74-year-olds, closely followed by 45- to 59-year-olds. An average EastEnders episode attracts a total audience share between 35 and 40 percent. The same-day repeat showing on BBC Three attracted an average of 500,000 viewers, whilst the Sunday omnibus generally attracted 3 million. EastEnders {{is one of the more}} popular programmes on British television and while the show's <b>ratings</b> <b>have</b> fallen since its initial surge in popularity and the advent of multichannel digital television, the programme continues to be successful for the BBC. EastEnders two main rivals are ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale.|$|E

25|$|Soap opera <b>ratings</b> <b>have</b> {{significantly}} {{fallen in}} the U.S. since the 2000s. No new major daytime soap opera {{has been created}} since Passions in 1999, while many have been cancelled. Since January 2012, four daytime soap operas – General Hospital, Days of Our Lives, The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful – continue to air on the three major networks, down from a total of 12 during the 1990–91 season and a high of 19 in the 1969–70 season. This {{marks the first time}} since 1953 that there have been only four soap operas airing on broadcast television. The Young and the Restless, the highest-rated soap opera from 1988 to the present, had fewer than 5 million daily viewers as of February 2012, a number exceeded by several non-scripted programs such as Judge Judy. Circulations of soap opera magazines have decreased and some have even ceased publication. SOAPnet, which largely aired soap opera reruns, began to be phased out in 2012 and fully ceased operations the following year. The Daytime Emmy Awards, which honor soap operas and other daytime shows, moved from primetime network television to smaller cable channels in 2012, then failed to get any TV broadcast at all in 2014, 2016, and 2017.|$|E
25|$|Channel 8 {{had been}} the ratings leader among the {{television}} newscasts in the Dallas-Fort Worth market for much of its history, having overtaken WBAP-TV/KXAS in the position during the mid-1970s. WFAA's 10:00p.m. newscast, known as The News 8 Update from 1980 to 2012, has typically placed as the market's most-watched late evening newscast, and its 5:00 and 6:00p.m. newscasts are typically the area's most-watched early evening local newscasts. However, the station's <b>ratings</b> <b>have</b> suffered in recent years, particularly among adults {{between the ages of}} 25 and 54 due to competition from Fox owned-and-operated station KDFW as well as improving viewership since the late 2000s for CBS owned-and-operated station KTVT's newscasts; WFAA's 10:00p.m. newscast slid from first place for the November 2010 sweeps to a relatively distant second during the February 2011 sweeps period with total viewers and with adults 25-54 (its first fall from first place in that slot as well as at 6:00p.m. in total viewers {{for the first time in}} at least three decades). WFAA's only #1 finish during the latter period was at 5:00p.m. in total viewers (it lost to KDFW in the adult 25-54 demographic), aided by its Oprah lead-in. The station was in last place overall in among adults 25 to 54 for the first time in at least 30 years. During the May 2011 sweeps period, the 10:00p.m. news regained its position as the market's #1 late newscast in total viewers and adults 25-54; its morning newscast placed third in both demographics, while the 5:00 and 6:00p.m. newscasts placed first in the early evening slot (aided by the outgoing Oprah) in total viewers and second (behind KDFW) in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic.|$|E

500|$|In {{its initial}} {{broadcast}} in the United States, the episode was watched by an estimated 7.817 million viewers {{and earned a}} 3.0/8 rating for viewers 18–49. After time shifted viewing was taken into account, Fringe increased to a 3.95 rating for the 18–49 demographic. It earned a 4.7/8 ratings share among all households, which caused {{it to be the}} series' worst rated episode yet. It was also more than 25 percent lower than its average audience from the first season. These lower <b>ratings</b> <b>have</b> been attributed to a lower-rated lead-in (Bones, instead of the previous season's American Idol and House), and tough competition from CBS's [...] and NBC's The Office. The rest of the season's ratings would continue to stay lower than the previous season, leading many to question Fox's decision to move the show in the first place.|$|E
500|$|... "Amber 31422" [...] was {{watched by}} an {{estimated}} 4.97 million viewers in the United States.

Between Fringe and its lead-in show Bones, Fox finished in third place for the night. The Fringe episode's low <b>ratings</b> <b>have</b> been attributed by critics to the unexpected end to the 2010 World Series, which caused Fringe to air a week earlier than expected. Den of Geek columnist Billy Grifter attributed the low ratings to the parallel universe focus, commenting [...] "if you weren't a fan beforehand, you'll {{not be able to}} follow what's going on now. For those of us that did step onto the Fringe elevator early, it's a great ride, but I can see that it's a difficult proposition to attract new viewers."
