40|$|Radiofrequency {{switches}} {{are critical}} components in wireless communication systems and consumer electronics. Emerging devices include switches based on microelectromechanical systems and phase-change materials. However, these devices suffer from disadvantages such as large physical dimensions and high actuation voltages. Here we propose and demonstrate a nanoscale <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>switch</b> {{based on a}} memristive device. The device can be programmed with a voltage as low as 0. 4 [*]V and has an ON/OFF conductance ratio up to 1012 with long state retention. We measure the radiofrequency performance of the switch up to 110 [*]GHz and demonstrate low insertion loss (0. 3 [*]dB at 40 [*]GHz), high isolation (30 [*]dB at 40 [*]GHz), an average cutoff frequency of 35 [*]THz and competitive linearity and power-handling capability. Our results suggest that, {{in addition to their}} application in memory and computing, memristive devices are also a leading contender for <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>switch</b> applications...|$|E
40|$|A {{structurally}} supportive miniaturized low-weight (≤ 150 g) <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>switch</b> mode amplifier {{developed to}} power the small diameter Pocket Rocket electrothermal plasma micro-thruster called MiniPR is tested in vacuum conditions representative of space to demonstrate its suitability for use on nano-satellites such as “CubeSats. ” Argon plasma characterization is carried out by measuring the optical emission signal seen through the plenum window vs. frequency (12. 8 – 13. 8 MHz) and the plenum cavity pressure increase (indicative of thrust generation from volumetric gas heating in the plasma cavity) vs. power (1 – 15 Watts) with the amplifier operating at atmospheric pressure and a constant flow rate of 20 sccm. Vacuum testing is subsequently performed by measuring the operational frequency range of the amplifier {{as a function of}} gas flow rate. The switch mode amplifier design is finely tuned to the input impedance of the thruster (~ 16 pF) to provide a power efficiency of 88 % at the resonant frequency and a direct feed to a low-loss (~ 10 %) impedance matching network. This system provides successful plasma coupling at 1. 54 Watts for all investigated flow rates (10 – 130 sccm) for cryogenic pumping speeds of the order of 6, 000 l. s− 1 and a vacuum pressure of the order of ~ 2 × 10 − 5 Torr during operation. Interestingly, the frequency bandwidth for which a plasma can be coupled increases from 0. 04 to 0. 4 MHz when the gas flow rate is increased, probably as a result of changes in the plasma impedance...|$|E

40|$|The nulling of {{interferences}} or jammers impinging on a planar {{antenna array}} is addressed {{by means of}} an efficient adaptive control strategy based on a Genetic Algorithm. Each element of the array is uniformly weighted and the nulling feature is yielded by controlling a set of <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>switches</b> that connect or disconnect the elements from the beam forming network. Under the assumption that the direction of arrival of the desired signal is known, the on/off setup of the array elements is optimized to maximize the ratio between the power of the desired signal and the total power collected by the antenna array. Representative results concerned with different interfering scenarios with multiple undesired signals are reported to assess the effectiveness of the approach...|$|R
40|$|Background: MRI has {{developed}} {{into one of}} the most important medical diagnostic imaging modalities, but it exposes staff to static magnetic fields (SMF) when present in the vicinity of the MR system, and to <b>radiofrequency</b> and <b>switched</b> gradient electromagnetic fields if they are present during image acquisition. We measured exposure to SMF and motion-induced time-varying magnetic fields (TVMF) in MRI staff in clinical practice in the UK to enable extensive assessment of personal exposure levels and variability, which enables comparison to other countries. Methods: 8 MRI facilities across National Health Service sites in England, Wales and Scotland were included, and staff randomly selected during the days when measurements were performed were invited to wear a personal MRI-compatible dosimeter and keep a diary to record all procedures and tasks performed during the measured shift. Results: 98 participants, primarily radiographers (71...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{is shown}} that <b>radiofrequency</b> micro-electromechanical-system (RF-MEMS) <b>switches</b> are useful to {{implement}} electronically reconfigurable split ring resonators (SRRs). Three {{different combinations of}} cantilever-type ON/OFF capacitive switches with SRRs are studied {{for the design of}} tunable or switchable SRR-loaded metamaterial transmission lines. These structures are then applied to the design of reconfigurable band stop and band pass filters at the X-frequency band. Through electrostatic actuation of the switches, the resonance frequency of SRRs can be shifted and, as a result, filter bandwidth and/or central frequency can be digitally controlled. Good agreement between theory and experiment is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Zero echo time (ZTE) imaging with single-pulse {{excitation}} is a fast, robust, {{and silent}} three-dimensional (3 D) method for MRI of short T 2 tissues. In this technique, algebraic reconstruction serves to fill {{gaps in the}} center of k-space due to finite acquisition dead time. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of this operation on depiction characteristics, noise behavior, and achievable bandwidth. Methods: The spatial response function (SRF) and noise covariance resulting from ZTE reconstruction were studied using formal analysis, simulations, and phantom experiments. Results: Three prominent limiting phenomena were identified: SRF behavior within the field of view, heightened sensitivity to out-of-band signal sources, and noise amplification. The related errors all appear as image distortions of low spatial frequency and are strongly attenuated upon the transition from one-dimensional projections to 3 D image data. Relying on these observations, ZTE imaging was accomplished with a previously unreached gap size, permitting the depiction of a solid sample with T 2 ≈ 25 µs at a bandwidth of 500 kHz. Conclusion: The tightest bandwidth limits in ZTE arise from background signal and <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) <b>switching</b> transients. Significant advances in ZTE performance will be afforded by faster transmit-receive (T/R) switching with negligible transients and RF coils free of background signal...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the outcomes of multi-channel switching RFA using a separable cluster electrode in patients with HCC. From November 2011 to July 2013, 79 patients with 98 HCCs < 5 cm were enrolled and treated with RFA using a multi-channel <b>switching</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> system and a separable cluster electrode under the guidance of a real-time fusion imaging system. The primary and secondary endpoints were the 3 -year local tumor progression (LTP) rate and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate, respectively. For post hoc analyses, LTP, RFS, and major complication rates were retrospectively compared with a historical control group treated with RFA using the same radiofrequency system but with multiple internally-cooled electrodes. The technique success rate of the 98 tumors was 100 %. Cumulative 1 -year, 2 -year, and 3 -year LTP rates were 3. 4 %, 6. 9 %, and 12. 4 %, respectively. For patient-level data, cumulative 1 -year, 2 -year, and 3 -year RFS rates were 83. 9 %, 68. 6 %, and 45. 4 %, respectively. On post hoc analyses, none of the baseline characteristics showed {{a significant difference between the}} separable cluster electrode and multiple internally-cooled electrodes group. Cumulative LTP and RFS rates of the two groups also showed no significant difference (p = 0. 401 and p = 0. 881, respectively). Finally, major complication rates of the separable cluster electrode group (5. 0 %, 4 / 79) and multiple internally-cooled electrodes group (5. 9 %, 4 / 74) were also comparable (p = 1. 000). Switching monopolar RFA using a separable cluster electrode is a feasible and efficient technique for the treatment of HCCs smaller than 5 cm, providing comparable local tumor control to multiple internally-cooled electrodes.

40|$|Ultra-high-field MRI (7 Tesla (T) and above) elicits more {{temporary}} side-effects {{compared to}} 1. 5 T and 3 T, e. g. dizziness or "postural instability" even after exiting the scanner. The current study aims to assess quantitatively vestibular performance {{before and after}} exposure to different MRI scenarios at 7 T, 1. 5 T and 0 T. Sway path and body axis rotation (Unterberger's stepping test) were quantitatively recorded {{in a total of}} 46 volunteers before, 2 minutes after, and 15 minutes after different exposure scenarios: 7 T head MRI (n =  27), 7 T no RF (n =  22), 7 T only B 0 (n =  20), 7 T in & out B 0 (n =  20), 1. 5 T no RF (n =  20), 0 T (n =  15). All exposure scenarios lasted 30 minutes except for brief one minute exposure in 7 T in & out B 0. Both measures were documented utilizing a 3 D ultrasound system. During sway path evaluation, the experiment was repeated with eyes both open and closed. Sway paths for all long-lasting 7 T scenarios (normal, no RF, only B 0) with eyes closed were significantly prolonged 2 minutes after exiting the scanner, normalizing after 15 minutes. Brief exposure to 7 T B 0 or 30 minutes exposure to 1. 5 T or 0 T did not show significant changes. End positions after Unterberger's stepping test were significantly changed counter-clockwise after all 7 T scenarios, including the brief in & out B 0 exposure. Shorter exposure resulted in a smaller alteration angle. In contrast to sway path, reversal of changes in body axis rotation was incomplete after 15 minutes. 1. 5 T caused no rotational changes. The results show that exposure to the 7 Tesla static magnetic field causes only a temporary dysfunction or "over-compensation" of the vestibular system not measurable at 1. 5 or 0 Tesla. <b>Radiofrequency</b> fields, gradient <b>switching,</b> and orthostatic dysregulation do not seem to play a role...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In bimodal {{electric}} tissue ablation (BETA), the cathode of the DC circuit {{is attached}} to the radiofrequency (RF) electrode to increase the surrounding tissue hydration. This will delay tissue desiccation and allowing the ablation process to continue {{for a longer period of}} time before "roll-off" occurs, resulting in larger ablations compared with standard radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Previous research showed that attaching the anode to the skin using electrosurgical grounding pads would reduce the efficacy of BETA because of the high electrical resistivity of the skin. This study investigated the ablation size produced when the anode was attached to the peritoneum (BETA-peritoneum) and the liver (BETA-liver) respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anode of the DC circuit in BETA was attached to the peritoneum and the liver in a pig model using ECG dots. In BETA, 9 V of DC was provided for 10 min, after which the <b>radiofrequency</b> generator were <b>switched</b> on and both electrical circuits allowed to run concurrently until "roll-off. " The size of ablations produced was compared to when the anode attached to the skin (BETA-skin) and standard RFA, respectively. The sites of anode placement were examined for local tissue injury. RESULTS: The transverse diameters in BETA-peritoneum and BETA-liver were significantly larger compared with BETA-skin and standard RFA, respectively (P < 0. 001). The axial diameter in the BETA-peritoneum and BETA-liver groups were also larger compared with the BETA-skin and RFA groups, although the differences did not reach statistical significance (P = 0. 09). Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) examination of the peritoneum and the liver where the anode was attached showed coagulation necrosis involving the superficial epithelium and the liver capsule, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: BETA can be used to treat larger liver tumors more effectively and may reduce the tumor recurrence rates compared with standard RFA. The efficacy of BETA depends on ensuring good electrical conductivity between the cathode and the anode of the DC circuit. Research so far has shown that BETA works best when the anode is placed deep to the skin as the stratum corneum consisted of a layer of a-nucleated cells, which have high electrical resistivity. The liver could be the ideal location to place the anode as it has excellent electrical conductivity, therefore ensuring maximum tissue hydration around the cathode to produce the largest ablations possible.
