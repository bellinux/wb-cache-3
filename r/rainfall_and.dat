40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to establish relationships between <b>rainfall</b> extremes <b>and</b> damage data from Dutch insurance industry. Rainfall data are based on a network of 33 automatic rain gauges held by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. Rainfall characteristics, such as peak <b>rainfall</b> intensity <b>and</b> <b>rainfall</b> volume, are correlated with damage statistics of claims in the vicinity of the rain gauges. The results show that rainfallrelated damage mainly occurs during summer seasons. There is a weak relationship between property damage <b>and</b> <b>rainfall</b> intensities <b>and</b> between property damage <b>and</b> <b>rainfall</b> volumes for summer events. More data is needed to confirm these relationships. In a subsequent study this will be investigated by using weather radar data to obtain a higher spatial <b>rainfall</b> resolution <b>and</b> thus be able to include more insurance data.

Therefore, many researcher have tried to solve these weakness by consolidating the models of <b>rainfall</b> occurrence <b>and</b> <b>rainfall</b> amount simultaneously.

40|$|Considerable {{seasonal}} and inter-annual changes {{exist in}} <b>rainfall</b> amount <b>and</b> intensity in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. These changes {{are expected to}} have significant effect on <b>rainfall</b> erosivity <b>and</b> soil erosion by water, but the magnitude of the impact is not well quantified because of the non-linear and dynamic nature of the relationship between <b>rainfall</b> amount <b>and</b> <b>rainfall</b> erosivity. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} model spatial and temporal variations in <b>rainfall</b> erosivity <b>and</b> impacts on hillslope erosion across NSW. We developed a daily rainfall erosivity model for NSW to calculate monthly <b>and</b> annual <b>rainfall</b> erosivity values by using gridded daily rainfall data for a continuous 53 -year period including a baseline period (1961 – 90) and a recent period (2000 – 12). Model parameters were improved based on their geographic locations and elevations to be truly geo-referenced and representative of the regional relationships. Monthly and annual hillslope erosion risk for the same periods was estimated with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation. We produced finer scale (100 -m) maps of <b>rainfall</b> erosivity <b>and</b> hillslope erosion through spatial interpolation techniques, and implemented the calculation of <b>rainfall</b> erosivity <b>and</b> hillslope erosion in a geographic information system by using automated scripts so that it is fast, repeatable and portable. The modelled rainfall erosivity values were compared with pluviograph calculations and previous studies, and the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency is > 0. 90. Outcomes from this study provide not only baseline information but also continuous estimates of <b>rainfall</b> erosivity <b>and</b> hillslope erosions allowing better monitoring and mitigation of hillslope erosion risk in NSW.
