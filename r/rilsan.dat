5000|$|Nylon 11 or Polyamide 11 (PA 11) is a {{polyamide}} and bioplastic , {{a member}} of the nylon family of polymers. It is produced from castor beans by Arkema under the trade name <b>Rilsan.</b> [...] It is produced by polymerization of 11-aminoundecanoic acid.|$|E
50|$|It is {{made with}} welded steel with rods in {{polished}} or satin chrome, or bonded <b>rilsan,</b> a very durable adhesive-fused nylon-dipped finish. Scratch, chip, and chemical resistant. All wire seating includes glides. Cushions are secured to chair with lock-snaps. Full covers are stretched over the wire seat basket and attach to seat basket with hooks.|$|E
50|$|PA 11 is a {{biopolymer}} {{derived from}} natural oil. It {{is also known}} under the tradename <b>Rilsan</b> B, commercialized by Arkema. PA 11 belongs to the technical polymers family and is not biodegradable. Its properties {{are similar to those}} of PA 12, although emissions of greenhouse gases and consumption of nonrenewable resources are reduced during its production. Its thermal resistance is also superior to that of PA 12. It is used in high-performance applications like automotive fuel lines, pneumatic airbrake tubing, electrical cable antitermite sheathing, flexible oil and gas pipes, control fluid umbilicals, sports shoes, electronic device components, and catheters.|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} of the crystalline index (CI) of polymeric materials by X-ray diffraction (XRD) may be rendered difficult {{by the number of}} overlapping crystalline phases and amorphous halos that contribute to the diffraction pattern. <b>Rilsan</b> ® Polyamide- 11 (PA- 11), produced by Arkema Inc., is a semi-crystalline polymer with an eleven-carbon repeat unit belonging to the general class of Nylon polymers. This material presents the peculiarity of having a smectic phase along with three crystalline phases. Samples from melt-extruded <b>Rilsan</b> ® PA- 11 oil pipeline liners that had been subjected to various aging conditions were analyzed by XRD. From wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns their CI was calculated, which were compared to values obtained from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Severe overlaps among the crystalline, amorphous and smectic phases of <b>Rilsan</b> ® PA- 11 were observed, which were further convoluted by the amorphous phases of additives in the polymer matrix. Initial attempts to calculate CI reliably from XRD data were therefore unsuccessful. Subsequently, hot stage XRD was used to perform peak decomposition on three temperature patterns (90 ºC, 150 ºC, and 180 ºC). A linear evolution for smectic and amorphous peak positions was seen in this temperature range. Extrapolation of peak positions to room temperature conditions helped to refine the experimental patterns and greatly increased the accuracy of the crystalline index calculation by XRD, which is seen by comparison with DSC data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Ankle–foot {{orthosis}} (AFO) designs vary in size, shape, {{and functional}} characteristics {{depending on the}} desired clinical application. Passive Dynamic (PD) Response ankle–foot orthoses (PD-AFOs) constitute a design that seeks to improve walking ability for persons with various neuromuscular disorders by passively (like a spring) providing variable levels of support during the stance phase of gait. Current PD-AFO manufacturing technology is either labor intensive or not well suited for the detailed refinement of PD-AFO bending stiffness characteristics. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to explore the feasibility of using a rapid freeform prototyping technique, selective laser sintering (SLS), as a PD-AFO manufacturing process. Feasibility was determined by replicating the shape and functional charac-teristics of a carbon fiber AFO (CF-AFO). The study showed that a SLS-based framework is ideally suited for this application. A second objective was to determine the optimal SLS material for PD-AFOs to store and release elastic energy; considering mini-mizing energy dissipation through internal friction is a desired material characteristic. This study compared the mechanical damping of the CF-AFO to PD-AFOs manufactured by SLS using three different materials. Mechanical damping evaluation ranked the materials as <b>Rilsan</b> ™ D 80 (best), followed by DuraForm ™ PA and DuraForm ™ GF. In addition, <b>Rilsan</b> ™ D 80 was the only SLS material able to withstand large deformations. Index Terms—Design automation, freeform fabrication, or-thotics. I...|$|E
40|$|Known since antiquity, Castor Oil {{has been}} first used in medicine. Now, {{even if it}} remains present in small {{quantities}} as an excipient in many pharmaceutical specialties, it finds a lot of applicationsin cosmetics, industrial applications and chemical industry. Castor Oil specificity comes from its high content of ricinoleic acid (up to 85 %) that combines a double bond and an hydroxyl function {{in the heart of}} a 18 carbons linear chain. This particular structure is the key of an unique chemistry developed by ARKEMA that gives by thermal cracking a wide range of compounds with either 7 or 11 carbon atoms. A whole range of innovative chemistries and end use products are generated from these base reaction products. They are used in every-day life, to improve our comfort and safety but also in very specific applications with very high technical requirements. Synthesized from undecylenic acid, 11 -amino-undecanoic acid, 100 % based on renewable resources, is the precursor to biobased polymers combining high performance and sustainability: Rilsan®, <b>Rilsan</b> Fine Powder®, Pebax Rnew®...|$|E
40|$|The {{blending}} of polymers {{is a relatively}} inexpensive method of manipulating their properties and is common practice in the industry. Phosphate glass/polymer hybrids are an emerging class of nanomaterial with peculiar characteristics derived from nano-micro interactions of their components. Inorganic phosphate glasses {{are made up of}} chain-like molecules and are similar to polymer chains in their structure. These glasses are also unique in exhibiting similar processing temperatures to polymers, which opens up the possibility of co-processing and of greatly extending the range of obtainable properties. Both components being fluid during processing allow controlling and tailoring hybrid morphologies, and avoiding the problem of the intractable viscosity inherent from a high solid filler concentration. This work investigates the {{blending of}} an organic semi-crystalline polymer, polyamide 11 (PA 11), with different compositions of phosphate glasses. Experimental and theoretical studies of miscibility and phase behaviour of these unusual blends were analysed. In particular the research investigated the effect of glass composition on the rheological and thermo-chemical properties and nano/microstructure of these new materials, focusing on the tin fluoride (SnF 2) content in the glasses. The Flory Huggins equilibrium depression point model was employed to correlate and predict miscibility behaviour in these new systems. The experimental results showed that a high amount of SnF 2 could act as a proper compatibilizer for the novel <b>Rilsan</b> ® PA 11 matrix. Experiments showed that the halogen content lowered the glass transition temperature (Tg) and softening point (Ts) of the glasses, allowing both phases being fluid during melt-blending. However the water stability of the glasses was improved with increasing SnF 2 content in the network. The particle size of glass in the hybrids was inversely correlated with SnF 2 in the glass composition. This phenomenon resulted in lowering the equilibrium melting point (Tm 0) in the hybrids. The load force (F) generated during the extrusion process and the hybrid viscosities decreased, without compromising chemical and thermal stability of the materials. The Tg of PA 11, measured as shifts of the major peak in dissipation factor against temperature plot, was inversely correlated with SnF 2 content in the v glass composition, phenomenon often attributed to the partial miscibility of components in a system. The stiffness of the hybrid was improved by higher amount of SnF 2 in the glass compositions with polyamide reinforced by the glass having the lowest Tg (60 SnF 2 mol...|$|E
