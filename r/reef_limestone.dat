50|$|The {{area around}} the lakes {{contains}} an unusual amount of <b>reef</b> <b>limestone.</b> This limestone was originally imbedded in sedimentary limestone, but the latter was shaved off during the latest Ice age when the inland ice sheet moved, leaving high hills of <b>reef</b> <b>limestone.</b> Along {{the south side of}} the lakes is a layer of limestone which exceptionally rich in fossils. Most of the cliffs formed from <b>reef</b> <b>limestone</b> have a steep, sometimes vertical, side facing north. In these cliffs (Gutnish: klintar) are small caves, the largest of which can be found at Rammträsk and Broträsk.|$|E

40|$|Phosphorites with P 2 O 5 {{contents}} up to 33 % {{have been}} recovered from the eastern Atlantic between 6 °N and 9 °N. Formed from the replacement of shallow-water <b>reef</b> <b>limestones</b> of Middle Eocene age, the deposits are exposed on the crests of three subsided seamounts, Lighthill, Hirondelle and Carter, at depths of 794 - 1246, 1161 - 1176 and 552 - 1158 m, respectively. Phosphates exposed on the sea floor are associated {{with high levels of}} acoustic backscatter recorded using a ship's echo-sounder and a 10 -kHz pinger towed ? 30 m above the bottom. Seabed scintillometer measurements on Carter Seamount near 9 °N, 21 °W revealed high x-ray emission where phosphorites are known to crop out from photography and sampling. Uranium contents of the deposits lie in the range 9 - 46 ppm, values which are lower than those found in continental margin phosphates, but similar to concentrations in Pacific seamount phosphorites. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios indicate that phosphatisation of the Middle Eocene <b>reef</b> <b>limestones</b> occurred in the Early-Middle Miocene (~ 16 - 23 Ma) on Carter and Hirondelle Seamounts and in the Late Miocene (~ 6 Ma) on Lighthill Seamount. Upwelling near the palaeo-equator probably played a vital role in diagenesis by promoting high biological productivity and a large flux of phosphorus to pore waters in the seamount limestones. Phosphorites are probably widespread on other sediment-capped seamounts and fracture-zone ridges in the Equatorial Atlantic...|$|R

50|$|The {{limestone}} {{rock that}} forms the geology of Dovedale is the fossilised remains of sea creatures that lived in a shallow sea over the area during the Carboniferous period, about 350 million years ago.

40|$|Extremely {{complicated}} {{evolution of}} the western margin of the Brno batholith resulted in a poor preservation of the Devonian and Lower Carboniferous in several fragments of a different stratigraphic range and deformational degree. The research of geological development has shown that sedimentological interpretations of such tectonically disturbed carbonate sequence require a multidisciplinary approach. After describing the most important transformations of limestone microfabric during the low-temperature ductile deformation, new data on biostratigraphy and facies of these relics of sedimentary successions are presented. The outcrop data are supplemented with facies and biostratigraphic information on eroded levels of carbonates that come from the limestone pebbles in the adjacent Permian alluvial fans of the Rokytná Member conglomerate. Three stratigraphic horizons are present, distinctly separated from one another by two gaps without any lithological content: 1. Eifelian to lowermost Givetian <b>reef</b> <b>limestones,</b> which can be paralleled to the Čelechovice Cycle of the Moravian Karst Development. 2 a. A thick succession of Middle Givetian to Lower Frasnian <b>reef</b> <b>limestones</b> with the development analogous to the Macocha Formation of the Moravian Karst. 2 b. Calciturbidites overlying succession 2 a in the Chudčice-Hůrka-Dálky area, in which Lower Frasnian conodont assemblages were identified. 3. Uppermost Famennian to Middle Viséan complex of limestones facially close to the Konice Palaeozoic or to the southern Moravian Karst limestones. In spite of the good correspondence of the limestones in horizons 1 and 2 a with the Moravian Karst Development, the Lower Frasnian calciturbidites (horizon 2 b) have not been reported from other typical exposures of the Macocha Formation in Moravia yet; their relation to Moravian Karst Development is thus not clear...|$|R
