50|$|The {{relational}} view {{argues that}} one must be {{in a relationship with}} God in order to possess the 'image' of God. Those who hold to the <b>relational</b> <b>image</b> agree that humankind possess the ability to reason as a substantive trait, but they argue that it is in a relationship with God that the true image is made evident. Later theologians like Karl Barth and Emil Brunner argue that it is our ability to establish and maintain complex and intricate relationships that make us like God. For example, in humans the created order of male and female is intended to culminate in spiritual as well as physical unions , reflecting the nature and image of God. Since other creatures do not form such explicitly referential spiritual relationships, these theologians see this ability as uniquely representing the imago dei in humans.|$|E

40|$|Relations {{appear in}} many fields of {{mathematics}} and computer science. In classical mathematics these relations are usually crisp, i. e. two objects are related or they are not. However, many relations in real-world applications are intrinsically fuzzy, i. e. objects {{can be related to}} each other to a certain degree. With each fuzzy relation, different kinds of fuzzy <b>relational</b> <b>images</b> can be associated, all with a very practical interpretation {{in a wide range of}} application areas. In this paper we will explicite the formal link between well known direct and inverse images of fuzzy sets under fuzzy relations on one hand, and different kinds of compositions of fuzzy relations on the other. Continuing from this point of view we are also able to define a new scale of so-called double images. The wide applicability in mathematics and computer science of all these fuzzy <b>relational</b> <b>images</b> is illustrated with several examples...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{symbolic}} model checking technique, which analyzes temporal properties in multityped transition systems. Specifically, the method uses multiple type-specific data encodings to represent system states, and it carries out fixpoint computations via the corresponding type-specific symbolic operations.

Any type-specific language can {{be included in}} this framework [...] provided that the language is closed under Boolean connectives, propositions can be checked for satisfiability, and <b>relational</b> <b>images</b> can be computed. Our technique relies on conjunctive partitioning of transition relations of atomic events based on variable types involved, which allows independent computation of one-step pre- and post-conditions for each variable type.

It explores the experience {{of women in the}} South African context making the Spiritual Exercises of St Ignatius as a Nineteenth Annotation Retreat. The results of the study show that shifts in image of self and image of God are facilitated by the imaginal and dialogical/relational processes in the Spiritual Exercises. A qualitative, hermeneutical approach was taken in which nineteen women were interviewed about their experience of making the Spiritual Exercises. Fifteen of these were interviewed after completing the Spiritual Exercises while four were interviewed during the process. Shifts towards more positive self and God-representations were reported by {{all but one of the}} women interviewed. Images of God shifted from distant or ambivalent to positive <b>relational</b> <b>images.</b> Images of self also shifted in concert with shifts in image of self, with the women coming to see themselves as intrinsically valuable and unconditionally loved by God. A marked lessening in defensive processes was also noted. A constructive interpretation of the themes which emerged from an analysis of the data was done from both psychological perspective and spiritual-theological perspectives. From a psychological perspective Object-Relations theory and Dialogical Self theory were used to better understand the mechanisms enabling shifts in God and self-representation. From a spiritual theological perspective, Rahner’s (1960, 1964) relational theology of grace shed light on the spiritual processes in the Spiritual Exercises which facilitate shifts in image of God and self. Imaginal dialogical or relational aspects of the Exercises were found to play an important role in facilitating shifts in both image of self and image of God. The findings of this study provide compelling evidence for the interplay between psychological and spiritual processes in the Spiritual Exercises in particular, and spiritual experience in general, resonating with the work of Meissner (1987, 2003) and Ulanov (2001). It also resonates with Rahner’s (1960, 1964) theology of grace as God’s self-communication which parallels the move in psychology towards the relational which is strongly evident in both object-relations theory and the more recent Dialogical Self psychology...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA finite image I is a {{function}} assigning colors to a finite, rectangular array of discrete pixels. Thus, the information directly encoded by I is purely locational. Such locational information is of little visual use in itself: perception of visual structure requires extraction of <b>relational</b> <b>image</b> information.

A dipole is a triple, ((dx,dy),α,β), with dx and dy horizontal and vertical, integer-valued displacements, and α and β colors. For any such dipole, DI((dx,dy),α,β) gives the number of pixel pairs ((x 1,y 1), (x 2,y 2)) of I such that I[x 1,y 1]=α, I[x 2,y 2]=β, and, (x 2,y 2) −(x 1,y 1) =(dx,dy). Note that DI explicitly encodes no locational information. Although DI is uniquely determined by (and easily constructed from) I, it is not obvious that I is uniquely determined by DI. Here we prove that any finite image I is uniquely determined by its dipole histogram, DI. Two proofs are given; both are constructive, i. e. provide algorithms for reconstructing I from DI.

40|$|What defines an {{emergent}} {{quantum mechanics}} (EmQM) ? Can new insight be advanced {{into the nature}} of quantum nonlocality by seeking new links between quantum and emergent phenomena as described by self-organization, complexity, or emergence theory? Could the development of a future EmQM lead to a unified, <b>relational</b> <b>image</b> of the cosmos? One key motivation for adopting the concept of emergence in relation to quantum theory concerns the persistent failure in standard physics to unify the two pillars in the foundations of physics: quantum theory and general relativity theory (GRT). The total contradiction in the foundational, metaphysical assumptions that define orthodox quantum theory versus GRT might render inter-theoretic unification impossible. On the one hand, indeterminism and non-causality define orthodox quantum mechanics, and, on the other hand, GRT is governed by causality and determinism. How could these two metaphysically-contradictory theories ever be reconciled? The present work argues that metaphysical contradiction necessarily implies physical contradiction. The contradictions are essentially responsible also for the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. A common foundation may be needed for overcoming the contradictions between the two foundational theories. The concept of emergence, and the development of an EmQM, might help advance a common foundation - physical and metaphysical - as required for successful inter-theory unification.

This research examines {{the extent to which the}} meaning of photographic content can operate on multiple levels by questioning how we perceive, encounter and reflect upon the world around us through an examination of the historical, social, political and aesthetic operations of photographic images. The photographic series Trees near Amiens, Trees near Fricourt, and Barrière de la Villette by Debra Phillips address the material, technological, ontological and epistemological parameters of the photographic medium and the extent to which these parameters can be communicated through the presentation of different photographic subjects that have been individually framed and installed across a gallery wall as a suite.

40|$|This work aims to {{parameterize}} {{the urban}} structure types (UST) in Santiago de Chile on statistical block level. In connotation of remote sensing UST {{are defined as}} land-use structure entities. Central input data for this object-oriented approach is spatially very high resolution panfused and atmospherically corrected Quickbird data. To analyse and assess the structural properties of urban land- cover objects within block level entities, basic and robust land-cover class descriptions are developed. For enhanced class descriptions several image object scales are created. Based on defined UST and additional field data a set of test areas is selected for four municipalities assigned to different socio-spatial clusters in Santiago de Chile. In all test areas {{the distribution of the}} basic land- cover classes is parameterized using complex sub-object and <b>relational</b> <b>image</b> object descriptions.

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} the {{subjective}} experiences of mature aged women who misuse alcohol. Specifically the goals are to {{gain an understanding of}} how the women viewed themselves, how they experienced and made sense of their alcohol use, their experiences of seeking help for their alcohol misuse, motivation to quit or reduce their drinking and possible barriers to seeking and receiving help. An overarching goal is to gain greater insight into the factors that make mature aged women vulnerable to substance misuse and how detection and treatment may be facilitated for such women. The sample used in this study consisted of nineteen middle-class {{women between the ages of}} forty and sixty. All of the participants were volunteers who self-identified as problem drinkers. The women were interviewed using a semi-structured format. The data was analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. A number of findings emerged from this study. First, due to negative <b>relational</b> <b>images</b> that were possibly formed in childhood, the participants brought a sense of worthlessness and powerlessness, as well as mistrust of others and a fear of vulnerability, into their current relationships. This creates disconnection in family relationships, which can make women vulnerable to alcohol misuse. This progression of disconnection leads towards increasing isolation. Next, as a result of such isolation, it appears as though the women who participated in this study felt a deep sense of alienation from both the self and from others, which manifested through intense feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and worthlessness. Such feelings are strongly linked to the use of avoidant coping mechanisms. The participants in this study seemed to use alcohol as their primary coping strategy. However, it seems that using alcohol in order to cope created more problems than it actually solved; it could be liked to solving a problem with a problem. As women avoided coping with their problems they seemed to lose the capacity to cope and as a result their lives became unmanageable to a point where they could not longer deny their difficulties. With regards to seeking and receiving help for alcohol misuse, it appears that the stereotypes associated with female alcohol misuse pose the biggest barrier to seeking treatment. Because these stereotypes are at odds with the real experiences of the women who participate in this study, they were less likely to identify their alcohol misuse as a serious issue until their lives had become completely unmanageable. The stereotypes also tend to lead to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis of the problem by health professionals. Finally since such stereotypes also create stigma around female alcohol misuse, there was a significant amount of guilt and shame associated with the participants’ drinking, which created a tendency for the participants to hide their drinking, which means it took longer for women to seek out help. With regard to treatment for alcohol misuse it appears that the most effective forms of treatment are those that focus on self-awareness, that promote growth-fostering connection, and that provide a safe and empowering environment, in which women are able {{to explore the}}ir emotional experience and to reach out for help. In order to recover, women must move from a place of isolation and pain to one of mutuality and relational resilience...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to explore}} the connection between love and personal knowledge and what Jesus 2 ̆ 7 life and teaching reveal {{about the relationship between}} these. I want to distinguish that form of love or caring that makes relationships personal from those forms, like benevolence or compassion, where the concern is impersonal. It is commonly thought in contemporary Western culture that the autonomy necessary for mature moral agency or for the realization of one 2 ̆ 7 s unique personal identity is diminished by the influence of other persons. In contrast, I argue that the <b>relational</b> <b>image</b> of love, or agape, in the New Testament presents a conception of personal identity in which autonomy is found in and through intimate, personal relationships with God and others. Our identity is ultimately personal, that is, we are not fully who we are apart from being in relationships with others that are personal. A fresh examination of the New Testament image of love reveals a portrait of the self as one in which the capacities essential for personhood such as autonomy are not diminished through identification with God but instead are most fully realized. I argue that this identification involves a personal form of caring, one that is distinctly intimate, that when mutual constitutes a personal form of knowing. This personal knowledge is constituted by a particular pattern of engagement between persons and is more than the intellectual apprehension of propositions that are true about another person. I argue that directly engaging the New Testament {{as a part of a}} philosophical project is justified, in part, because adequately describing the moral character of this love requires a narrative. Only a story or exemplar can image in depth the volitional, desiderative, and emotional qualities of this love as well as its relational character. Moreover, I argue that joy is an essential emotional and desiderative component of this love and is necessary for intimate, personal knowing. I argue that this kind of personal knowing is capable of addressing the existential problem of meaning. On this account the human hunger for meaning, or significance, is one that finds its satisfaction not in theoretical or explanatory knowledge but in intimate, personal engagement with God and, through God, with others...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of richly indexed <b>relational</b> <b>image</b> databases provides {{a system for}} organising material, and a tool for correlating and interrogating image collections and accumulated contextual information. Many galleries, libraries and museums build digital resources to preserve, manage and give wider access to image collections. While {{much has been written}} about the technical and procedural aspects of such projects, the impact of these systems in aiding the {{development of}} research, teaching and scholarship is seldom considered. Digital resources are not just procedural artefacts ? they are not mere technological products. They are cognitive artefacts and the relationship between the way they are constructed and how they are used and understood is implicit. The structural principals of relationship, of one to one, one to many and many to many, are the basis of relational data models. The potential complexity of relationships, and layers of relationships, between bodies of information within a database system presents the possibility of mapping and exploring areas of knowledge, rather than merely collecting and presenting information. Contemporary historians have questioned single readings, or the construction of a grand narrative in writing about the past. The digital medium tends to reinforce multiple points of view, and the consideration of an object within a complex contextual framework. Within this paper these issues are considered in relation to the development of the New Zealand Design Archive, which is a virtual collection presenting the history of design in everyday life. Within New Zealand the lack of recognition and access to local design material has tended to reinforce approaches to the teaching of design that stress modernist canons of 'good design' and to ignore the value, particularity and influence of local histories and contexts. Addressing this historic oversight regarding local material is allowing the NZDA to build a more flexible and relevant model that might be of interest to other design historians and digital archivists. On one level the NZDA digital archiving projects might be seen as practical solutions to making ephemeral and dispersed material available for study in facsimile version via digital media. However, the information presented in virtual archives goes beyond mere reproduction, as the process of rich indexing and image analysis presents the viewer with different information than they would get from looking at the original in a museum or gallery display or even from a book. The methodology of indexing encourages students to engage in a deep and rigorous analysis of the designed object and its material and social context. My own interest in these issues is not whether actual is better than virtual or vice versa, but in the ways information is presented, interpreted and structured through digital media, and how these processes can lead to different interpretations and understanding of design, its history and the material culture of everyday life.

40|$|A model-based {{handwritten}} Chinese {{character recognition}} (HCCR) system is proposed. The characters {{are represented by}} attributed relational graphs (ARG) using strokes as ARG vertices. A number of vector relational attributes are also used in the representation to improve {{the performance of the}} translation and scale invariant and rotation sensitive recognition system. Since the ETL- 8 database is very noisy and broken strokes are commonly encountered, a suitable homomorphic energy function is proposed that allows the segments of a broken stroke of a test character to be matched to the corresponding model stroke. The homomorphic ARG matching energy is minimised using the self-organising Hopfield neural networks [1] [Suganthan, P. N., Teoh, E. K., Mital D. P., A self-organising Hopfield network for attributed <b>relational</b> graph matching, <b>Image</b> and Vision Computing, 13 (1) (1995) 61 - 73]. An effective formulation is introduced to determine the matching score. The formulation does not penalise the matching scores of test characters with broken strokes. Experiments were performed with 100 classes of characters in the ETL- 8 database and 98. 9 % recognition accuracy has been achieved...|$|R
40|$|Most {{commonly}} used face recognition algorithms {{are based on}} extraction of global features using eigenvalue decomposition of some <b>relational</b> matrix of <b>image</b> intensity values. Real time face recognition applications require a computationally efficient algorithm for eigenvalues generation. Fast principal component analysis (FPCA) is an algorithm for efficient generation of eigenvalues which improves the computational efficiency to O(n 2) as compared to normal decomposition method which gives the solution in O(n 3) time. In FPCA however, non-convergence state can be resulted for high resolution images because {{in this case the}} number of Grams-Schmidt (GS) iterations for orthonormalization convergence may exceed the maximum limit. To overcome this problem we present a modified FPCA algorithm to generate eigenvalues for images including those at high resolution. An overall efficient face recognition scheme has also been proposed using the generated eigenvalues, which can work satisfactorily under varying image resolutions. The validity of the proposed system has been checked by varying the feature vectors and the training sets. The developed technique provides an efficient and a low error rate solution for high speed image recognition systems...|$|R
40|$|As {{information}} hiding, {{the digital}} watermark techniques have been attracting more interests in both research and industrial fields. Relational database {{is widely used}} in many information systems, {{as a tool for}} storing and managing a data. Major issue to protect the copyright of relational data. In order to make watermarking information more intuitive and easier to identify and to give authorization to the database this idea has been proposed. Ownership verification of a database by inserting an imperceptive watermark in such a way to provide robustness and security against attempts to remove the watermark. To prove ownership of the database watermarking is done using image. Image is converted into the row bits and row bits is encrypted using MD 5 security algorithm. This row bits will be embed into the database attribute in terms of watermark. To check the performance of this scheme will be tested based on different types of attacks on the database which shows the robustness of this scheme.

40|$|Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) {{departments}} in many organizations {{are faced with}} two interrelated problems which limit their ability to make accurate decisions based on quality data. First, many EHS departments follow a reactive business management model and need to work towards a proactive continuous improvement model to better manage EHS. The second {{is a lack of}} data integration and interoperability between the numerous different EHS data sources and systems. EHS departments are challenged with managing large quantities of data generated through tracking and monitoring programs to continuously improve EHS performance. EHS data can be in many forms paper, digital files, spreadsheets, <b>images,</b> <b>relational</b> databases and proprietary software applications. EHS data have strong spatial relationships, which makes the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) a very cost effective and feasible solution for integrating and managing EHS data. This thesis will outline how GIS brings to EHS the advantages of traditional IT methods with the added benefit of spatial analytical operations such as map overlay, relationships and querying, and informative visual presentation through maps, floor plans, and imagery through the implementation of a GIS database for EHS called GeoSpatial Environmental Health and Safety (GEO-EHS) ...|$|R
