50|$|ATR is a serine/threonine-specific {{protein kinase}} that is {{involved}} in sensing DNA damage and activating the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest. ATR is activated in response to persistent single-stranded DNA, which is a common intermediate formed during DNA damage detection and repair. Single-stranded DNA occurs at stalled replication forks and as an intermediate in DNA repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair and homologous <b>recombination</b> <b>repair.</b> ATR works with a partner protein called ATRIP to recognize single-stranded DNA coated with RPA. Once ATR is activated, it phosphorylates Chk1, initiating a signal transduction cascade that culminates in cell cycle arrest. In addition to its role in activating the DNA damage checkpoint, ATR is thought to function in unperturbed DNA replication.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{well-known}} of these 'synthetic lethality' drugs is the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor olaparib, which {{was approved by the}} Food and Drug Administration in 2015 for the treatment in women of BRCA-defective ovarian cancer. Tumor cells with partial loss of DNA damage response (specifically, homologous <b>recombination</b> <b>repair)</b> are dependent on another mechanism - single-strand break repair - which is a mechanism consisting, in part, of the PARP1 gene product. Olaparib is combined with chemotherapeutics to inhibit single-strand break repair induced by DNA damage caused by the co-administered chemotherapy. Tumor cells relying on this residual DNA repair mechanism are unable to repair the damage and hence are not able to survive and proliferate, whereas normal cells can repair the damage with the functioning homologous recombination mechanism.|$|E

As well as mutations to DNA damage repair genes, mutations also {{arise in the}} genes responsible for arresting the cell cycle to allow sufficient time for DNA repair to occur, and some genes are involved in both DNA damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint control, for example ATM and checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) - a tumor suppressor that is often absent or downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer.|$|E

The lower frequencies of mutation in germ cells compared to somatic cells appears to be due to more efficient removal of DNA damages by repair processes including homologous <b>recombination</b> <b>repair</b> during meiosis.
