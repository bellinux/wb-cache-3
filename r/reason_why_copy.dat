This section of the questionnaire was formulated from the studies of Mintzberg (1973; 1975) on the evaluation of works and scales devised {{to collect data on}} the ten managerial roles, from Anderson et al. (2002) and Pearson and Chatterjee (2003). The questionnaire used by Anderson et al. (2002) was available in the article they published, whereas the questionnaire used by Pearson and Chatterjee (2003) was not available in their article – the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> a <b>copy</b> was requested via email, which was received in early March 2009.|$|R

40|$|Plagiarism and {{inadequate}} citing {{appear to have}} reached epidemic proportions in research publication. This article discusses how plagiarism is defined and suggests some possible causes for {{the increase in the}} plagiarism disease. Most editors do not have much tolerance for text re-use with inadequate citation regardless of <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> words are <b>copied</b> from other sources without correct attribution. However, there is now some awareness that re-use of words in research articles to improve the writing or "the English" (which has become a common practice) should be distinguished from intentional deceit for the purpose of stealing other authors′ ideas (which appears to remain a very rare practice). Although it has become almost as easy for editors to detect duplicate text as it is for authors to re-use text from other sources, editors often fail to consider the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> researchers resort to this strategy, and tend to consider any text duplication as a symptom of serious misconduct. As a result, some authors may be stigmatized unfairly by being labeled as plagiarists. The article concludes with practical advice for researchers on how to improve their writing and citing skills and thus avoid accusations of plagiarism...|$|R
5000|$|Contrary to {{some early}} biographical accounts, Garcia de Orta married a wealthy cousin, Brianda de Solis, in 1543; the {{marriage}} was unhappy, but the couple had two daughters. In 1549 his mother {{and two of his}} sisters, who had been imprisoned as Jews in Lisbon, managed to join him in Goa. According to a confession by his brother-in-law after his death, Garcia de Orta privately continued to assert that [...] "the Law of Moses was the true law"; in other words, he, probably in common with others in his family, remained a Jewish believer. In 1565 an inquisitorial court was opened in Goa. Active persecution against Jews, secret Jews, Hindus and New Christians began. Garcia himself died in 1568, apparently without having suffered seriously from this persecution, but his sister Catarina was arrested as a Jew in the same year and was burned at the stake for Judaism in Goa on October 25, 1569. Garcia himself was posthumously convicted of Judaism. His remains were exhumed and burned along with an effigy in an auto da fé on December 4, 1580. They were among 342 New Christians accused of crypto-Judaism of whom 68 were executed between 1561 and 1623. His books were most likely burnt as well, possibly a <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> no <b>copy</b> of his book exists in Goa. The fate of his daughters is not known. During his lifetime, Orta had been protected from the Goa Inquisition by his friend and patron, Martim Afonso de Sousa, Governor-General of Portuguese India from 1542 to 1545.|$|R
5000|$|At {{least five}} {{editions of the}} songbook are known: folio‘s from two {{probably}} older editions survived as reinforcement of the cover of other books while {{the structure of the}} preserved copy implicates that two earlier editions have existed. Thus, only one edition is preserved in one copy only, collected by Duke August von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel and conserved in the Herzog August Bibliothek (the library also known as Bibliotheca Augusta) in Wolfenbüttel. The <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> only one <b>copy</b> survived must be that two years after publication this songbook was put on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, the index of forbidden literature of the Catholic Church’s infamous Inquisition. The printer died later on in prison, where he was held because of having printed clandestine literature. Not that much the political songs, in favour of the House of Habsburg, but rather the songs about depraved and licentious monks and nuns might have disturbed the Inquisition. Probably, the few copies left in the Netherlands after the songbook was put on the index, were destroyed by French librarians eager to make disappear every trace of Flemish culture in the Southern Netherlands.|$|R

40|$|Background: L 1 retrotransposable {{elements}} are potent insertional mutagens {{responsible for the}} generation of genomic variation and diversification of mammalian genomes, but reliable estimates of the numbers of actively transposing L 1 {{elements are}} mostly nonexistent. While the human and mouse genomes contain comparable numbers of L 1 elements, several phylogenetic and L 1 Xplore analyses in the mouse genome suggest that 1, 500 – 3, 000 active L 1 elements currently exist {{and that they are}} still expanding in the genome. Conversely, the human genome contains only 150 active L 1 elements. In addition, there is a discrepancy among the nature and number of mouse L 1 elements in L 1 Xplore and the mouse genome browser at the UCSC and in the literature. To date, the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> a high <b>copy</b> number of active L 1 elements exist in the mouse genome but not in the human genome is unknown, as are the potential mechanisms that are responsible for transcriptional activation of mouse L 1 elements. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed the promoter sequences of the 1, 501 potentially active mouse L 1 elements retrieved from the GenBank and L 1 Xplore databases and evaluated their transcription factors binding sites and CpG content. To this end, we found that a substantial number of mouse L 1 elements contain altered transcription factor YY 1 binding sites on their promoter sequences that are required for transcriptional initiation, suggesting that only a half of L 1 elements are capable of being transcriptionally active. Furthermore, we present experimental evidenc...|$|R
