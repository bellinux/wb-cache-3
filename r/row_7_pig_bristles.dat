25|$|The {{relatively}} short, stiff, {{coarse hairs}} of the <b>pig</b> are called <b>bristles,</b> and were once so {{commonly used in}} paintbrushes that in 1946 the Australian Government launched Operation <b>Pig</b> <b>Bristle.</b> In May 1946, {{in response to a}} shortage of <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> for paintbrushes to paint houses in the post-World War II construction boom, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flew in 28 short tons of <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> from China, their only commercially available source at the time.|$|R
500|$|Some of the <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> were {{rushed to}} Australia on board No. 38 Squadron aircraft, and the {{remainder}} were transported from Hong Kong by sea. On 29 May {{it was reported that}} the shortage of <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> had been overcome. One of the pilots involved in Operation <b>Pig</b> <b>Bristle</b> received the Air Force Cross in the 1948 New Years Honours in recognition of his role in the operation. RAAF official historian Alan Stephens wrote in 1995 that [...] "John Balfe's brief but thrilling account of his team's exotic adventure should be mandatory reading in every RAAF air transport crew room".|$|R

5|$|Operation <b>Pig</b> <b>Bristle</b> was {{an unusual}} {{transport}} task conducted by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in May 1946. The operation was ordered by the Australian Government {{in response to a}} national shortage of paint brushes, which was hindering house-building efforts. No. 38 Squadron of the RAAF was given the task of transporting 25 tonnes of <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> from Chongqing in China to Hong Kong, from where the bristles were shipped to Australia. The squadron completed this task over a two-week period.|$|R
50|$|The Aetas {{generally}} use ornaments {{typical of}} people living in subsistence economies. Flowers and leaves are used as earplugs for certain occasions. Girdles, necklaces, and neckbands of braided rattan incorporated with wild <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> are frequently worn.|$|R
5|$|Following World War II, the Australian Commonwealth {{and state}} governments {{launched}} a joint Commonwealth Housing Scheme to address a national shortage of accommodation. This scheme, and private sector house-building activities, was delayed by a shortage of materials, including <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> needed to manufacture paint brushes.|$|R
25|$|Commonly, {{toothbrushes}} {{are made}} of plastic. Such brushes constitute a source of pollution. In {{order to reduce the}} environmental impact, some manufacturers have switched to using biodegradable materials and/or use replaceable heads. In order to avoid plastic altogether alternative toothbrushes on offer consist of wooden handles (often bamboo) and bristles of bamboo viscose or <b>pig</b> <b>bristles.</b>|$|R
50|$|A typical toilet brush {{consists}} of a hard bristled end, usually with a rounded shape and a long handle. Today toilet brushes are commonly made of plastic, but were originally made of wood with <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> or from the hair of horses, oxen, squirrels and badgers. The brush is typically stored in a holder, {{but in some cases}} completely hidden in a tube.|$|R
50|$|Quality dartboards {{are made}} of sisal fibres; less {{expensive}} boards are sometimes made of cork or coiled paper. However, several types of sisal fibre are used in dartboards today, originating from East Africa, Brazil, or China. Despite widespread belief that some dartboards are constructed using <b>pig</b> <b>bristles,</b> camel hair, or horse hair, {{there is no evidence}} that boards have ever been produced commercially from these materials.|$|R
500|$|At the time, {{the only}} {{available}} source of <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> was China. In 1946, the company Jardine Matheson acquired [...] of bristles for the British {{government and a}} further [...] for Australia from remote locations in China near the border with Tibet. These stocks were transported to Chongqing, {{the capital of the}} Kuomintang government, and Jardine Matheson eventually gained permission to export them to Australia and Britain. This supply of bristles would be sufficient to meet Australia's needs for several months.|$|R

5|$|Bristle {{toothbrush}}: According to a Library of Congress website, the Chinese {{have used}} the bristle toothbrush since 1498, {{during the reign of}} the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–1505) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644); it also adds that the toothbrush was not mass-produced until 1780, when they were sold by a William Addis of Clerkenwell, London, England. In accordance with the Library of Congress website, scholar John Bowman also writes that the <b>bristle</b> toothbrush using <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> was invented in China during the 1490s. While Bonnie L. Kendall agrees with this, she noted that a predecessor existed in ancient Egypt {{in the form of a}} twig that was frayed at the end.|$|R
5|$|As the Chinese Civil War was raging at {{the time}} and Communist forces were attacking river boats {{travelling}} from Chongqing, it was judged necessary to transport the <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> from the city by air. The Kuomintang government agreed to allow RAAF and Royal Air Force aircraft to fly return flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing between 1 and 14 May only. After arriving in Hong Kong, the bristles would be shipped to Australia by sea. Both the Kuomintang government and the Communist forces were concerned about the presence of foreigners in China, and the Australian aircrew were warned that they would be imprisoned if they landed anywhere other than Chongqing or an emergency airstrip at Canton.|$|R

In addition, the squadron transported other service personnel back to Australia until 1946 as part of the demobilisation of the Australian military. During May 1946, three of No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas were assigned the unusual task of flying 25 tonnes of <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> from Chongqing in China to Hong Kong, from where the bristles were shipped to Australia.

Materials connected to these needles included flax, hemp, fascia, hair, linen strips, <b>pig's</b> <b>bristles,</b> reeds, gras-ses, and other exotic materials available. Tying of locks of scalp hair into knots to close scalp wounds was com-mon djring battles and is still employed as a temporary measure in some busy emergency rooms.

But, delightfully as the wine looked, it was mingled with the most potent enchantments that Circe knew how to concoct. For every drop of the pure grape juice there were two drops of the pure mischief; and the danger of the thing was, that the mischief made it taste all the better. The mere smell of the bubbles, which effervesced at the brim, was enough to turn a man's beard into <b>pig's</b> <b>bristles,</b> or make a lion's claws grow out of his fingers, or a fox's brush behind him.|$|R

40|$|A {{quantitative}} trait locus (QTL) affecting fatness in a way opposite to expectations based on breed means was mapped to swine chromosome 7 (SSC 7) using crosses between Large White (LW) and Meishan (MS) founders. Defining the molecular fatness trait more explicitly would allow deducing positional candidate genes, for which expression differences must be analysed in experimental populations. First, mRNA levels of genes representing sequential steps in adipogenesis or involved in lipid metabolism were studied in backfat of pigs having homozygous LWQTL 7 /LWQTL 7 or heterozygous LWQTL 7 /MSQTL 7 alleles and considered at two ages. mRNA level of DLK 1 expressed in preadipocytes was greater in MSQTL <b>7</b> /LWQTL <b>7</b> <b>pigs</b> than in homozygous pigs at 28 days. Transcript abundances of CEBPA involved in differentiation, the prolipogenic FASN gene and the adipocyte-specific marker FABP 4 were lower in MSQTL <b>7</b> /LWQTL <b>7</b> <b>pigs</b> compared with LWQTL <b>7</b> /LWQTL <b>7</b> <b>pigs</b> at 150 days. Because these results suggest a lag time in terminal differentiation associated with the MS allele, seven genes in the QTL interval were deduced as promising candidates for the QTL effect by bioinformatics analysis. Among them, PPARD and CDKN 1 A had lower expression levels in MSQTL <b>7</b> /LWQTL <b>7</b> <b>pigs</b> at both ages. Genotype-related differences were observed in mRNA levels of PPARD target genes involved in cell differentiation (FZD 7) or fatty acid oxidation (ACADL and ACOX 1) at 150 days. These results re-evaluate the potential of PPARD to explain part of variation in pig adiposity...|$|R
