5|$|Priestley's friends, {{particularly}} other Rational Dissenters, {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768).

Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending {{that the government should}} only have control over the public sphere. Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms.|$|E
