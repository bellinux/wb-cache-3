The problem faced is the damage that often occurs suddenly on the blowmould machine so that corrective maintenance must be done. The purpose of this research is to know the cause of the damage and to propose the action plan to minimize downtime. The method used is Reliability Centered Maintenance to determine the selection of action and time interval of replacement for critical components on the blowmould machine. From the FMEA analysis, it is known that the critical components of each blowmould machine subsystem are bearing <b>roller</b> <b>feed,</b> mandrel, seal gasket, and fitting. The results of LTA analysis are the category of failure (outage problem and economic problem) and the selection of action for the critical component (time directed). From the calculation of Total Minimum Downtime, known that the replacement schedule for critical component are 23 days for bearing <b>roller</b> <b>feed,</b> 9 days for mandrel, 8 days for seal gasket, and 8 days for fitting, that is resulting in decreased downtime of 1. 56 % with a value of 99. 63 % availabilit...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} into material wrinkling failure mechanics of conventional metal spinning {{and the effects}} of process parameters and material properties are presented in this paper. By developing finite element (FE) models using the Box-Behnken design of experiments, the effects of six key process and material parameters on the start of material wrinkling have been investigated. These key factors include <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> per pass, feed rate, blank thickness, tool path profile, material Young’s modulus, yield stress and strain hardening exponent. The results of FE simulation are validated by comparing the modelled roller tool forces and spun part end shape with those measured during a spinning experiment. From FE simulations, large residual stresses in the form of bending moments are found to be present in the flange of the blank, induced by the roller contact. It is found that material wrinkling failure begins when a plastic hinge is formed between the roller and the edge of the blank. It is found that both <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> per pass and feed rate produce the most significant effect on the initiation of wrinkling failure, as they increase the bending stresses causing a plastic hinge to form more rapidly, thus wrinkling to occur more quickly...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFlow forming is {{gradually}} employed in production of high precision seamless {{components in the}} field of aerospace and defense. Rocket & missile casing, rocket motor case, cartridge case, rocket nose cones are few examples of flow forming process. The nature of process is non linear with complex deformation behavior. There are mainly two strategies used during the process viz. forward and backward/reverse. In forward method, the direction of <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> and material deformation is same and in reverse method, the direction of <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> and material deformation is opposite. Usually there are three force components encountered during the process i. e. axial, radial and circumferential. The understanding and knowledge of forces are crucial for tooling design for various geometrical and material conditions. The online force measurement during the process is quite difficult in commercial machines. Therefore, a simulation model is developed to estimate forces during the process. Taguchi L 9 design has been used to develop the model because it is a well established design of experiment method to solve complex and time consuming problems. Three levels of three operating variables (rotational speed, axial feed and depth of forming) along with friction factor have been used during the study. The material utilized as Aluminum Alloy 6063 due to its light weight, excellent corrosion resistance, recyclable, cost effectiveness, ease of availability, durability etc. It has been observed that axial force is found to be highest followed by the radial and circumferential force. Also it has been discerned that axial feed and friction factor are the most prominent factors affecting axial and circumferential forces during the process. Further, radial force is influenced by friction factor only. The effect on von mises stress and equivalent plastic strain also studied and reported...|$|E

40|$|The present review {{deals with}} {{parameters}} influencing the rice breakage during rice milling operations {{and the effect}} of rubber roll Sheller in rice husk removal process. The main objective of rice milling system is to remove the husk and bran layer to produce the white rice. In this process, rubber roll sheller is used to remove husk from the grains by friction process. If the rubber material is too soft, there may not be sufficient shear force to husk the paddy. Wear will be minimum for rubber material with high hardness but indeed it pronounce the breakage of rice. Hence, for efficient husking the rubber roll material should possess the balance of physico-mechanical properties. Rice breakage depends on several other parameters like the type of harvest, drying temperature, drying methods, physical characteristics of paddy, husking characteristics, paddy moisture content, rubber roller speed, rubber roll pressure, paddy feed rate and fissures.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{wrinkling}} {{failure in}} conventional spinning of a cylindrical cup {{has been investigated}} by using both finite element (FE) analysis and experimental methods. FE simulation models of a spinning experiment have been developed using the explicit finite element solution method provided by the software Abaqus. The severity of wrinkles is quantified by calculating the standard deviation of the radial coordinates of element nodes {{on the edge of}} the workpiece obtained from the FE models. The results show that the severity of wrinkles tends to increase when increasing the <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> ratio. A forming limit study for wrinkling has been carried out and shows that there is a feed ratio limit beyond which the wrinkling failure will take place. Provided that the feed ratio is kept below this limit, the wrinkling failure can be prevented. It is believed that high compressive tangential stresses in the local forming zone are the causes of the wrinkling failure. Furthermore, the computational performance of the solid and shell elements in simulat-ing the spinning process are examined and the tool forces obtained from wrinkling and wrinkle-free models are compared. Finally, the effects of the feed ratio on variations of the wall thickness of the spun cylindrical cup are investigated...|$|E

Many researchers have investigated power spinning. Hua et al.

They concluded that the radial spinning force component plays {{a significant role in the}} ball spinning of a thin-walled tube, and increasing the radial spinning force component contributes to the plastic deformation of the spun tubular blank as well as the accuracy of the spun workpieces. Mohebbi et al.

The study examined the impact of retaining bark on logs on the productivity and costs of a whole-tree to roadside harvesting system in a short-rotation Eucalyptus nitens plantation in Australia being harvested for pulp logs. Trees were felled and bunched with a feller-buncher in spring, then left infield for four weeks to promote bark adhesion and reduce bark loss. A skidder extracted the trees to roadside where a processor processed them to predominantly 10 m logs. Machine productivities were calculated from estimated tree and log volumes and cycle times recorded from video recordings. The feller-buncher's productivity (65 m 3) was less than expected as it appeared to be underpowered to handle the larger trees on the study site. The skidder's productivity (56 m 3) was comparable to those reported in studies under similar conditions and with bark retained. The roadside processor's productivity (25 m 3) was lower than expected. This was believed to result from the operator separately stacking 10 m and 5 m logs, and the lower feed speed resulting from slippage due to the reduced <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> pressure used in the study to reduce bark loss. Future research could identify <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> that increase <b>feed</b> speed while retaining bark.
