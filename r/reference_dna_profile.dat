40|$|Physical {{contact can}} result in the {{transfer}} of DNA from one individual to another. In cases of sexual offence this can often be {{by means of an}} aggressive or sexual act. Biological material can accumulate under the fingernail hyponychium of both the victim and/or the suspect and has the potential to provide evidence and intelligence information to the police. The incidence of mixed DNA profiles obtained from fingernail samples of couples who co-habit was explored using AmpFlSTR® SGM Plus® (SGM Plus) (Applied Biosystems®). It was predicted that the higher incidence of contact from co-habitation and therefore the greater opportunity for DNA transfer would result in an increased level of foreign DNA from the partner under the donor's fingernails. Fingernail swabs were taken from all fingers of the left and right hands of 12 couples on three separate occasions. DNA profiles were compared to both the donor and partner's reference DNA profiles. The number of reportable mixed DNA profiles obtained (17 %) was higher than in previous reports. In this study, the majority of non-donor alleles matched the partner's <b>reference</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>profile,</b> indicating that co-habitation affected non-donor DNA obtained from fingernail swabs. The results demonstrated that as the couples spent increasing amounts of time together, the incidence of mixed DNA profiles increased. The large variation in the incidence of foreign alleles observed within and between couples suggested that a combination of lifestyle factors were having a significant effect on whether mixed DNA profiles were observed. Further DNA profiling using the AmpFlSTR® Y-filer® (Yfiler) PCR amplification (Applied Biosystems) was carried out to determine whether female fingernail samples that had previously given single donor profiles contained low levels of male DNA that may be detected by targeting the Y-chromosome. It was found that 63 % of the samples analysed using Yfiler produced full or partial Y-STR profiles. The Y-STR profiles were compared to partners' profiles and searched through two haplotype databases to determine the evidential value of such samples...|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} study of short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping of telogen phase hairs in particular, and hair shaft in general, is presented. A number of extraction procedures in common use were investigated and the quantities of nuclear DNA (nuDNA) delivered were quantified via a real-time PCR assay. The extracts {{were subjected to}} two variations on AmpFℓST® Profiler Plus™ PCR amplification strategies (extended cycles, two rounds of PCR) and the genotypes compared. Nuclear DNA was found to persist in human hair shafts, albeit at very low levels. Full Profiler Plus™ profiles consistent with the hair donor were obtained from 100 mg hair shaft samples (bleached and unbleached). These were, however, mixed profiles, indicating low copy number (LCN) contamination in the extracts. Single telogen hair clubs and single hair shafts delivered partial profiles with usually only one allele of heterozygous loci. Telogen phase hairs yielded {{the same amount of}} nuDNA (and no more) as hairshafts (either anagen or telogen). Whether hair shafts dissolved or not in lysis buffer had no effect on either the quantitated yield of DNA or on the chance of obtaining a correct genotype. These results provide evidence that genomic DNA resides on the exterior of the hair shaft and we use this information to suggest an optimal procedure for nuDNA extraction from keratinised hair samples: soaking hairs in simple digestion buffers containing Tris–HCl, a salt and a chelating agent without prior cleaning of the hair shafts. It is proposed that cleaning removes most of the recoverable DNA. This procedure was applied to obtain genotypes from 3 cm hair shafts which matched reference profiles from the donors at up to 9 out of 10 AmpFℓST® Profiler Plus™ STR loci. When the genotyping success was measured by counting the number of matches between the two dominant alleles at each locus for each extract with the <b>reference</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> of the hair donor, the success was found to be highly dependent on the donor. The number of matching alleles varied between not less than 10 for one donor to no more than two for another donor. These results may well be linked to the environmental experience of the hairs from each donor prior to removal...|$|E

40|$|The {{fight against}} doping is mainly focused on direct detection, using {{analytical}} methods {{for the detection}} of doping agents in biological samples. However, the World Anti-Doping Code also defines doping as possession, administration or attempted administration of prohibited substances or methods, trafficking or attempted trafficking in any prohibited substance or methods. As these issues correspond to criminal investigation, a forensic approach can help assessing potential violation of these rules. In the context of a rowing competition, genetic analyses were conducted on biological samples collected in infusion apparatus, bags and tubing in order to obtain <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles.</b> As no database of athletes' <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> was available, the use of information from the location detection as well as contextual information were key to determine a population of suspected athletes and to obtain <b>reference</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> for comparison.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1994 Jane Moira TaupinThe innovative forensic technique of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> has been acclaimed {{as the most important}} advance in forensic science since fingerprinting. Whilst there is much anecdotal information on the impact of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> on criminal investigation, prosecution and adjudication, there is little quantitative and control comparison data on the routine use of forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling.</b> This study evaluates the effect of the introduction of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> in Victoria on a number of key points in the criminal justice system. The overall impact of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was low as determined by the percentage of criminal cases which utilise <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling.</b> However, in certain classes of cases its impact was measurable, most notably in sex offences committed by “strangers”. Less than one quarter of sexual offence cases of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiled</b> resulted in a contested trial, suggesting that the focus of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> on the criminal justice system should swing to the pre-trial phase. <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was most often used in sexual offence cases and a database comparison of these cases before and after the advent of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was examined. Whilst not statistically significant, trends indicated there were more solved cases, more guilty pleas and fewer trials after the introduction of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling,</b> but more individuals were drawn into the investigatory process. The number of trials of sexual offences in which consent was an issue was slightly greater than previously. The increase in guilty pleas with <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was only for stranger type crime.

It also deals with the legal aspects of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> because it raises many important legal questions. The The- sis consists of two parts. The first part is about <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> itself. The history of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> worldwide and in the Czech Republic is mentioned. The first cases solved with its contribution are described. A very important feature of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> is that it can be used not only for conviction of offenders but also for acquittal of innocent individu- als. Biological principles of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> are explained as well as possibilities of its utilization in criminal science, criminal and civil proceedings. The fact that monozy- gotic twins have identical DNA is mentioned as well as some very extraordinary occurrences such as hermaphrodites or another kind of individuals, who have two different DNA. These anomalies can cause problems with interpretation of the results. DNA databases can be used for comparison of many <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> without the necessity to repeat sample analysis.

We evaluated the ability of bacterial artificial chromosomes/P 1 -derived artificial and oligonucleotide array-CGH analyses to detect constitutional sex chromosome imbalances using sex-mismatched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Twenty-two samples with imbalances involving either the X or Y chromosome, including deletions, duplications, triplications, derivative or isodicentric chromosomes, and aneuploidy, were analyzed. Although concordant results were obtained for approximately one-half of the samples when using sex-mismatched and sex-matched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs,</b> array-CGH analyses with sex-mismatched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs</b> did not detect genomic imbalances that were detected using sex-matched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs</b> in 6 of 22 patients. Small duplications and deletions of the X chromosome were most difficult to detect in female and male patients, respectively, when sex-mismatched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs</b> were used. Sex-matched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs</b> in array-CGH analyses provides optimal sensitivity and enables an automated statistical evaluation for the detection of sex chromosome imbalances when compared with an experimental design using sex-mismatched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Using sex-mismatched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs</b> in array-CGH analyses may generate false-negative, false-positive, and ambiguous results for sex chromosome-specific probes, thus masking potential pathogenic genomic imbalances.

40|$|When a Y-chromosomal and a (partial) {{autosomal}} <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> {{are obtained}} from one crime sample, and both profiles match the suspect's profiles, {{we would like}} to know the combined evidential value. To calculate the likelihood ratio of observing the autosomal and Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> combined, we need to know the conditional random match probability of the observed autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile,</b> given the Y-chromosomal match. We examine this conditional probability in two ways: (1) with a database containing data of 2, 085 men and (2) using a simulation model. We conclude that if the Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> match, we can still regard the autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> as independent from the Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> if the matching person is not a descendant of the father of the donor of the (crime) sample.

40|$|In {{forensic}} science {{it is common}} practice to work on problems where the likelihood ratio is based on observing single piece of evidence given two hypotheses. However, {{in a lot of}} cases, {{there is more than one}} piece of evidence. In this thesis three problems regarding combining <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> are discussed. First, we derived a method to combine the evidential value of different partial Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> of different stains. The method consists of finding a lower bound for the likelihood ratio when more than two propositions are compared and where we don't need the prior probabilities of the different propositions. Second, we made a simulation model to investigate the dendence of autosomal and Y chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> by assuming that everybody with the same Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> has a common ancestor and simulating the assignment of autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> over different family tree structures. The results can be used in practice as scientific support for the assumption of independence between the Y and autosomal profile. Third, we developed a model to interpret (low-template) <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> which is able to give the likelihood of observing the <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> given any allele-combination of the donor. This model assumes that a <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> is a result of a stochastic process where the input are the alleles of a possible donor.
