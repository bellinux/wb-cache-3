The CONELRAD system allowed for early nationwide warnings in the event of possible enemy attack during the Cold War.

[...] WINC was the station on which country music singer Patsy Cline made her debut in 1948, when Cline asked {{the leader of a}} [...] "hillbilly band" [...] for a chance to perform with them on air. [...] In the late 1950s, the station's chief engineer, Philip Whitney, designed a CONELRAD alarm device for FM stations to warn listeners {{in the event of an}} enemy attack during the Cold War. [...] Whitney also created many of the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> used by radio stations. [...] He was awarded for his work by the National Association of Broadcasters in 1970. [...] WINC had difficulty renewing its license in the early 1970s, as it was airing 22 minutes of commercials per hour—in excess of what the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permitted. The station encountered further trouble in 1988 when a local prosecutor called one of its promotions an [...] "illegal cash lottery"; a judge disagreed. [...] In that same year, the news department at WINC received an Associated Press Broadcasters Association national award for [...] "Best Radio Spot News".|$|E

The remaining {{two parts of the}} <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> include chemically caged ATP, which is injected into the central nervous system through the fly's simple eye, and laser light capable of uncaging the injected ATP. The giant fibre system in insects consists of a pair of large interneurons in the brain which can excite the insect flight and jump muscles. A 200 ms pulse of laser light elicited jumping, wing flapping, or other flight movements in 60%-80% of the flies. Although this frequency is lower than that observed with direct electrical stimulation of the giant fibre system, it is higher than that elicited by natural stimuli, such as a light-off stimulus.|$|R
