2500|$|Modern {{headlamps}} are electrically operated, {{positioned in}} pairs, {{one or two}} {{on each side of}} the front of a vehicle. A headlamp system is required to produce a low and a high beam, which may be achieved either by an individual lamp for each function or by a single multi-function lamp. High beams (called [...] "main beams" [...] or [...] "full beams" [...] or [...] "driving beams" [...] in some countries) cast most of their light straight ahead, maximizing seeing distance, but producing too much glare for safe use when other vehicles are present on the road. Because there is no special control of upward light, high beams also cause backdazzle from fog, rain and snow due to the <b>retroreflection</b> of the water droplets. Low beams (called [...] "dipped beams" [...] or [...] "passing beams" [...] in some countries) have stricter control of upward light, and direct most of their light downward and either rightward (in right-traffic countries) or leftward (in left-traffic countries), to provide safe forward visibility without excessive glare or backdazzle.|$|E

40|$|Some {{advanced}} concepts for gated viewing are presented, including spectral diversity illumination techniques, non-line-of-sight imaging, indirect scene illumination, and {{in particular}} setups in bistatic configurations. By using a multiple-wavelength illumination source target speckles could be substantially reduced, leading to an improved image quality and enhanced range accuracy. In non-line-of-sight imaging experiments we observed the scenery through the reflections in a window plane. The scene was illuminated indirectly as well by a diffuse reflection of the laser beam at different nearby objects. In this setup several targets could be spotted, which, e. g., offers the capability to look around the corner in urban situations. In the presented measuring campaigns the advantages of bistatic setups in comparison with common monostatic configurations are discussed. The appearance of shadows or local contrast enhancements {{as well as the}} mitigation of <b>retroreflections</b> supports the human observer in interpreting the scene. Furthermore a bistatic configuration contributes to a reduced dazzling risk and to observer convertness...|$|R
40|$|Creating photo {{realistic}} {{images from}} real word complex materials {{is a great}} challenge: the reflectance function of materials, especially fabrics, has glossy or specular highlights, reflectance anisotropy and <b>retroreflections.</b> This increases greatly the complexity of rendering. Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTFs), i. e. 2 D textures acquired under varying illumination and viewing directions, {{have been used to}} render complex materials. However, the acquisition of textures for BTF requires up to now expensive setups and the measurement process is very timeconsuming as the directional dependent parameters (lighting and viewing directions) have to be controlled accurately. This paper will present in detail a new low cost programmable device for the rapid acquisition of BTF datasets. The device allows to acquire BTF databases {{at a fraction of the}} cost of available setups, and allows to experiment when a texture resolution and sample density increase in the parameter space is not perceivable by an observer of the renderings. The paper proves that using smaller resolution textures and decreasing the samples in parameter space does not lead to a loss of picture quality...|$|R
40|$|An optical time-domain {{reflectometer}} (OTDR) is {{a diagnostic}} that measures light {{that has been}} reflected back towards the laser's origin. The transport spatial filter (TSF) OTDR is a device that measures these reflections {{in the latter half}} of the laser system, especially to monitor <b>retroreflections</b> from the target. A MATLAB computer program has been created that imports and analyzes OTDR data files. These data files contain information on the voltage of the return signal at specific times, the time scale used, and the shot type. The time that the light takes to return to the OTDR from specific optics has been determined through the use of ray trace charts. These charts have been used to trace the beam's path to the optic and back to the TSF OTDR. These times are used to create labels on the graph for the most important optics. The program then plots the data on a graph of voltage vs time. This graph allows easy interpretation of the data, allowing the user to diagnose any optic malfunctions or unexpected return signals. Purpose Optical time-domain reflectometry is used in the OMEGA EP (extended performance) system to identify and locate optics which have deformations or impurities, or optics that hav...|$|R
5000|$|Digital {{compositing}} {{programs and}} chroma key environments use <b>retroreflection</b> to replace traditional lit backdrops in composite work as {{they provide a}} more solid colour without requiring that the backdrop be lit separately.|$|E
50|$|A bicycle {{reflector}} or prism reflector is {{a common}} safety device found on the rear, front and wheels of bicycles. It uses the principle of <b>retroreflection</b> to alert another road user of the bicycle's presence on the road.|$|E
50|$|Because the back-side {{reflection}} for an uncoated sphere is imperfect, it {{is fairly}} common {{to add a}} metallic coating to the back half of retroreflective spheres to increase the reflectance, but this implies that the <b>retroreflection</b> only works when the sphere is oriented in a particular direction.|$|E
50|$|It is possible, using {{nonlinear}} optical processes, {{to exactly}} reverse the propagation direction and phase variation of {{a beam of}} light. The reversed beam is called a conjugate beam, and thus the technique is known as optical phase conjugation (also called time reversal, wavefront reversal and <b>retroreflection).</b>|$|E
50|$|Retroreflective {{sheeting}} {{for road}} signs is categorized by construction and performance specified by technical standards such as ASTM D4956-11a.; various types give differing levels of <b>retroreflection,</b> effective view angles, and lifespan. Sheeting has replaced button copy as the predominant type of retroreflector used in roadway signs.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{retroreflector}} can {{consist of}} many small versions of these structures incorporated {{in a thin}} sheet or in paint. In the case of paint containing glass beads, the paint adheres the beads to the surface where <b>retroreflection</b> is required and the beads protrude, their diameter being about twice {{the thickness of the}} paint.|$|E
50|$|Specifies {{requirements}} for {{high visibility clothing}} which is capable of visually signalling the user's presence. The high visibility clothing is intended to provide conspicuity of the wearer in any light condition when viewed by operators of vehicles or other mechanized equipment during daylight conditions and under illumination of headlights in the dark.Performance requirements are included for color and <b>retroreflection</b> {{as well as for}} the minimum areas and for the placement of the materials in protective clothing.|$|E
50|$|An MRR couples or {{combines}} {{an optical}} retroreflector with a modulator to reflect modulated optical signals directly {{back to an}} optical receiver or transceiver, allowing the MRR to function as an optical communications device without emitting its own optical power. This can allow the MRR to communicate optically over long distances without needing substantial on-board power supplies. The function of the <b>retroreflection</b> component is to direct the reflection back to or near {{to the source of}} the light. The modulation component changes the intensity of the reflection. The idea applies to optical communication in a broad sense including not only laser-based data communications but also human observers and road signs. A number of technologies have been proposed, investigated, and developed for the modulation component, including actuated micromirrors, frustrated total internal reflection, electro-optic modulators (EOMs), piezo-actuated deflectors, multiple quantum well (MQW) devices, and liquid crystal modulators, though any one of numerous known optical modulation technologies could be used in theory. These approaches have many advantages and disadvantages relative to one another with respect to such features as power use, speed, modulation range, compactness, <b>retroreflection</b> divergence, cost, and many others.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} optical {{communications}} arrangement, the MRR with its related electronics {{is mounted on}} a convenient platform and connected to a host computer which has the data {{that are to be}} transferred. A remotely located optical transmitter/receiver system usually consisting of a laser, telescope, and detector provides an optical signal to the modulating retro-reflector. The incident light from the transmitter system is both modulated by the MRR and reflected directly back toward the transmitter (via the <b>retroreflection</b> property). Figure 1 illustrates the concept.|$|E
50|$|A third, {{much less}} common way of {{producing}} a retroreflector {{is to use the}} nonlinear optical phenomenon of phase conjugation. This technique is used in advanced optical systems such as high-power lasers and optical transmission lines. Phase-conjugate mirrors require a comparatively expensive and complex apparatus, as well as large quantities of power (as nonlinear optical processes can be efficient only at high enough intensities). However, phase-conjugate mirrors have an inherently much greater accuracy {{in the direction of the}} <b>retroreflection,</b> which in passive elements is limited by the mechanical accuracy of the construction.|$|E
50|$|Other {{methods include}} using {{spectral}} analysis instead of merely monochromatic cameras to distinguish iris tissue from other material; observing the characteristic natural movement of an eyeball (measuring nystagmus, tracking eye while text is read, etc.); testing for retinal <b>retroreflection</b> (red-eye effect) or for reflections from the eye's four optical surfaces (front {{and back of}} both cornea and lens) to verify their presence, position and shape. Another proposed method is to use 3D imaging (e.g., stereo cameras) to verify the position {{and shape of the}} iris relative to other eye features.|$|E
50|$|Two general {{types of}} {{infrared}} / near-infrared (also known as active light) eye tracking techniques are used: bright-pupil and dark-pupil. Their difference {{is based on}} the location of the illumination source with respect to the optics. If the illumination is coaxial with the optical path, then the eye acts as a retroreflector as the light reflects off the retina creating a bright pupil effect similar to red eye. If the illumination source is offset from the optical path, then the pupil appears dark because the <b>retroreflection</b> from the retina is directed away from the camera.|$|E
50|$|Another {{common type}} of {{retroreflector}} consists of refracting optical elements with a reflective surface, arranged so that the focal surface of the refractive element coincides with the reflective surface, typically a transparent sphere and (optionally) a spherical mirror. In the paraxial approximation, this effect can be achieved with lowest divergence with a single transparent sphere when the refractive index of the material is exactly one plus the refractive index ni of the medium from which the radiation is incident (ni is around 1 for air). In that case, the sphere surface behaves as a concave spherical mirror with the required curvature for <b>retroreflection.</b> In practice, the optimal index of refraction may be lower than ni + 1 ≅ 2 due to several factors. For one, it is sometimes preferable to have an imperfect, slightly divergent <b>retroreflection,</b> {{as in the case}} of road signs, where the illumination and observation angles are different. Due to spherical aberration, there also exists a radius from the centerline at which incident rays are focused at the center of the rear surface of the sphere. Finally, high index materials have higher Fresnel reflection coefficients, so the efficiency of coupling of the light from the ambient into the sphere decreases as the index becomes higher. Commercial retroreflective beads thus vary in index from around 1.5 (common forms of glass) up to around 1.9 (commonly barium titanate glass).|$|E
50|$|The Earth, Moon, {{and some}} other bodies have, to some extent, the {{property}} of <b>retroreflection.</b> Light which strikes them is reflected preferentially back in the direction from which it has come, rather than in other directions. If the light comes from the Sun, it is reflected back toward the Sun and in nearby directions. For example, when its phase is full, the Moon reflects light preferentially toward the Sun, and toward the Earth, which is in almost the same direction. The full Moon therefore appears brighter, when seen from Earth, than it would if it diffused light uniformly in all directions. Similarly, near new moon, earthshine which has been retroreflected by the Earth toward the Sun, or toward the Moon which is in almost the same direction, and then retroreflected again by the Moon toward the Earth appears much brighter, seen from Earth, than it would without the retroreflective effects. The <b>retroreflection</b> is produced by spheres of transparent material on the reflecting surface. When it encounters a transparent sphere, light is preferentially reflected and refracted in a path, within the sphere, which exits it in the direction from which it entered. On the Earth, the spheres are droplets of water in clouds. On the Moon, large numbers of solid glassy spheres are found on the surface. They {{are thought to have}} been formed from drops of molten rock, produced by impacts, which cooled and solidified before falling back to the surface.|$|E
5000|$|With SLR cameras, it is {{important}} that the image in the viewfinder be the same image recorded by the film or sensor, so that the effect of the add-on lenses and filters can be seen by the photographer. Point-and-shoot cameras generally don't have such add-on devices, hence there is no such need. [...] Small cameras, including digital ones, encourage the occurrence of photographic orbs [...] - [...] unexpected, typically circular artifacts that occur in flash photography [...] - [...] where the short distance between the lens and the built-in flash decreases the angle of light reflection to the lens. The resulting <b>retroreflection</b> makes dust particles bright and visible.|$|E
5000|$|The term cat's eye {{derives from}} the {{resemblance}} of the cat's eye retroreflector to the optical system that produces the well-known phenomenon of [...] "glowing eyes" [...] or eyeshine in cats and other vertebrates (which are only reflecting light, rather than actually glowing). The combination of the eye's lens and the cornea form the refractive converging system, while the tapetum lucidum behind the retina forms the spherical concave mirror. Because {{the function of the}} eye is to form an image on the retina, an eye focused on a distant object has a focal surface that approximately follows the reflective tapetum lucidum structure, which is the condition required to form a good <b>retroreflection.</b>|$|E
50|$|A simple {{retroreflector}} {{can be made}} {{by placing}} three ordinary mirrors mutually perpendicular to one another (a corner reflector). The image produced is the inverse of one produced by a single mirror. A surface can be made partially retroreflective by depositing a layer of tiny refractive spheres on it or by creating small pyramid like structures. In both cases internal reflection causes the light to be reflected back to where it originated. This is used to make traffic signs and automobile license plates reflect light mostly back in the direction from which it came. In this application perfect <b>retroreflection</b> is not desired, since the light would then be directed back into the headlights of an oncoming car rather than to the driver's eyes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Retroreflection</b> (sometimes called retroflection) {{is used on}} road surfaces, road signs, vehicles, and {{clothing}} (large parts of the surface of special safety clothing, less on regular coats). When the headlights of a car illuminate a retroreflective surface, the reflected light is directed towards the car and its driver (rather than in all directions as with diffuse reflection). However, a pedestrian can see retroreflective surfaces in the dark only {{if there is a}} light source directly between them and the reflector (e.g., via a flashlight they carry) or directly behind them (e.g., via a car approaching from behind). [...] "Cat's eyes" [...] are a particular type of retroreflector embedded in the road surface and are used mostly in the UK and parts of the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Thermoplastic {{markings}} {{are applied}} using specially designed vehicles. Usually thermoplastic marking mode should apply with equipment called a road marking machine to coat traffic lines, {{and the road}} paint needs preheating by a device commonly called a preheater. The thermoplastic mix is heated in trucks to about [...] before being fed to the application apparatus. This is often a screed box or ribbon gun. Immediately after the thermoplastic has been applied, glass beads are laid onto the hot material so that they embed before the plastic hardens. These beads provide initial <b>retroreflection.</b> As the marking wears during use and the initial beads are lost, the beads mixed with the binder are uncovered, providing long term retroreflectivity. These can be made exceptionally thick to produce a rumble strip effect.|$|E
50|$|The process {{involves}} an electron (hole) incident {{on the interface}} from the normal state material at energies less than the superconducting energy gap. The incident electron (hole) forms a Cooper pair in the superconductor with the <b>retroreflection</b> of a hole (electron) of opposite spin and velocity but equal momentum to the incident electron (hole), {{as seen in the}} figure. The barrier transparency is assumed to be high, with no oxide or tunnel layer which reduces instances of normal electron-electron or hole-hole scattering at the interface. Since the pair consists of an up and down spin electron, a second electron (hole) of opposite spin to the incident electron (hole) from the normal state forms the pair in the superconductor, and hence the retroreflected hole (electron). Through time-reversal symmetry, the process with an incident electron will also work with an incident hole (and retroreflected electron).|$|E
5000|$|Orbs are {{captured}} during low-light instances where the camera's flash is used. Cases include night or underwater photography, or where {{a bright light}} source is near the camera. Light appears much brighter very near the source due to the inverse-square law, which says light intensity is inversely proportional to {{the square of the}} distance from the source. [...] The orb artifact can result from <b>retroreflection</b> of light off solid particles, such as dust or pollen, or liquid particles, especially rain. They can also be caused by foreign material within the camera lens. [...] The image artifacts usually appear as either white or semi-transparent circles, though may also occur with whole or partial color spectra, purple fringing or other chromatic aberration. With rain droplets, an image may capture light passing through the droplet creating a small rainbow effect.|$|E
50|$|Crossed Andreev {{reflection}}, or CAR, {{also known}} as non-local Andreev reflection occurs when two spatially separated normal state material electrodes form two separate junctions with a superconductor, with the junction separation {{of the order of}} the BCS superconducting coherence length of the material in question. In such a device, <b>retroreflection</b> of the hole from an Andreev reflection process, resulting from an incident electron at energies less than the superconducting gap at one lead, occurs in the second spatially separated normal lead with the same charge transfer as in a normal AR process to a Cooper pair in the superconductor. For CAR to occur, electrons of opposite spin must exist at each normal electrode (so as to form the pair in the superconductor). If the normal material is a ferromagnet this may be guaranteed by creating opposite spin polarization via the application of a magnetic field to normal electrodes of differing coercivity.|$|E

5000|$|Frequently quoted gain {{levels of}} various {{materials}} range from 0.8 of light grey matte screens to 2.5 {{of the more}} highly reflective glass bead screens, some manufacturers claiming even higher numbers for their products. Very high gain levels could be attained simply by using a mirror surface, although the audience would then just see {{a reflection of the}} projector, defeating the purpose of using a screen. Many screens with higher gain are simply semi-glossy, and so exhibit more mirror-like properties, namely a bright [...] "hot spot" [...] in the screen—an enlarged (and greatly blurred) reflection of the projector’s lens. Opinions differ as to when this [...] "hot spotting" [...] begins to be distracting, but most viewers do not notice differences as large as 30% in the image luminosity, unless presented with a test image and asked to look for variations in brightness. This is possible because humans have greater sensitivity to contrast in smaller details, but less so in luminosity variations as great as half of the screen. Other screens with higher gain are semi-retroreflective. Unlike mirrors, retroreflective surfaces reflect light back toward the source. Hot spotting is less of a problem with retroreflective high gain screens. Unfortunately, at the perpendicular direction used for gain measurement, mirror reflection and <b>retroreflection</b> are indistinguishable, and this has sown confusion about the behavior of high gain screens.|$|E
