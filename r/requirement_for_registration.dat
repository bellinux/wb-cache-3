500|$|The USA, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand breed {{associations}} do {{not define}} a breed standard in their regulations, {{and application of}} any standard is voluntary. The only <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> as a Fullblood in both North American herd book registers is that ancestors should have [...] "full French ancestry", or trace directly to the [...] "Herd Book Limousin in France". In Australia and New Zealand the French Pure herd book classification requires that animals carry [...] "100% Pure French genetics". USA, Australian and New Zealand breed association regulations also allow graded up animals to be registered in their herd books as purebreds without a requirement {{to comply with a}} minimum French Limousin content. Grading up using these purebreds over base or lower grade animals has resulted in the gradual reduction in the French Limousin content of some purebreds, and an observable divergence from the French breed standard. The Canadian breed association by regulation prevents loss of French Limousin content from its registered purebreds by requiring that they [...] "contain 90% or more Limousin blood".|$|E

40|$|Lifelong {{education}} and the related topic of meeting <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> of nurses are hotly discussed. The main reason is the constantly changing conditions to register. The purpose is to provide quality nursing care provided by highly competent and educated nurses. Lifelong learning promotes high standards of professional practice. My thesis deals with meeting <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> in nurses on parental leave. The research objective was to identify the most common problems in meeting <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> in nurses on parental leave and to find the difference in meeting <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> in nurses in the working process and nurses on parental leave. The purpose of my research was to confirm my hypothesis that for the nurses on parental leave {{it is more difficult}} to meet <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration.</b> <b>For</b> data collection a combination of quantitative and qualitative research was used. In the quantitative research I distributed 150 questionnaires, which were anonymous, to nurses in the districts of Český Krumlov and České Budějovice. 119 questionnaires were returned. In the qualitative research I addressed seven nurses on parental leave, whom I interviewed. The research has proved that nurses on parental leave have little information on educational events. And also, nurses on parental leave do not receive information about educational events from their employers, they cannot take part in those events and do nor get any financial contributions. Nurses on parental leave miss babysitting at educational events. Nurses in the working process can participate in educational events organized by the employer and they also receive financial contributions for educational events. All the nurses agreed on the belief that lifelong learning brings them benefits...|$|R
