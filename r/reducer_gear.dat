Due to the reason of power circulation, these two kinds of planetary gear trains with high reduction ratios have low meshing efficiencies. The 2 K type planetary <b>gear</b> <b>reducer</b> only contain two ring gears and one carrier, hence it {{will not have the}} problem of power circulation and will have better meshing efficiency than 3 K type and 2 K- 2 H type planetary <b>gear</b> <b>reducers.</b> Also, in general, the <b>gear</b> <b>reducers</b> with high reduction ratio are compound gear system. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose 2 K type planetary simple <b>gear</b> <b>reducers</b> with high reduction ratios.
