40|$|Behavior {{maintained}} by stimulus-reinforcer pairings was examined. Guinea pigs maintained at 85 per cent of free-feeding weights reliably contacted a retractable lever presented before {{delivery of a}} single piece of guinea-pig chow or a 45 -milligram guinea-pig pellet. When animals were given free access to one food and received the second food preceded by the lever, contact responses persisted. Such responses seldom occurred when a single food was freely available and was also delivered after lever presentation. Introduction of an omission training (negative automaintenance) procedure, in which lever contacts resulted in <b>lever</b> <b>retraction</b> and prevented food delivery, strongly reduced lever contacts. Observation indicated that mouthing the food cup, instead of the lever, became the prominent behavior during the prefood stimulus under the omission training procedure...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} ten femoral veins with duplex ultrasound during total {{hip replacement}} {{to demonstrate the}} operative manoeuvres which cause venous obstruction and to assess prophylactic measures which may overcome it. Exposure of the acetabulum by distraction of the femur with a hook was less likely to occlude flow than <b>retraction</b> with bone <b>levers.</b> Adequate exposure of the femoral shaft by adduction, flexion and either internal or external rotation caused cessation of flow in all cases. In four cases an A-V Impulse System foot pump was activated during periods of stasis. In each case it overcame the obstruction and produced peak velocities which were twice that of the resting state. In five cases, {{towards the end of}} the procedure, debris was seen travelling proximally through the femoral vein...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: The rate of {{acquisition}} of drug self-administration {{may serve as}} a predictor of later drug-taking behavior, possibly influencing vulnerability to initiate drug use. Objectives: The present study examined the effects of perinatal (gestation/lactation) lead exposure on adult rates of {{acquisition of}} intravenous (i. v.) heroin self-administration and cocaine self-administration using an automated procedure that included both Pavlovian and operant components. Methods: For Experiment 1, female rats were gavaged daily with 0 or 16 mg lead for 30 days prior to breeding with nonexposed males. Metal administration continued through pregnancy and lactation and was discontinued at weaning (postnatal day [PND] 21). Animals born to control or lead-exposed dams received indwelling jugular catheters as adults and subsequently were tested daily in a preparation where sessions included an initial 3 -hr autoshaping period followed by a 3 - hr self-administration period. During autoshaping, heroin (. 018 mg/kg) infusions were paired with the extension and <b>retraction</b> of a <b>lever</b> when a lever press was not made for 15 sec, while infusions occurred during self-administration only when a lever press was executed (FR- 1). The criterion for acquisition was a 2 -day period during which a mean of 10 infusions/session occurred during self-administration. Animals were given 35 days to reach criterion. Results: Findings from Experiment 1 showed the proportion of rats meeting the lever-press response criterion for heroin when tested as adults was lower among lead-exposed animals. In Experiment 2, cocaine (. 20 mg/kg) was presented to animals that underwent the same metal-exposure regimen, surgical procedures and methods with variations only in the number of infusions that were automatically administered during the Pavlovian component. Criterion for cocaine acquisition was a mean of 50 infusions over a two-day. In Experiment 2, a greater proportion of leadexposed animals reached the criterion for cocaine acquisition. Conclusions: Developmentally lead-exposed animals showed a decrease in vulnerability to initiate drug-taking behavior when presented with heroin in the adult phase, relative to controls. In contrast, developmentally lead-exposed animals showed an enhanced vulnerability to reach the criterion for cocaine self-administration. Clinical relevance of developmental exposure to lead and the attendant vulnerability to self-administer drugs of abuse is discussed...|$|R
