40|$|Industrial {{wireless}} sensor {{networks have}} been widely deployed in many industrial systems. The main communication paradigm of such systems, known as convergecast, is to converge sensing data to a centralized manager. The rapid and reliable data convergecast {{is essential to the}} industrial production. Multiple <b>radio</b> <b>interfaces</b> on a network device and convergecast scheduling algorithms can effectively reduce convergecast delay. Existing works confine to the convergecast based on linear- and tree-based routing. Compared to the two routing schemes, graph routing is more reliable. Although the graph routing gains more popularity in industrial networks due to its better reliability, few works have addressed its temporality performance. On the other hand, the number of <b>radio</b> <b>interfaces</b> also impacts on the convergecast delay. In this paper, we present a holistic framework to solve how to use multiple <b>radio</b> <b>interfaces</b> to converge data. First, we propose a convergecast scheduling algorithm for industrial {{wireless sensor networks}} with multiple <b>radio</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Second, based on our proposed scheduling algorithm, we propose an optimal algorithm and a fast heuristic algorithm to minimize the number of <b>radio</b> <b>interfaces</b> under the temporality constraint of industrial production. Evaluations show that all our algorithms perform closely to the optimal solution...|$|R
