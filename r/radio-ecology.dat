40|$|Aim. To assess {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} pharmaceutical therapy, as well as genetic, pharmacogenetic, and radio-ecological features of malignant renovascular hypertension (RVH). Material and methods. Seventy-eight patients were randomized into main (n= 26) and placebo groups (n= 52). Primary combined end-point included the following: genetic analysis of monogenic disease, chromosome aberrations, genotypes and allele patterns for main polymorphic candidate genes participating in arterial hypertension (AH) and atherosclerosis pathogenesis; pharmacogenetic features of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive pharmaceutical therapy effectiveness; incorporated gamma-nuclide activity in critical organs. Results. Combined therapy with statins (target levels achieved in 92 % of the patients), fibrates (91 %), and angiotensin II antagonists (95 %) was highly effective and safe in RVH / ischemic nephropathy treatment. Genetic analysis demonstrated monogenic disease, adverse polymorphic gene genotypes, and chromosome aberrations linked to AH, atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome (MS), in more than 30 % of the participants. Stem sell transplantation (SCT) resulted in a 7, 1 -fold increase in concentration of mononuclear cells with high telomerase activity and long telomeres. Higher prevalence of adverse genome characteristics in Ural population (by 2, 7 times, comparing to Dutch population) could be partially explained by adverse <b>radio-ecology</b> in the former region: caesium, iodine, cobalt, manganese, and chrome concentrations were 12, 6 times higher than their upper safety limits. SC could act as radionuclide discorporants, reducing radionuclide concentration by 1, 4 - 2, 3 times. Pharmacogenetic analysis demonstrated minimal gene polymorphism sensitivity and maximal effectiveness for the combination of fluvastatin forte and fenofibrate M (36 %), as well as valsartan (44 %). Conclusion. Pharmaceutical therapy was highly effective and safe in RVH / ischemic nephropathy treatment. Genetic analysis demonstrated monogenic disease, adverse polymorphic gene genotypes, and chromosome aberrations linked to AH, atherosclerosis and MS, in more than 30 % of the subjects...|$|E
