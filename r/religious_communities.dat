5|$|A typhus {{epidemic}} swept Montreal in late 1847 and Montreal's <b>religious</b> <b>communities,</b> including Cadron-Jetté and {{the staff}} of the hospice, were called upon by Bishop Bourget to assist in combating it. The hospice's chaplain and director, Antoine Rey, and its midwife, Madame Montrait, were among the nine priests and 13 Religious Sisters of Montreal who were killed by the disease. One of the hospice's penitents also died due to the disease. Bishop Bourget subsequently named Father Venant Pilon as Rey's replacement as Director of the Hospice.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} several {{historic}} <b>religious</b> <b>communities</b> in Belgrade, the religious makeup {{of the city is}} relatively homogenous.

5|$|Gandhi first {{proposed}} a flag to the Indian National Congress in 1921. The flag {{was designed by}} Pingali Venkayya. In the centre was a traditional spinning wheel, symbolising Gandhi's goal of making Indians self-reliant by fabricating their own clothing. The design was then modified to include a white stripe in the centre for other <b>religious</b> <b>communities,</b> and provide a background for the spinning wheel. Subsequently, to avoid sectarian associations with the colour scheme, saffron, white and green were chosen for the three bands, representing courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively.|$|E
5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with <b>religious</b> <b>communities</b> that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious education classes. Public holidays in Croatia also include the religious festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the Julian calendar, Muslims on the days of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.

40|$|<b>Religious</b> <b>community</b> Jehovah´s Witnesses {{and ethical}} {{questions}} of blood transfusion The refusing of blood transfusion is a {{one point of}} the doctrine of <b>Religious</b> <b>community</b> Jehovah´s Witnesses. Deprecation like this can endanger patient´s life and opens many ethic questions and dilemmas. The main goal of this thesis is a survey of blood transfusion problems and comparison of different views of current and ex members of <b>Religious</b> <b>community</b> Jehovah´s Witnesses and doctors. This thesis was elaborated with using qualitative research methods { [...] } with using questionnaires. The first research group was built from current and ex members of <b>Religious</b> <b>community</b> Jehovah´s Witnesses. The second one was generated from doctors from chosen departments. Gaining data was very difficult because the members of <b>Religious</b> <b>community</b> Jehovah´s Witnesses aren´t willing to give information about this question. From research work result that not all current members of <b>Religious</b> <b>community</b> Jehovah´s Witnesses refuse blood transfusion. The members that left religious comunity mostly don´t agree with blood transfusion refusing. Major part of doctors prefers saving life and health to complying with patient´s resolution. Respecting of patient´s resolution is bigger in non life-threatening situations and mainly when doctors are churchgoers. From research work also result doctor´s non-uniform attitude to blood transfusion serving in case that pacient { [...] } a member of <b>Religious</b> <b>community</b> Jehovah´s Witnesses { [...] } is inconscious and in life-threatening situation and has a legal document that should guarantee not serving blood transfusion. The <b>Religious</b> <b>community</b> Jehovah´s Witnesses is certified religion in Czech Republic and we should respect their rights of religion { [...] } even if we don´t agree with their doctrina. It is important to find a good solution when doctors and patients have different opinion...|$|R

5|$|Some municipalities, {{particularly}} in South Jersey, are dry towns where no alcohol can be legally served or sold. Some {{of them are}} dry because of their origins as Quaker, Methodist, or other Protestant <b>religious</b> <b>communities.</b> For example, the seaside resort town of Ocean City has been dry since {{it was founded in}} 1879 by four Methodist clergymen. In recent years, several municipalities have questioned whether they ought to remain dry. Dry towns frequently have public referendums on whether they should remain dry or allow liquor sales in order to attract new businesses and increase property tax revenue.|$|E

In Orthodox schools, the Greek language would be the sole medium of instruction, except for grades one through three. However, religious education would be exclusively in Greek. Moreover, Greek was also made equal to Albanian in all public affairs, including courts and elective councils.|$|E

5|$|Another event which {{attracted}} {{much debate}} was the Supreme Court's annulment of the 1946 war crimes conviction of Gregorij Rožman. Rožman was the Catholic bishop of Ljubljana {{who had been}} found guilty of war crimes and treason during World War II {{as a result of}} his collaboration with Italian and German occupation forces. Several attempts during the 1990s to review the trial had failed. This had led to Janša's government changing the law, enabling the <b>religious</b> <b>communities</b> to request a review of trials of their deceased members, something which had previously been reserved only for close relatives. After the Archdiocese of Ljubljana initiated the review, the Supreme Court annulled the 1946 trial on procedural grounds, effectively rehabilitating Rožman, a decision that caused much controversy. This proved harmful for Peterle's campaign, as he was closely associated with the Catholic Church. When asked about the Rožman case in a TV debate, Peterle confined himself to remarking that he was a supporter of the rule of law, that the war had divided the nation and that Rožman had played some part in that.|$|E
5|$|Chad is a religiously diverse country. The 1993 census {{found that}} 54% of Chadians were Muslim (of these, {{according}} to a Pew report 48% professed to be Sunni, 21% Shia, 4% Ahmadi and 23% just Muslim). Roughly 20% of Chadians are Roman Catholic, 14% Protestant, 10% animist, while 3% did not profess any religion. None of these religious traditions are monolithic. Animism includes a variety of ancestor and place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam is expressed in diverse ways; for example, according to the Pew report mentioned earlier 55% of Muslim Chadians belong to Sufi orders. Christianity arrived in Chad with the French and American missionaries; as with Chadian Islam, it syncretises aspects of pre-Christian religious beliefs. Muslims are largely concentrated in northern and eastern Chad, and animists and Christians live primarily in southern Chad and Guéra. The constitution provides for a secular state and guarantees religious freedom; different <b>religious</b> <b>communities</b> generally co-exist without problems.|$|E
5|$|During the Norman reign, several {{different}} <b>religious</b> <b>communities</b> coexisted in the Kingdom of Sicily. They were: Latin Christians (Roman Catholics), Greek-speaking Christians (Eastern Orthodox), Muslims and Jews. Although local religious practices were not interrupted, {{the fact that}} Latin Christians were in power tended to favor Latin Christianity (Roman Catholicism). Bishops of the Eastern Orthodox rite were obliged to recognize {{the claims of the}} Latin Church in Sicily, while Muslim communities were no longer ruled by local emirs. Greek-speaking Christians, Latin Christians, and Muslims interacted on a regular basis, and were involved in each other's lives, economically, linguistically, and culturally. Some intermarried. Christians living in an Arabic-speaking area might adopt Arabic or even Muslim names. In many cities, each religious community had its own administrative and judicial order. In Palermo, Muslims were allowed to publicly call for prayer in mosques, and their legal issues were settled by qadis, judges who ruled in accordance with Islamic law.|$|E
