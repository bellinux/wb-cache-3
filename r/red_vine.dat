40|$|Abstract: Low venous tone (LVT) {{occurs when}} the veins in the lower limbs can no longer {{sufficiently}} pump enough blood back to the heart. Symptoms may include dull aching and cramping, itching or tingling in the calves, swelling redness or any colour changes as well as thickening of the skin in the lower limbs (Comerota, 2009). The most common indication of LVT is dilated veins known as varicose veins(Glovicski et al., 2011). LVT is a disorder found more commonly in females. Conventional treatment for LVT includes vein ligation or stripping, elastic compression, valve reconstruction and sclerotherapy venous bypass(Van den Bos et al., 2009). Amongst other treatment, exercise has also proven to be effective as it increases circulation, by increasing blood returning to the heart (Behrens and Michlovitz, 2006). A variety of herbal supplements have been proven {{to be safe and}} effective in the treatment of LVT. A combination complementary medication of red leaf extract, butcher’s broom extract, horse chestnut extract and vitamin B 6 has been formulated as an over-thecounter product in South Africa, to treat LVT without any anticipated adverse effects (Venavine-Nativa, 2014). <b>Red</b> <b>vine</b> leaf extract has also been proven to be useful in the treatment of LVT. Previous studies on the <b>red</b> <b>vine</b> leaf extract have shown that it is an effective and safe source of treatment (Kaluset al., 2004).

(Homoeopathy) Abstract: Low venous tone (LVT) {{has become}} a common problem in the primary care-setting and is often {{associated}} with significant morbidity and healthcare cost (Comerota, 2009). The prevalence of LVT is higher in females than in males; 40 % of females experience symptoms of LVT whereas 17 % of males may experience symptoms (Meissner et al., 2007). Approximately 50 % of {{women between the ages of}} 40 and 50 and 75 % of women between the ages of 60 and 70 experience some symptoms of LVT during their lifetime (Beebe-Dimmer, 2005). Females are more prone to LVT as certain hormones, such as progesterone, relax venous walls. Hormonal changes such as pregnancy and menopause also increase the risk of having LVT. Venous ulceration and varicose veins; decrease quality of life, cause chronic pain, loss of working days and may ultimately lead to early retirement (Gloviczki et al., 2011). There is a wide variety of treatments available in treating LVT however certain drugs such as anti-inflammatories and antibiotics have side effects, and interventional procedures are costly (Eberhardt and Rafelto, 2005). A combination of <b>red</b> <b>vine</b> leaf extract, butcher’s broom extract, horse chestnut extract and vitamin B 6 has been created to treat LVT without any anticipated adverse effects (Venavine-Nativa, 2014), therefore the question arises whether this combination work effectively. Previous studies have been conducted on each herbal extract individually, and showed positive results when treating physical symptoms associated with LVT. There are no current studies done on the combination of these herbs in treating physical symptoms associated with LVT. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a combination complementary medication consisting of <b>red</b> <b>vine</b> leaf extract (360 mg), horse chestnut extract (60 mg), butcher’s broom extract (35 mg); and pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) (3. 2 mg) in the treatment of physical symptoms of LVT, using a venous clinical severity score questionnaire (VCSS).

40|$|M. Tech. (Homoeopathy) Abstract: Low Venous Tone (LVT) {{is defined}} as {{impaired}} venous return which results in lower limb symptoms that include pain, swelling and dermatologic changes (Turpie, 2011). Low venous tone affects both males and females, but is more prevalent in females (Lenković et al., 2009). It is precipitated mainly by chronic diseases of lifestyle, namely obesity, hypertension and a sedentary lifestyle which are increasing in South Africa (Goedeck et al., 2005). Chronic disease status results in declined physical activity and therefore a decline in quality of life (Westaway, 2010). Conventional treatment modalities include surgery, compression stockings and sclerotherapy. These modalities have a limited role in treating low venous tone and have concomitant adverse effects. Surgery is invasive and poses a risk of damaging nerve tissue. With sclerotherapy {{there is a possibility}} of vessels recanalising after treatment. Compression therapy has poor compliance because of the difficulty of wearing the stocking and the discomfort felt from the pressure exerted by the stocking (Palfreyman and Michaels, 2009). Herbal treatment of low venous tone includes <b>Red</b> <b>Vine</b> leaf extract, Butcher’s Broom root extract and Horse Chestnut seed extract to name a few. All three plants show positive results in ameliorating the burden of venous tone insufficiency with mild to no adverse effects; however the extracts have not been studied in combination. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of a combination complementary medicine consisting of <b>Red</b> <b>Vine</b> leaf extract, Butcher’s Broom leaf extract, Horse Chestnut root extract and Vitamin B 6 on the quality of life in females with perceived low venous tone (CEAP C 1 -C 4) using the CIVIQ- 20 questionnaire (pain, physical, social and psychological outcome measures).

The training system is Royat bilateral with vertical shoot positioning. Three different shoot densities were applied: D 1 – 23 shoots/m row, D 2 – 17 shoots/m row and D 3 – 11 shoots/m row. At veraison was also introduced another factor: leaf removal (under clusters). During the growing season several parameters were measured (leaf area, leaf water potential, leaf gas-exchanges, leaf layer number, canopy size, intercepted photosynthetically active radiation, fruit composition, yield and vigour). Basal leaf removal improved the canopy microclimate by a lower leaf layer number with positive effects on the interception of radiation at fruit zone, inferior percentage of interior leaves and clusters. On shoot density, it was verified that the D 2 presented the best conditions of canopy microclimate. Yield was positively influenced by shoot density increase by the augment of the cluster number, while cluster weight was not affected. Leaf removal had not a significant effect on yield parameters.
