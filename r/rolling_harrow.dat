40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in 2004 in the Fucino Valley (Italy) one of the Italian most vocated areas for fennel cultivation. The aim was to test new strategies and equipments for physical weed control on organic fennel and to compare them with the weed control strategy ordinary adopted the by organic farmers of the Valley. The alternative strategies included both seed bed preparation before crop transplanting (false seedbed technique) and two different post transplanting weed control techniques based upon rolling harrowing In the first one <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow</b> was employed alone, while in the other one the <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow</b> was followed by precision hoeing. Manual weeding was applied both in traditional and in innovative control strategies. During the testing period, weed flora was monitored, fennel yield was determined at harvest. In addition both work chains characteristics and manpower use were determined. Results were quite interesting: the innovative strategies for physical weed control allowed to obtain relevant and high quality yields with a significant reduction of manpower use with respect to the organic traditional weed control system...|$|E
40|$|Cabbage is {{a common}} open-air {{vegetable}} crop in Italy (nearly 40000 ha), and although {{it is a very}} competitive species, weed management still represents a key operation during the crop cycle. One year “on-farm” experiment was carried out during 2006 - 2007 season by the MAMA Division of DAGA Department and CIRAA “Enrico Avanzi” researches centre of the University of Pisa in cooperation with San Giuliano Terme and Vecchiano municipalities (Serchio Valley, Pisa, Central Italy). The innovative weed control strategy was performed by means of the false seedbed technique application, two precision hoeing interventions and in-row hand weeding as complementary operation. False seedbed technique was performed by the <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow</b> (a patent by the University of Pisa), while hoeing passes were carried out with the “hoe conformed” <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow</b> and a precision hoe, both of them equipped with hand guidance systems and elastic tines for selective inrow weed control. Weed density, weed biomass at harvest, crop fresh yield, innovative operative machines performances and economic parameters were assessed during the experiment. The two compared weed management systems gave very similar results concerning with all the parameters involved in 2006. Another year of experiment was carried out from the autumn of 2008.

40|$|The <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow</b> was {{developed}} and patented at the MAMA of DAGA of the University of Pisa during 2003 and 2004. The new harrow is equipped with spike discs placed at the front and gage rolls mounted at the rear. The spike discs and gage rolls are each placed on horizontal axles and are connected to one another by a chain drive with a ratio equal to 2. Thus, the rolls work with a peripheral speed {{twice as high as}} that of the discs. The discs and the rolls can be placed differently on the axles: (1) close arrangement in order to make non-selective pre-emergence mechanical weed control (false seedbed technique); (2) spaced arrangement with the aim to make selective post-emergence inter-row weeding. The action of the <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow</b> is characterised by the passage of the spike discs (that till the top 3 - 4 cm of the soil) followed by the passage of the gage rolls that work at a higher peripheral speed whereby the 1 - 2 cm top soil is tilled and crumbled. Thus, it is possible to kill those weed seedlings that are included and protected by small lumps that are normally left on the soil after common mechanical weed control on crusty wet and plastic soils. The machine was tested in some organic vegetable crops with very good results. The working width can be varied from 1 m and up to 18 m for pre-emergence control. For post-emergence treatments, the implement can be adjusted to different inter-row width ranging from 15 cm and up to 90 cm. Moreover, the implement can be equipped with pairs of elastic tines with the aim to control weeds also in the rows...|$|E
40|$|Weed {{control is}} one of the most serious {{problems}} in vegetable crops limiting yields. Therefore, the aim of this work was to set up and improve innovative strategies and machines for physical weed control in organic or “integrated” vegetable crops cultivated in five important areas of Central and Southern Italy. Experimental on-farm trials were carried out on fresh marketable spinach, processing and fresh market tomato, cauliflower, savoy cabbage, potato, greenhouse cultivated leaf beet, garlic, chicory, fennel and carrot. The traditional farm weed management system was always compared to an innovative system. The innovative strategy was the combination among preventive methods (false or stale seed-bed technique), cultural methods (crop spatial arrangement adjusted in order to improve machinery effectiveness) and direct control methods (flaming, hoeing, etc.). Different kinds of flex tine and <b>rolling</b> <b>harrows</b> (patented by the University of Pisa) and flamers were used for false or stale seed-bed technique. Precision hoes and hoe-conformed <b>rolling</b> <b>harrows,</b> equipped with elastic tines for selective in-row weed control, were used for post emergence interventions. The innovative weed management systems always resulted in significant weed abundance reductions (from 70 to 100 %), relevant yield increases (from 10 to 100 %) and high contractions of manpower requirement (from 20 to 80 %) compared to the standard systems. The results of these on-farm experimental trials emphasise that physical weed control can be effectively performed using the innovative machines built at the University of Pisa. These machines can also be easily adjusted for use in other crops and agricultural contexts...|$|R
40|$|Weed {{control is}} one of the most serious {{problems}} in vegetable crops, limiting cultivated plants correct development, yields, product quality and farmers income. Therefore, the aim of this work was to set up and improve innovative strategies and machines for physical (mechanical and thermal) weed control in organic or “integrated” vegetables production in many important areas of Northern, Central and Southern Italy. Therefore, on-farm experiments were carried out since 1999 on fresh marketable spinach, processing and fresh market tomato, cauliflower, savoy cabbage, greenhouse cultivated leaf beet, garlic, chicory, fennel and carrot. These research activities started are still ongoing. The traditional farm weed management system was always compared to one or more innovative strategies that were defined according to the characteristics of the environment (i. e. soil type and conditions, water availability, etc.), typology of cultivation, crop rotation, expected technical and economical results. The innovative strategies were the combination among preventive methods (false or stale seed-bed technique), cultural methods (i. e. crop spatial arrangement that was often adjusted in order to improve operative machines effectiveness) and direct control methods (flaming, precision hoeing, etc.). Different kinds of specific implement such as flex tine and <b>rolling</b> <b>harrows</b> (patented by the University of Pisa, patent n.

Furthermore, the innovative crop and weed management systems reduced the costs for hand weeding and increased gross income...|$|E
40|$|A {{two years}} field {{experiment}} (2004 - 2005) {{was carried out}} in the Fucino Valley. The aim was to compare different strategies for physical weed control in organic chicory. Chicory is the second most important vegetable crop of the area after carrot. The physical weed control strategy included the stale seed-bed technique before crop transplanting and one or more mechanical and manual interventions after transplanting. Three different operative machines two meters wide were adopted for false seed-bed technique: a <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow,</b> a flame weeder and a spring tine harrow. A conventional hoe or a specific innovative precision hoe with six units (45 cm of inter-row) were used to perform both inter-row and intra-row (by means of torsion weeders) weed control. During the testing period weed flora (density and biomass) was monitored and chicory yield was recorded. In addition, work chains characteristics and manpower use were determined. The results were quite interesting and stressed the chicory high quality yield, under the different physical weed control strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|Dairy and {{livestock}} farmers face considerable {{economic and environmental}} challenges as they prepare for the future. Over {{the last several years}} many farmers have adopted low-disturbance tillage and soil conservation practices that improve profitability and protect the environment. A modified no-till system with a <b>rolling</b> tine <b>harrow</b> suitable for use on dairy {{and livestock}} farms reduced machinery costs 25 %, fuel costs 45 %, and labor costs 50 %, compared with a conventional tillage and planting system (Harrigan et al., 1996). Cropping systems that reduce tillage intensity and increase the use of cover crops improve soil quality and protect the environment in many ways. Even small amounts of crop residue reduce soil erosion, and no-till systems are associated with the least runoff. However, manure use is a challenge in no-till crop-ping systems. There is a need for cropping and manure management options that stabilize soil and prevent overland flow of sedi-ment, nutrients, and contaminants. Such options will retain manure in the root zone for nutrient use in the following crop and remediation of pathogens. Cover crops have not been used widely in livestock-based cropping systems because establishment costs, competition for labor and added manage-ment needs have discouraged their use. Because cover crops are an effective barrier to overland flow, sedimentation, and manure contamination of waterways, interest in the use of cover crops is increasing. This article describes on-going work at Michigan State University in combining seeding, manure land application, and aeration tillage in one sustainable, efficient, and environ-mentally sensitive operation (Figure 1) ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1994, three series of field trials on row hoeing were carried out in cereals. The results of {{two of them are}} shown in this paper. The trials are part in a several years' project aiming to develop {{improved}} methods of mechanical weed control The implements used were a rotary hoe equipped with powered hoe wheels, L-shaped shares and duck-foot shares, and a <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow.</b> In the R 2 - 6109 series, row hoeing was studied in winter wheat. The purpose of the trials was to investigate the function of the rotary hoe at normal row spacing, i. e. 12, 5 cm. Row hoeing was also carried out at 25 cm row spacing and L-shaped shares were tested too. The treatments were compared with untreated and chemical treatments. In the R 2 - 6114 series, row hoeing at three different row spacing in spring barley were studied, i. e. 12, 5 cm, 17 cm and 25 cm. The implements used were a rotary hoe, L-shaped shares and duck-foot shares. The treatments were compared with untreated and chemical treatments. In the R 2 - 6109 series hoeing with a rotary hoe repeated twice at 12, 5 cm row spacing resulted in the highest yield. The effect on the weight of the weeds was also good. Galeopsis spp and Polygonum aviculare were the most difficult species to control In the R 2 - 6114 series, treatment with a <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow</b> combined with rotary hoe wheels at 25 cm row spacing had the best effect on the weight of the weeds. The yield was the same as for treatments with rotary hoe. Galeopsis spp, Stellaria media and Polygonum convolvolus were the most difficult species to control The conc 1 usions of the trials are: • Row hoeing at normal (12, 5 cm) row spacing in winter wheat in this year' s trials worked out good considering the effect on weeds and yield. This can be of practical importance since a normal row spacing makes mechanical weed control adjusted to the need possible. • The sensitivity of the weeds to row hoeing in spring barley was in the following order, beginning with the highest sensitivity: Chenopodium album, Polygonum convolvulus, oil plants, Stellaria media and Galeopsis spp. • The sensitivity of the weeds to row hoeing in winter wheat was in the following order, beginning with the highest sensitivity: Chenopodium album, Matricaria inodora, Galeopsis spp. and Polygonum aviculare. • More research and field trials have to be done. It is desirable to evaluate row hoeing in a complete cultivating system where the soil management is taken into consideration...|$|E
40|$|Weed {{control is}} often a major {{limitation}} for vegetable crops, since compared to arable crops fewer herbicides are available and the crops are more sensitive to weeds. Field experiments were {{carried out in the}} province of Pisa (Central Italy) to determine the effect of two different mulches (black biodegradable plastic film and wheat straw) and mechanical and thermal treatments on weed population and yield of rain-fed fresh market tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). <b>Rolling</b> <b>harrow,</b> flaming machine and precision hoe for weed control, which were either built, enhanced or modified by the University of Pisa were used separately (mechanical-thermal strategy) or in combination with a straw mulch (mechanical-thermal-straw strategy).

The strategies were compared in terms of machine performance, weed density, total labour requirement, weed dry biomass, and crop fresh yield at harvest. The total operative time for weed control was on average ~ 25 h ha- 1 for the two systems, which included mulching, and over 30 h ha- 1 for the mechanical-thermal strategy.

40|$|Fresh-market tomato {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} Italian open-field vegetable cultivation, involving over than 23000 ha. A three year on-farm experimental trial (2006 - 2008) was carried out by the MAMA Division of DAGA Department and CIRAA “Enrico Avanzi” research centre of the University of Pisa in cooperation with San Giuliano Terme and Vecchiano municipalities (Serchio Valley, Pisa, Central Italy). The experiment was run in two different “pilot” integrated farms (the first one in 2006 and 2008 and the second one in 2007) placed in the Serchio Valley. Tomato was transplanted following a single row space arrangement. Crop density was about 10000 plants ha- 1 (1, 5 m x 0, 7 m). Crop was not irrigated. The aim of the research was to compare three different non-chemical weed control methods: 1) biodegradable black plastic mulching film; 2) physical weed control on bare soil; 3) physical weed control plus straw dead mulch (only during 2007 and 2008). Biodegradable plastic mulch was placed just before crop transplanting. In this case just few hand weeding interventions were performed in addiction. No false or stale seedbed technique was carried out. This is the developing ordinary cultivation technique adopted in the area. Physical wed control on bare soil was performed with innovative operative machines built by the University of Pisa. Stale-seedbed technique was covered at by means of the <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow</b> (a patent of the University of Pisa) and an open flame operative machine before crop transplanting. Hoeing interventions were carried out with a precision hoe and the hoe conformed <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow,</b> both of them equipped with a hand guidance system and elastic tines for selective in-row weed control. In-row hand weeding was also performed when necessary. The third method consisted in the use of straw dead mulch together with the physical weed control strategy previously described. The straw mulch was placed just after the last hoeing intervention in 2007 and after crop transplanting in 2008. The purpose of the straw mulch use was to increase weed control effectiveness and water supply for the crop. Weed density, weed dry biomass at harvest, fruit fresh yield, operative machine performances and economic parameters were assessed. During the first year of experiment, the use of plastic biodegradable mulch allowed to reach high yields and lower weed dry biomass values at harvest with respect to the physical weed control method applied to bare soil. In 2007 the use of the straw mulch allowed to reach similar yield and economical parameters with respect to the biodegradable plastic mulch utilization, while physical weed control methods applied to bare soil gave again worse results.

40|$|Tomato {{is a very}} {{important}} vegetable crop in Italy. Improving the means of production for processing organic tomatoes could help guarantee better profits for farmers and, at the same time, enhance environmental management and safeguard consumers’ health. Weed control, in particular within crop rows, {{is one of the main}} problems in organic farming, and thus also for the organic cultivation of tomato. The aim of this study was to develop innovative strategies and equipment for effective physical weed control in processing tomatoes. A conventional weed management system incorporating herbicides was compared with an alternative system relying exclusively on physical control during three growing seasons (2006 – 2008) on a farm located near Pisa, Italy. The crop was transplanted mechanically onto paired rows. The conventional strategy consisted of three different chemical treatments, two post-transplanting PTO-powered rotary hoe passes and several hand-weeding treatments on the paired rows. The alternative system included a stale seedbed technique (performed by a <b>rolling</b> <b>harrow</b> pass and one flaming treatment), two post-transplanting precision hoeing treatments and several hand-weeding treatments. All the machines for the alternative system were adjusted and set up for processing tomatoes transplanted in paired rows. Each physical treatment (mechanical and thermal) within the alternative system allowed an ‘instantaneous’ (just before/just after) weed control from 50 to 100 %, while the alternative strategy as a whole achieved values of weed dry biomass at harvest ranging from 22 to 126 gm- 2. However, the alternative system required a total labor input that averaged 50 % higher than the conventional strategy. The conventional system had on average more effective weed control than the alternative system, but both strategies controlled weeds effectively. Weed biomass at harvest averaged 36 and 68 gm- 2 for conventional and alternative strategies, respectively. On the other hand, the alternative system generally led to a significant increase in fresh crop yield (+ 13 % average yield for the 3 years) ...|$|E
