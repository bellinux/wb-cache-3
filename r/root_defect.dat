Joining of thermoplastics in friction stir welding {{which is based on}} frictional heat generated through contact between a rotating tool and the work piece.

In friction stir welding of thermoplastics, traditional tools form a slit on the backside of welded specimen which leads to <b>root</b> <b>defect</b> causes poor tensile strength. Due to the high transparency of this polymer, it was to possible to analyse easily the morphological changes induced by the welding process on it. In this investigation the welding parameters studied were the tool rotation speed which varied between 800 and 1200 (rpm), transverse speed which varied between 40 and 200 (mm/min), axial force ranging from 1 to 5 (KN). An attempt was made to join the polypropylene plate of 5 mm thickness with different tool profiles (square, cylindrical and triangular threaded pin profile).

40|$|Abstract. Prosthetic {{rehabilitation}} of endodontically treated teeth usually requires {{the use of}} an endodontic post and coronal core to enhance artificial crown retention. In cases of flared canals, the weakened remaining dentin walls have to be reconstructed prior to post insertion in order to increase post retention and root strength. The use of adhesive composite resin restorative materials is usually recommended. Based on the mechanical resistive properties of dentin and restorative materials found in the literature, this study describes a numerical predictive analysis of crack propagation which may lead to fracture after root reconstruction. A 3 D finite element model of a maxillary central incisor restored with a glass fiber post/composite core/crown system was constructed. The root canal walls were thinned to simulate a <b>root</b> <b>defect</b> filled by adhesive composite resin. A 100 N oblique load was applied to the crown lingual surface, simulating normal mastication. The possibility of crack formation followed by dentin root wall fracture or disruption of the cement layer was investigated. A scalar damage model based on the maximum principal stress criterion was used to predict crack propagation. The parameters of the constitutive model were the elastic properties, the tensile strength and the fracture energy of the material...|$|E
40|$|Coordination {{between the}} Hertwig’s {{epithelial}} root sheath (HERS) and apical papilla (AP) {{is crucial for}} proper tooth root development. The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and Nfic are both involved in tooth root development; however, their relationship {{has yet to be}} elucidated. Here, we establish a timecourse of mouse molar root development by histological staining of sections, and we demonstrate that Hh signaling is active before and during root development in the AP and HERS using Gli 1 reporter mice. The proper pattern of Hh signaling activity in the AP is crucial for the proliferation of dental mesenchymal cells, because either inhibition with Hh inhibitors or constitutive activation of Hh signaling activity in transgenic mice leads to decreased proliferation in the AP and shorter roots. Moreover, Hh activity is elevated in Nfic−/−mice, a <b>root</b> <b>defect</b> model, whereas RNA sequencing and in situ hybridization show that the Hh attenuatorHhip is downregulated. ChIP and RNAscope analyses suggest that Nfic binds to the promoter region of Hhip. Treatment of Nfic−/ − mice with Hh inhibitor partially restores cell proliferation, AP growth and root development. Taken together, our results demonstrate that an Nfic-Hhip-Hh signaling pathway is crucial for apical papilla growth and proper root formation. This discovery provides insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating tooth root development...|$|E
40|$|XBAT 32, {{a member}} of the RING domain-containing ankyrin repeat {{subfamily}} of E 3 ligases, was previously identified as a positive regulator of lateral root development. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants harboring a mutation in XBAT 32 produce fewer lateral roots that wild-type plants. We found that xbat 32 mutants produce significantly more ethylene than wild-type plants and that inhibition of ethylene biosynthesis or perception significantly increased xbat 32 lateral root production. XBAT 32 interacts with the ethylene biosynthesis enzymes AMINOCYCLOPROPANE- 1 -CARBOXYLIC ACID SYNTHASE 4 (ACS 4) and ACS 7 in yeast-two-hybrid assays. XBAT 32 is capable of catalyzing the attachment of ubiquitin to both ACS 4 and ACS 7 in in vitro ubiquitination assays. These results suggest that XBAT 32 negatively regulates ethylene biosynthesis by modulating the abundance of ACS proteins. Loss of XBAT 32 may promote the stabilization of ACSs and lead to increased ethylene synthesis and suppression of lateral root formation. XBAT 32 may also contribute to the broader hormonal cross talk that influences lateral root development. While auxin treatments only partially rescue the lateral <b>root</b> <b>defect</b> of xbat 32, they completely restore wild-type levels of xbat 32 lateral root production when coupled with ethylene inhibition. Abscisic acid, an antagonist of ethylene synthesis/signaling, was also found to stimulate rather than inhibit xbat 32 lateral root formation, and abscisic acid acts synergistically with auxin to promote xbat 32 lateral root production...|$|E
40|$|Squalene {{epoxidase}} enzymes catalyse {{the conversion}} of squalene into 2, 3 -oxidosqualene, the precursor of cyclic triterpenoids. Here we report that the Arabidopsis drought hypersensitive/squalene epoxidase 1 - 5 (dry 2 /sqe 1 - 5) mutant, identified by its extreme hypersensitivity to drought stress, has altered stomatal responses and <b>root</b> <b>defects</b> because of a point mutation in the SQUALENE EPOXIDASE 1 (SQE 1) gene. GC-MS analysis indicated that the dry 2 /sqe 1 - 5 mutant has altered sterol composition in roots but wild-type sterol composition in shoots, indicating an essential role for SQE 1 in root sterol biosynthesis. Importantly, the stomatal and <b>root</b> <b>defects</b> of the dry 2 /sqe 1 - 5 mutant are associated with altered production of reactive oxygen species. As RHD 2 NADPH oxidase is de-localized in dry 2 /sqe 1 - 5 root hairs, we propose that sterols play {{an essential role in}} the localization of NADPH oxidases required for regulation of reactive oxygen species, stomatal responses and drought tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Folylpolyglutamate {{synthetase}} (FPGS) catalyzes {{the attachment}} of glutamate residues to the folate molecule in plants. Three isoforms of FPGS {{have been identified}} in Arabidopsis and these are localized in the plastid (AtDFB), mitochondria (AtDFC) and cytosol (AtDFD). We recently determined that mutants in the AtDFB (At 5 G 05980) gene disrupt primary root development in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Transient expression of AtDFB-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion {{under the control of the}} native AtDFB promoter in Nicotiana tabacum leaf epidermal cells verified the plastid localization of AtDFB. Furthermore, low concentrations of methotrexate (MTX), a compound commonly used as a folate antagonist in plant and mammalian cells induced primary <b>root</b> <b>defects</b> in wild type seedlings that were similar to atdfb. In addition, atdfb seedlings were more sensitive to MTX when compared to wild type. Quantitative (q) RT-PCR showed lower transcript levels of the mitochondrial and cytosolic FPGS in roots of 7 -day-old atdfb seedling suggesting feedback regulation of AtDFB on the expression of other FPGS isoforms during early seedling development. The primary <b>root</b> <b>defects</b> of atdfb, which can be traced in part to altered quiescent center (QC) identity, pave the way for future studies that could link cell type specific folate and FPGS isoform requirements to whole organ development...|$|R

40|$|Periodontitis is an {{inflammatory}} disease affecting {{the support of}} the teeth, eventually leading to loosening and subsequent loss of teeth. Effective procedures for periodontal tissue engineering or regeneration require preclinical models before market introduction. Research has been performed in either small or large animals. Unfortunately, there is no intermediate-sized in vivo model available for periodontal regeneration studies, such as, for instance, rabbits. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the rabbit as a new experimental model to study periodontal regeneration. In 12 rabbits, periodontal defects were created in a 4 × 6 mm bone window. The animals were sacrificed after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks. Up to 6 weeks, the fenestration defects healed partly by repair and partly by regeneration. After 6 weeks the root had erupted to such an extent that the original <b>root</b> <b>defect</b> shifted into the oral cavity. This signifies that the periodontal ligament (PDL) bordering the original bone defect site is newly formed during the natural eruption process and not locally regenerated. Apparently, the new PDL originates from mesenchymal cells that arise from the apical part (sheath of Hertwig) and subsequently developed into PDL fibroblasts. At 12 weeks, no signs of surgery were present anymore. On the basis of our observation that the defect of the PDL was replaced rather than restored, we conclude that the rabbit model has disadvantages and is less suitable for studies of regeneration of PDL...|$|E

The capacity of the canister is 12 assemblies of BWR or VVER 440 fuel and 4 assemblies of EPR fuel. The canister shall be tight with a high probability for at least 100 000 years.

40|$|Background: Dentoalveolar {{ankylosis}} {{may occur}} spontaneously or as a sequela to dental trauma {{and results in}} an area of bone fusing to the tooth (Kurol 1981). Infra-occlusion following dentoalveolar ankylosis results in a number of significant orthodontic sequelae. These include overeruption of the opposing tooth, tipping of adjacent teeth towards the ankylosed tooth, a loss of arch length, space loss and a shift of the dental midline (Messer and Cline 1980; Andlaw 1974; Ponduri et al. 2009). Vertical alveolar growth may also be hindered (Kjaer et al. 2008). The understanding of the biological processes behind the formation and repair of the ankylotic lesion is incomplete. Following dental trauma, the periodontal ligament (PDL) may be the source of the cells that repopulate a tooth <b>root</b> <b>defect</b> that determine whether ankylosis occurs (Erausquin and Devoto 1970; Lin et al. 2000; Melcher 1970; Line et al. 1974). When the PDL space is repopulated by cells from a source outside the true PDL tissues (such as the alveolar bone) healing may occur by way of dentoalveolar ankylosis. Research in the field of bone biology has recently focused {{on the role of the}} osteocyte. This cell, with its unique location embedded in bone, may have an essential role in bone metabolism. Osteocytes produce sclerostin, a protein that inhibits bone formation. There is also evidence that the osteocyte may be a major source of receptor activator of NF-κβ (RANKL) which is essential for osteoclastogenesis. This project aims to investigate the expression of RANKL and sclerostin in a rat model of dentoalveolar ankylosis induced by a hypothermal insult. The null hypothesis is that an applied cold insult and subsequent ankylosis does not affect the expression of RANKL and sclerostin within the dentoalveolar complex. Methods: Dentoalveolar ankylosis was induced in fifteen, eight week old, male, Sprague-Dawley rats (5 groups of 3 rats each) by application of dry ice to the upper right first molar tooth. An additional 3 rats served as untreated controls and the experimental rats were sacrificed at days 0, 4, 7, 14 and 28. Immunohistochemical detection of RANKL and sclerostin was performed and the number of RANKL and sclerostin positive and negative cells as well as the number of empty lacunae representing dead osteocytes were calculated and compared between groups. Results: The cold insult resulted in dentoalveolar ankylosis, with the periodontal ligament (PDL) almost completely replaced by bone in the furcation region of the root 14 days after injury with regeneration of the PDL evident after 28 days. Resorption of the ankylotic bone and cementum was evident in the furcation region. There was also a statistically significant increase in the number of empty lacunae due to osteocyte death that coincides with the incidence of maximal ankylosis. RANKL was detected in bone marrow stromal cells, osteoblasts and bone lining cells, osteoclasts, endothelial-like cells lining vessels, epithelial cells, odontoblasts and periodontal fibroblasts. However, clear staining in osteocytes was not evident. Epithelial rests of Malassez showed strong expression of RANKL. When ankylosis was present, there was a statistically significant difference in sclerostin expression between the areas of bone closest to, and farthest away, from the furcation area. There was a non-statistically significant trend towards reduced sclerostin expression at days 7 and 14 followed by a slight increase in expression at day 28. The slight increase in sclerostin expression at day 28 may indicate the establishment of a healing response. In considering these results, it should be noted that this experiment uses a model of ankylosis in which the ankylotic lesion develops following a thermal insult. The factors that initiate ankylosis in a clinical situation are incompletely understood and may differ from this model. Conclusions: Whilst RANKL was not detected in osteocytes in this model of ankyloses there was strong expression of RANKL by ERM in the PDL and a significant change in sclerostin expression near the area of ankylosis. This may contribute evidence that RANKL, sclerostin and the osteocyte might have a role in influencing the regeneration of the PDL following dentoalveolar ankylosis. The null hypothesis that an applied cold insult and subsequent ankylosis does not affect the expression of RANKL and sclerostin within the dentoalveolar complex is rejected. Thesis (D. Clin. Dent.)

A continuous distribution in phenotypes suggests quantitative trait loci (QTL) controls underneath. Primary mapping on a F 2 population revealed two major QTLs, qPN 1 and qPN 11, with epistatic interactions on each other. When both qPN 1 alleles are from TNG 67, allele of qPN 11 from SA 1613. 1 acts dominantly and generates rootless plant with tiny single tiller, abbreviated as “rolts”. Since qPN 1 {{was found to}} be very close to the centromere of chromosome 1, qPN 11 was chosen as the major target for fine-mapping in this study. To do fine mapping on qPN 11 that confer rolts phenotype, a BC 2 F 6 line was established as a backcross recombinant inbred line (BRIL). In the selected BC 2 F 6 line, only the qPN 1 and qPN 11 loci remained heterozygous while homozygous as TNG 67 throughout the genome. Therefore any phenotypic changes in its selfed progenies must be caused by segregation of qPN 1 and/or qPN 11 but not interfered by other loci. Using 811 BC 2 F 7 progenies as the mapping population, candidate region for qPN 11 was narrowed down to be within InDel markers D 32693 and I 33724 A. The theoretical interval between these two markers is 1661 Kb in the Japonia genome with 232 predicted ORFs. RNA-Seq analysis on roots of 5 DAG seedlings were employed to identify genes that located within the candidate region and showed differential expressions between normal [T,T] and rolts[T,S] plants (the symbols before and after comma represent qPN 1 and qPN 11 allele, respectively). Hydroponic culture of rolts seedlings revealed an early symptom five days after germination. Compared with normal plants, rolts seedlings exhibited a short seminal root, very few lateral root, and absence of adventitious root (crown root). Confocal microscopic studies on the seminal root of rolts seedlings revealed absence of long cells in its elongation region and irregular cell walls all over the root cells. This result suggests that rolts mutation may disturb cell elongation and cell wall biogenesis. As symptom of <b>root</b> <b>defect</b> in rolts can be lessened by providing 1 % sucrose, indicates that function of rolts can be modulated by nutrition. Moreover, rolts plant is less responsive to exogenous auxin, implicates a defect in auxin signaling pathway.

40|$|An {{intriguing}} and long-standing {{question in}} developmental biology is how plant cells {{communicate with each}} other and sense signals from their surrounding environment. Through research over past decades, it became clear that plant cells use membrane-localized receptors to perceive signals from their environment, which subsequently results in the initiation of downstream signaling (Kobe and Kajava, 2001; Torii, 2005). The membrane-associated receptors often form in multimeric complexes that contain receptor-like proteins (RLP) (Song et al., 1997; Jeong et al., 1999; Fritz-Laylin et al., 2005) as well as receptor-like kinase (RLK) proteins (Shiu and Bleecker, 2001 a; 2001 b). This is the case {{for the development of the}} shoot apical meristem (SAM) involving the CLAVATA 1 (CLV 1) and CLAVATA 2 (CLV 2) receptor molecules, as well as a small secreted polypeptide CLAVATA 3 (CLV 3) (Clark et al., 1993; Clark et al., 1995; Clark et al., 1997; Kayes and Clark, 1998; Fletcher et al., 1999; Jeong et al., 1999; Brand et al., 2000; Schoof et al., 2000). The Arabidopsis gene CLV 2 encodes an LRR RLP acting in a functional CLV receptor complex that is involved in restricting the size of shoot meristem (Jeong et al., 1999). A total of 57 AtRLPs, which share sequence similarity and domain composition, have been identified in the Arabidopsis genome (Wang et al., 2008). However, the function of most AtRLPs remains elusive despite a genome-wide functional study into the roles of AtRLPs has been carried out recently (Wang et al., 2008). Given that fact that many AtRLPs originated from duplication events (Fritz-Laylin et al., 2005), it is very likely that the lack of identification of biological functions for AtRLP genes may be explained by functional redundancy, a phenomenon that typically obscures studies employing a reverse genetics strategy, as has been described for many RLK gene family members (Cano-Delgado et al., 2004; Shpak et al., 2004; Albrecht et al., 2005; DeYoung et al., 2006; Hord et al., 2006). In the future, RNA interference (RNAi) or artificial microRNA (amiRNA) approaches to target the expression of multiple AtRLP genes simultaneously could be followed to circumvent the functional redundancy (Chuang and Meyerowitz, 2000; Miki and Shimamoto, 2005; Ellendorff et al., 2008; Ossowksi et al., 2008). Alternatively, these multiple mutants of closely related AtRLP genes or potential co-expressed AtRLP genes should be combined to reveal the function of these genes. The clv 2 mutant displays weaker, although similar phenotypes as clv 1 and clv 3 mutants (Kayes and Clark, 1998; Diévart et al., 2003; Chapters 2; 3. 1), while loss-of-function mutants of clv 3 are phenotypically stronger than clv 1 or clv 2 null mutants (Fletcher et al., 1999; Kayes and Clark, 1998; Dievart et al., 2003). In addition, CLV 2 has a broader expression pattern, which may suggest a wider role for CLV 2 in more developmental processes than only meristem development (Kayes and Clarks, 1998; Chapters 2; 3. 1). Besides the broader role of CLV 2, it is interesting to note that clv 2 mutations, similar to clv 1 mutations, are significantly affected by natural variation (Diévart et al., 2003; Chapters 3. 1; 5), as has also been shown for the strubbelig (sub) and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (bri 1) mutants (Chevalier et al., 2005; Cano-Delgado et al., 2004). The phenotype of clv 2 in Col- 0 (atrlp 10) is also significantly enhanced by introduction into Ler background. Although our genetic interaction experiments indicated that the effect does not depend on the ER locus (Chapter 3. 1), our observations imply that (a) CLV 1 /CLV 2 -modifying factor(s) exist(s) to co-regulate meristem development (Diévart et al., 2003; Chapters 3. 1; 5). It would be interesting to identify these co-factor(s) in the future. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for CLV 2 in root development. Over-expression of CLV 3, CLE 19 and CLE 40 leads to an arrest of root growth (Casamitjana-Martinez et al., 2003; Hobe et al., 2003; Fiers et al., 2004), while the clv 2 mutant can suppress the short-root phenotype caused by ectopic expression of CLE 19 (Fiers et al., 2005). In addition, clv 2 failed to respond to exogenously supplied synthetic CLE peptide, which corresponds to the conserved CLE motif of the CLV 3 /ESR gene family (Fiers et al., 2005; Ito et al., 2006; Kondo et al., 2006), indicating that CLV 2 is able to perceive the CLE ligands in the root. However, the clv 2 mutant exhibits no visible root phenotype under normal growth conditions, suggesting that a redundant protein, most likely another AtRLP gene, compensates for the loss of CLV 2 function in the root. We found that only a few AtRLP genes are expressed in the root, although their expression is quite low (Chapters 2; 3. 1). Possibly, a <b>root</b> <b>defect</b> only will become apparent in combination of multiple mutants for these genes. This observation argues that a CLV-like pathway also operates in roots (Fiers et al., 2007), but no RLK involved in this process has been found, although some of the RLKs that are expressed in the root (Birnbaum et al., 2003; Nawy et al., 2005). As such, CORYNE/Suppressor of overexpression of LLP- 2 (CRN/SOL 2) and Barely Any Meristem 1 - 3 (BAM 1 - 3) might be the logical RLK candidates for the redundant role in root development, because of their pronounced expression in roots (DeYoung et al., 2006; Müller et al., 2008; Miwa et al., 2008). Specifically, like clv 2 mutants, crn/sol 2 mutants did not respond to CLE peptide treatments (Müller et al., 2008; Miwa et al., 2008), suggesting that CRN, like CLV 2, is involved in transmitting CLE signals. Therefore, studies with different combinations of mutants of these genes will help to clarify their biological function in root development (Chapter 2; 3. 1; 4). Interestingly, WOX 5, a homologue of WUS, marks the root Quiescent Centre (QC) identity and is expressed very early in the hypophysial cell (Sarkar et al., 2007), which is strikingly similar to the role of WUS in the shoot meristem (Haecker et al., 2004; Sarkar et al., 2007). Furthermore, it has been shown recently that POL and PLL, in addition to their role in Arabidopsis SAM maintenance (Song and Clark, 2005; Song et al., 2006), also act in the root meristem development through regulating the expression of the WUS homolog WOX 5 (Song et al., 2008). These findings strengthen the hypothesis that a CLV-like pathway exists in the root meristem, which might include CLV 2, CRN, WOX 5, POL and PLL 1. Similarly, our results as well as previous reports (Song and Clark, 2005; DeYoung et al., 2006; Müller et al., 2008) suggest that a CLV-related signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of leaf shape/size (Chapter 3. 1) and pedicel length (Chapter 5). Interestingly, all these developmental pathways share some conserved factors such as POL and PLL, indicating common regulatory mechanisms exist in the developmental regulation of SAM, root meristem, leaf shape/size and pedicel growth. We provide evidence that two CLV 2 -related AtRLPs, AtRLP 2 and AtRLP 12, were capable to rescue clv 2 mutants when expressed under the control of the CLV 2 promoter (Chapter 4), suggesting that functional specification of these two AtRLPs may reside, at least in part, in their cis-regulatory elements. The importance of variation in expression pattern for the specificity in function of closely-related genes from multi-gene families while the proteins are interchangeable, has been documented for many genes such as the CLV 1 -like genes (BAM 1 - 3, DeYoung et al., 2006; Hord et al., 2006), ERECTA-family (ER and ERL 1 - 2, Shapk et al., 2004) and BRL-family members (BRI 1, BRL 1 and BRL 3; Cano-Delgado et al., 2004). However, the double mutant combinations of atrlp 2 and atrlp 12 mutants with atrlp 10 /clv 2 did not show additive effects on growth of meristems and other organs when compared to that of the atrlp 10 /clv 2 mutant, suggesting that other AtRLPs, such as AtRLP 3 and AtRLP 11 that are duplication counterparts of AtRLP 2 and AtRLP 12 respectively, can also replace the function of CLV 2 in the regulation of the meristem development (Chapter 4). Therefore, additional phenotypes and the role of other AtRLP family members will become apparent only in the absence of the entire CLV 2 close-related members as has been shown for ER, ERL 1 and ERL 2 (Shpak et al., 2004). Our studies in Chapter 4 revealed that several members of the AtRLP family can replace each other and are functionally equivalent. However, there are also family members with a similar protein domain organization, but that are clearly distinct from CLV 2. This raised the question what determines the specificity in these proteins. We determined the function of the different domains by deletion analysis and generation of hybrid molecules (Chapter 4). CLV 2 is still fully functional when the island domain is removed, while the C 3 -F region can be replaced by a close homologue (Chapter 4). Taken together, this study provided valuable information on the function of CLV 2 domains that contribute to functional specificity and conservation. Despite these findings, little is known about the roles and specificity of other CLV 2 domains, such as the transmembrane domain which is proposed to be the site for dimerization between CLV 2 and CRN/SOL 2 (Müller et al., 2008; Miwa et al., 2008). Of particular interest for future investigations are conserved residues flanking the LRR domain, which could be mutated to determine whether they are essential for CLV 2 activity (Fritz-Laylin et al., 2005; van der Hoorn et al., 2005; Chapters 1; 3. 1; 4). Previous studies proposed that CLV 2 dimerizes with CLV 1 to form an active receptor complex that binds the CLV 3 ligand and initiates the downstream signaling pathway required for the maintenance of the stem cell population in the shoot apical meristem (Jeong et al. 1999; Trotochaud et al., 1999; Rojo et al., 2002; Dievart and Clark, 2004). The CLV 2 protein was regarded as a stabilizer for the CLV 1 protein based on the observation that CLV 1 protein levels were reported to be reduced by over 90 % in clv 2 loss-of-function mutants (Jeong et al., 1999). In addition to CLV 1, the receptor kinase CRN/SOL 2 acts closely together with CLV 2 to transmit the CLV 3 signal independently but in parallel with CLV 1 (Müller et al., 2008; Miwa et al., 2008). CRN/SOL 2 has a kinase domain which might create a fully functional transmembrane receptor kinase together with CLV 2 through dimerization in the transmembrane domains (Müller et al., 2008). This raises the hypothesis that CLV 3 could bind CLV 2 directly. However, whether CLV 3 peptide can directly bind to the extracelluar domain of CLV 2 remains to be validated. Nevertheless, the CLV 3 signal is probably transduced through two separate receptor complexes, comprising CLV 1 /CLV 2 (or CLV 1 alone) and CRN/CLV 2 (Müller et al., 2008). Despite these observations, the role of CLV 2 in these signaling pathways remains largely unresolved. The CLV pathway is largely built on genetic data whereas direct biochemical evidence for the mode of action of the proteins involved is largely missing (Jeong et al. 1999; Trotochaud et al., 1999; Müller et al., 2008). Only very recently, it has been shown that the CLV 3 peptide directly binds to the CLV 1 ectodomain (Ogawa et al., 2008). In an effort to understand the physical interactions of the CLV proteins and their localization, we created fluorescently tagged versions of CLV 1 and CLV 2 (Chapter 5). These fusion proteins appeared to be targeted to the plasma membrane, displaying a common subcellular localization (Chapter 5). The functionality of the fusion proteins was confirmed by complementation of the respective mutants (Chapter 5). It has been postulated that the CLV 1 /CLV 2 receptor complex resides in the plasma membrane to perceive the CLV 3 ligand (Jeong et al. 1999; Trotochaud et al., 1999; Diévart et al., 2003). Our localization studies support this scenario. Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine a direct interaction between CLV 1 and CLV 2 in the framework of this Ph. D study. However, it is obvious that the interaction study can be the immediate next step using the available fluorescently-tagged CLV 1 and CLV 2 proteins and the stable transgenic lines generated in this study (Chapter 5). Furthermore, the study can be extended to visualize the components of the CLV signaling complex and follow their dynamics during plant growth. Furthermore, the labelled CLV-receptors can also be used for the isolation and identification of unknown components of the CLV receptor complex. For instance, it would be interesting to investigate whether CLV 2 and CRN/SOL 2 interact directly as proposed (Müller et al., 2008; Miwa et al., 2008). Indeed, a preliminary study using a similar approach supports the interaction of CLV 2 and CRN/SOL 2 (Y-F. Zhu and C-M. Liu, personal communication). It also intrigues to determine whether the CLV 3 or other possible CLE(s) are directly interacting with the CLV 2 /CRN receptor complex. Undoubtedly, the tools generated in this study will be of great help for future experiments aiming to unravel the CLV signaling pathway...|$|E

In auxin signaling pathways, the tiny RNA molecules, i. e., microRNAs (miRNAs), show their strong potential in modulating the auxin signal transduction. Recently, we isolated a novel auxin resistant rice mutant osaxr (Oryza sativa auxin resistant) that exhibited plethoric <b>root</b> <b>defects.</b> Microarray experiments were carried out to investigate the expression patterns of both the miRNAs and the protein-coding genes in osaxr.

Auxin response elements (AuxREs) were demonstrated to be more frequently present in the promoters of auxin-related miRNAs. In our previous report, a comparative analysis of miRNA and protein-coding gene expression datasets uncovered a number of reciprocally expressed miRNA-target pairs. A feedback circuit between miRNA and auxin response factor (ARF) was then proposed. Here, we will discuss indepth some points raised in the previous report, in particular, the organ-specific expression patterns of miR 164, the feedback regulatory model between miR 167 and certain ARFs, and the potential signal interactions between auxin and nutrition or stress that are mediated by miRNAs in rice roots...|$|R

40|$|The ACT 2 gene, {{encoding}} one {{of eight}} actin isovariants in Arabidopsis, is the most strongly expressed actin gene in vegetative tissues. A search was conducted for physical defects in act 2 - 1 mutant plants to account for their reduced fitness compared with wild type in population studies. The act 2 - 1 insertion fully disrupted expression of ACT 2 RNA and significantly lowered the level of total actin protein in vegetative organs. The root hairs of the act 2 - 1 mutants were 10 % to 70 % the length of wild-type root hairs, and they bulged severely at the base. The length of the mutant root hairs and degree of bulging at the base were affected by adjusting the osmolarity and gelling agent of the growth medium. The act 2 - 1 mutant phenotypes were fully rescued by an ACT 2 genomic transgene. When the act 2 - 1 mutation was combined with another vegetative actin mutation, act 7 - 1, the resulting double mutant exhibited extensive synergistic phenotypes ranging from developmental lethality to severe dwarfism. Transgenic overexpression of the ACT 7 vegetative isovariant and ectopic expression of the ACT 1 reproductive actin isovariant also rescued the <b>root</b> hair elongation <b>defects</b> of the act 2 - 1 mutant. These results suggest normal ACT 2 gene regulation is essential to proper root hair elongation and that even minor differences may cause <b>root</b> <b>defects.</b> However, differences in the actin protein isovariant are not significant to root hair elongation, {{in sharp contrast to}} recent reports on the functional nonequivalency of plant actin isovariants.

40|$|Protophloem is a {{specialized}} vascular tissue in growing plant organs, such as root meristems. In Arabidopsis mutants with impaired primary root protophloem differentiation, brevis radix (brx) and octopus (ops), meristematic activity and consequently overall root growth are strongly reduced. Second site mutation in the protophloem-specific presumed phosphoinositide 5 -phosphatase cotyledon vascular pattern 2 (CVP 2), {{but not in}} its homolog CVP 2 -like 1 (CVL 1), partially rescues brx defects. Consistent with this finding, CVP 2 hyperactivity in a wild-type background recreates a brx phenotype. Paradoxically, however, while cvp 2 or cvl 1 single mutants display no apparent <b>root</b> <b>defects,</b> the <b>root</b> phenotype of cvp 2 cvl 1 double mutants is similar to brx or ops, although, as expected, cvp 2 cvl 1 seedlings contain more phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -biphosphate. Thus, tightly balanced phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -biphosphate levels appear essential for proper protophloem differentiation. Genetically, OPS acts downstream of phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -biphosphate levels, as cvp 2 mutation cannot rescue ops defects, whereas increased OPS dose rescues cvp 2 cvl 1 defects. Finally, all three mutants display higher density and accelerated emergence of lateral roots, which correlates with increased auxin response in the root differentiation zone. This phenotype is also created by application of peptides that suppress protophloem differentiation, clavata 3 /embryo surrounding region 26 (CLE 26) and CLE 45.

40|$|Plant {{growth and}} {{development}} of new organs depend on the continuous activity of the meristems. In the shoot, patterns of organ initiation are determined by PINFORMED (PIN) -dependent auxin distribution, while the undifferentiated state of meristem cells requires activity of KNOTTED LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) transcription factors. Cell proliferation and differentiation of the root meristem are regulated by the largely antagonistic functions of auxin and cytokinins. It has previously been shown that the transcription factor JAGGED LATERAL ORGANS (JLO), {{a member of the}} LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY DOMAIN (LBD) family, coordinates KNOX and PIN expression in the shoot and promotes root meristem growth. Here we show that JLO is required for the establishment of the root stem cell niche, where it interacts with the auxin/PLETHORA pathway. Auxin signaling involves the AUX/IAA co-repressor proteins, ARF transcription factors and F-box receptors of the TIR 1 /AFB 1 – 5 family. Because jlo mutants fail to degrade the AUX/IAA protein BODENLOS, root meristem development is inhibited. We also demonstrate that the expression levels of two auxin receptors, TIR 1 and AFB 1, are controlled by JLO dosage, and that the shoot and <b>root</b> <b>defects</b> of jlo mutants are alleviated in jlo plants expressing TIR 1 and AFB 1 from a transgene.
