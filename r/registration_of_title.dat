5000|$|<b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> Land {{transactions}} - Under British rule, {{there were}} significant changes to land ownership policies. During {{the early part of}} British rule, the policies concentrated on the provision of larger tracts of land, for plantations of cinnamon, coffee, tea, rubber and coconuts. This influenced to a large extent the changes to the traditional policies and attitudes to land. In 1840, enactment of the Crown Lands (Encroachment) Ordinance was a landmark event. Under that ordinance all waste lands in the country such as forests and chena (shifting cultivation), uncultivated and unoccupied lands were presumed to be property of the crown, unless proved otherwise. This ensured the availability of crown lands for the British investors for plantations. The first significant legislation to attempt introduction <b>of</b> <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> in Sri Lanka was enacted in 1863. It did not lead to the full <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>titles</b> as envisaged by the government of the day. Unfortunately, as a temporary measure, the government allowed the adoption <b>of</b> the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> deeds, which is still in place today and is entrenched in the laws of Sri Lanka.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} {{registration}} under the deeds registration system {{was to give}} the instrument registered [...] "priority" [...] over all instruments that are either unregistered or not registered until later. The basic difference between the deeds registration and Torrens systems is that the former involves registration of instruments while the latter involves <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E
5000|$|AND WHEREAS {{provision}} {{has been}} made by the National Land Code (Penang and Malacca Titles) Act 1963, for the introduction of a system of <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to land in the States of Penang and Malacca, for the issue of replacement titles, for the assimilation of such system to the provisions of the National Land Code, and for matters incidental thereto: ...|$|E
50|$|Apart from adjudicating cases, <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to real {{property}} {{is one of}} the Land Court's most important responsibilities. <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> under Massachusetts state law occurs when the Land Court, after having the title exhaustively searched by a Court-appointed examiner, and after due process is afforded to all interested parties, reviews and then adjudicates and decrees the state of the title. Once this process is complete, {{the current state of the}} title, as it is sequentially updated by registration of future transactions, is embodied in a certificate of title which both evidences and guarantees title, subject only to the exceptions provided by statute and matters of federal law. The initial decree of registration and the subsequent certificate of title are actions in rem. Registration is useful when title is insufficient to support a conclusion of ownership under the traditional recording system, or is clearly defective, and the putative owner desires to make the title good and marketable.|$|E
50|$|A {{mortgage}} system {{depends on}} the effective <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> property units and rights in land. The cadastre, maintained by the National Survey and Cadastre, identifies each land parcel and property unit. The identification is used by other national information systems. The Land Registration Court handles <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>titles</b> to land, mortgages and other charges. The mortgage banks grant a loan only on condition that the mortgage deed is registered, but without {{any other type of}} security. Also, a very detailed credit check isn't done on the borrower; the collateral of the loan is the property, rather than the borrower. The details of the process of setting up a mortgage loan are described in English. The Municipalities of Denmark maintain information systems, recording among others zoning, building construction details and taxable value, and the tax authorities maintain a mass appraisal system. Both latter systems are updated through compulsory abstracting <b>of</b> <b>title</b> deeds, collected through the municipalities.|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} freehold register is {{a complex}} information system that has changed extensively in the last 150 years. It began with {{a system in which}} unregistered deeds were grunted from the crown. In 1908 we saw the implementation <b>of</b> the compulsory <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> deeds in which land transfers became recorded under headings in registry books. From here there was a shift from the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> deeds to the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>titles.</b> Technology became utilized beginning with microfiche. In 2003, an E-dealing system was introduced with the online registration system for land title transactions called the Landonline. This system is not just the creation of “Surveyors and lawyers ” as it is commonly described, the IT industry has played an essential part. How often do we as industry practitioners really examine the impacts of this type of system? This year I investigated a complex Right of Way that was put in place over eighty years. This content relating to the Right of Way was affected by changes information system. These changes may affect our interpretations of the intent of the material...|$|R
50|$|Originally {{owned by}} the Crown, on 27 July 1640 the Braye du Valle was gifted, {{together}} with other flooded lands, to Sir Henry de Vic by Charles I in consideration of long service to the Crown. The <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>title</b> was delayed 25 years because of the English Civil War. This also resulted in the boundaries being formally defined and recorded.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, because <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> {{was never}} made {{compulsory}} per se, 18 per cent {{of land in}} England and Wales remained unregistered. Only if a transaction identified in the Land Registration Act 2002 section 4 took place, as under the Land Registration Act 1925, would the land be compulsorily entered on the register. This, however, included any sale, mortgage, or lease over seven years.|$|E
50|$|The National Land Code (Kanun Tanah Negara), is a Malaysian {{laws which}} enacted to amend and {{consolidate}} the laws relating {{to land and}} land tenure, the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to land and of dealings therewith and the collection of revenue therefrom within the States of Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Selangor, Terengganu and the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, and for purposes connected therewith.|$|E
5000|$|Property {{legislation}} in all states is grounded upon the Torrens principle of <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> This means that each {{state has a}} central register of all land in the state that that the register also shows the 'owner' of the land. This system was devised {{to reduce the amount}} of fraud relating to land due to falsification of title deeds. It does so with 'ownership' of the land being confirmed only upon registration of the property. That is, [...] "it is not a system of <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> but a system of title by registration". [...] This gives a purchaser [...] "greater assurance, indeed certainty, of title". [...] The principle of 'indefeasibility' of title - where a right has been entered on the register, it cannot be defeated by later rights except in certain circumstances - further protects the Torrens title holder. [...] Still a small residue of Old System Land remains and efforts are underway to convert this to Torrens title. The Torrens system also provides for registration of other entitlements to land such as a mortgage, by which land is used to secure a loan.|$|E

50|$|Often however a <b>title</b> <b>of</b> nobility may {{be claimed}} {{by a family}} whose members are officially {{recognised}} only as jonkheeren, the title not being acknowledged by the modern monarchy either because the family is registered as untitled nobility and may thus only use the honorific or predicate, or because the family has not requested official <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>title,</b> but possesses a grant of nobility which predates {{the founding of the}} Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815.|$|R

50|$|In 1857 the Royal Commission on <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> {{proposed}} {{a system of}} registration administered by a central registry in London with district offices. The Land Registry Act 1862 was introduced by the then Lord Chancellor, Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury. The Act provided for the registration of freehold and long leasehold estates in land. The system of registration adopted had some differences to that piloted in South Australia by that colony's then Premier Sir Robert Torrens, although both were founded on the 1857 report.|$|E
50|$|In December 1857 he {{championed the}} Real Property Act of 1858 (for the {{transfer}} of real property) through the assembly, and the system {{became known as the}} Torrens title. The system transferred property by <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> instead of by deeds, and it has since been widely adopted throughout the world. Attempts have been made to minimise the credit due to Torrens for his great achievement, and it has been stated that Anthony Forster, then editor of the Adelaide Register, made the original suggestion. In the preface to his book, The South Australian System of Conveyancing by <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Title,</b> published at Adelaide in 1859, Torrens stated that his interest in the question had been aroused 22 years before through the misfortunes of a relation and friend, and that he had been working on the problem for many years. Whoever first suggested the present method, which may have owed something to a report presented to the British House of Commons on 15 May 1857, it was Torrens and a German lawyer Dr. Ulrich Hübbe (with a knowledge of the real property laws of the Hanse Towns), who put it into practical shape, and fought it through parliament in spite of violent opposition from the legal profession. He later visited Victoria and assisted in bringing in the new system in that colony.|$|E
50|$|LBTT {{will usually}} {{be paid by}} the {{solicitor}} {{on behalf of the}} buyer, as part of the administrative process to complete the conveyancing transaction, although final responsibility lies with the buyer. Submitting an LBTT return and making arrangements to pay the LBTT due is a prerequisite to applying for <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> LBTT is a progressive tax, with its structure designed so that the charge is more proportionate to the actual price of the property. The percentage rate for each band in LBTT is applied only to the part of the price over the relevant threshold and up to the next threshold.|$|E
50|$|The {{records were}} made in the books of the then Office of Nobility and Knighthood. In 1848 mysteriously {{disappeared}} all the documents of the office. At the time, they were the responsibility of Possidonio da Fonseca Costa, then King of Arms, which greatly hindered the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> nobiliary <b>titles</b> granted during the First Reign of the Empire. Luis Aleixo Boulanger, his successor, sought to recover part of this documentation, producing a single book with part of the first generation of the Brazilian nobility.|$|R
5000|$|Miri = feudal or State land, but {{can also}} {{specifically}} refer to vacant State land, private usufruct State land.

50|$|A {{clear title}} to {{property}} is one that clearly states any obligation in the deed to the property. It reveals no breaksin the chain of legal ownership. After {{the records of the}} property have been traced and the title has been found clear, it is sometimes guaranteed, or insured. In a few states, a different system <b>of</b> insuring <b>title</b> <b>of</b> real properties provides for <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> a clear <b>title</b> with public authorities. After this is accomplished, no abstract <b>of</b> <b>title</b> is necessary.|$|R
