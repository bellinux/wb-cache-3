Buffalo sent two of his sons to St. Paul, the state capital, where they obtained a portion of the annuities still owed.|$|E

The demographics that will be studied include age, race, gender, economic status, and educational level. Comparisons will be made by randomly choosing 10 cases methamphetamine <b>removals</b> and 10 non-methamphetamine <b>removals</b> {{over the past two years}} at the Hart County Department for Protection and Permanency.

5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, {{for the purposes of}} processing and <b>removal,</b> did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed the provisions of the Migration Act extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the <b>removal</b> of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of <b>removal</b> are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered to be for the purpose of <b>removal.</b> Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} alum and glutinous rice flour as dual {{coagulant}} on the <b>removals</b> of colour and suspended solid from stabilized leachate were investigated. A series of jar test {{were conducted by}} optimizing the dose and pH of single coagulant (alum and glutinous rice flour) and its combination. It was observed that low <b>removals</b> (colour: 46 %, suspended solid: 16 %) were recorded by glutinous rice as single coagulant at pH 7 and dose 1. 2 g/L. However, addition of glutinous rice flour (0. 12 g/L) as coagulant aid for alum at pH 6 and dose of alum 2. 5 g/L, show better <b>removals</b> of colour (86 %) and suspended solid (92 %) from alum. At same pH and dose of alum as single coagulant, the <b>removals</b> achieved only 79 % and 83 % of colour and suspended solid, respectively. Thus, addition of glutinous rice flour as coagulant aid improved the colour and suspended solid <b>removals</b> from the stabilized leachat...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I show a matrix method to {{calculate}} the exact inverse pseudopolar grid Fourier transform, and use this transform to do noise <b>removals</b> in the k space of pseudopolar grids.

The results present the signal to noise ratio and the variance are much better when doing noise <b>removals</b> in the pseudopolar grid than the Cartesian grid. The noise <b>removals</b> of pseudopolar grid or Cartesian grid are both in the k space, and all these noises are added in the real space. Comment: 4 pages, 7 figures, 1 important equation Eq.
