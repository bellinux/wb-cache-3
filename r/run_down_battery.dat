Cell phones viruses have become real as many smartphones and other modern cell phones feature internet capability and contain storage space. Cell phones viruses can be harmful because they can steal personal information entered by the user that is useful in identity theft, make expensive calls using the victim’s account or <b>run</b> <b>down</b> the <b>battery</b> quickly. In this paper, we will study mobile phone viruses and how they affect network stability...|$|R
50|$|The {{first order}} of {{business}} was to restore electric power. Two of the eight batteries were destroyed, the rest fully discharged. Dzhanibekov determined that a sensor in the solar array pointing system had failed, preventing the batteries from recharging. A telemetry radio problem prevented the TsUP (mission control center) from detecting the problem. Salyut 7 had quickly <b>run</b> <b>down</b> its <b>batteries,</b> shutting <b>down</b> all its systems and accounting for the break in radio contact. The cosmonauts set about recharging the batteries and used Soyuz T-13 to turn the station in order to point its solar arrays to the sun.|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{the drying}} Hmong {{manpower}} pool, GM 26 contained more than 100 troopers {{under the age}} of 17. As the adviser to GM 21 noted, [...] "We had 14-year-olds fighting, and the troops were getting lazy, leaving behind lots of equipment in the field...." [...] The CIA case officer for GM 26 saw paradrops called in just so his soldiers could line their foxholes with the parachutes. The young soldiers would switch weapons assignments out of boredom. They <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> the <b>batteries</b> of their tactical radios lighting cigarettes from the power terminals. And the case officer found it necessary to assign about a dozen pre-teen soldiers to communications and logistics duties to spare them from combat.|$|R
60|$|There {{were ten}} huts, each {{containing}} twenty men. Two or three shots were fired, {{as they entered}} the last two huts; but the Spaniards were overpowered in an instant, as they were here vastly outnumbered. The officers were made prisoners and, ten men being placed over them, the rest of the force, now carrying three muskets each, <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> into the <b>battery.</b> The sentries here threw down their arms, at once, and were allowed to go where they pleased.|$|R
6000|$|Among {{the party}} on the Peak were Unus and Peggy. The latter {{understood}} {{a good deal of}} English, and that which she did not comprehend, {{in the course of the}} discussions on this interesting occasion, Bob, who had picked up something of the language of her group, explained to her, as well as he could. After a time, the girl <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> to the <b>battery</b> and brought up her husband, through whom the proposal was made that, at first, excited so much wonder. Peggy had told Unus what was going on, and had pointed out to him the boat of Juno, now sensibly drawing nearer to the island, and Unus volunteered to swim out and meet the girl, so as to give her timely warning, as well as instructions how to proceed! ...|$|R
50|$|On 14 March 1942, Wanlyn {{departed}} on his 27th {{patrol in}} the Gulf of Taranto. On {{the night of}} the 18 March he sighted a submarine on the surface and determined her to be hostile. He engaged with a full spread of torpedoes, and the submarine blew apart and sank. The submarine was later identified as the Tricheco and was lost with all hands. There was no counterattack, but motor torpedo boats shadowed her movements for hours which <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> her <b>battery</b> and oxygen. The following day Wanklyn moved to St Cataldo Point hoping to find a softer target for his deck gun. The lookouts sighted four vessels, a trawler and three fishing smacks. Wanklyn ordered the submarine to surface 100 yards from the trawler, Maria. His officers gestured to the crew to abandon ship and Upholder fired seven shells into the vessel which sank. The smacks fled close to shore. The action had lasted 14 minutes and Wanklyn decided it was too dangerous to give chase. On 23 March Upholder, Proteus and P36 loitered off Taranto in the hope of engaging Italian warships. One convoy was signed and Wanklyn fired on a light cruiser but misses. All three returned to Malta without success.|$|R
50|$|This armor {{eventually}} achieved sentience due to Stark downloading Jocasta {{into the}} armor- thus corrupting the usual failsafes Stark had installed {{to prevent such}} an occurrence happening as Jocasta unintentionally infected the armor with the 'Ultron Imperative', a system that would cause Ultron's creations to rebuild {{him if he was}} ever destroyed-, lightning strikes sustained during a fight with Whiplash providing the necessary 'nudge' to push the armor into full sentience based on Stark's own mind. Although the armor's new tactical abilities made it far more efficient than previous armors, able to evade attacks based on past experience with opponents, its lack of human morality caused it to kill Whiplash in its 'test drive', subsequently becoming increasingly obsessed with merging with Stark so that they would become Iron Man on a permanent basis (on a more practical note, it also suffered from a power supply problem as it <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> its <b>batteries</b> at a far more rapid rate due to the energy required to sustain its sentience). Although it attempted to kill Stark in a final confrontation on a deserted island, when Stark suffered a heart attack, it reverted to its default programming, sacrificing its own central power source to help sustain Stark's heart. It was later salvaged by the 'Sons of Yinsen'- a cult who followed Ho Yinsen- to use as a host for Yinsen's brain, only for Ultron {{to take control of the}} armor before it was destroyed for good.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} pumps, {{valves and}} cylinders {{used for the}} modifications to these cars were originally used for operations done for airplanes. Using these materials {{took a lot of}} engineering ability in order to get these cars back in working condition after being stripped. For many automobile owners, it was too expensive to have an auto shop install the hydraulics in their car for them. In the early 1960s, owners were left to do the mechanics for their own cars because the kits were not sold in stores until the later 1960s. These hydraulic kits were known as [...] "trays" [...] to many consumers. Many times, since these batteries, pumps and valves were made for such large aircraft originally, extra batteries were needed to assist in the hydraulics. This would <b>run</b> the <b>batteries</b> <b>down</b> more often than the original usage for these batteries so, it was necessary for the owners of these automobiles to charge the automobile's batteries more frequently. After using aircraft materials, liftgate trucks' materials were found to be more manageable on the car as well as the maintenance of the car.|$|R
