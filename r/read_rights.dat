500|$|Scholar Virginia Sapiro {{states that}} few read Wollstonecraft's works {{during the nineteenth}} century as [...] "her attackers implied or stated that no self-respecting woman would read her work". (In fact, as Craciun points out, new editions of Rights of Woman {{appeared}} in the UK in the 1840s, and in the US in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s.) One of those few was Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who <b>read</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman at the age of 12, and whose poem Aurora Leigh reflected [...] "Wollstonecraft's unwavering focus on education". Lucretia Mott, a Quaker minister, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Americans who met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, discovered they had both read Wollstonecraft, and agreed the need for what became the Seneca Falls Convention, an influential women's rights meeting held in 1848. Another who read Wollstonecraft was George Eliot, a prolific writer of reviews, articles, novels, and translations. In 1855, she devoted an essay to the roles and rights of women, comparing Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller. Fuller was an American journalist, critic, and women's rights activist who, like Wollstonecraft, had travelled to the Continent, been involved in the struggle for reform (in this case the Roman Republic), and had a child by a man without marrying him. Wollstonecraft's children's work was adapted by Charlotte Mary Yonge in 1870.|$|E
2500|$|Originalists often argue that, where a {{constitution}} is silent, judges should not <b>read</b> <b>rights</b> into it (i.e. a textualist interpretation). However, the Ninth Amendment, seen through an originalist lens, {{can be seen}} as providing the judiciary with means of protecting [...] which the founders had not thought, for whatever reasons, to explicitly list, such as rights involving abortion, gender and sexual orientation equality, and capital punishment. This presents a particular challenge to the theory of Original Intent, which seems to thus suggest just the opposite of what the text of the Constitution and original intent of the founders arguably affirm, creating an inconsistency in the practice of at least one branch of Originalism. The subsequent Tenth Amendment, detailing non-enumerated rights as the sole property of the states and the people, is often cited as the clarification for this inconsistency and the reason why the federal courts have no say in affirming or denying said rights per the Ninth Amendment.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to using external tools for monitoring or auditing, native database audit capabilities {{are also available}} for many database platforms. The native audit trails are extracted {{on a regular basis}} and transferred to a designated security system where the database administrators do/should not have access. This ensures a certain level of segregation of duties that may provide evidence the native audit trails were not modified by authenticated administrators, and should be conducted by a security-oriented senior DBA group with <b>read</b> <b>rights</b> into production. Turning on native impacts the performance of the server. Generally, the native audit trails of databases do not provide sufficient controls to enforce separation of duties; therefore, the network and/or kernel module level host based monitoring capabilities provides a higher degree of confidence for forensics and preservation of evidence.|$|E

[...] "Taking their own lives was not necessary, but it certainly is a good PR move."

5000|$|Wollstonecraft {{has what}} scholar Cora Kaplan {{labelled}} in 2002 a [...] "curious" [...] legacy that {{has evolved over}} time: [...] "for an author-activist adept in many genres ... up until the last quarter-century Wollstonecraft's life has been read much more closely than her writing". After the devastating effect of Godwin's Memoirs, Wollstonecraft's reputation lay in tatters for a century; she was pilloried by such writers as Maria Edgeworth, who patterned the [...] "freakish" [...] Harriet Freke in Belinda (1801) after her. Other novelists such as Mary Hays, Charlotte Turner Smith, Fanny Burney, and Jane West created similar figures, all to teach a [...] "moral lesson" [...] to their readers. (Hays had been a close friend, and helped nurse her in her dying days.) Scholar Virginia Sapiro states that few read Wollstonecraft's works {{during the nineteenth century}} as [...] "her attackers implied or stated that no self-respecting woman would read her work".

40|$|Abstract: A {{database}} can {{be stored}} in a centralized manner, or its fragments can be dis-tributed in a set of nodes in a network [1]. Some fragments {{can be stored}} in a single node, or in more than one node (are replicated) [2]. The operations required by client (as reading, adding, updating, or deleting records) could be performed over the fragments according to the client rights for the mentioned fragment and the fragment rights (<b>read</b> <b>rights</b> and write rights) in the node where the operation is required. The distribution of the fragments in the database nodes and the rights allocation can be per-formed in a static mode by specifying exactly the rights and placement for each fragment, or can be performed in a dynamic mode taking into account factors as: the node rules for fragment management or the requests flow in the distributed database. In the current paper is proposed a method for a dynamic distribution of the fragments in the nodes of a distributed database...|$|E
