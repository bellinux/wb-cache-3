H. Lawrence Clever suggested rounding rules for logarithmic and exponential operations in 1979.

We propose a refinement to Clever’s <b>rounding</b> <b>rule</b> for common (i. e. base 10) logarithmic operations that significantly increases its accuracy. Clever’s rules for exponential operations were found to be extremely poor, almost never predicting the correct number of significant figures in the result.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} three different rounding rules for multiplication and division is presented, including statistical analyses via Monte-Carlo simulations {{as well as a}} math-ematical derivation. This work expands upon a previous study by Mulliss and Lee (1998), by making the more realistic assumption that the contributing uncertainties are statistically independent. With this assumption, it is shown that the so-called standard <b>rounding</b> <b>rule</b> fails over 60 % of the time, leading to a loss in precision. Two alternative rules are studied, and both are found to be significantly more accurate than the standard rule. One alterna-tive rule requires one extra significant digit beyond that predicted by the standard rule. The other requires one to count numbers whose leading digit is 5 or greater as having an extra significant digit, and then to apply the standard rule. Although the second alternative rule is slightly more accurate, the first is shown to be completely safe for data — never leading to a truncation of digits that contain significant information. Accordingly, we recommend the first alternative rule as the new standard. PACS numbers: 01. 30. Pp, 01. 55. +b, 02. 70. Uu I...|$|E

40|$|Nearly {{one and a}} {{half years}} have elapsed since the MNB withdrew 1 - and 2 -forint coins from {{circulation}} on 1 March 2008, which simultaneously saw the rule on rounding to the nearest value of 5 enter into force. While it was perfectly clear from a professional perspective that rounding would make cash payments easier on a daily basis, there was nevertheless strong concern surrounding the introduction of rounding. The actual developments, however, have not underpinned preliminary fears. The withdrawal of 1 -and 2 -forint coins did not bring about an inflationary effect, due to the symmetrical direction of the rounding for final amounts payable only, and the application of new rounding rules did not cause any particular difficulties. It does not come as a surprise that the use of rounding did not cause any disruption in the economy, as rounding has a more than decadelong tradition in Hungary on account of the withdrawal of the filler in the 1990 s. In this article, we will present the reasons and the economic rationale behind the introduction of rounding rules with the help of Hungarian and numerous foreign practices. As Hungary’s legal tender will hopefully be the euro within a few years, the experiences of euro area countries in the practice of rounding will be examined more closely. <b>rounding</b> <b>rule,</b> withdrawal small change, elimination small denomination coins, 1 - and 2 -forint coins, filler, 1 - and 2 -cent coins, penny. ...|$|E

40|$|Finally, as {{combinatorial}} {{applications of}} complex quadratic optimization; we consider Max 3 -Cut with fixed nodes constraints, Max 3 -Dicut with weight constraints, Max 3 -XOR, and so on, and present corresponding bounds on the approximation ratios. Quadratic optimization problems with complex-valued decision variables, in short called complex quadratic optimization problems, find many applications in engineering. In this dissertation, we study several instructive models of complex quadratic optimization, {{as well as}} its applications in combinatorial optimization. The tool that we use is a combination of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and randomization technique, which has been well exploited in the last decade. Since most of the optimization models are NP-hard in nature, we shall design polynomial time approximation algorithms for a general model, or polynomial time exact algorithms for some restricted instances of a general model. To enable the analysis, we first develop two basic theoretical results: one is the probability formula for a bivariate complex normal distribution vector to be in a prescribed angular region, and the other one is the rank-one decomposition theorem for complex positive semidefinite matrices. The probability formula enables us to compute the expected value of a randomized (with a specific <b>rounding</b> <b>rule)</b> solution based on an optimal solution of the SDP relaxation problem, while the rank-one decomposition theorem provides a new proof of the complex S -lemma and leads to novel deterministic rounding procedures. With the above results in hand, we then investigate the models and applications of complex quadratic optimization via semidefinite programming in detail. We present an approximation algorithm for a convex quadratic maximization problem with discrete complex decision variables, where the approximation analysis is based on the probability formula. Besides, an approximation algorithm is proposed for a non-convex quadratic maximization problem with discrete complex decision variables. Then we study a limit of the model, i. e., a quadratic maximization problem with continuous unit module decision variables. The problem is shown to be strongly NP-hard. Approximation algorithms are described for the problem, including both convex case and non-convex case. Furthermore, if the objective matrix has a sign structure, then a stronger approximation result is shown to hold. In addition, we use the complex matrix decomposition theorem to solve complex quadratically constrained complex quadratic programming. We consider several interesting cases for which the corresponding SDP relaxation admits no gap with the true optimal value, and consequently, this yields polynomial time procedures for solving those special cases of complex quadratic optimization.
