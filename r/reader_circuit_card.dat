40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the line assignment problem in printed <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> assembly systems. The line assignment problem involves the allocation of <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> types to an appropriate assembly line among a set of assembly lines with the objective of reducing the total assembly time. These <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> are to be assembled in a manufacturing facility, capable of simultaneously producing a wide variety of printed <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> in different production volumes.

40|$|Abstract. Integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> or {{smart cards}} are now well-known. Applications such as {{electronic}} purses (cash units stored in cards), subscriber identification cards used in cellular telephone or access keys for pay-TV and information highways emerge {{in many places}} with millions of users. More services are required by applications providers and card holders. Mainly, new integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> evolve towards non-predefined multi-purpose, open and multi-user applications. Today, operating systems implemented into integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> cannot respond to these new trends. They have evolved from simple operating systems defining an hardware abstraction level up to file management systems or database management systems where the card behavior was defined once at the manufacturing level or by the card issuer. The needs for open and flexible card life cycle enabling to accommodate executable code loaded by different service providers require {{a new generation of}} smart cards. Operating systems based on object-oriented technologies are key components for future integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> applications...|$|R

This thesis describes the creation of a design tool that improves electrical design for test, reducing wasteful troubleshooting on hundreds of products each year, saving {{tens of thousands of dollars}} on high cost programs, with incremental yearly savings totaling in the hundreds of thousands, and a net present value of over 2. 5 million in labor savings. The tool provides designers with real time feedback regarding the impact their design decisions have on expected troubleshooting activity, and provides guidance to improve troubleshoot ability. The tool reduces spending on non-value added activity buy an average of 50 %, while at the same time helping fulfill <b>Circuit</b> <b>Card</b> Assembly's mission to engage design teams at the earliest stages of product development, before potentially costly decisions are finalized and beyond <b>Circuit</b> <b>Card</b> Assembly's ability to influence. The subject of interaction between groups in different functional silos, between independent Raytheon businesses and with seemingly disparate incentives is investigated as it pertains to the development of the design for test tool. The method of action of the design tool at a personal or organizational level is to raise awareness of total product cost and allow disparate teams to communicate in the same language with a more complete understanding of how to achieve corporate level goals. Communicating effectively across business and functional barriers is the greatest achievement of the new tool, but also the greatest roll out and developmental challenge. The tool is part of a suite of similar activities driving towards operational excellence within CCA. by Glenn Bergevin. Thesis (S. M.)
