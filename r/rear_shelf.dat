60|$|Josie was not satisfied. She peered {{under the}} bed, softly opened all the drawers in the dresser and finally entered the closet. Here, on the <b>rear</b> <b>shelf,</b> a {{newspaper}} {{was placed in}} such manner as to hide from observation anything behind it. To an ordinary person, glancing toward it, the newspaper meant nothing; to Josie's practised eye it was plainly a shield. Being short of stature, the girl had to drag in a chair {{in order to reach}} the high shelf. She removed the newspaper, took down a black hand-satchel--it was dreadfully heavy and she almost dropped it--and then replaced the paper as it had been before.|$|E
50|$|The Bolero {{possesses}} a 3.3 liter V6 engine. The rear deck was {{slightly higher than}} the hood, making for a more aerodynamic design. Fiber optics were utilized throughout the car. A built-in cooler was {{also included in the}} <b>rear</b> <b>shelf,</b> dual cup holders for the front and rear passengers, and portable headsets behind the front seats.|$|E
50|$|On 22 August 1962, Charles de Gaulle was {{the victim}} of an {{attempted}} assassination at Petit-Clamart. He later said that the potentially fatal bullet had been stopped by the frame of the photograph of Anne that he always carried with him, placed this particular day on the <b>rear</b> <b>shelf</b> of his car. When he died in 1970, he was buried in the cemetery of Colombey beside his beloved daughter.|$|E
50|$|Fiberboard is {{also used}} in the {{automotive}} industry to create free-form shapes such as dashboards, <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelves,</b> and inner door shells. These pieces are usually covered with a skin, foil, or fabric such as cloth, suede, leather, or polyvinyl chloride.|$|R
5000|$|DX: The more {{powerful}} DX, with a [...] 1.5 L D15B7 engine, manual passenger side mirror (after '92), tilt steering, intermittent wipers, side mouldings, rear wiper/washer, and <b>rear</b> cargo <b>shelf</b> as standard equipment. Despite the higher hp powerplant, the DX returns real-world mileage of 38 city / 45 hwy.|$|R
50|$|Dead {{spots are}} a result of the maximum {{overshoot}} requirement from above. The power delivered to the internal LF antennas has to be tuned to give best performance i.e. minimum dead spots and maximum average overshoot. Dead spots are usually near the extremities of the vehicle e.g. the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{vehicles}} offer configurable cargo conveniences {{such as a}} shelf or board. They often serve various purposes. The multiposition <b>rear</b> <b>shelf</b> on the Chrysler PT Cruiser {{can be used as}} a {{table for}} a picnic, a second cargo layer, or a security screen. The Citroën C3 has a foldable segmented false floorboard that compartmentalises the cargo area, makes loading easier, and evens out the load floor when the back of the rear seat is folded down.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, {{automatic}} headlamps were added, and the Handling Group {{removed the}} speed limiter. In 2000, an interlock {{was added to}} prevent shifting the transmission from Park unless the brake pedal was pressed; and tether anchors {{were added to the}} <b>rear</b> <b>shelf</b> for child seats. The 2001 model year brought more changes, with an optional luxury group that included an automatic dimming driver-side mirror and supplemental side airbags. A more advanced EVIC (trip computer) was made optional. The 300M also received new jeweled taillights.|$|E
50|$|The 1FM was {{produced}} for the UK in 1992 {{to coincide with}} the 25th birthday of BBC Radio 1. Only 25 were made and each car was individually numbered with a small brass plate. The car was only available in black with 'Radio 1FM 25th' bodywork decals, grey speedline alloy wheels and came with all options fitted as standard. A special stereo system including a CD changer and an acoustic <b>rear</b> <b>shelf</b> was specified by Clarion. Radio 1 ran a competition on air to win one.|$|E
5000|$|April 1974: Introduction of the R5 LS, {{same as the}} R5 TL {{but with}} a larger 1.3 engine, {{different}} design steel wheels, H4 iodine headlights, electric windscreen washers, fully carpeted floor ahead of the front seats, carpeted <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf,</b> electronic rev counter, daily totalizer, two-speed ventilation system, rear wiper, and illuminated ashtray with cigarette lighter.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} model and technique are described {{to simulate the}} turbulent fluid flow over and heat transfer through a model of vehicle windshield defrosting and demisting systems. The simplified geometry and {{the dimensions of the}} {{numerical model}} are representative of vehicle system with accurate locations of the nozzles and outlet vents, including cabin features such as seating and the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf...</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 6-seater version. Three rows of seats: fixed {{front bench}} seat for driver and passenger, plus four single rear seats in two rows. The rear seats could be {{individually}} folded flat to the floor, allowing for a reconfigurable cargo area with an even loading surface. With all six seats up storage space was reduced to the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf.</b> Original price on the Italian market: 743,000 Lire.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989 {{introduced}} an extensive exterior redesign {{which included a}} longer 113.8-inch wheelbase for sedans. The [...] 4.5-liter powerplant (introduced just a year earlier), dashboard, and the front doors (on both the coupe and sedan) were about the only items that carried over — even the luggage compartment was over [...] larger than last year. The Coupe de Ville and Fleetwood coupe retained the previous year's interior, wheelbase, and doors—all cleverly hidden between the new front and rear styling. A give-away to the previous design is the <b>rear</b> <b>shelf</b> package on the 2-door models. While the parcel shelf on the four-door models received a 'Mercedes-Benz inspired' storage compartment with lid, rear seat headrest panel, and a long 3-bulb horizontal brake lamp, the 2-door models still had the narrow carpeted parcel shelf and pedestal brake lamp from the previous year. Of special note were the composite (plastic) front fenders that resisted parking-lot dings and dents, and weighed less than their steel counterparts. Previously optional equipment that was made standard for 1989 included electrically powered outside mirrors and the AM/FM/cassette player stereo. New options introduced this year included a driver's side airbag, the Bose compact disc player, an electrically heated windshield, {{and a set of}} four reversible carpeted floor mats.|$|E
40|$|Loudspeakers in car cabins {{often are}} {{installed}} in positions primarily regarding design aspects. Acoustical aspects are mostly subordinate. For this reason loudspeakers frequently radiate against a window, the dashboard or the <b>rear</b> <b>shelf,</b> also a radiation {{to the floor}} room is common. Acoustical reflections at short distances causing interferences of direct and reflected sounds are {{the main reason for}} comb-filter effects at the listening position. For the measurements in this work two stimuli were used: a pseudorandom pink noise, recursively averaged over 15 seconds, when the measurement position was changed, and a sine sweep when the position was fixed during the measurement process. Both, microphone movements and head movements, lead to a robust averaging of the measured magnitude response, reducing significantly both the variations in the response and the comb-filter effects in the car cabin. Frequency responses measured by the process described here require less filtering effort to equalize the loudspeakers in the car cabin...|$|E
50|$|August 1985 saw {{the arrival}} of the 1.3 City and 1.3 City X. The 1.3 City was similar to the {{previous}} 1.3 base model. The 1.3 City X added full carpeting, cloth upholstery, head restraints, a <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf,</b> a radio and a manually operated choke. These models also did without the plastic bumpers, having more conventional steel bumpers with plastic end caps similar to the Maestro van.|$|R
50|$|The Visa's <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf</b> was in two hinged sections, {{one in the}} car, {{the other}} on the tailgate, to allow objects that were {{slightly}} too tall to still fit without removing the shelf. When carrying larger loads, the part of the shelf attached to the tailgate could be folded up, and fixed with the elasticated support strings, to protect the rear window and heated rear screen elements.|$|R
50|$|It {{replaced}} the ZIL-4104 in 1985 and {{had virtually no}} mechanical changes compared with that model. The only major changes {{have been in the}} styling, which in some respects, notably in the rear-view mirrors, was subtly modernised compared to the styling of previous ZIL models. The front turn indicators were also modernised, with the rectangular horizontal line giving way to a more vertically oriented, door-like shape. The front headlights were also restyled, as was the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf.</b>|$|R
5000|$|To {{celebrate}} the occasion, Volkswagen marketed a final, special series of 3,000 Beetles marketed as [...] "Última Edición" [...] (Final Edition) in light blue (Aquarius Blue) or beige (Harvest Moon Beige). Each car included the 1.6 engine, whitewall tires, a CD player with four speakers, chrome bumpers, trim, hub caps and exterior mirrors, a Wolfsburg emblem above the front trunk's handle, chrome glove box badge, body coloured wheels, tinted glass, a <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf,</b> and VW Última Edición plaque.|$|R
50|$|The {{tailgate}} opens over six-feet {{high and}} 60/40 rear seatbacks fold {{down for a}} flat cargo area. A hard cargo cover can fit flush on the floor when not needed and is reversible to carry wet or dirty cargo. The cabin includes several storage areas including a lockable center console that can hold a standard size laptop computer. The cargo hold is small size compared to most rivals and {{does not have the}} adjustable cargo tracks or a <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Most {{competing}} systems used {{a separate}} heating system and an engine-mounted compressor, {{driven by the}} engine crankshaft via a belt, with an evaporator in the car's trunk to deliver cold air through the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf</b> and overhead vents. General Motors made a front-mounted air conditioning system optional in 1954 on Pontiacs with a straight-eight engine that added separate controls and air distribution. The alternative layout pioneered by Nash [...] "became established practice and continues to {{form the basis of}} the modern and more sophisticated automatic climate control systems." ...|$|R
50|$|Super S trim was {{available}} in 1993-1997, then the name was changed to SR (Facelift); Differences include a slightly faster 3.6 turns lock-to-lock rack, over the standard 3.8 turns, different colour coded front and rear bumpers, colour coded wing mirrors and bump strips, rear wrap around spoiler, front fog lights, remote fuel flap opening, wider 175/60/r13 tyres, rear ash tray, tachometer, more heavily bolstered seats, split folding rear seats and <b>rear</b> speaker <b>shelf</b> as standard. Features such as electric windows and power steering were still optional extras. The only engine available for the Super S was the 75 bhp CG13DE/ 1.3 twin cam 16v engine.|$|R
5000|$|Using its Kelvinator {{refrigeration}} experience, {{the automobile}} industry's first single-unit {{heating and air}} conditioning system was introduced by Nash in 1954. This was a compact, affordable system for the mass market with controls on the dash and an electric clutch. Entirely incorporated within the engine bay, the combined heating and cooling system had cold air for passengers enter through dash-mounted vents. Competing systems used a separate heating system and an engine-mounted compressor with an Evaporator in the car's trunk to deliver cold air through the <b>rear</b> package <b>shelf</b> and overhead vents. The alternative layout pioneered by Nash [...] "became established practice and continues to form the basis of the modern and more sophisticated automatic climate control systems." ...|$|R
50|$|From 2008 to 2012, {{there was}} an {{optional}} Bowers & Wilkins (B&W) sound system available. At its core there are 14 speakers which (with {{the exception of the}} aluminium high-frequency tweeters) employ B&W's Kevlar composite speaker cones. Each front door contains a 168 mm woofer, a 100 mm mid-range speaker and a 25 mm dome tweeter (the latter two wired in parallel with a crossover), while each rear door houses a similar 168 mm woofer and 25 mm tweeter. As a centre speaker there is a 100 mm full-range driver, similar to the two 100 mm full-range 'surround' speakers located on the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf.</b> The B&W system has been reviewed by journalists at Autocar magazine, who proclaimed it the best in-car system they have ever heard.|$|R
5000|$|Each shelf slot is 30.48 mm wide. This {{allows for}} 14-board chassis to be {{installed}} in a [...] 19-inch rack-mountable system and 16 boards in an [...] ETSI rack-mountable system. A typical 14-slot system is 12 or 13 rack units high. The large AdvancedTCA shelves are targeted to the telecommunication market so the airflow goes {{in the front of}} the shelf, across the boards from bottom to top, and out the <b>rear</b> of the <b>shelf.</b> Smaller shelves that are used in enterprise applications typically have horizontal air flow.|$|R
50|$|The Corgi {{design team}} {{came up with}} the first model with an opening feature in February 1960, the Aston Martin DB4 (218) which had an opening bonnet. Steerable front wheels, jewelled {{headlights}} and rear lights and an opening boot complete with spare wheel were added on the Bentley Continental Sports Saloon (224) in April 1961, and by October 1963 with the release of the Ghia L6.4 (241) new levels of authenticity were reached. This model featured a number of 'firsts' with not only an opening bonnet, but also opening doors and boot, and a detailed interior with a rear view mirror, folding front seats, and even a model corgi dog sitting on the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf.</b> At introduction, the Ghia sold for eight shillings and sixpence, and even at this relatively high price around 1.7 million were sold before being withdrawn in 1969. By contrast, only twenty five examples of the real car were completed.|$|R
5000|$|This weight {{reduction}} {{was achieved}} by removing the spare wheel, rear counterweight, <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf</b> and <b>rear</b> seats, and the standard fitment air conditioning. The main battery was also relocated {{to the rear of}} the vehicle in order to maintain weight distribution as much as possible. Lightweight fixed-back Recaro bucket seats graced the interior. Distinguishable from other TT Coupés by its two-tone paint scheme (Phantom Black pearl painted roof, pillars and mirror housings, in combination with either Avus Silver, Phantom Black, Mauritius Blue or Misano Red body colour) and unique 18" [...] 15-spoke cast aluminium alloy wheels, plus the same body kit as fitted to the TT 3.2 V6, the TT quattro Sport also featured black exhaust tailpipes and uprated suspension settings and new wheels, ½" [...] wider at the rear for improved handling. The brochure stated V6-spec brakes were to be fitted, however models delivered in the UK came with the standard 225 spec brake callipers which were red-painted.|$|R
50|$|The Super Saloon Extra and Royal Saloon {{versions}} {{were packed}} with {{features such as}} dual-zone climate control, AM/FM cassette stereo with six acoustically matched speakers, combined with a separate rear cassette stereo with headphones, with dashboard-installed integrated CD player, and separate A/C and stereo control buttons installed in the <b>rear</b> armrest, parcel <b>shelf</b> mounted refrigerator, automatic headlights, reading lamps for all outboard seating positions, electrically adjusted tilt and telescoping steering column combined with a steering wheel and seat memory feature, glovebox mounted courtesy mirror among many things, while the slightly lower trim package Super Select was more modestly equipped.|$|R
25|$|Dual zone {{climate control}} was a {{standard}} feature across the WH range, as was 12-mode trip computer {{integrated into the}} instrument cluster. Caprice including rear roof mounted climate control and stereo controls for rear passengers- rear passengers were also provided with two headphone jacks in the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf</b> and could listen to a different audio source to the front occupants. A rear flip down table was incorporated into the rear armrest, complete with storage pocket and cup holders. The exclusive-to-Caprice options included standard Howe leather seats, 260-watt 12-speaker DSP audio system, individual ignition key memory (not available in Statesman- stereo settings, seating position) for three drivers, upright Holden crest logo on the bonnet, chrome exterior door handles, as well as heated side view mirrors and auto dipping passenger side view mirror to avoid alloy wheel damage when reversing. Headlights could be set to automatically sense low light levels and turn on without driver input. Caprice featured a fine chrome vertical bar grille, while Statesman used a chrome matrix style front grille design, and lacked chrome exterior door handles.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the convertible version of the TR7 required the interior light, {{which was in the}} headlining, to be removed. This was replaced by lights with integral switches in each of the door cards. A map light, mounted between the seats on the back panel below the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf,</b> was deleted. The convertible also required a smaller fuel filler cap, as the deck area in front of the boot lid was reduced to allow for the stowage of the hood. These modifications were also applied to the hard top for the 1978 year model (starting after the factory's summer shutdown in 1977), presumably to maintain commonality of parts on the assembly line. The wheel trims were also changed at this time, from smaller black trims that covered only the centre of the wheels, to larger silver ones, covering the whole wheel. However, {{only a small number of}} 1978 year model cars, with the smaller filler cap and lights in the door cards, were produced at Speke, due to the industrial action there in 1977-78.|$|R
5000|$|... quattro GmbH offers {{potential}} purchasers of new Audi cars {{the possibility}} of customising their new car {{beyond the scope of}} [...] "conventional" [...] options, to their own personal desires during the initial manufacturing process. [...] This facility is called Audi exclusive, and extends to virtually all areas of the car. The customer may choose unique exterior paint, in any colour, and be complemented by alloy wheels originally developed by quattro GmbH. [...] For the interior, the upholstery can be finished in various grades and grains of leathers (including nappa), again in a choice of colours. [...] These coloured leathers may also be applied to interior door coverings and <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelves.</b> Headlining fabrics can be customised in colour, along with seat belt webbing. The interior can be finished with a wide selection of fine wooden trims, sourced from around the world, along with colour coordinated piping on the edges of tailored floor carpet mats. Finally, for the traveling business person, a range of in-car office equipment is available. [...] quattro GmbH first offered this service at the 1995 Frankfurt International Motor Show.|$|R
5000|$|One major {{internal}} option came in {{the form}} of an advanced car audio system known as the Super Live Surround Sound or SLSS. The SLSS comprised a total of 10 speakers; 3 x 10 cm tweeters in the front console (left, right and centre), 2 x 10 cm door-mounted cones (left and right), 2 x tweeters and 2 x cones contained in a single, tube shaped unit mounted on the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf,</b> and a boot fitted 'Acoustic Resonance Woofer' (subwoofer). The SLSS came with a three mode Digital Sound Processor (DSP) which cycled through 'off', 'Casual' or 'Funky' mode by use of a button labelled [...] "WARP" [...] on the CD/Radio or CD/Radio/Cassette head unit. These produced slight differences in sound quality through preset values for settings such as bass and treble, as well as rotating the speakers in the rear unit to either project directly into the car or bounce off the rear window. A complete and functional SLSS is one of the most highly sought after options by Toyota Sera enthusiasts, but by being factory fit is quite hard to retro-fit.|$|R
50|$|The Airtemp {{was more}} {{advanced}} than rival automobile air conditioners by 1953. It was operated by a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions. As the highest capacity unit available at that time, the system was capable of quickly cooling the passenger compartment and also reducing humidity, dust, pollen, and tobacco smoke. The system drew in more outside air than contemporary systems; thus, reducing the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the <b>rear</b> window package <b>shelf</b> as on GM cars, small ducts directed cool air toward {{the ceiling of the}} car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} model and technique are described {{to simulate the}} turbulent fluid flow over and heat transfer through a model of vehicle windshield defrosting and demisting systems. The simplified geometry and {{the dimensions of the}} {{numerical model}} are representative of vehicle system with accurate locations of the nozzles and outlet vents, including cabin features such as seating and the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf.</b> The three-dimensional geometry of the numerical model is created in Auto Cad (Release 14). Surface meshing and a computational mesh of 750, 000 (tetrahedral) fluid cells is generated in the pre-processor of the CFD software used for the simulation of the fluid flow. Turbulence is modelled by using the k-e turbulence equations together with the wall function method. This decision was made after comparing the k-e model's performance with that of lower order models, and after considering the increased computer time requirements and decreased stability of more complex models, such as the Reynolds stress model. The numerical results of the study are very encouraging and compare favourably with measurements obtained from the actual vehicle by Thermograph and Hot Bulb probe techniques. The findings highlight some of the drawbacks of the existing design of the windshield systems and show that the maximum flow rates occur {{in the vicinity of the}} lower part of the windshield, progressing from the defroster nozzle in the dashboard...|$|R
5000|$|These safety {{features}} were all newly introduced passenger-car [...] "firsts" [...] on a production vehicle: padded door trim around the windows, heavily padded steering wheel (later {{to be replaced}} by an airbag with the Mercedes-Benz abbreviation of SRS standing for the English-language term Supplemental Restraint System), more comprehensive safety padding on the dashboard and around the interior, dual asymmetric windshield wipers, headrests with a center depression to locate the occupant's head in a more central position during a rear impact, a rain-water management system to improve visibility consisting of deep channels {{on both sides of the}} windshield and flowing into deeply channeled rain gutters, including similar designs on the side mirrors, rounded body shapes along the edges, such as the tops of the front fenders, etc., designed to ameliorate pedestrian injuries, ribbed rear taillamp lenses which would remain clearer of dirt on the recessed areas, an easy-to-access first aid kit stowed in a recessed compartment on the <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelf</b> prominently labeled with the universally recognized [...] "cross" [...] symbol which represents [...] "first aid", and several other subtle {{safety features}} related to both active and passive safety. The Mercedes Benz S-Class is a classic chauffeur driven car, and has frequently been used as standard by car hire companies. It is comfortable and safe as well as elegant looking; ideal for drives across the countryside or high class transport on a night out.|$|R
6000|$|We had {{scarcely}} {{left the}} landing {{of the hotel}} in the boat of the patriarch--for I need hardly say he was first and most rapacious of the plundering crew--when we found ourselves in very turbulent waters, {{in the face of}} mighty bluffs, rising inaccessible from the sea. Here and there, where their swarthy fronts were softened with a little verdure, goat-paths wound up and down among the rocks; and midway between the hotel and the grotto, in a sort of sheltered nook, we saw the Roman masonry of certain antique baths--baths of Augustus, says Valery; baths of Tiberius, say the Capriotes, zealous for the honor of their infamous hero. Howbeit, this was all we saw {{on the way to the}} Blue Grotto. Every moment the waves rose higher, emulous of the bluffs, which would not have afforded a foothold, or any thing to cling to, had we been upset and washed against them--and we began to talk of the immortality of the soul. As we neared the grotto, the patriarch entertained us with stories of the perilous adventures of people who insisted upon entering it in stormy weather,--especially of a French painter who had been imprisoned in it four days, and kept alive only on rum, which the patriarch supplied him, swimming into the grotto with a bottle-full at a time. [...] "And behold us arrived, gentlemen!" [...] said he, as he brought the boat skillfully around in front of the small semicircular opening at the base of the lofty bluff. We lie flat on the bottom of the boat, and complete the immersion of that part of our clothing which the driving torrents of rain had spared. The wave of destiny rises with us upon its breast--sinks, and we are inside of the Blue Grotto. Not so much blue as gray, however, and the water about the mouth of it green rather than azure. They say that on a sunny day both the water and the roof of the cavern are of the vividest cerulean tint--and I saw the grotto so represented in the windows of the paint-shops at Naples. But to my own experience it did not differ from other caves in color or form: there was the customary clamminess in the air; the sound of dropping water; the sense of dull and stupid solitude,--a little relieved in this case by the mighty music of the waves breaking against the rocks outside. The grot is not great in extent, and the roof in the <b>rear</b> <b>shelves</b> gradually down to the water. Valery says that some remains of a gallery have caused the supposition that the grotto was once the scene of Tiberius's pleasures; and the Prussian painter who discovered the cave was led to seek it by something he had read of a staircase by which Barbarossa used to descend into a subterranean retreat from the town of Anacapri on the mountain top. The slight fragment of ruin which we saw in one corner of the cave might be taken in confirmation of both theories; but the patriarch attributed the work to Barbarossa, being probably tired at last of hearing Tiberius so much talked about.|$|R
40|$|For {{almost thirty}} years bast fibers such as flax, hemp, kenaf, sisal and jute {{have been used as}} {{reinforcing}} material in the molding process of both thermoplastic and thermoset matrices. The main application areas of these natural fiber reinforced composites in Europe are limited almost exclusively to the passenger car range. Typical components are door panels, <b>rear</b> parcel <b>shelves,</b> instrument boards and trunk linings. Natural fiber reinforced composites have become prevalent due to their good mechanical properties and their low production costs. The main advantage in applying natural fibers as reinforcement in composite materials is the price. Nowadays this argument becomes more and more important due to the scarcity of synthetic raw materials and consequently, their rising prices. Additionally the low density (approx. 1. 5 g/cm³) of natural fibers confers them a very good lightweight potential. Other advantageous features of natural fiber composites include very good processing and acoustic properties. Further benefits such as good life cycle assessment and easier processability compared to glass fiber material should also be taken into account. Disadvantages of natural fibers are unevenness of the fiber quality and varying fiber characteristics due to differences in soil, climate and fiber separation and their low heat resistance (at temperatures exceeding 220 °C, some fiber components start thermal degradation). Another disadvantage of natural fiber reinforced materials is that with some matrices (mostly thermoplastic polymers) a sufficient impregnation of the fibers can only be achieved if the fiber content in the composite is kept low, usually below 50 wt. -...|$|R
