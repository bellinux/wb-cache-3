2500|$|In 2004 it was {{discovered}} that Portas's CDS-PP party had deposited 1,065,250 euros through 105 low-denomination deposits into the party's accounts in an attempt to circumvent monitoring regulations on political party funding and possibly on money-laundering (see smurfing). It was factually established that CDS-PP fabricated the donor receipts (including some using comical names such as [...] "Jacinto Leite Capelo Rego," [...] which in Portuguese is an erotic pun on words) but the real source of the money was never identified. In investigating, the police suspected the Espírito Santo Group (on whose bank the money was deposited) to have donated that money in connection with a tourism development named 'Portucale' in Benavente that entailed the cutting down of thousands of protected cork trees, which Paulo Portas, through his (until then) best friend and party colleague Luís Nobre Guedes, allegedly facilitated {{in the final days of}} the government to which they belonged. Paulo Portas denied any illegality and was not directly implicated in the case, while Nobre Guedes took the blame (and stopped talking to Paulo Portas). However, in investigating this case, the police intercepted phone calls that motivated another investigation into the costly purchase of two submarines by the Portuguese State (see below). It turned out that in addition to the Espírito Santo Group's <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>subsidiary</b> in charge of the Portucale project (ESAF) there was another trading subsidiary (ESCOM) that was also an intermediary in a major submarines deal, for which it had received 30 million euros in advance and which was judicially suspected to have been the source of the CDS-PP deposits as a kickback pay-off for the submarines intermediation.|$|E
