5|$|HIV is {{the cause}} of the {{spectrum}} of disease known as HIV/AIDS. HIV is a <b>retrovirus</b> that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. It directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or {{who had lived in}} Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new <b>retrovirus.</b> As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same <b>retrovirus</b> as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{study which}} used {{endogenous}} <b>retrovirus</b> markers {{to investigate the}} history of sheep domestication found the Jacob to be more closely linked to sheep from Africa and South-west Asia than to other British breeds, though all domestic breeds {{can be traced back}} to an origin the Fertile Crescent.|$|E
40|$|Scattered {{in human}} and animal genomes are a class of repetitious genetic {{elements}} called endogenous <b>retroviruses</b> (ERVs), which bear sequence homology to retroviral genomes. They constitute about 8 % of the human genome. Evolutionists assume that all endogenous <b>retroviruses</b> are remnants of germ line infection by exogenous <b>retroviruses.</b> However, the essential beneficial function of some ERVs and complex interaction between ERVs and other host DNA sequences suggest that some <b>retroviruses</b> were created in the cell {{as part of the}} host genome. The original ERV elements were endowed with the ability to package themselves in proteins and lipids and leave the host cell as infectious particles. Thus we speculate exogenous <b>retroviruses</b> were derived from endogenous <b>retroviruses</b> (exogenization, as opposed to endogenization). The ability of <b>retroviruses</b> to transpose within the host cell or to infect another host may have been designed for protein-coding, for gene regulation, and for DNA repair by homologous and non-homologous recombination. After the Fall, retroviral elements have been degraded by mutations. Retroviral insertion into the host genome also became deregulated, causing insertional mutagenesis. Deregulation of exogenous <b>retroviruses</b> resulted in pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Retroviruses,</b> a form {{of mobile}} genetic elements, have {{important}} roles in disease and primate evolution. Exogenous <b>retroviruses,</b> such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have significant pathological implications that have created a massive public health challenge in recent years. Endogenous <b>retroviruses</b> (ERVs), which are {{the primary focus of}} this review, can also be pathogenic, as well as being beneficial to a host in some cases. Furthermore, <b>retroviruses</b> may have {{played a key role in}} primate evolution that resulted in the incorporation of these elements into the human genome. <b>Retroviruses</b> are mobile genetic elements that have important roles in disease and primate evolution. We will further discuss the pathogenic potential of <b>retroviruses,</b> including their role in cancer biology, and will briefly summarize their evolutionary implications...|$|R

5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century was the golden age of virus {{discovery}} and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years. In 1957, equine arterivirus and the cause of Bovine virus diarrhoea (a pestivirus) were discovered. In 1963, the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first <b>retrovirus.</b> Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore. In 1983 Luc Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the <b>retrovirus</b> now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered Hepatitis C.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation in DPB is {{also caused}} by the {{chemokine}} MIP-1alpha and its involvement with CD8+ T cells. Beta defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides found in the respiratory tract, are responsible for further inflammation in DPB when a pathogen such as P.aeruginosa is present. If present with DPB, the human T-lymphotropic virus, type I, a <b>retrovirus,</b> modifies DPB pathogenesis by infecting T helper cells and altering their effectiveness in recognizing the presence of known or unknown pathogens involved with DPB.|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of human <b>retroviruses</b> {{in the early}} 1980 s revealed the existence of viral-encoded non-structural genes that were not evident in previously described animal <b>retroviruses.</b> Based on the absence or presence of these additional genes <b>retroviruses</b> were classified as ‘simple’ and ‘complex’, respectively. Expression of most of these extra genes is achieved through the generation of alternatively spliced mRNAs. The present review summarizes the genetic organization and expression strategies of human complex <b>retroviruses</b> and highlights the converging mechanisms controlling their life cycles...|$|R
40|$|<b>Retroviruses</b> cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} such as cancer, AIDS, autoimmunity and diseases of central nervous system, bone and joints. Some <b>retroviruses</b> are apparently harmless and some retroviral genomes are even inherited as host mendelian traits. Whereas oncoviruses generally have a low virus load, so that antiviral therapy would not greatly affect disease progression, lentiviruses like HIV have high load and turnover. The cell interactions of <b>retroviruses</b> largely determine their pathogenesis. Finally, <b>retroviruses</b> are being exploited therapeutically as vectors for gene therapy...|$|R
5|$|Koalas can {{be subject}} to {{pathogens}} such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria, which can cause keratoconjunctivitis, urinary tract infection, and reproductive tract infection. Such infections are widespread on the mainland, but absent in some island populations. The koala <b>retrovirus</b> (KoRV) may cause koala immune deficiency syndrome (KIDS) {{which is similar to}} AIDS in humans. Prevalence of KoRV in koala populations suggests a trend spreading from the north to the south of Australia. Northern populations are completely infected, while some southern populations (including Kangaroo Island) are free.|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of <b>retrovirus)</b> that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a <b>retrovirus.</b> Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s {{the theory}} that most cancers were caused by {{environmental}} <b>retroviruses</b> gained clinical support and funding. It had recently become known, due {{to the work of}} Nobel laureates Howard Temin and David Baltimore, that nearly all avian cancers were caused by bird <b>retroviruses,</b> but corresponding human <b>retroviruses</b> have not yet been found.|$|R
40|$|Ty 3 /Gypsy long {{terminals}} repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are structurally and phylogenetically {{close to}} <b>retroviruses.</b> Two notable structural {{differences between these}} groups of genetic elements are 1) the presence in <b>retroviruses</b> of an addi-tional envelope gene, env, which mediates infection, and 2) a specific dual ribonuclease H (RNH) domain encoded by the retroviral pol gene. However, similar to <b>retroviruses,</b> many Ty 3 /Gypsy LTR retrotransposons harbor additional env-like genes, promoting concepts of the infective mode of these retrotransposons. Here, we provide a further line of evidence of similarity between <b>retroviruses</b> and some Ty 3 /Gypsy LTR retrotransposons. We identify that, together with their addi-tional genes, plant Ty 3 /Gypsy LTR retrotransposons of the Tat group have a second RNH, as do <b>retroviruses.</b> Most importantly, we show that the resulting dual RNHs of Tat LTR retrotransposons and <b>retroviruses</b> emerged independently, providing strong evidence for their convergent evolution. The convergent resemblance of Tat LTR retrotransposons and <b>retroviruses</b> may indicate similar selection pressures acting on these diverse groups of elements and reveal potential evolutionary constraints on their structure. We speculate that dual RNH is required to accelerate retrotransposon evolution through increased rates of strand transfer events and subsequent recombination events. Key words: convergent evolution, LTR retrotransposons, <b>retroviruses,</b> ribonuclease H...|$|R
40|$|Retroelements with long-terminal repeats (LTRs) inhabit {{nearly all}} {{eukaryotic}} genomes. During {{the time of}} their rich evolutionary history they have developed highly diverse forms, ranging from ordinary retrotransposons to complex pathogenic <b>retroviruses</b> such as HIV-I. Errantiviruses are a group of insect endogenous LTR elements that share structural and functional features with vertebrate endogenous <b>retroviruses.</b> The errantiviruses illustrate one of the evolutionary strategies of retrotransposons to become infective, which together with their similarities to vertebrate <b>retroviruses</b> make them an attractive object of research promising to shed more light on the evolution of <b>retroviruses...</b>|$|R
5|$|Koalas {{typically}} inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and {{the leaves}} of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay {{for the first six}} to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala <b>retrovirus,</b> as well as by bushfires and droughts.|$|E
5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using <b>retrovirus,</b> they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic stem cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent stem cells far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E

40|$|<b>Retroviruses</b> {{are defined}} by their ability to reverse the normal flow of genetic {{information}} from genomic DNA to mRNA (19). Although not unique (pararetroviruses such as hepatitis B virus also share this property), <b>retroviruses</b> nevertheless form a clearly defined viral genus. Distinguish-ing characteristics include the morphology and composition of retroviral virions and the possession of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. While <b>retroviruses</b> form a relatively homogeneous viral family, they have customarily been subdivided into three taxonomic groupings primarily {{on the basis of}} the in vivo and in vitro consequences of infection (16, 19). The oncovirus subgroup includes <b>retroviruses</b> able to cause neoplastic disease in the infected host animal but also includes some related, relatively benign viruses.

5000|$|When <b>retroviruses</b> have {{integrated}} {{their own}} genome into the germ line, their genome is {{passed on to}} a following generation. These endogenous <b>retroviruses</b> (ERVs), contrasted with exogenous ones, now make up 5-8% of the human genome. Most insertions have no known function and are {{often referred to as}} [...] "junk DNA". However, many endogenous <b>retroviruses</b> play important roles in host biology, such as control of gene transcription, cell fusion during placental development {{in the course of the}} germination of an embryo, and resistance to exogenous retroviral infection. Endogenous <b>retroviruses</b> have also received special attention in the research of immunology-related pathologies, such as autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, although endogenous <b>retroviruses</b> have not yet been proven to play any causal role in this class of disease.|$|R
