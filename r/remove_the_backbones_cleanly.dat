30|$|To {{synthesize}} D-M 2 protein containing 97 D-amino acids, {{chemical synthesis}} of two peptide segments D-M 2 [1 – 49, 4 Arg-Tag]-NHNH 2 1 and D-M 2 [50 – 97] 2, was conducted, {{similar to the}} previously reported procedure for L-M 2 (Zheng et al., 2014). An Arg 4 -tagged backbone modification group was incorporated into the transmembrane domain containing peptide 1 at Gly 34 to improve the solubility of 1. Peptides 1 and 2 were successfully prepared by 9 -fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl solid-phase peptide synthesis (Fmoc SPPS) with the isolated yield of 16 % and 21 %, respectively. The ligation of 1 and 2 was performed using the protocol of hydrazide based native chemical ligation (Fang et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2016). The ligation product was purified using the reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) to give D-M 2 [1 – 97, 4 Arg-Tag] 3 with 30 % yield.

The dn E-cadherin c-DNA was isolated as a 1, 3 kb XbaI – HindIII fragment. The XbaI site was blunted with T 4 DNA polymerase. The fragment was cloned into the pBI 5 vector (containing a tet operator) by cutting with NheI/blunt – HindIII.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the processing of}} NiTi alloy from elemental powder of Nickel (Ni) and Titanium (Ti) mixed with binder system of Palm Stearin (PS) and polyethylene (PE) by using Metal Injection Moulding (MIM) process. The processing of NiTi alloys from elemental Ni and Ti powder mixtures by powder metallurgy (PM) route, particularly by metal injection moulding (MIM) is quite challenging owing to many stages involved which will result significantly on the homogeneity level of the powder mixture and the binder component. It process generally starts with mixing selected powders and binder in the correct proportions. The levels of impurities originated from the binder residue, especially oxygen and carbon need to be kept {{as low as possible}} since the values significantly influence the shape memory effect (SME) and pseudo-elasticity (PE) behaviour. Three different atomic fractions of Ni-Ti were investigated; 50 - 50, 50. 4 - 49. 6 and 50. 8 - 49. 2 and the powder loading used was 65. 5 vol%. The feedstock containing the mixture of elemental powders and binder exhibited promising rheological properties, thus resulting successful injection moulding at an optimum temperature of 130 °C. The moulded tensile-shaped samples were then underwent solvent extraction using n-heptane solution to <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> primary binder of PS. It was followed by thermal debinding to completely <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>backbone</b> binder of PE and subsequently sintered in high vacuum at 1050, 1100 and 1150 °C to allow diffusion of the elemental Ni and Ti powders to form NiTi alloy. The XRD results showed that the predominant phases were B 2 (austenite) and B 19 '(martensite) with minimal fractions of Ti-rich phases (NiTi 2 /Ni 2 Ti 4 Ox) and Nirich phases (NisTi and Ni 4 Ti 3) was obtained in the sintered parts. The phases were confirmed by microstructural image from FESEM that showed different grayscale contrast attributed to different atomic mass of the phases. The DSC results showed that increasing Ni content resulted in broadening of reversible martensite to austenite PTTs and decreasing the enthalpy for phase transition. Besides that, the impurities and fractions of secondary phases introduced in the alloy could also the other factors in broadening of phase transformation temperatures (PTTs). The tensile test showed that the samples exhibited promising mechanical tensile properties with the Young's modulus calculated from the stress-strain curve in the range of 2. 5 to 4. 8 GPa which is close to cancellous type bone. The porous structure shown in SEM images was highly inter-connected, thus promoting better bone tissue ingrowth when it is used as an implant. Increasing Ni contents resulted in slightly increase in degree of ductility which attributed from less fraction of porosity in the samples. Overall, NiTi parts with different Ni-Ti ratios were successfully produced by MIM using palm stearin based binder system...|$|R
50|$|Aflatoxin B1 is {{a potent}} {{genotoxic}} hepatocarcinogen with its exposure strongly linked {{to the development of}} hepatocellular carcinoma, liver tumors, especially given co-infection with hepatitis B virus. These effects seem to be largely mediated by mutations at guanine in codon 249 of the p53 gene, a tumor suppressing gene, and at several guanine residues in the 12th and 13th codons of the ras gene, a gene whose product controls cellular proliferation signals. Aflatoxin B1 must first be metabolitzed into its reactive electriphilic form, Aflatoxin B1-8,9-exo-epoxide by cytochrome p450. This active form then intercalates between DNA base residues and forms adducts with guanine residues, most commonly Aflatoxin B1-N7-Gua. These adducts may then rearrange or become <b>removed</b> from <b>the</b> <b>backbone</b> all-together, forming an apurinic site. These adducts and alterations represent lesions which, upon DNA replication cause the insertion of a mis-matched base in the opposing strand. Up to 44% of hepatocellular carcinomas in regions with high aflatoxin exposure bear a GC → TA transversion at codon 249 of p53, a characteristic mutation seen with this toxin.Prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in individuals exposed to aflatoxin, increases with co-infection of hepatitus B virus. One study estimated that while individuals with urinary aflatoxin bio-markers were at 3x greater risk than the normal population for hepatocellular carcinoma; those infected with hepatitis B virus were at a 4x risk; and those with the bio-markers and infected with hepatitis B virus were at a 60x greater risk for hepatocellular carcinoma than the normal population.|$|R

However, some restriction sites existing on <b>the</b> pGreen <b>backbone</b> might interfere with further cloning {{procedures of the}} TuMV infectious clone. Therefore, we designed a mini binary vector that is specifically suitable for prompt construction of TuMV infectious clones. In this study, a mini binary vector (pBD 003) for agrobacterium-mediated transient expression was created. The vector was then applied to deliver virus infectious clones to the nuclei of plant cells. The vector was 4, 141  bp in size and unnecessary restriction sites were <b>removed</b> from <b>the</b> plasmid <b>backbone.</b> We used <b>the</b> strategy of compatible cohesive end of restriction enzymes, such as Avr II ligated with Nhe I, to link various comportments to avoid restriction sites remaining on the vector after ligation. The advantage of a plasmid with fewer restriction sites on <b>the</b> vector <b>backbone</b> can increase <b>the</b> usage of restriction sites. Moreover, having a miniature-sized vector can increase the rate of successful construction. This is especially useful when handling the large fragments for recombination analyses, genomic mutation, or inserting a foreign open-reading frame into the infectious clone. The pBD 003 contains a ribozyme to cleave the nascent RNA at the 3 ′-end for generation of infectious clones for non-poly A tail type of viruses. In addition, pBD 003 also has a nos terminator, which provides a polyadenylation signal to generate a poly A tail on viral RNA.

40|$|Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) {{is a rare}} genetic skin {{disorder}} caused by mutations in the COL 7 A 1 gene. The lack of type VII collagen results in absent anchoring fibrils which may cause {{the separation of the}} epidermis from the dermis in response to minimal trauma or friction. RDEB patients suffer from severe blistering and chronic wounds with their lifetimes. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for RDEB to date. Among all the currently investigating methods, gene therapy directly correct COL 7 A 1 gene expression in the targeted cells. Compared to viral gene vector, the non-viral vector is a realistic alternative that increases gene cargo capability and decreases the safety risks. However, <b>the</b> bacterial <b>backbone</b> on <b>the</b> non-viral vector and the relatively large size of COL 7 A 1 limits its transfection efficiency and the protein restoration. Here, an efficient non-viral minicircle vector was investigated by <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> bacterial <b>backbone</b> which includes prokaryote origin and antibiotic resistance gene. The reduced vector size can significantly increase the transfection efficiency. In addition, the silencing effect of the target gene can be decreased with lower immunoreactivity which leads to a long-term expression of type VII collagen. In this thesis, proper transfection approach was firstly selected from current commercially available reagents; then, the transfection efficiencies between minicircle and parental plasmid vectors were compared in different cell types. Minicircle vector with COL 7 A 1 gene was constructed. Our preliminary results suggested that the minicircle-COL 7 A 1 gene vector significantly increased the transfection efficiency and prolonged the expression of type VII collagen in vitro. To further improve the minicircle system, a tissue-specific promoter driving COL 7 A 1 gene expression in Homo sapiens was introduced into the minicircle vector for future systemic delivery study.
