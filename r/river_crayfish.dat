If by any {{accident}} they are prevented doing so, they infallibly die, because the old skin has grown so tough and hard that it hinders the increase in volume which is inseparable from {{the growth of the}} animal. The casting of the skin is induced by the formation {{on the surface of the}} inner epidermis, of a layer of very fine and equally distributed hairs, which evidently serve the purpose of mechanically raising the old skin by their rigidity and position. These hairs then may be designated as casting hairs. That they are destined and calculated for this end is evident to me from the fact established by Dr. Braun, that the casting of the shells of the <b>river</b> <b>crayfish</b> is induced in exactly the same manner by the formation of a coating of hairs which mechanically loosens the old skin or shell from the new. Now the researches of Braun and Cartier have shown that these casting hairs--which serve the same purpose in two groups of animals so far apart in the systematic scale--after the casting, are partly transformed into the concentric stripes, sharp spikes, ridges, or warts which ornament the outer edges of the skin-scales of reptiles or the carapace of crabs."[1] Professor Semper adds that this example, with many others that might be quoted, shows that we need not abandon the hope of explaining morphological characters on Darwinian principles, although their nature is often difficult to understand.|$|E

30|$|The {{complete}} range of P. semicarinata, as properly understood, seems to extend across twelve US states and two Canadian provinces, from northern Vermont and southern Quebec west to Wisconsin and Iowa, south through Kentucky. The older field observations and more recent experimental {{results can be}} combined with the morphometric survey of Dunithan et al. ([2012]) to yield an overall model for shell form in P. semicarinata across this broad range. Waters in the south, below the glacial maximum, are more lotic in their character, with a well-defined gradient of current, substrate, and predator community from headwaters to the big <b>rivers.</b> <b>Crayfish</b> predation in small streams (possibly {{in combination with other}} factors) induces the typical semicarinata form in small streams in the south, and crushing predators in large rivers induce the obovata form. Waters in the northern half of the range, above the glacial maximum, are more lentic in their character and the upstream-downstream gradient less well-defined. Thus, the intermediate P. livescens morphology prevails.|$|R
50|$|The {{lifeblood of}} the fishery is the basin's annual {{flooding}} and dewatering cycle. Overflows occur during the winter and spring rains, with many areas gradually becoming dewatered {{during the summer and}} fall. Sportfishing is popular throughout the basin. Largemouth bass, white crappie, black crappie, warmouth, bluegill, redear sunfish, and channel catfish are the primary species sought. More than 85 species of fish occur in the basin, and their populations frequently exceed 1,000 pounds per acre (100 g/m²).

50|$|The ACT {{has five}} species of {{freshwater}} crayfish in its rivers. The Murray <b>River</b> <b>crayfish</b> has an ornate spiny abdomen with four rows of spines, and two large white claws. Males have larger claws than females, and females have a fatter abdomen. The thorax has {{two rows of}} small spines. It can grow its carapace to 150 mm long. It {{is found in the}} Murrumbidgee, Cotter and Paddys Rivers, but has been extirminated by overfishing and heavy metal poisoning in the Molonglo River. A red crayfish Euastacus nobilis crassus is found in the swamps on Mount Franklin and Mount Gingera. The 5 cm long Engaeus parvulus produces a mound of dirt around the entrance of its burrow, which has a subterranean chamber more than 30 cm in diameter, and has its own pool of water at the base. Small pools of water hold the tiny Daphnia, copepods and ostracods.|$|E
50|$|Comprehensive {{measures}} {{have been taken to}} reduce the pollution and increase the water quality. These actions have benefited the fish population which include (but are not limited to) largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, sunfish, catfish, trout, chain pickerel, american eels, carp and yellow perch. Pike can be found in relative abundance in some portions of the river like Clinton and Califon. An occasional Musky has been taken out of the Raritan as well. The tidal portions of the river host migratory salt water species such as striped bass, fluke, winter flounder, weakfish and bluefish. Recently, efforts to restore anadromous fish populations have been made, done by removing many of the obsolete dams and the constructing dam bypass infrastructure. Hopefully this will result in restoring shad, striped bass, and sturgeon populations in the river. Many nesting birds and water fowl make their homes in and {{along the length of the}} river. Crustaceans such as blue claw crab, fiddler crabs and green crabs are also found in the tidal sections of the <b>river.</b> <b>Crayfish</b> can be found farther upstream.|$|E
40|$|Studying {{biological}} {{rhythms of}} activity and determining the external {{factors that influence}} behaviour of animals can be challenging in many aquatic habitats. We investigated the validity of using variations in radio-signal strength to quantify changes in activity of radio-tagged aquatic fauna on a small spatial scale under controlled conditions in the field. We monitored short-term activity (< 1 min) of two aquatic species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Murray <b>River</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Euastacus armatus), that differ markedly in their primary mode of movement. Simultaneous video monitoring confirmed that active and inactive periods for both species could be accurately determined by radio-telemetry, as were specific behaviours exhibited by trout. We were also able to quantify activity based on different radio-tag (coil and trailing whip antennas) and receiving antenna configurations (yagi and gap-loop antennas); however, we recommend use of control tags to provide reference data. Variation in radio-signal strength represents a valid means of monitoring activity of moderately site-attached aquatic species. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Transport and {{processing}} of allochthonous material {{is crucial for}} trophic pathways in headwater streams. Freshwater crayfish are known to affect and exploit the break-down of in-stream terrestrial plant material into detritus. We recorded Euastacus armatus (Murray <b>River</b> <b>crayfish)</b> individuals feeding on discrete patches of allochthonous material within an unregulated section of the Goodradigbee River, an upland stream in temperate Australia. Despite suggestions of aggressive territoriality, E. armatus were observed by remote and manual underwater filming to feed in non-aggressive aggregations on these piles of fine woody debris and leaf litter. On the basis of observations of 25 individuals found {{in the vicinity of}} the allochthonous patches, this population comprised mostly female individuals at smaller sizes of maturity than has been recorded for lowland populations of E. armatus. Our study confirms the importance of concentrated allochthonous food patches for detritivores, and points to the important trophic linkage between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems via a widespread and iconic freshwater invertebrate. Moreover, these non-aggressive feeding aggregations of E. armatus challenge notions of aggression in this species that have been developed in small-scale aquarium studies...|$|E
40|$|The first {{topic that}} must be {{considered}} is the name. Crayfish is the term most often used in technical literature and the name used in this document. However, these same animals are also known as crawfish, crawdads, and mudbugs. Rest assured, regardless of the name, they all refer to the same broad category of animals. Specifically, they are freshwater decapod crustaceans, the freshwater equivalent of shrimp and lobsters. In most years, production of crayfish in the United States is the second largest aquacultural industry. This fact surprises {{most people in the}} North Central Region (NCR) because the availability of crayfish outside the traditional production area is minimal. Most of the crayfish are produced in the southern United States (Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas and Mississippi) and most of that production is consumed in the same area. Two species comprise the majority of production—the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and the white <b>river</b> <b>crayfish</b> (P. zonangulus). Crayfish culture in those areas is seasonal, available as a fresh product from November through June.

40|$|The guppy, Poecilia reticulata, is {{a common}} study {{organism}} for behavioral and other ecological experiments (Houde, 1997). As far as we know, no previous data have been compiled regarding hormones and condition index of guppies. In this experiment we {{examined the relationship between}} circulating levels of three hormones (testosterone, 11 -ketotestosterone and cortisol) and condition index in males and also made comparisons among the hormone levels, for three guppy sites from the northern range of Trinidad – Aripo River, Marianne <b>River</b> and Small <b>Crayfish</b> <b>River.</b> Hormone samples were obtained using non-invasive water borne techniques and quantified by our collaborator. The condition index of guppies was calculated as the ratio of mass per length 3. We predicted the following relationships: positive relationships between testosterone (T) and 11 -ketotestosterone (11 KT), condition index (CI) and 11 KT, and CI and T; negative relationships between 11 KT and cortisol (C), T and C, and CI and C. We found: a positive relationship between 11 KT and C, 11 KT and T, and C and T for the Small <b>Crayfish</b> <b>River</b> population. Aripo River and Marianne River populations displayed no significant relationship between 11 KT and C, and 11 KT and T.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} the interval between radio-tracking fixes above 1 h was examined for estimates of the diel activity, diel mobility, and diel range of the Murray <b>River</b> <b>crayfish,</b> Euastacus armatus. Estimates of these diel variables were determined by radio-tracking six individuals at intervals of 1 h for three diel periods. These data were then sub-sampled to simulate radio-tracking at intervals of 2 h, 3 h, 4 h and 6 h. Our perception of diel activity was altered {{as a consequence of}} different sub-sampling intervals, and variation in activity over the diel period was lost as tracking interval was increased. Both mean diel mobility and mean diel range decreased linearly with less frequent radio-tracking. A shift from 1 h to 6 h tracking corresponded to 49 % and 55 % reduction in estimated diel mobility and diel range, respectively. However, we suggest that these trade-offs between information gain and radio-tracking effort be viewed {{in the context of a}} comprehensive understanding of home-range across multiple seasons with a view to conserving this species.

40|$|Accurate {{distribution}} and abundance estimates for rare {{and endangered species}} are necessary to ascertain extinction threats and take appropriate conservation measures. Traditional capture-based methods are imperfect for surveying elusive species such as freshwater crayfish in upland streams. We compared estimates of Murray <b>River</b> <b>crayfish</b> Euastacus armatus abundance made via direct visual assessments by snorkel, against baited remote underwater video surveys (BRUVS) and traditional hoop netting conducted in 2 montane river systems. Similar total abundances were recorded via visual survey and BRUVS across 4 sites within 1 river system where E. armatus was relatively common. In contrast, markedly lower values were obtained at these sites via conventional hoop netting methods. In another stream where E. armatus is particularly rare, the only detection of this species was via BRUVS. Average catch per unit effort (CPUE) was highest from active visual surveys (2. 99 ind. h⁻¹), followed by BRUVS (0. 63) and hoop netting (0. 13). Extremely low sampling efficiency from hoop netting was attributed to the short time periods crayfish attended baits (mean ± SE, 387 ± 209 s) relative to the rate of net retrieval (hourly). We conclude that in systems of adequate water clarity, visual surveys and BRUVS provide reliable, non-invasive methods for estimating freshwater crayfish abundance and hold promise particularly for research and monitoring of threatened Euastacus species...|$|E

It is widely acknowledged that invasive crayfish species may be instrumental in modifying benthic invertebrate community structure, but there is limited knowledge regarding the temporal and spatial extent of these effects within lotic ecosystems. This study investigates the long term changes to benthic macroinvertebrate community composition following the invasion of signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, into English rivers. Data from long-term monitoring sites on 7 <b>rivers</b> invaded by <b>crayfish</b> and 7 <b>rivers</b> where signal <b>crayfish</b> were absent throughout the record (control sites) were used to examine how invertebrate community composition and populations of individual taxa changed {{as a result of}} invasion. Following the detection of non-native crayfish, significant shifts in invertebrate community composition were observed at invaded sites compared to control sites. This pattern was strongest during autumn months but was also evident during spring surveys. The observed shifts in community composition following invasion were associated with reductions in the occurrence of ubiquitous Hirudinea species (Glossiphonia complanata and Erpobdella octoculata), Gastropoda (Radix spp.), Ephemeroptera (Caenis spp.), and Trichoptera (Hydropsyche spp.); although variations in specific taxa affected were evident between regions and seasons. Changes in community structure were persistent over time with no evidence of recovery, suggesting that crayfish invasions represent significant perturbations leading to permanent changes in benthic communities. The results provide fundamental knowledge regarding non-native crayfish invasions of lotic ecosystems required for the development of future management strategies...|$|R
