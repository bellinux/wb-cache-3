5|$|<b>Rhodium</b> finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} on white gold and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as <b>rhodium</b> flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) <b>rhodium</b> jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that <b>rhodium</b> is applied only as an electroplate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhodium</b> is a {{fission product}} of uranium-235; therefore, each {{kilogram}} of fission product contains {{a significant amount}} of the lighter platinum group metals including <b>rhodium.</b> Used nuclear fuel is a potential source of <b>rhodium.</b> However, the extraction is complex and expensive, and the presence of <b>rhodium</b> radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half-lives of the longest-lived isotope (about 10 years). These factors make the source unattractive and no large-scale extraction has been attempted.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhodium</b> is a hard, silvery, durable {{metal that}} has a high reflectance. <b>Rhodium</b> metal does not {{normally}} form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of <b>rhodium,</b> but is released on solidification. <b>Rhodium</b> has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|The element's major use (approximately 80% {{of world}} <b>rhodium</b> production) is {{as one of}} the {{catalysts}} in the three-way catalytic converters in automobiles. Because <b>rhodium</b> metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, <b>rhodium</b> is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. White gold is often plated with a thin <b>rhodium</b> layer to improve its appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium-plated for tarnish resistance.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to <b>rhodium</b> in the {{workplace}} by inhalation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has specified the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for <b>rhodium</b> exposure in the workplace at 0.1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the recommended exposure limit (REL), at the same level. At levels of 100mg/m3, <b>rhodium</b> is immediately dangerous to life or health. For soluble compounds, the PEL and REL are both 0.001mg/m3.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhodium</b> {{catalysts}} {{are used}} {{in a number of}} industrial processes, notably in catalytic carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid by the Monsanto process. It is also used to catalyze addition of hydrosilanes to molecular double bonds, a process important in manufacture of certain silicone rubbers. <b>Rhodium</b> catalysts are also used to reduce benzene to cyclohexane.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhodium</b> {{detectors}} {{are used}} in nuclear reactors to measure the neutron flux level.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhodium</b> plated {{by either}} {{electroplating}} or evaporation is extremely hard and useful for optical instruments.|$|E
5|$|The main {{exporter}} of <b>rhodium</b> is South Africa (approximately 80% in 2010) followed by Russia. The annual world production is 30 tonnes. The price of <b>rhodium</b> is highly variable. In 2007, <b>rhodium</b> cost approximately eight {{times more than}} gold, 450 times more than silver, and 27,250 times more than copper by weight. In 2008, the price briefly rose above $10,000 per ounce ($350,000 per kilogram). The economic slowdown of the 3rd quarter of 2008 pushed <b>rhodium</b> prices sharply back below $1,000 per ounce ($35,000 per kilogram); the price rebounded to $2,750 by early 2010 ($97,000 per kilogram) (more than twice the gold price), but in late 2013, the prices were less than $1000.|$|E
5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, {{by the turn}} of the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for <b>rhodium.</b> The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used <b>rhodium</b> to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.|$|E
5|$|By {{altering}} the process conditions, acetic anhydride {{may also be}} produced on the same plant using the <b>rhodium</b> catalysts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhodium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Rh and atomic number 45. It is a rare, silvery-white, hard, corrosion resistant and chemically inert transition metal. It is a noble metal {{and a member}} of the platinum group. It has only one naturally occurring isotope, 103Rh. Naturally occurring <b>rhodium</b> is usually found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, and rarely as {{a chemical}} compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite. It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals.|$|E
5|$|The common {{oxidation}} state of <b>rhodium</b> is +3, but {{oxidation state}}s from +0 to +6 are also observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{complex of}} a <b>rhodium</b> ion with BINAP {{is a widely}} used chiral {{catalyst}} for chiral synthesis, as in the synthesis of menthol.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} <b>rhodium</b> is complex because the ores {{are mixed with}} other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold and {{there are very few}} rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes <b>rhodium</b> recovery cost-effective.|$|E
5|$|Aggarwal has {{developed}} an alternative method employing the same sulfide as above and a novel alkylation involving a <b>rhodium</b> carbenoid formed in situ. The method too has limited substrate scope, failing for any electrophiles possessing basic substituents due to competitive consumption of the carbenoid.|$|E
5|$|Because it hardens {{platinum}} and palladium alloys, ruthenium is used {{in electrical}} contacts, where a thin film is sufficient to achieve the desired durability. With similar properties and lower cost than <b>rhodium,</b> electric contacts are a major use of ruthenium. The plate {{is applied to the}} base by electroplating or sputtering.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} <b>rhodium</b> {{is composed}} of only one isotope, 103Rh. The most stable radioisotopes are 101Rh with a half-life of 3.3 years, 102Rh with a half-life of 207 days, 102mRh with a half-life of 2.9 years, and 99Rh with a half-life of 16.1 days. Twenty other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from 92.926 u (93Rh) to 116.925 u (117Rh). Most of these have half-lives shorter than an hour, except 100Rh (20.8 hours) and 105Rh (35.36 hours). It has numerous meta states, the most stable being 102mRh (0.141MeV) with a half-life of about 2.9 years and 101mRh (0.157MeV) with a half-life of 4.34 days (see isotopes of <b>rhodium).</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhodium</b> {{belongs to}} group 9 of the {{periodic}} table, but {{the configuration of}} electrons in the outermost shells is atypical for the group. This anomaly is also observed in the neighboring elements, niobium (41), ruthenium (44), and palladium (46).|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhodium</b> {{has also}} been used for honors or to signify elite status, when more {{commonly}} used metals such as silver, gold or platinum were deemed insufficient. In 1979 the Guinness Book of World Records gave Paul McCartney a rhodium-plated disc for being history's all-time best-selling songwriter and recording artist.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{decay mode}} before the most {{abundant}} isotope, 102Ru, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay product before 102Ru is technetium and the primary decay product after is <b>rhodium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Whereas {{all other}} group 8 {{elements}} have 2 electrons in the outermost shell, in ruthenium, the outermost shell {{has only one}} electron (the final electron is in a lower shell). This anomaly is observed in the neighboring metals niobium (41), molybdenum (42), and <b>rhodium</b> (45).|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride nanomesh is a nanostructured {{two-dimensional}} material. It {{consists of}} a single BN layer, which forms by self-assembly a highly regular mesh after high-temperature exposure of a clean <b>rhodium</b> or ruthenium surface to borazine under ultra-high vacuum. The nanomesh looks like an assembly of hexagonal pores. The distance between two pore centers is 3.2nm and the pore diameter is ~2nm. Other terms for this material are boronitrene or white graphene.|$|E
5|$|For {{isotopes}} with {{atomic mass}} unit values {{less than that of}} the most abundant stable isotope, 106Pd, the primary decay mode is electron capture with the primary decay product being <b>rhodium.</b> The primary mode of decay for those isotopes of Pd with atomic mass greater than 106 is beta decay with the primary product of this decay being silver.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is a semiconductor. Zone {{refining}} {{techniques have}} led to the production of crystalline germanium for semiconductors that has an impurity of only one part in 1010, {{making it one of the}} purest materials ever obtained. The first metallic material discovered (in 2005) to become a superconductor in the presence of an extremely strong electromagnetic field was an alloy of germanium, uranium, and <b>rhodium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Scottish {{toxicologist}} John Duffus {{reviewed the}} definitions used {{over the previous}} 60 years and concluded they were so diverse as to effectively render the term meaningless. Along with this finding, the heavy metal status of some metals is occasionally challenged {{on the grounds that}} they are too light, or are involved in biological processes, or rarely constitute environmental hazards. Examples include scandium (too light); vanadium to zinc (biological processes); and <b>rhodium,</b> indium, and osmium (too rare).|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, meitnerium is a d-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the group 9 elements, although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to iridium in group 9 as the seventh member of the 6d series of transition metals. Meitnerium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, cobalt, <b>rhodium,</b> and iridium.|$|E
5|$|Political and {{financial}} problems led to very low {{oil prices and}} oversupply, causing most metals to drop in price. The economies of China, India and other emerging countries slowed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014 alone, 23,722,890 motor vehicles were produced in China, excluding motorbikes. This resulted in a <b>rhodium</b> price of 740.00 US-$ per Troy ounce (31.1 grams) in late November 2015.|$|E
5|$|Prediction of the {{probable}} chemical properties of meitnerium {{has not received}} much attention recently. Meitnerium {{is expected to be}} a noble metal. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions. In comparison, <b>rhodium</b> and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for <b>rhodium.</b> The oxidation state +9, represented only by iridium in +, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF9) and the + cation, although + is expected to be more stable than these meitnerium compounds. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhodium</b> {{is found}} in {{platinum}} or nickel ores together with {{the other members of}} the platinum group metals. It was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston in one such ore, and named for the rose color of one of its chlorine compounds, produced after it reacted with the powerful acid mixture aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|The metal {{was used}} by pre-Columbian Americans near modern-day Esmeraldas, Ecuador to produce {{artifacts}} of a white gold-platinum alloy. They employed a relatively sophisticated system of powder metallurgy. The platinum used in such objects was not the pure element, but rather a naturally occurring mixture of the platinum group metals, with small amounts of palladium, <b>rhodium,</b> and iridium.|$|E
5|$|Thorium dioxide is a {{material}} for heat-resistant ceramics, {{as used in}} high-temperature laboratory crucibles, as a main material or as an addition to zirconium dioxide. An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst for oxidising ammonia to nitrogen oxides, but this {{has been replaced by}} an alloy of 95% platinum and 5% <b>rhodium</b> because of its better mechanical properties and greater durability.|$|E
5|$|When refined, uranium is {{a silvery}} white, weakly {{radioactive}} metal. It has a Mohs hardness of 6, sufficient to scratch glass and approximately {{equal to that}} of titanium, <b>rhodium,</b> manganese and niobium. It is malleable, ductile, slightly paramagnetic, strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor. Uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1g/cm3, denser than lead (11.3g/cm3), but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold (19.3g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|Biomedical {{researchers}} {{have examined the}} applications of <b>rhodium</b> compounds and their derivatives in medicine and reported one potential application for a rhodocene derivative as a radiopharmaceutical to treat small cancers. Rhodocene derivatives are used to synthesise linked metallocenes so that metal–metal interactions can be studied; potential applications of these derivatives include molecular electronics and research into the mechanisms of catalysis. The value of rhodocenes tends {{to be in the}} insights they provide into the bonding and dynamics of novel chemical systems, rather than their applications.|$|E
5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading him {{to believe that he}} was working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: <b>rhodium,</b> palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later {{come to be known as}} the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is {{the seventh}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since element 112 (copernicium) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with meitnerium as part of the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium, thus implying that meitnerium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements, cobalt, <b>rhodium,</b> and iridium.|$|E
