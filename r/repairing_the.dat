5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the hurricane, immediate access to clean water was a priority for international aid agencies working in Mexico. The National Commission of Water spent another $25million (US$2.47million) of federal funds <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> damaged infrastructure for irrigation and drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell, who {{had limited}} {{communications}} with his division headquarters, {{was concerned that}} his force would be cut off by fierce and chaotic fighting at Sarimbun and Jurong to the south west, involving the Australian 22nd Brigade. Maxwell's force consequently withdrew from the seafront. This allowed the Japanese to land in increasing strength and take control of Kranji village. They also captured Woodlands, and began <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> causeway, without encountering any Allied attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Rübel family {{restored}} commercial citrus {{production and}} set about <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> earthquake damage. They successfully lobbied to have Camulos listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. In 2000, it was further designated a National Historic Landmark. Although the main house was restored in 1996, funding was not available to restore the smaller buildings until 2006, with construction completed in spring 2007. The rancho is on State Route 126, but little is visible from the highway.|$|E

5|$|The Vanport flood {{induced changes}} to the slough's system of levees, which were rebuilt {{and in some cases}} {{fortified}} to withstand a 100-year flood. Instead of <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> levee along the Peninsula Canal, the city plugged it at both ends. The disaster also affected Oregon's system of higher education. After floodwaters destroyed the Vanport Extension Center, set up in 1946, the Oregon Board of Higher Education reestablished the school in downtown Portland, where it eventually became Portland State University.|$|E
5|$|The {{spirits are}} {{forced into the}} head of a Krazoa statue, which reveals itself to be the revived Andross, the mastermind behind the spirit scheme, who flies off to resume his conquest of the Lylat System. When Falco Lombardi arrives in space, he helps Fox defeat Andross, {{restoring}} and <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> Krazoa spirits to the planet. Afterwards, Falco rejoins the Star Fox team and Krystal is recruited.|$|E
5|$|At nightfall, as {{the three}} swap stories, the great white returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull and killing the power. The men work through the night, <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> engine. In the morning, Brody {{attempts}} to call the Coast Guard, but Quint smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line {{is tied to the}} stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backwards, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment before breaking the cleats off. He then heads toward shore, intending to lure the shark to shallower waters and suffocate it, but the overtaxed engine fails.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, the Main Roads Department focused its {{activities}} on the war effort. Roads in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the most urgent maintenance works were authorised on roads for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main Roads returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The rural road network expanded in the 1950s, with Main Roads both <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. Such activity was spurred on by the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, the {{servants}} {{fend off the}} villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his will upon seeing Belle return. He spares Gaston's life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston stabs the Beast, but he loses his footing and falls to his death. The Beast dies before the last petal falls. When Belle tearfully professes her love to him, the curse is broken, <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> castle and restoring the Beast's and servants' human forms. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.|$|E
5|$|Engineers Stimers and Newton {{soon began}} <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> {{damage to the}} pilot house and reconfigured the sides from an upright {{position}} to a slope of thirty degrees to deflect shot. During this time, Mrs. Worden personally brought news of her husband's progress and recovery and was optimistic, informing the crew his eyesight would soon return but he would be laid up for some time. She also informed them President Lincoln had personally paid Worden a visit extending his gratitude. However Worden was later taken to his summer home in New York and remained unconscious for three months. He returned to Naval service in 1862 as Commander of , another ironclad.|$|E

5|$|From May 1945 No.75 Squadron {{participated in}} the Borneo Campaign. While the squadron's ground crew landed on Tarakan with the {{invasion}} force in early May 1945, delays with <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> island's airfield meant that its aircraft could not be deployed there until mid-July rather than 3May as had been originally planned. During this period No.75 Squadron's pilots remained at Morotai but conducted little flying, causing their morale to decline. Once established at Tarakan the Kittyhawks attacked targets near Sandakan and supported Australian forces during the Battle of Balikpapan in the war's last weeks.|$|E
5|$|Henry Bolingbroke {{took the}} English throne to rule as Henry IV in 1400, but {{rebellion}} {{broke out in}} North Wales shortly afterwards {{under the leadership of}} Owain Glyndŵr. In March 1401, Rhys ap Tudur and his brother Gwilym, cousins of Owain Glyndŵr, undertook a surprise attack on Conwy Castle. Pretending to be carpenters <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> castle, the two gained entry, killed the two watchmen on duty and took control of the fortress. Welsh rebels then attacked and captured the rest of the walled town. The brothers held out for around three months, before negotiating a surrender; as part of this agreement the pair were given a royal pardon by Henry.|$|E
5|$|In summer 969, Sviatoslav left Rus' again, {{dividing}} his dominion {{into three}} parts, each under a nominal rule {{of one of}} his sons. At the head of an army that included Pecheneg and Magyar auxiliary troops, he invaded Bulgaria again, devastating Thrace, capturing the city of Philippopolis, and massacring its inhabitants. Nikephoros responded by <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> defenses of Constantinople and raising new squadrons of armored cavalry. In the midst of his preparations, Nikephoros was overthrown and killed by John Tzimiskes, who thus became the new Byzantine emperor.|$|E

Several techniques were investigated including thermal and non-thermal based techniques. Ideally <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> would maintain <b>the</b> inherent properties of the substrate without losing integrity at <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> site. <b>The</b> <b>repaired</b> sites were tested for adhesion, corrosion, hardness, microhardness, surface toughness, thermal stability, ability to withstand bending of <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> site, and <b>the</b> ability to endure a high-pressure water blast without compromising <b>the</b> <b>repaired</b> site. <b>The</b> <b>repaired</b> material could not change the inherent properties of the substrate throughout each of the test in order to remain a possible technique to <b>repair</b> <b>the</b> RSRM substrate materials. One repair method, Electro-Spark Alloying, passed all the testing and is considered a candidate for further evaluation...|$|R

5|$|In the 1990s, MDSHA {{discovered}} the bridge's rarity while conducting a bridge inventory. The inventory also found premature deterioration of its supports due to galvanic corrosion involving the steel bearing pads and aluminum girder structure. Because <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> structure {{would have been}} extremely difficult, MDSHA decided to build a replacement bridge immediately {{to the west of}} the aluminum bridge; the new bridge opened in 2004 along with a slight relocation in MD32 on both sides of the bridge. The aluminum bridge was added to the state's Historic Bridge Registry and was left in place as a historic landmark after MD32's new bridge over the Patapsco River opened.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{military}} {{officials said the}} Palestinians intended to build a mosque on {{the ruins of the}} site. The statement came after workers <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> tomb painted the site's dome green, the colour of Islam. A Palestinian Authority spokesman denied the allegations and said that Arafat had ordered the renovations and for the synagogue to be rebuilt. Ghassan Shakaa, the mayor, claimed that city officials simply wanted to return the building to the way it looked before it came into Israeli hands in the 1967 Mideast war. Under intense U.S. and international pressure the dome was repainted white.|$|E
5|$|Leake had {{not brought}} many {{supplies}} to Gibraltar but provided what he could, and loaned Hesse the fleet's skilled manpower, {{of which the}} confederate garrison was desperately short. A labour force of some 500 men was assembled from the ships' companies and was put to work <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> fortifications, remounting guns dislodged by Spanish fire and hauling cannon up the Rock to increase the fire being directed onto the Spanish batteries. One of those involved, Captain Willis, played such a prominent role that the track he used was renamed (and is still known as) Willis' Road, and he also gave his name to Willis' Battery (now Princess Royal's Battery), Magazine and Guard.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{construction}} of a family of erasure correcting codes for distributed storage systems that achieve low repair bandwidth and low <b>repair</b> complexity. <b>The</b> construction is based on two classes of codes, where the primary goal of the first class of codes is to achieve a good fault tolerance, while the second class of codes aims at reducing <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> bandwidth and <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> complexity. <b>The</b> <b>repair</b> procedure is a two-step procedure where parts of the failed node are <b>repaired</b> in <b>the</b> first step using the first code. The downloaded symbols during the first step are cached in the memory and used to <b>repair</b> <b>the</b> remaining erased data symbols at no additional read cost during the second step of <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> process. <b>The</b> first class of codes is based on maximum distance separable (MDS) codes modified using piggybacks, while the second class of codes is designed {{to reduce the number of}} additional symbols that need to be downloaded to <b>repair</b> <b>the</b> remaining erased symbols. We show that the proposed codes achieve better repair bandwidth compared to MDS, Piggyback, and local reconstruction codes, while a better repair complexity is achieved when compared to MDS, Zigzag, and Piggyback codes...|$|R

5|$|Most of Norwich's city walls, {{and all of}} the gatehouses, were {{demolished}} in {{the late}} 18th and 19th century as the city industrialised, but the Cow Tower avoided destruction. The tower was now owned by the Trustees of the Great Hospital, who carried out repairs to the structure in the late 19th century, and in 1904, the British Army considered <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> tower for use as an ammunition depot. The repairs in the 19th century had used modern concrete when patching the walls, and this, combined with erosion from the river, soon caused extensive damage: wide splits formed up and down the tower along its northern side.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{cost for}} {{reconstruction}} {{was estimated at}} $2.5billion, which was estimated to take four years. The cost for <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> damaged houses was estimated at $484.8million. Following the storm, workers made emergency repairs to the destroyed bridges and roads. The cost for rebuilding roads was higher than their damage cost due to planning for future flooding. Within a month, there were repairs to the power grid {{to a level of}} 550MW, or 91.7% of what it was before Mitch struck. Water companies restored water to 60% of Tegucigalpa within a month of the storm striking.|$|E
5|$|The repairs mainly {{involved}} {{fixing holes}} in the roof and preventing the ingress of rain water, as well as <b>repairing</b> <b>the</b> weatherboards on the sides. The intervention by English Heritage led to a protracted dispute over the £30,000 cost of the repairs that was scheduled to come to trial at the High Court of Justice in April 2012. In January 2012, a settlement was reached in which Harmondsworth Barn Ltd sold the barn to English Heritage for £20,000. By that time the government had abandoned its plans to expand Heathrow Airport and the barn had become a liability for the company.|$|E
