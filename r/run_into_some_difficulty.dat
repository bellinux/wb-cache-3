50|$|Ruth and Eugene {{were also}} {{trying to have a}} baby, but <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>difficulties.</b> As a result, while they are still friends with Alison and Tom, they {{do not seem to be}} as close as they used to be. This is {{possibly}} due to feelings of jealousy, but it could just be because they now live in different houses. Ruth and Eugene are an interracial couple; Ruth is black and Eugene is white.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the death}} of Cook on 19 July 1684, {{the crew of the}} Bachelor's Delight elected Davis Captain to succeed him. However, the {{expedition}} <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>difficulty</b> as a failed attack on El Realejo, Nicaragua would result in the departure of Eaton as well as raids against Paita, Peru and Guayaquil, Ecuador turning up little of value, although the capture of several slave ships resulted in 15 slaves joining the crew.|$|R
50|$|In 1917, Bridges {{was sent}} on the Balfour Mission, {{military}} liaison to the United States under Arthur Balfour, {{soon after the}} Americans entered the war, to coordinate the sending of American soldiers to Europe. He <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>difficulty</b> because, like most British generals and politicians, he pushed for the amalgamation or incorporation of Americans into understrength British units {{to be commanded by}} British officers. This caused much friction as the American general staff felt that US troops should be commanded by US officers.|$|R
5000|$|China's {{plan has}} <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>difficulties</b> {{regarding}} the steps North Korea {{will take to}} denuclearize in exchange for aid. The Japanese chief representative claimed North Korea was demanding too much compensation in return for denuclearization. South Korea's chief representative Chun Yung-woo said it was [...] "unreasonable" [...] to expect a breakthrough on Sunday 11 February 2007. Russia's chief representative Losyukov said that the chances of reaching a two-page joint statement are slim, and if this does not work out, a Chairman's Statement will be issued.|$|R
50|$|After World War II {{the club}} resumed play locally with the youth side enjoying some early success in enjoying an undefeated season and {{capturing}} the East Westphalian title before dropping a 1:2 {{decision in the}} overall regional final. However, BVD <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>difficulty</b> involving rough play and attacks on game officials leading to {{the imposition of a}} two-year ban. The penalty was sidestepped and the team returned to play after only one year by the dissolution of BVD and subsequent formation of Delbrücker SC in 1950 which began play in the second-class city circuit.|$|R
5000|$|With Marx, he <b>runs</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>difficulty</b> in that Marx did {{not define}} {{some of his}} terms well, such as {{historical}} materialism. When it comes to religion Marx said, “Religious suffering is at once an expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering.” [...] He does not elaborate on how this protest occurs, instead he says, “Religion… is the opium of the people.” He makes no effort to change religion, only suggests it be abolished. This interrupts the hermeneutic circle. Marx {{is not interested in}} trying to find if a new interpretation of Christianity favoring the class struggle, can be found.|$|R
5000|$|Hawley {{returned}} to San Francisco to attend City College there in 1865. He {{also began to}} read law at an attorney's office. He apparently completed the coursework he wanted {{by the spring of}} 1867. However, he then <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>difficulty</b> in San Francisco, the details of which [...] "have not been preserved." [...] According to one account, he ran away to sea and ended up in China, on the losing side of the Taiping Rebellion. Supposedly, he escaped death after being captured by government forces through the good offices of the British consul. In any case, Hawley {{returned to}} the Boise Basin in 1868, and again took up mining and prospecting.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, the {{province}} of Nova Scotia allows citizens to vote by proxy if they expect to be absent. The Territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut also allow for proxy voting. Canadian prisoners of war in enemy camps were allowed to vote through proxy voting. David Stewart and Keith Archer opine that proxy voting can result in leadership selection processes to become leader-dominated. Proxy voting had only been available to military personnel since World War II, but was extended in 1970 and 1977 to include voters in special circumstances such as northern camp operators, fishermen, and prospectors. The Alberta Liberal Party <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>difficulties,</b> in that {{an unknown number of}} proxy ballots that were counted may have been invalid. Those who, through proxy voting or assistance of invalids, become knowledgeable of the principal's choice are bound to secrecy.|$|R
500|$|The band {{returned}} to the Falcon, where they played a still shambolic, but better gig in front of record executives. Meanwhile, [...] George had put the band {{in touch with their}} first manager, Richard Lowe from MRM management. They made further appearances on Welsh television to support the release of Hooked in May, but another drunken performance followed, this time in Newport. MRM sent them on a short tour in France during the second week of May, and then started their first UK wide support tour to the band Salad. When due to perform at the Cnapan Music Festival in Wales on 2 July, the band <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>difficulties.</b> The security team refused to let Matthews in as they didn't recognise her. It was only after the intervention of one of the fans of the band, actor Rhys Ifans, that she was allowed in.|$|R

40|$|The {{most recent}} {{analyses}} of infrared spectrophotometric studies of Neptune's satellite Triton concluded that both condensed methane and nitrogen are present. It was also {{concluded that the}} most likely surface configuration is a liquid nitrogen (N_ 2) 'ocean' with dry areas of solid methane (CH_ 4), and perhaps some exposed fine-grained water frost (H_ 2 O). However, this model <b>runs</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>difficulties,</b> especially when requirements of phase equilibrium between the solid and liquid components are imposed. Because {{an understanding of the}} distribution and state of volatiles is crucial in interpreting secular changes in Triton's appearance due to seasonal effects, and in planning observing strategies for the Voyager–Neptune/Triton encounter, we assess here several possible configurations for these volatiles on Triton. We conclude that the simplest volatile configuration which best satisfies the constraints with the least number of ad hoc assumptions is N_ 2 and CH_ 4 both in solid forms, perhaps partly as a microscopic mixture, but more probably as a disequilibrium assemblage, non-uniformly distributed. Thermodynamic equilibrium is then limited by seasonal transport and the finite diffusion time of CH_ 4 in crystalline N_ 2. Although a nitrogen ocean cannot be excluded, it requires very restrictive assumptions...|$|R

The Ford Foundation was also funding other pioneering innovative housing programs, including in nearby Bedford-Stuyvesant through the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation. SHIP was the first effort at low income home ownership by the City of New York and <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> initial <b>difficulties</b> due to limitations in the State constitution on [...] "gifts and loans" [...] (the discounted sales price to new homeowners was considered [...] "a gift"). At least the first 100 houses were eventually renovated under the program before it was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|A {{short time}} later, Chow <b>runs</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> {{financial}} <b>difficulties,</b> and stops going out. To make some extra money, {{he starts to}} write a science fiction series called 2046. The story {{is set in the}} distant future, about a group of heart sick individuals looking for love. The only place to find it is at a mysterious location called 2046. Virtually all of the characters in 2046 are based on people that Chow has met, such as Su Li-zhen, Lulu, or Wang Jing-wen. Whether 2046 is a place, a room, or a state of mind is never explicitly defined. Chow makes the story somewhat bizarre and erotic, and readers seem to take notice.|$|R
50|$|The {{election}} in the Shanklin South ward, held by Pugh, soon became the most high-profile battle of the campaign. Facing Pugh was Richard Priest, manager of the Riverside Centre and a town councillor, standing as an Island Independent. Fearful of splitting the anti-Pugh vote and sensing Priest had {{the best chance of}} defeating Pugh, Labour and UKIP decided not to field candidates in the ward. Meanwhile, the continuing decline of the Liberal Democrats on the island became more evident during the campaign. Aside from their local problems since their last stint in power, the national party had been battered by its involvement in government with the Conservatives. Bob Blezzard, a high-profile Liberal Democrat on the island, resigned from the party in 2012 and publicly denounced his national party leader, Nick Clegg, before announcing he would stand as an independent candidate to the council for Sandown North. Former council leader, Shirley Smart, likewise decided to resign from the party and stand as an independent in Newport South. Neither aligned themselves with the Island Independents. In the end, the Liberal Democrats were only able to field seven candidates, with group leader Reg Barry saying it was a 'shame' that Blezzard and Smart, among others, 'have turned their back'. The UKIP campaign <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>difficulty</b> when they were accused by the Conservatives of falsifying signatures on the electoral nomination forms of their candidate for Newport North - the police were unable to give judgement on the complaint before the election.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of my thesis is {{to analyze and}} compare reactions of Iceland and Ireland to financial and economic crisis {{as well as the}} aftermath of the crisis and the process of recovery as direct consequence of these reactions. Both states had financial sector couple of times bigger than their GDP before the crisis and after the fall of Lehman Brothers they <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> serious <b>difficulties.</b> However, states chose very different approaches to deal with a situation. Ireland decided to bailout its banks despite the huge increase in public debt and cost of taxpayers' money. Iceland allowed its banks to default and backed only domestic deposits. In my thesis I also analyze the fact that Ireland is a member of euro area and therefore does not possess independent monetary policy and Iceland has independent floating currency and implications that these facts had during and after the crisis on development of countries. In the last chapter I am analyzing possibilities of future development of economies and potential risks and challenges that lie ahead of them...|$|R

40|$|As Europe {{explores the}} future role of Loran-C, the {{question}} has been raised of whether Loran can form a stand-alone alternative to satellite navigation as a Basic Area Navigation system for aircraft flying under the Instrument Flight Rules. The leading alternative to GNSS {{in the view of}} many airlines is DME (Distance Measuring Equipment). But General Aviation interests are promoting Loran as both a more economical solution and a more suitable one for flight at low level. A key question within this context is whether Loran is capable of supporting non-precision approaches (NPAs) ? Given that Loran NPAs were approved in the USA many years ago, this question may appear superfluous. Nevertheless, the NPA programme there <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>difficulties,</b> <b>some</b> of which are only now being addressed by the FAA. Further, we have a much more sophisticated understanding than previously of what are commonly the largest position error components, Additional Secondary Factors (ASFs). Thus, revisiting the issue is fully justified. The paper concentrates on the accuracy of Loran-C under the special conditions of non-precision approaches to multiple runways of airports. Repeatable accuracy is also assessed under European conditions in the light of factors that include ground-wave attenuation, skywave-groundwav...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a natural}} {{assumption}} in mainstream epistemological theory that ascriptions of knowledge of a proposition p track strength of epistemic position vis-à-vis p. It is equally natural {{to assume that the}} strength of one’s epistemic position is maximally high in cases where p concerns a simple analytic truth (as opposed to an empirical truth). For instance, it seems reasonable to suppose that one's epistemic position vis-à-vis “a cat is a cat” is harder to improve than one's position vis-à-vis “a cat is on the mat”, and consequently, that the former is at least as unambiguous a case of knowledge as the latter. The current paper, however, presents empirical evidence which challenges this intuitive line of reasoning. Our study on the epistemic intuitions of hundreds of academic philosophers supports the idea that simple and uncontroversial analytic propositions are less likely to qualify as knowledge than empirical ones. We show that our results, though at odds with orthodox theories of knowledge in mainstream epistemology, can be explained in a way consistent with Wittgenstein's remarks on 'hinge propositions' or with Stalnaker's pragmatics of assertion. We then present and evaluate a number of lines of response mainstream theories of knowledge could appeal to in accommodating our results. Finally, we show how each line of response <b>runs</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> prima facie <b>difficulties.</b> Thus, our observed asymmetry between knowing “a cat is a cat” and knowing “a cat is on the mat” presents a puzzle which mainstream epistemology needs to resolve...|$|R
