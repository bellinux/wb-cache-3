This study taps into rational choice theory to first investigate how burglars select a target by relying on residence attributes to optimize a combination of perceived rewards, efforts and risk, and then tests the hypothesis that higher perceived rewards, lower effort and lower anticipated risk compensate travel effort. Using data on 650 residential burglaries committed by 650 unique burglars during the period 2006 - 2012 and the approximately 500, 000 residences in one Belgian province in a discrete spatial choice framework with the residence as the spatial unit of analysis, we find that burglars rely on effort-related attributes to distinguish between targets.
