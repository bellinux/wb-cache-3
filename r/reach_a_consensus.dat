5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel. According to Seth Killian, a former community manager for Capcom, Marvel presented {{a list of}} their own characters that {{they were interested in}} seeing in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities in order to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus.</b> Each company also had their own set of interests and priorities. Marvel characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming products. On the other hand, Capcom sought to bring more diversity into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like character that could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of Firebrand.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} any {{reference}} to a Davidic son-ship in the gospel text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent to abolish the Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more {{at home with the}} Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and Petri Luomanen, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come to abolish the sacrifices rather than substituting for them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.|$|E

5|$|Events in {{the world}} {{appeared}} to play into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War and the Austro-Turkish War); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War). At first, King Poniatowski and some reformers hoped to gain Russian support for the reforms; they attempted to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans {{as an opportunity to}} strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This line of reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. With the new Polish-Prussian alliance seeming to provide security against Russian intervention, King Poniatowski drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party. This alliance was also helped as the 1790 elections were more supportive of the royal faction then Potocki's; and the conservative faction gained enough new seats to threaten the reformers if they were to stay divided. With the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, Potocki and Poniatowski begun to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> on a more constitutional monarchy approach, and started to draft a constitutional document.|$|E

A third view is that, despite the relatively insignificant losses that the Chindits were able to inflict, their propaganda value in 1943, {{at a time when the}} Army was on the defensive, was a morale boost to the people of India and Britain, and helping to dispel the image of Japanese invincibility.

25|$|Sauk warrior Black Hawk, {{the leader}} of a band of Sauks near Rock Island at Saukenuk, was always in {{opposition}} to ceding Native American lands to white settlers and their governments. Black Hawk supported the invalidity of the Treaty of St. Louis (1804) of both the Sauk and Fox nations negotiated with the then Indiana Territory Governor William Henry Harrison. The treaty ceded territory, including Black Hawk's birthplace Saukenuk, to the United States. The Sauk are a consensus decision making society. Their representatives exceeded the authorization of merely taking under consideration what terms the United States government might put forth, bring them back to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> and then return with their treaty terms. The lack of the tribe discussing the treaty prior to being made official made it invalid by Black Hawk {{and other members of the}} tribe.

25|$|At the President's insistence, Ellie {{agrees to}} meet with two {{religious}} leaders, Billy Jo Rankin and Palmer Joss. A lifelong religious skeptic, Ellie tries to convince Joss of her faith in science by standing near a heavy Foucault pendulum and trusting that its amplitude will not increase.

25|$|With {{the failure}} to {{establish}} a political consensus after the January 1910 general election, the Liberals called a second general election in December. The Conservative leadership decided that a good test of {{the popularity of the}} tariff reform programme would be to have a prominent tariff reformer stand for election in a disputed seat. They considered Law a prime candidate, and after debating it for a month he guardedly agreed, enthusiastic about the idea but worried about the effect of a defeat on the Party. Law was selected as the candidate for Manchester North West, and became drawn into party debates about how strong a tariff reform policy should be put in their manifesto. Law personally felt that duties on foodstuffs should be excluded, something agreed to by Alexander Acland-Hood, Edward Carson and others {{at a meeting of the}} Constitutional Club on 8 November 1910, but they failed to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> and the idea of including or excluding food duties continued to be something that divided the party.|$|E

25|$|Buber {{rejected}} the idea of Zionism as just another national movement, and wanted instead to see {{the creation of an}} exemplary society; a society which would not, he said, be characterized by Jewish domination of the Arabs.

In 1925, he was involved {{in the creation of the}} organization Brit Shalom (Covenant of Peace), which advocated the creation of a binational state, and throughout the rest of his life, he hoped and believed that Jews and Arabs one day would live in peace in a joint nation. In 1942, he co‑founded the Ihud party, which advocated a bi-nationalist program. Nevertheless, he was connected with decades of friendship to Zionists and philosophers such as Chaim Weizmann, Max Brod, Hugo Bergman, and Felix Weltsch, who were close friends of his from old European times in Prague, Berlin, and Vienna to the Jerusalem of the 1940s through the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Welsh clubs {{play in the}} English league system. Prior to 1996, these clubs, {{as members of the}} Football Association of Wales, were {{entitled}} to enter the Welsh Cup, and thus eligible to take the European place that came with winning the competition. However, from 1996 onwards, these clubs were prevented from taking part, which meant that they would {{no longer be able to}} claim a European place representing Wales. However, these clubs remained as members of the FAW, meaning that it was unclear whether they would be eligible to claim one of England's European places in the event that they met the qualifying criteria. This was not a major issue as for many years the Welsh clubs were in the lower divisions of the Football League and tended not to make the latter stages of either the FA or League Cups. However, in 2008, Cardiff City reached the final of the FA Cup, which led to UEFA and the Football Association needing to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> on the club being one of England's representatives in the event of them winning the competition (this became moot as they lost the 2008 FA Cup Final). However, the question of participation in European competition was only definitively resolved in 2012, when Cardiff reached another major final (this time the League Cup Final, which they again lost). UEFA stated that there would be no bar to Cardiff City or Swansea City being eligible for one of England's places; at the same time however they prevented the FAW from offering the European place for winning the Welsh Cup to teams playing in the English league system (the FAW had invited the six clubs playing in England to participate in the 2011–12 Welsh Cup, and had hoped to persuade UEFA to allow them to give these clubs the right to claim the European place). In 2013, Swansea became the first Welsh club to gain a place representing England by winning the League Cup and qualifying for the 2013–14 Europa League.|$|E
