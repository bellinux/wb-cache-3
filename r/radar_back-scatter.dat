By digitizing the radar video signal {{it can be}} processed by a digital computer. Sea surface parameters may be calculated {{on the basis of}} these digitized images. The marine navigation radar operates in low grazing angle mode and wind generated surface ripple must be present.The marine navigation radar is non-coherent and is a typical example of an indirect wave sensor, because there is no direct relation between wave height and <b>radar</b> <b>back-scatter</b> modulation amplitude. An empirical method of wave spectrum scaling is normally employed. Marine navigation radar based wave sensors are excellent tools for wave direction measurements. A marine navigation radar may also be a tool for surface current measurements. Point measurements of the current vector as well as current maps up to a distance of a few km can be provided (Gangeskar, 2002). Miros WAVEX has its main area of application as directional wave measurements from moving ships. Another example of a marine radar based system is OceanWaves WaMoS II.|$|E

In order {{to gain a better}} understanding of these mechanisms and the vertical structure of the precipitation associated with a typhoon at different stages of development, an analysis has been carried out of the <b>radar</b> <b>back-scattered</b> signal in order to obtain the power, velocity and velocity width of the Doppler spectrum of clear air and hydrometeors. The vertical profiles of raindrop size distribution (DSD) parameters are estimated through model-based regression analysis.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the use of SAR data in the context of natural disasters. A Curvelet-based change {{detection}} algorithm is presented that automatically extracts changes in the <b>radar</b> <b>back-scattering</b> from two TerraSAR-X acquisitions – pre-disaster and post-disaster - of the same area. After a logarithmic scaling of the geocoded amplitude images the Curvelet-transform is applied. The differ-entiation is then done in the Curvelet-coefficient domain where each coefficient represents the strength of a linear structure apparent in the original image. In order to reduce noise the resulting coefficient differences are weighted by a special function that suppresses minor, noise-like structures. The resulting enhanced coefficients are transformed back to the image domain and brought to the original scaling, so that the values in the difference image describe the increase and the decrease with respect to the amplitude value in the initial image. This approach is applied on three sample data sets: flood, forest fire, and earthquake. For all scenarios including natural landscapes and urban environ-ments as well areas with changes in the radar amplitude are clearly delineated. The interpretation of the changes detected in the radar images needs additional knowledge, e. g. pre-disaster maps. The combination of both could possibly deliver a robust and reliable database for the coordination of res-cue teams after large-scale natural disasters...|$|R

Two techniques are employed: one covering a large sample area (> 1000 m 2) but working at low grazing angels only and one (short range) covering a small sample area of about 1 m 2 only, but working at higher grazing angles. They will be compared with the requirements: 1. that all samples investigated must contain sufficient scatterers to give a Rayleigh distribution at the output of the sensor and 2. that the decorrelation time is sufficiently short to obtain an adequate number of uncorrelated samples in one measurement. With both equipments the depression angles between lo and 75 o are covered. Results of measurements will be reported.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Observations of the {{physical}} properties of the snow cover and underlying young fast ice in Resolute Passage, N. W. T., Canada, were made {{during the winter of}} 1982. Detailed measurements of snow density, and ice and snow temperatures, salinities, and brine volumes were made over a period of 46 d, beginning when the ice was 0. 4 m thick and about 8 d old. The recorded values are used in a theoretical mixture model to predict the dielectric properties of the snow cover over the microwave frequency range. The results of this analysis are then used to investigate the effects of the snow properties on the <b>radar</b> <b>back-scatter</b> signatures of young sea ice.

40|$|Forward-scatter {{systems have}} been much {{neglected}} {{for the study of}} meteors and meteor streams. A great deal of this neglect stems from the complicated geometry which has made the interpretation of results difficult in the past. This no longer presents a problem because of the computer power now available. There are practical advantages in using forward-scatter in that low-power transmitters are much easier to handle than the high-power ones used in pulsed <b>back-scatter</b> <b>radars.</b> The data reduction of the CW signals is also significantly simpler. Because the forward-scatter reflection geometry increases the duration of the echoes relative to the back-scatter case, the problem of the underdense ceiling is partially alleviated. We have built a 'short hop' forward-scatter system between Ottawa and London (Ont) for which the transmitter and receiver are separated by about 500 km. With it, we are able to measure unambiguously the directions of arrival of the echoes using a 5 -antenna interferometer. Morton and Jones (1982, MN, 198, 737) have shown how the echo direction distribution can be deconvolved to yield the meteor radiant distribution for back-scatter data. We have extended the technique to the forward-scatter case and present some preliminary meteor radiant distribution maps...|$|R

Data from a digisonde and a 30 MHz coherent <b>back-scatter</b> <b>radar</b> operated at an equatorial site, Sao Luis (dip angle: 2. 7 &deg;) and from a digisonde operated at another equatorial site (dip angle: &minus; 11. 5 &deg;) are analyzed during selected days representative of differing precursor conditions of the evening prereversal vertical drift, F layer bottom-side density gradients and density perturbations due to gravity waves. It is found that radar irregularity plumes indicative of topside bubbles, can be generated for precursor vertical drift velocities exceeding 30 m/s even when the precursor GW induced density oscillations are marginally detectable by the digisonde. For drift velocities &le; 20 m/s the presence of precursor gravity waves of detectable intensity is found to be a necessary condition for spread F instability initiation. Theoretical model calculations show that the zonal polarization electric field in an instability development, even as judged from its linear growth phase, can be significantly enhanced under the action of perturbation winds from gravity waves.

30|$|Doppler radar {{observations}} {{have made}} a large contribution towards improving our understanding of middle- and upper-atmosphere dynamics. This radar echo is mainly due to radiowave scattering by atmospheric turbulence, which occurs almost universally throughout the atmosphere {{as a result of}} gravity wave (GW) breaking. In the strictness sense, the <b>radar</b> pulse is <b>back-scattered</b> by radio refractive index (RRI) perturbations caused by turbulence whose size along the radar beam is half of the radar wavelength. Understanding of the validity of the MST (mesosphere, stratosphere and troposphere)-radar observation requires a precise knowledge of how RRI perturbations are formed and behave. A basic property of the RRI of the atmosphere is that it has a static vertical gradient in terms of distribution and the turbulence velocity is divergence-free. The RRI depends on three atmospheric properties—humidity, air density and electron density. These three elements each have a static vertical gradient along which turbulence transports each element, hereby perturbing the density distribution of each element; that is to say, it produces the RRI irregularity for scattering the radar pulse. Since the turbulence motion and winds are divergence-free, PRI perturbation co-moves with the total air flow, i.e. turbulence motion plus winds. This can be true even in the mesosphere where the perturbation is controlled electromagnetically. Co-movement of turbulence with local winds has been shown from a comparison of observations with radars and radiosondes. In addition to tracking turbulence as wind-tracers, MST-radar observations provide important data in the study of atmosphere turbulence dynamics.|$|R

It would be useful to measure the delay caused by tropospheric anomalies in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite signals (phase of the <b>back-scattered</b> <b>radar</b> wave) that could be interpreted as deformation. From the delay estimated through the GPS data processing, the tropospheric tomography of electromagnetic waves refractivity, has been performed using the SIMULps 12 software. The aim {{of this study was to}} perform software synthetic tests by using SIMULps 12 applied to atmospheric tomography and to verify the influence of the different GPS geodetic network configurations on obtaining a reliable tomography. Three different anomalies of increasing complexity have been investigated in order to understand the representative parameters of a correct tomography, the best spatial resolution and the portions of space in which the tomography is reliable. The tests also focused on fixing/establishing the a-priori atmospheric model and the critical values of the main parameters involved in the tomographic inversion. To this end, we made a random choice of two days, necessary to define the tomographic problem. Three different network configurations with 15, 30 and 90 GPS receivers were studied. The results indicate that the well-resolved area of tomographic images increases with the number of GPS receivers not linearly, and that the actual GPS network of 42 receivers is capable of revealing/detecting the atmospheric anomalies. </p...|$|R
30|$|Since Wolf’s discovery, in 1859, of the {{dependence}} of Sq amplitudes on the sunspot number, this relation has been extensively studied. It is known that there exists an almost linear relationship between the sunspot number and Sq amplitudes. The early work on this subject was summarized by Chapman and Bartels (1940). Yacob and Prabhavalkar (1965) and, in the following year, Yacob and Radhakrishna Rao (1966) examined Sq(H), as observed at Alibag (18.6 ° north in geographic coordinates) from 1905 to 1960, {{and concluded that the}} increase of daily Sq(H) amplitudes with increasing solar activity is due to the effect of solar activity on the ionization intensity. They also pointed out that solar activity controls not only the amplitudes but also controls the phase of the diurnal Sq(H) component, that is, the maximum of the Sq(H) tends to occur at a later time of the day in greater-sunspot years. Rastogi and Iyer (1976) explained this as a combination effect of ionospheric conductivity and electric field. Later, Vikramkumar et al. (1984) supported their idea after examining VHF <b>back-scatter</b> <b>radar</b> data. Briggs (1984) pointed out that Sq amplitudes correlate with the solar radio emission at 10.7 cm (F 10.7). He also showed evidence for the effect of 27 -day solar rotation on the Sq amplitude. Takeda (1999, 2002 a) found that the intensity of the equivalent Sq current system at a solar maximum is about twice as large as that at a solar minimum. Takeda (2002 b) showed that the solar-activity dependence of the Sq variation is explained as an effect of the local ionospheric conductivity.|$|R
40|$|The giant radar/radio {{astronomy}} dish near Arecibo, Puerto Rico, {{was conceived}} by William E. Gordon in early 1958 as a <b>back-scattering</b> <b>radar</b> system {{to measure the}} density and temperature of the Earth’s ionosphere up to a few thousand kilometers. Gordon calculated the required size of the antenna by using the Thomson cross-section for scattering by the electrons, and assuming that the elementary scattered waves would be incoherent. During the summer and autumn of 1958 Gordon led a study group that published a design report in December 1958. The report showed that a dish 1000 feet in diameter would be required, and described a limestone sinkhole in Puerto Rico {{that would make a}} suitable support for such a dish. Meanwhile, in November 1958, Kenneth L. Bowles per-formed an ionospheric radar experiment that showed that the Gordon calculation for the scattered power was roughly correct, but that the calculated spectral width was too big. The consequence of these results was that a dish substantially smaller than 1000 feet could have satisfied the original goals for the radar. However, from the spring of 1958 the value of 1000 feet had been {{in the minds of the}} study team, and a large suite of important experiments that such a dish could do had been identified. These apparently became the raison d’être for the project, and the possibility of shrinking the dish to accomplish only the original goals seems to have been ignored. The project was sold to a new federal funding agency, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which was interested, in part at least, because ballistic missiles traveled through the ionosphere and it was important to fully understand that environment. Gordon’s original calculation contained a remarkably beneficial error. Without it, it is doubtful that such a large dish would have been built...|$|R
40|$|Future {{spaceborne}} SAR {{systems will}} operate in bi- and multistatic configurations {{to gain more}} information of the illuminated region. Such additional information might be the extraction of bistatic radar cross section or the simultaneous scene acquisition from different bistatic angles. Furthermore, a considerable cost reduction {{can be achieved by}} applying one radar illuminator and several passive receivers. For the definition of such SAR configurations, a bistatic airborne SAR experiment has been accomplished between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the French “Office National d’Etudes et de Recherches Aérospatiales” (ONERA) with their airborne SAR systems E-SAR and RAMSES. One of the two radar systems serves both as transmitter and receiver while the other is receiving the <b>back-scattered</b> <b>radar</b> echoes. Different configurations have been designed to achieve a maximum of useful radar data which will be investigated with respect to the bistatic angle and other issues as e. g. the applied synchronisation. The two main configurations are the along-track configuration where both aircraft are flying in close succession and the across-track configuration where both aircraft are flying alongside. The E-SAR was flying in front of RAMSES in along-track configuration for flight stability reasons. To ensure a sufficient synchronisation between the transmitting and the receiving-only system, the GPS time signal is used for the nonrecurring synchronisation of both radar systems directly before data acquisition. Several modifications have been implemented into both systems to realise this synchronisation strategy which permits a sufficient phase and timing stability of both the transmitted and received radar signals during the time of a radar data take. Some calibration targets have been set up in the test area for both mono- and bistatic radar data. This paper describes the flight configurations for the data takes of the bistatic airborne SAR experiment. The challenges that had to be met are outlined such as the platform motion which will affect the resulting common antenna footprint, or the applied synchronisation strategy. The effect of the synchronisation is shown and analysed in the bistatic radar data. The influence of the applied processing algorithm is examined by results of processed radar images and an overview of the processing status of bistatic interferometric SAR data is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of lightning-related casualties typically occur during thunderstorm initiation (e. g., first flash) or dissipation (e. g., last flash). The physics of electrification and lightning production during thunderstorm initiation is fairly well understood. As such, the literature includes {{a number of}} studies presenting various radar techniques (using reflectivity and, if available, other dual-polarimetric parameters) for the anticipation of initial electrification and first lightning flash. These radar techniques have shown considerable skill at forecasting first flash. On the other hand, electrical processes and lightning production during thunderstorm dissipation are not nearly as well understood and few, if any, successful techniques have been developed to anticipate the last flash and subsequent cessation of lightning. One promising approach involves the use of dual-polarimetric radar variables to infer the presence of oriented ice crystals in lightning producing storms. In the absence of strong vertical electric fields, ice crystals fall with their largest (semi-major) axis in the horizontal associated with gravitational and aerodynamic forces. In thunderstorms, strong vertical electric fields (100 - 200 kV m(sup - 1)) have been shown to orient small (less than 2 mm) ice crystals such that their semi-major axis is vertical (or nearly vertical). After a lightning flash, the electric field is typically relaxed and prior radar research suggests that ice crystals rapidly resume their preferred horizontal orientation. In active thunderstorms, the vertical electric field quickly recovers and the ice crystals repeat this cycle of orientation for each nearby flash. This change in ice crystal orientation from primarily horizontal to vertical during the development of strong vertical electric fields prior to a lightning flash forms the physical basis for anticipating lightning initiation and, potentially, cessation. Research has shown that radar reflectivity (Z) and other co-polar <b>back-scattering</b> <b>radar</b> measurements like differential reflectivity (Z(sub dr)) typically measured by operational dual-polarimetric radars are not sensitive to these changes in ice crystal orientation. However, prior research has demonstrated that oriented ice crystals cause significant propagation effects that can be routinely measured by most dual-polarimetric radars from X-band (3 cm) to S-band (10 cm) wavelengths using the differential propagation phase shift (often just called differential phase, phi(sub dp)) or its range derivative, the specific differential phase (K(sub dp)). Advantages of the differential phase include independence from absolute or relative power calibration, attenuation, differential attenuation and relative insensitivity to ground clutter and partial beam occultation effects (as long as the signal remains above noise). In research mode, these sorts of techniques have been used to anticipate initial cloud electrification, lightning initiation, and cessation. In this study, we develop a simplified model of ice crystal size, shape, orientation, dielectric, and associated radar scattering and propagation effects in order to simulate various idealized scenarios of ice crystals responding to a hypothetical electric field and their dual-polarimetric radar signatures leading up to lightning initiation and particularly cessation. The sensitivity of the K(sub dp) ice orientation signature to various ice properties and radar wavelength will be explored. Since K(sub dp) is proportional to frequency in the Rayleigh- Gans scattering regime, the ice orientation signatures should be more obvious at higher (lower) frequencies (wavelengths). As a result, simulations at radar wavelengths from 10 cm down to 1 cm (Ka-band) will be conducted. Resonance effects will be considered using the T-matrix method. Since most K(sub dp) Vbased observations have been shown at S-band, we will present ice orientation signatures from C-band (UAH/NASA ARMOR) and X-bd (UAH MAX) dual-polarimetric radars located in Northern Alabama. Issues related to optimal radar scanning for the detection of oriented ice will be discussed. Preliminary suggestions on how these differential phase signatures of oriented ice could contribute to lightning initiation and cessation algorithms will be presented...|$|R
