We evaluated prospectively the presence of acid <b>reflux</b> disease, <b>oesophagitis</b> and the accuracy of pH monitoring in the prediction of oesophagitis in a population of irritable infants. A 24 -h oesophageal pH monitoring with a glass electrode and an upper gastro-intestinal tract endoscopy with grasp biopsies were performed in 60 irritable infants, aged 1 to 6 months, not responding to cow's milk elimination. The 24 -h oesophageal pH monitoring was considered abnormal in 40 / 60 (66 %) babies and histological oesophagitis was present in 26 / 60 (43 %). In the infants with histological <b>oesophagitis,</b> the <b>reflux</b> index (% of the investigation time with a pH 5 % in 18 / 26 (69 %). Histology of the oesophagus was normal in 22 of the 40 (55 %) infants with an abnormal pH monitoring. The mean reflux index in the group with oesophagitis (12. 20 %) was significantly higher than in the group with normal histology (8. 74) (P = 0. 036), although there was an important overlap. The sensitivity and specificity to predict <b>oesophagitis</b> with a <b>reflux</b> index of 5. 0 % or more was 69. 2 and 35. 3, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{high level}} of gastric acid {{secretion}} {{is considered to be}} a risk factor for <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> or Barrett's oesophagus. Corpus gastritis may have a protective effect on the oesophagus, because of decreased gastric acid output. AIM: To determine if corpus gastritis is associated with <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> or Barrett's oesophagus. METHODS: Three antral and two corpus biopsies were taken from consecutive patients in whom Helicobacter pylori testing was requested during endoscopy at a single centre between January 1995 and May 1997. Antral and corpus gastritis was studied by histology; H. pylori was studied by histology, culture and CLO test. A regression model was used to test for correlation between <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis,</b> Barrett's oesophagus and risk factors. RESULTS: During the study period, 676 patients had biopsies taken during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Endoscopic signs of <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> and Barrett's oesophagus were observed in 125 and 23 patients, respectively. Corpus gastritis was found in 59 % of patients without <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> or Barrett's oesophagus, 45 % of patients with <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> and 30 % of patients with Barrett's oesophagus.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{is not a}} {{risk factor}} for {{gastro-oesophageal}} <b>reflux</b> and <b>oesophagitis,</b> and there are arguments suggesting that H. pylori may actually protect against gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease patients are less often infected with H. pylori than controls. If infected, they may have less severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and H. pylori infected duodenal ulcer patients without gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are potentially at risk of developing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease after eradication of the organism. In addition, H. pylori also affects the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. H. pylori eradication may decrease the acid-lowering capacity of proton pump inhibitors and H 2 receptor antagonists, and it could induce or aggravate gastro-oesophageal reflux. Proton pump inhibitor treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease may be associated with an accelerated development of atrophic gastritis in H. pylori positive patients, suggesting that H. pylori should be diagnosed and eradicated in these patients. The role of H. pylori in duodenogastric reflux remains controversial. SCOPUS: sh. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Exposure in the upright period correlated closet (r= 0. 92 : p less than 0. 001) with that during the total period. Recumbent exposure correlated with both upright and postprandial exposure (p less than 0. 001). Acid exposure during all four periods correlated significantly with the severity of oesophagitis, but postprandial acid exposure correlated best and recumbent acid exposure least well. Although acid clearance in the total, recumbent and upright periods correlated with oesophagitis, postprandial clearance showed the closest relationship.

Only scattered erosions were observed in the antioxidant pretreated group but acid suppression by ranitidine was not effective in decreasing the severity of <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis.</b> Significantly increased amounts of malondialdehyde (MDA), increased nuclear factor κB (NFκB) activation, and depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) were observed in experimentally induced <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis.</b> DA- 9601 pretreatment attenuated the decrement in mucosal GSH levels and decreased MDA formation significantly.

Studies were reviewed according to predefined eligibility and quality criteria. Twenty-seven studies/trials {{were included in the}} systematic review. Results: Study variation rather than therapy-influenced results in relation to {{the presence or absence of}} oesophagitis in patients with duodenal ulcer who underwent H. pylori eradication at 6 – 48 months follow-up. In patients with <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> no obvious differences were discovered in heartburn scores, 24 -h pH values, healing and relapse rates between H. pylori-positive and -negative cases. Conclusion: There is no evidence to indicate that H. pylori eradication in duodenal ulcer disease provokes <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> or worsens heartburn; (ii) there are insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about the impact of H. pylori in patients with <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} the {{oesophagus}} of an aromatic oil, guaiacol, has been examined {{in a group of}} 20 patients with <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> and also normal volunteers. This agent produced a rapid and sustained rise in resting lower oesophageal sphincter pressures and the peristaltic pressures induced in response to swallowing liquids. This compound may prove useful in the treatment of patients with <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> and other disorders of oesophageal motility...|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms of {{gastro-oesophageal}} reflux were studied by oesophageal manometry and pH monitoring in 33 children: nine controls, 15 with {{gastro-oesophageal reflux}} alone, and nine with <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis.</b> A total of 122 episodes of reflux were analysed in detail: 82 (67 %) were synchronous with swallowing and 40 (33 %) asynchronous. Infants with trivial symptoms had gastro-oesophageal reflux synchronous with swallowing, whereas those with serious symptoms had slower acid clearance and asynchronous reflux. There {{were significant differences}} in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and amplitude of oesophageal contractions between controls and patients with both gastro-oesophageal reflux and <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis.</b> In <b>reflux</b> <b>oesophagitis</b> there was a decrease in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and the contractions had a bizarre waveform suggesting a neuropathic process...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: There {{is little}} {{evidence}} regarding the benefit of stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) outside a critical care setting. Overprescription of SUP is not devoid of risks. This prospective study aimed {{to evaluate the use}} of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for SUP in a general surgery department. METHOD: Data collection was performed prospectively during an 8 -week period on patients hospitalized in a general surgery department (58 beds) by pharmacists. Patients with a PPI prescription for the treatment of ulcers, gastro-oesophageal <b>reflux</b> disease, <b>oesophagitis</b> or epigastric pain were excluded. Patients admitted twice during the study period were not reincluded. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists guidelines on SUP were used to assess the appropriateness of de novo PPI prescriptions. RESULTS: Among 255 patients in the study, 138 (54 %) received a prophylaxis with PPI, of which 86 (62 %) were de novo PPI prescriptions. A total of 129 patients (94 %) received esomeprazole (according to the hospital drug policy). The most frequent dosage was at 40 mg once daily. Use of PPI for SUP was evaluated in 67 patients. A total of 53 patients (79 %) had no risk factors for SUP. Twelve and two patients had one or two risk factors, respectively. At discharge, PPI prophylaxis was continued in 33 % of patients with a de novo PPI prescription. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the overuse of PPIs in non-intensive care unit patients and the inappropriate continuation of PPI prescriptions at discharge. Treatment recommendations for SUP are needed to restrict PPI use for justified indications...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{mechanisms}} underlying {{symptoms in}} GERD, particularly in non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), {{remain to be}} fully elucidated. Weakly acidic reflux and presence of gas in the refluxate could be relevant in the pathogenesis of symptoms. Design and PATIENTS: To assess the relationship between symptoms and weakly acidic, acid and mixed (liquid + gas) reflux, 24 -hour oesophageal pH-impedance monitoring was performed in 32 NERD and in 20 oesophagitis patients. In 12 NERD patients the study was repeated following 4 -week PPI treatment. Impedance-pH data were {{compared with those of}} 10 asymptomatic controls. Heartburn and acid regurgitation were considered in the analysis of symptoms. RESULTS: 15 NERD patients showed a physiological acid exposure time (pH-negative). Weakly acidic reflux was significantly less frequent in patients (25 +/- 2 %, m+/-SE) than in controls (54 +/- 4 %, p< 0. 01). Gas was present in 45 - 55 % of reflux events in patient groups and controls and decreased following PPI treatment. In NERD pH-negative patients, weakly acidic reflux accounted for 32 +/- 10 % (vs 22 +/- 6 % in NERD pH-positive and 12 +/- 8 % in <b>oesophagitis</b> patients), mixed <b>reflux</b> for more than 2 / 3 of all symptom-related refluxes. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that in NERD pH-negative patients risk of reflux perception was significantly higher when gas was present in the refluxate (odds ratio: 3. 2; 95 % confidence intervals: 1. 2 - 10; p< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: The large majority of symptoms, in all patients, are related to acid reflux. In NERD patients, presence of gas in the refluxate significantly enhances probability of reflux perception. These patients are also more sensitive to less acidic <b>reflux</b> than <b>oesophagitis</b> patients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Information on the {{relationships}} between gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), reflux symptoms, hiatal hernia (HH) and oesophagitis, and the response to antisecretory treatment is lacking. In a multicentre study endoscopy, ambulatory 24 -h pH monitoring and symptom assessment were carried out in 142 patients with symptomatic reflux disease before and during treatment with ranitidine. Using a randomized, double-blind design, patients took ranitidine 150 mg bid or 300 mg bid. Macroscopic oesophagitis (grade I or II) was found in 85 patients; the remaining 57 patients had normal oesophageal mucosa. A significant correlation {{was found between the}} presence of an HH and the presence of oesophagitis. Symptom scores were similar in patients with and without oesophagitis, and in patients with and without HH. Patients with oesophagitis had significantly greater oesophageal acid exposure during the night, and in the total 24 -h period, but not during the day. Likewise, patients with HH had greater acid exposure during the night (p < 0. 008). Both doses of ranitidine significantly decreased oesophageal acid exposure and the effect was independent of baseline acid exposure. Reflux symptoms cannot be used to differentiate between presence or absence of <b>oesophagitis</b> and/or HH. <b>Reflux</b> patients without <b>oesophagitis</b> have less night-time reflux. Ranitidine dose-dependently decreases oesophageal acid exposure, and the effect is independent of baseline reflu...|$|R
