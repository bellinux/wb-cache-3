Rosete assumed {{office as}} the first duly elected and {{appointed}} President of the University effective February 12, 2001, {{the start of the}} full operation of the institution as a multi-campus university system. With a viable organizational structure, the institution transformed dramatically as it accelerated the full integration of its component campuses. Through strong partnership with the Provincial Government, DepEd and municipal governments, RMTU had established LGU-subsidized satellite campuses in Masinloc, Castillejos, and Sta. Cruz in the year 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Faculty development and infrastructure build-up were intensified. Degree programs increased from 12 to 65 in the last nine (9) years. Enrolment expanded from 2,000 to 8,000 per semester over the same period. Massive scholarships from various stakeholders attracted more and more students. Graduates registered commendable performance in licensure examinations especially in electrical, mechanical and civil engineering and other flagship programs. In addition to its Php 93.0M annual budget from the National Government, income from <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>projects</b> and self-liquidating academic programs reached as high as Php 80.0M per year. Major curricular programs attained various accreditation levels and RMTU achieved an unprecedented Level III-A status under the Commission on Higher Education-Department of Budget and Management-Philippine Association of State Colleges and Universities (CHED-DBM-PASUC) Leveling Scheme. The CHED also listed RMTU {{as one of the top}} 30 higher education institutions (HEIs) recognized by the People’s Republic of China, South Korea and other countries.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a procedurally fair provision mechanism that allows {{members of a}} small group to determine, through their bids, which project to implement. Previous experiments with (only) costly projects have demonstrated that the mechanism is efficiency enhancing. Our experiment tests whether the mechanism remains conducive to efficiency when revenue-generating, but less efficient, projects are made available. We find {{that this is not the}} case. Additionally, we detect no significant difference in bid levels depending on whether mixed valuations are present or absent, and on whether the others’ valuations are known or unknown. We interpret these results as evidence that the availability of <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>projects</b> engenders a biased perception of the efficient costly project...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to provide the reader with basics of the legislative framework of the cohesion policy of the European union within the current programming period 2007 - 2014. The emphasis is put on {{the implementation of the}} cohesion policy on the national level. The thesis should acquaint the reader with bodies and procedures, which have been set by the Comission towards transparent execution of the policy. The second part of this thesis deals with the main differences and changes the Comission proposed in proposals of the Cohesion policy regulations. Finally, the last part deals with the <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>projects</b> and will define the main changes in the methodology. For purposes of this thesis was chosen the priority axis "The Improvement of Water Management Infrastructure and Reduction of Flood Risks"...|$|E

This paper contributes to understanding the readiness of these municipalities to issue municipal bonds as an alternative way of financing. The aim is to prove that if the funds are successfully managed and associated with <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>project</b> does not need rigidity. Alternatives for implementation of the projects are too many {{despite the fact that}} municipalities are small. Also, despite the fact that municipalities are small and developing economies are usually centralized in the capitals in the country, neither Skopje (the capital in Republic of Macedonia) will attempt to realize the municipal bond. Processing of paper used data analysis, statistical calculations, synthesis and similar methods for data analyzing. Used methods are qualitatively and quantitatively supporting the thesis of this paper. ...|$|R

40|$|A reliable, {{cost-effective}} {{and safe}} transportation {{system is essential}} to economic growth. To keep pace with demands for network capacity, <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>projects</b> are increasingly being used to complement the current procurement practices and lessen the pressure on public finances. In such transportation networks where there exists a mix of free access links and links with user fees, network interconnectivity {{is an important component}} of project valuation. A bilevel stochastic recourse model for valuating network flexibility is formulated. A key component of the model is consideration of network-based managerial flexibility in context of the upper level project valuation objective and the lower level network user equilibrium solution under demand uncertainty. The results from a test network, for which a closed form solution is possible, indicate that the value of network flexibility directly depends on initial network conditions, variance in future travel demand and toll pricing decisions.

40|$|Local {{borrowing}} {{is one of}} {{the hardest}} issues in Indonesia decentralization agenda. Under Law no. 22 / 1999 and Law no. 25 / 1999 local governments are allowed to make borrowing with some restrictions:! All local government borrowings (from domestic or abroad) should be accepted by local parliament and central government. This means that central government has the authority to evaluate all aspects related to the borrowings made by local government. Central government can stop the borrowing process if the proposal is not acceptable (Law No. 22 / 1999). ! Local government can make short-term and long-term borrowings. Short-term borrowing (less than one year loan) is made only for cash-flow requirements and should be fully repaid in the current budget year. Long-term borrowings are used to finance local infrastructure, and it should be <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>projects</b> with a direction to social benefit. The loan proposal should be accepted by central government (Law No. 25 / 1999). It is natural that a local government needs borrowing to finance part of its expenditures. Under Indonesian decentralization policy, local government revenue capabilities have been increased significantly through central transfers (mainly the block grant DAU an...|$|E
40|$|The {{developing}} countries, {{especially in}} the Balkans, barely use the municipal bonds as an alternative way of financing their activities. This paper {{is part of the}} project “The municipal bonds as an alternative source of financing municipals activities and the effective management of funds, with a special emphasis to the Municipality of Stip, R. Macedonia”. The paper has an important impact, according to both academic and practical perspective. It combines the experts’ academic analysis with the municipals potential in order to facilitate a successful municipal bond emission that would support the local economic growth. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the ability and willingness of the Municipality of Stip to issue municipal bonds. The main hypothesis states that the Municipality of Stip is able to issue a municipal bond as an alternative way of financing its investment activities. The research includes the classical SWOT analysis regarding the Municipality of Stip and continues with a statistical analysis based on correlation and regression relationships within the accounts of the Municipality’s annual reports. The methodological framework is based on quantitative research methods (correlations and regression methods) which result in acceptance of the main hypothesis in the paper - the municipal bonds as an alternative source for funding municipal’s activities are justified, especially if the funds are associated with a specific revenue-generating project. The findings would serve as a basis for the municipal bonds prospect, which would be the ultimate goal of combining the academic knowledge with the practical potential of the Municipality of Stip. The conclusions reveal that this would be the first municipal bond emission in the Republic of Macedonia. However, this fact can serve as an advantage in the market in terms of introducing financial instrument innovation. This paper suggests that the usage of municipal bonds is far away from a risky activity, especially if the funds are invested in <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>projects.</b> Municipal bonds can be a less expensive source of funds for the municipal’s projects, rather than different forms of domestic or foreign borrowings. In this way, municipalities can use this financial instrument to initiate and support local economic growth...|$|E
50|$|Revenue {{bonds are}} most often issued to finance a <b>revenue-generating</b> public works <b>project</b> such as, bridges, tunnels, sewer systems, {{education}} (e.g. college dorms and/or student loans). In the case of education or school systems, bonds issued for {{colleges and universities are}} generally backed by income or other progressive taxes. General obligation bonds may be backed by a variety of credits depending on the state and local law; those credits include taxes on local property (ad valorem), regressive taxes and/or all other sources of revenue to the municipality. As a general rule, revenue bonds are backed by the revenue generated by the municipal facility funded by the bond issue. A feasibility study should be conducted to compare one project's IRR (internal rate of return, or hurdle rate) to another proposed project, as it is most important to ensure the success of the municipality. For instance, local government and port authorities can propose construction for a given neighborhood, based on projects that have been successful previously, or it can create a nonprofit authority to issue revenue bonds to build a school district, for example.|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis, public and private investment has stagnated due to loss of confidence and austerity policies. The supply side for investment is complex, with the boundaries between public and private often blurred. The overall landscape varies widely between countries, but is characterised by the growing importance of national promotional banks (NPBs) in economic development. Carefully calibrated financial instruments, often provided through NPBs, can provide sustainable support for <b>revenue-generating</b> / saving <b>projects</b> in areas like SME support, R&D&I and energy efficiency where market imperfections result in suboptimal levels of investment. The uptake of ESI Fund co-financed FIs has increased in 2014 - 20, but remains focused on loan-based SME support. The regulatory framework for ESIF co-financed FIs has improved, especially through mandatory ex ante assessments, but the implementation of FIs remains challenging for Managing Authorities, suggesting that more timely guidance, more stable rules, and perhaps more ‘off-the-shelf’ instruments would be beneficial. However, the plethora of initiatives at domestic and European levels can make the FI ‘scene’ difficult to decipher and quantify. Related, there is evidence of policy competition, pointing to the need to rationalise modes of intervention and tailor FIs to the relevant institutional and economic context...|$|R
40|$|Since {{transportation}} infrastructure projects have {{a lifetime of}} many decades, project developers must consider not only the current demand for the project but also the future demand. Future demand is of course uncertain and {{should be treated as}} such during project design. Previous research for Southwest Region University Transportation Center (Report 167556) explored the impact of uncertainty on roadway improvements and found neglecting uncertainty to lead to suboptimal network design decisions. This research is extended in the current work by considering not only motor vehicle traffic, but other modes as well. The first half of this report examines the problem of network flexibility in the face of uncertainty when constructing a potentially <b>revenue-generating</b> toll road <b>project.</b> Demand uncertainty and network design are considered by way of a bilevel stochastic recourse model. The results from a test network, for which a closed form solution is possible, indicate that the value of network flexibility directly depends on initial network conditions, variance in future travel demand, and toll pricing decisions. The second half of this report integrates Environmental Justice into the transit frequency-setting problem while considering uncertainty in travel demand from protected populations. The overarching purpose is to improve access via transit to basic amenities to: 1) reduce the disproportionate burden transit dependent populations’ experience; and 2...|$|R
