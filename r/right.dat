40|$|Although {{collective}} cultural <b>rights</b> {{are included}} in international human <b>rights</b> law, their precise place and their nature and significance are not well-explored or understood. This paper aims to show where collective cultural <b>rights</b> {{can be found in}} international human <b>rights</b> law and explore how these <b>rights</b> fit in the general body and framework of international human <b>rights</b> law. The starting point in this chapter is international human <b>rights</b> law, which implies that the analysis of collective cultural <b>rights</b> is framed by positive law and international legal instruments, such as treaties and conventions, as well as by soft law instruments, such as declarations, recommendations and resolutions. In this paper, the two categories of collective <b>rights</b> and cultural <b>rights</b> are defined, drawing a distinction between a) different types of collective <b>rights,</b> including <b>rights</b> for collectivities as such, <b>rights</b> for individuals as members of collectivities, and <b>rights</b> with a collective interest or object; and b) between different types of cultural <b>rights,</b> including <b>rights</b> that explicitly refer to ‘culture’ and <b>rights</b> that relate to culture or have a cultural dimension. This paper furthermore analyses various contentious issues surrounding collective <b>rights</b> and cultural <b>rights</b> in international human <b>rights</b> law, including the lack of clarity on the object and subject of these <b>rights.</b> The paper then outlines the different forms of collective cultural <b>rights</b> in international human <b>rights</b> law, by providing examples of legal provisions in international human <b>rights</b> law that can be classified as collective cultural <b>rights.</b> Finally, the paper elaborates on how collective subjects and collective cultural interests are integrated in international human <b>rights</b> law and analyses how and to what extent collective cultural <b>rights</b> provisions provide answers to the above-noted issues...|$|R
40|$|In an East and West {{debate on}} human <b>rights,</b> {{scholars}} from different cultures disagree on whether all {{civil and political}} <b>rights</b> are human <b>rights.</b> While they generally agree that basic civil <b>rights</b> such as <b>rights</b> against torture and slavery (i. e., physical security <b>rights)</b> are human <b>rights,</b> some of them argue that traditional political <b>rights</b> in the West such as {{freedom of speech and}} political participation (i. e., liberal <b>rights)</b> are not human <b>rights.</b> Some scholars, such as Daniel A. Bell, argue that liberal <b>rights</b> are not human <b>rights</b> because liberal <b>rights</b> conflict with some East Asian cultures. In this dissertation, I argue that both physical security <b>rights</b> and liberal <b>rights</b> are human <b>rights,</b> and explain the relationship between these <b>rights</b> and East Asian cultures. First, I argue that if liberal <b>rights</b> are not human <b>rights</b> because they conflict with some East Asian cultures, then physical security <b>rights</b> are also not human <b>rights</b> because physical security <b>rights</b> also conflict with some East Asian cultures. Next, I discuss the idea from Daniel Bell and Michael Walzer that physical security <b>rights</b> are human <b>rights</b> because they are minimal values. Based on their idea, I explain what minimal values are, and why it is possible to develop some maximal theories of physical security <b>rights</b> in East Asian cultures. I argue that since physical security <b>rights</b> are minimal values, they are still human <b>rights</b> even they conflict with some East Asian cultures. I then argue that liberal <b>rights,</b> similar to physical security <b>rights,</b> are also minimal values, and it is possible to develop some maximal theories of them in East Asian cultures. Therefore, similar to physical security <b>rights,</b> liberal <b>rights</b> are also human <b>rights</b> even they also conflict with some East Asian cultures. I also discuss other human <b>rights</b> debates, especially the debates between Daniel Bell and other philosophers. Charles Taylor argues for an overlapping consensus approach on human rights; Jack Donnelly argues for a Western liberalist approach on human <b>rights.</b> I explain the relationship between these approaches and my arguments, and how my arguments can help them to reply to the challenges from Daniel Bell...|$|R

This chapter aims to classify collective cultural <b>rights</b> in international human <b>rights</b> instruments and to explore how these <b>rights</b> fit in the general framework of international human <b>rights</b> law.
