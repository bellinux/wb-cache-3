50|$|Rack Jobbing {{began in}} the 1930s with the Music Dealers Service with their music sheet racks which they operated. Because the {{ownership}} of the products remain {{the property of the}} <b>rack</b> <b>jobber,</b> the potential loss incurred by the seller is reduced if nobody buys the product. The proceeds of the sale from the product are then divided/shared by the <b>rack</b> <b>jobber</b> and retailer. Historically, possibly, one of the main products that have been supplied to stores in this fashion are record LPs. Other items that rack jobbers supply have been beauty aids, greeting cards, hardware, paperback books and toys. The display, maintenance and stock rotation of the merchandising are the responsibility of the <b>rack</b> <b>jobber</b> who must periodically come into the store.|$|E
50|$|The first LP <b>rack</b> <b>jobber</b> in the U.S. was Elliott Wexler (1913-1966) {{who started}} Music Merchants in Philadelphia in 1952.|$|E
5000|$|One {{record label}} whose {{catalogue}} was sold via rack jobbers was Sutton, {{which was founded}} by Bob Blythe, {{the former president of}} Tops Records. In 1963, the label began with 225 records in its catalogue, which was sourced from labels that included Music Craft, Omega and Tiara. Another record label that found its way into the racks was Crown Records, a budget label owned by the Bihari brothers. [...] In the 1960s, one third of record sales were from records sold via rack jobbers. Eventually the rack jobbers moved into more traditional department stores by making arrangements with the retailer in various ways. One of them was asking the retailer to allow a certain amount of sell-space and the <b>rack</b> <b>jobber</b> deciding what goes in the space. Also there could be a verbal guarantee that all of the products would be sold and if not, the next time around, the <b>rack</b> <b>jobber</b> would bring back merchandise that would.|$|E

2500|$|Jobber: A jobber is {{a special}} type of wholesaler, {{typically}} one who operates {{on a small scale}} and sells only to retailers or institutions.

50|$|A <b>rack</b> <b>jobber</b> (also {{known as}} a rack merchandiser) is a company or trader that has an {{agreement}} with a retailer to display and sell products in a store. The outlets for the products would be ones that traditionally don't stock such products such as gas stations, grocery stores and others not traditionally associated with the products sold. Often the products are of a budget variety.|$|E
50|$|The label was a {{subsidiary}} of Modern Records. It was formed some time prior to March 1965 and according to an article in Billboard, {{it was a new}} label that already had 31 LPs in its catalogue. The records were to sell at $1.98 as opposed to the other budget LPs that retailed at 98 cents and 99 cents. Saul Bihari recognized the value of the <b>rack</b> <b>jobber</b> for these types of records.|$|E
5000|$|Frank DiLeo {{graduated}} from Central Catholic High School. DiLeo {{began his career}} in the music industry in the late 1960s, shortly after high school, as a <b>rack</b> <b>jobber</b> (distributing records to retail stores) in Pittsburgh. Following a number of brief, higher-profile jobs, he was hired as a promotion staffer in Cleveland by CBS Records subsidiary Epic Records in 1968. He promoted albums by The Hollies, Donovan and Sly & the Family Stone to local radio stations, and was later promoted to the company's regional office in Chicago. Circa 1969 he was [...] "headhunted" [...] by RCA Records in New York City, followed by a stint at Bell Records. After a year with Bell he [...] "retired" [...] from the music business and moved back to Pittsburgh. His return to the music industry was prompted by an [...] "electrical fire" [...] which destroyed his Pittsburgh home, for which his insurance carrier reportedly refused to pay out.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, it was {{reported}} in the March 2 issue of Billboard that Blythe had launched a new record label called Sutton Records, a subsidiary of his recently formed Sutton Enterprises.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Sniderman {{expanded}} {{the business with}} franchise and corporate stores in Toronto and elsewhere. The expanded business was called Roblan Distributors (named for Sam Sniderman's son Robert and Sid Sniderman's daughter Lana (d. August 2012)) and conducted business at the store level as Sam the Record Man. Some stores were not full franchises but used Roblan Distributors as their principal <b>rack</b> <b>jobber</b> and were known as RD 2000 stores. A warehouse to service the franchises and flagship store was established at 110 Bond Street incorporating the accounting and head offices which had previously been located at Yonge Street. It later moved to much larger facilities at 274 Church Street. This building was demolished and became a parking lot in the late 1990s after record companies agreed to direct ship orders to the franchise stores, thus rendering {{the need for a}} central warehouse redundant. (Previous to this the record companies would ship at no cost only to a few designated locations and that with a minimum order value.) The accounting, offices, and some warehousing facilities were moved back to 110 Bond Street, but closed when the chain filed for bankruptcy. Both properties were sold to Ryerson University along with the Yonge Street properties in January 2008.|$|E
50|$|In the late-1980s, Disney began seeking other outlets to {{distribute}} its video, {{and decided to}} ink deals with mass-merchant retailers such as Target, Caldor, and Walmart. In 1989, Disney sought to further control the distribution of its products by eliminating the use of <b>rack</b> <b>jobbers.</b> Around this time, the studio began partnering with major retailers for advertising campaigns.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1965 Ray {{started his}} own business, Ray Lawrence, Ltd. to {{specialize}} in promoting phonograph records and servicing <b>rack</b> <b>jobbers,</b> one stops and retail record outlets.

5000|$|Sutton {{was founded}} in 1963 by Bob Blythe, {{formerly}} of Tops Records, was a label known for budget exploito albums. One band that had records released under its own name but destined straight for the cut out bins to be filled by the <b>rack</b> <b>jobbers</b> was the New Dimension. Surf music producers Tony Hilder and Bob Hafner provided the material. One album to meet this fate was Soul with The New Dimensions, released on Sutton SSU 336. Another one by the same group was Surfn Bongos that years later would end up be auctioned {{under the heading of}} THE New Dimensions Surfn Bongos ~ Fuzz Garage Surf Exploito 1963 Sutton LP. As announced by Billboard in 1965, Pat Collins aka the [...] "Hip Hypnotist" [...] was to do a couple of albums for the label.|$|R
50|$|The typical exploito {{album is}} aimed at the unsuspecting buyer with the {{attraction}} of a budget price. In the United States Alshire was one label that released this type of album. In Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the label there was Arc. The current hits of the day would be recorded. Sometimes local musicians would be used. Also some extra original compositions would be added by hired writers or people that worked for the label.One example of how an exploito album imitates a genuine release is the Mark, Don & Terry album which has the layout and cover art and design copies a recent release of a legitimate album. They often ended up being put into stores by <b>Rack</b> <b>Jobbers.</b> Some of the releases are by unknown or no-name artists and the sound quality and packaging {{in the early days}} made for an inferior product.|$|R
50|$|Modeled {{after the}} names of bands in the 1950s, Joe Crane and his Hoodoo Rhythm Devils signed with Capitol Records under the {{direction}} of Michael Sunday and Jack Leahy, made their first record <b>Rack</b> <b>Jobber's</b> Rule in 1971. The name was too big of a mouthful, so it was shortened to the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils. Roger Allen Clark, fresh from the Steve Miller Band, was added on drums with the second album, The Barbecue of DeVille on Blue Thumb Records in 1972. The Hoodoos toured extensively that year playing with Savoy Brown, The Doobie Brothers, Steely Dan, Chuck Berry, John Lee Hooker, Graham Central Station, Tower of Power, Mott the Hoople, Bloodrock, and The Tubes. Roger Clark left to become a studio session drummer working for Rick Hall at Muscle Shoals Sound in Alabama. Keith Knudsen, formerly of Lee Michael's band and later the Doobie Brothers, then joined for a short stint on drums from late 1972 to mid 1973 before Jerome Kimsey joined the band for the recording of their third album, What the Kids Want, for Blue Thumb Records in 1973. The Hoodoos continued to tour the USA and Joe began having some of his songs covered by Johnny Winter, The Chambers Brothers, Rodger Collins, and Patti LaBelle.|$|R
