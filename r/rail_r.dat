5000|$|In its heyday, Pagwa {{was busy}} with {{commercial}} activity. Goods transported by rail to Pagwa for the Trade Post were unloaded from boxcars onto a long wooden chute that slid the goods downhill to the doorstep of the Post. Each year large wooden barges were constructed at Pagwa to float goods by steamer to villages along the Kenogami and Albany Rivers as far as Ogoki and Fort Albany. The barges were built from douglas-fir timbers brought from British Columbia by <b>rail</b> (<b>R.</b> Ferris, 2010).|$|E
50|$|Parasites {{include the}} sucking lice Nirmus cuspidiculus and Pediculus ralli, the tick Ixodes frontalis, and the louse fly Ornithomyia avicularia. The water rail can be {{infected}} by the avian influenza virus and the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, carried by Ixodes ticks, {{which is also}} a human pathogen causing Lyme disease. Three lice, Fulicoffula rallina, Pseudomenopon scopulacorne and Rallicola cuspidatus discovered on dead water rails in 2005 on the Faroe Islands were all species that had not been found on the archipelago previously. The parasitic flatworm Ophthalmophagus nasciola was found in one rail's nasal sinus, and at least three species of feather mite have been detected on the plumage. The louse Philopterus ralli and the nematode Strongyloides avium have been found on the closely related brown-cheeked <b>rail</b> <b>R.</b> a. indicus.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its distinctive plumage, it has very different vocalisations from the water rail, and it was considered a separate species in early works, including the first edition (1898) of Fauna of British India, but later demoted to a subspecies by E. C. Stuart Baker in the second edition (1929). It was restored as a full species, the eastern water <b>rail,</b> <b>R.</b> indicus, by Pamela Rasmussen in her Birds of South Asia (2005). Rasmussen, an expert on Asian birds, also renamed the other forms as the western water rail. Her treatment has gained acceptance, and is followed in Birds of Malaysia and Singapore (2010). A 2010 study of molecular phylogeny further supported the possibility of specific status for R. a. indicus, which is estimated to have diverged from the western forms around 534,000 years ago. The paper also suggested that {{the differences between the}} three other races were clinal, and that they should all be merged into R. a. aquaticus.|$|E

40|$|Rail play a {{important}} part in train {{if there is any}} problem at rail then simply train cannot operate as well or cannot operate. Undesirable problems that is extension of rail because can endanger safety, so many research to make extension of rail be better. <b>Rail</b> <b>R</b> 42 used in Indonesia since long time, because time efficiency factor and usage of train more than past time so needing larger ones rail.

Therefore writer research of welding rail extension R 54 -R 42,purpose to know and analyse material characteristic of rail, analysing microstructure of extension result of thermite welding, knowing the nature of is mechanical of extension result of rail thermite welding R 54 -R 42. Some material testing which have been done there are spectrometric test that used to know about the composition and influence composition toward hardness step, microhardness vickers for measure hardness value, and SEM for observing surface topograph. This research showing if hardness of R 54 rail base metal have big value better than R 42 base metal. Kinds of defect is porosity, crack, and inclusion.

50|$|The L.A. county Transportation Commission took years, {{but finally}} in 1990 {{approved}} {{the construction of}} the subway connecting North Hollywood to Hollywood, East Hollywood, Koreatown, Westlake and downtown Los Angeles along the Metro <b>Rail</b> <b>Red</b> Line. That followed the Los Angeles City Council unanimously endorsing North Hollywood as the northern terminal of the Red Line. The final route has termini at Union Station and North Hollywood. The North Hollywood Metro Subway station opened in June 2000. Close to half a million people took advantage of free rides on the 17.4 mi Red Line subway in its first weekend in operation.

40|$|Recent {{court cases}} and news reports on transit {{projects}} {{have focused on}} the effects of construction on business revenue and survival, yet the topic remains underexplored in the scholarly literature. This thesis examines whether transit construction negatively affected businesses’ revenue and survival along the second segment of the Los Angeles Metro <b>Rail</b> <b>Red</b> Line under Vermont and Hollywood Boulevards. Using regression analysis on National Establishment Time-Series data, I find that business survival was lower along the corridor than for the county as a whole, but not significantly different from a nearby control corridor. I also find little evidence of revenue impacts. These findings suggest that revenue loss from transit construction is not the main mechanism by which businesses are displaced and that {{further research is needed to}} understand the source of community concerns...|$|R
