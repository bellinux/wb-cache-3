By the late 1970 's romans were dominant between Kalk Bay and Arniston and also important contributors else-where, but seventy-fours were only recorded in any significant quantities from Port Alfred. Interpretation of these trends is complicated by a lumping of catches, but {{the possibility of an}} environmental change favouring romans (cooler water) at the expense of seventy-fours (warmer water) cannot be discounted. Other marine forms having a biology associated with cooler waters have also increased along the southern Cape coast in recent years. Redfish resources at Gans Bay and Struts Bay are not currently overexploited, but provide a valuable source of remuneration for local fishermen when preferred target species are absent. Limited data collected in the Tsitsikamma Coastal National Park indicate that dageraad C. cristiceps populations could deteriorate rapidly if subjected to high fishing pressure. The contribution of dageraads to combined redfish landings is currently highest in areas of low exploitation...|$|E
