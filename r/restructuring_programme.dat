After sixty American visitors were stranded by a strike of Air Greenland employees and the company refused to make alternate arrangements for their return, ticket sales slumped and the route was closed in March 2008.|$|E

25|$|The firm {{suddenly}} found itself without {{the vast majority}} of its business (despite later receiving financial compensation for the physical assets seized by Mobutu's regime) but managed to survive: full ownership passed to conglomerate Société Générale de Belgique, where it was grouped with its other metals and mining interests. As a reflection of its enforced departure from the Katanga Province, the new, simplified name Union Minière was adopted. With its more European focus, Union Minière began to grow its business again through the 1980s, initially largely organically. In 1989 however, Société Générale announced plans to merge Union Minière with three other Belgian metals companies in which it held a significant stake: zinc producer Vieille Montagne (with a history stretching back to 1805); Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt, which dealt {{in a wide range of}} metals including copper, cobalt, and lead; and Mechim, an engineering firm. The much enlarged company was initially renamed Acec-Union Minière (although the prefix was dropped in 1992) and subsequently set about streamlining its organisational structure, but the global economic downturn of the early-to-mid-1990s hit profits and forced management to implement a major <b>restructuring</b> <b>programme</b> in 1995. The three-year plan, implemented under the guidance of recently appointed CEO Karel Vinck, involved the loss of around 25% of Union Minière's workforce and the sale of a number of non-core assets, including a zinc wire operation, French roofing material retailer Asturienne and much of the company's exposure to the diamond products sector (including Diamant Boart).|$|E
2500|$|Earlier still, at the {{transition}} between the MB I and MB II, a large-scale <b>restructuring</b> <b>programme</b> was undertaken in a possible effort to transform Kabri into an idealised Syrian-style city – a powerful city-state centred around a magnificent and well-fortified palace. The area was fortified, {{and an additional}} [...] were enclosed within a large glacis, a type of earthwork fortification that was [...] wide with a stone core and that encircled the tel as it appears today. The glacis was topped by mudbrick and stone. There was an MB I palace and this was expanded into the MB II palaces. This <b>restructuring</b> <b>programme</b> resulted {{in some parts of}} the tel being flattened out and a large portion of the population having to find new homes in the city, as a result of part of the MB IIA palace – along with certain parts of the rampart – being built in an area previously occupied by private houses. Kabri's ancillary sites (such as Achziv and Avdon) were also built up, and migration from the hinterland to Kabri – and its secondary sites – increased dramatically as a result of these projects. Kabri became the capital of a major polity, with the newly expanded MB II palace at its centre.|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis which hit Southeast Asian countries in July 1997 {{had a significant}} impact on the countries' economies and forced governments in the region to undertake <b>programmes</b> of financial <b>restructuring</b> in order to reduce weaknesses in banks' balance sheets, stabilise currencies and, most importantly, to improve the soundness of the banking and financial sectors. The main aim of such policies was to restore confidence and help meet the ongoing challenges associated with financial innovation and globalisation. The causes and consequences of the Asian crisis have been studied extensively in the past decade. However, the literature on the impact of the post-crisis crisis <b>restructuring</b> <b>programmes</b> on bank efficiency, performance and competition, and their evolving relationships, remain rather limited and inconclusive. This study aims to shed some light on these interrelated aspects, with particular reference to the experience of six of the countries mostly affected by the crisis - Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand - during their recovery period (1999 to 2005). Results from the efficiency analysis, carried out by means of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), show evidence of efficiency improvements in the region thereby indicating a positive impact of the <b>restructuring</b> <b>programmes</b> on the banking sector. Between 1999 to 2005 most of the countries in our sample actively followed policies of either closing failing institutions or fostering mergers. As a consequence, bank concentration in the region increased, raising the issue of the impact of the <b>restructuring</b> <b>programmes</b> on the competitive structure of banking markets. We found that, despite increased concentration, competition (assessed by the Panzar-Rosse Hstatistic) also increased leading us to conclude that the structural changes in South East Asia improved the region's banking industry performance without resulting in banks enjoying excessive market power. These lessons from the Asian crisis may prove valuable in the light of current re-structuring of global banking systems in the light of the 2008 credit crisis...|$|R
2500|$|In May 2007, SAA {{launched}} an 18-month comprehensive <b>restructuring</b> <b>programme</b> which aimed {{to make the}} airline profitable. According to then-CEO Khaya Ngqula, this came largely after [...] "uncompetitive ownership and aircraft lease costs, excessive head count and fuel price volatility". The programme involves: the spin-off of businesses into seven subsidiaries, thereby allowing SAA to concentrate on its core business of passenger and cargo transport; grounding SAA's Boeing 747–400 fleet; rationalising international routes (Paris was dropped altogether); the axing of 30% of the airline's managers; among other reductions. This was expected to save the airline R2.7billion (US$378.2million). By June 2009, R2.5billion had been saved.|$|E

40|$|The {{reintegration}} of South Africa {{into the}} global economy and technological change on many fronts has increased the need for investment in human capital to make South Africa's industry globally competitive. This paper describes how a partnership was formed between government, industry and educators in South Africa and Canada to develop university-level wood products education programmes capable of producing the managers needed to make South Africa's wood processing industry globally competitive. We describe the revitalisation of the professoriate at the Stellenbosch University and Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, the institutions that offer these education programmes, and then describe how these institutions worked with the University of British Columbia in Canada to <b>restructure</b> their <b>programmes.</b> We also describe how the delivery of the <b>restructured</b> <b>programmes</b> is making use of new digital educational technologies to overcome the educational divide between academia and industry. The partnership with industry has been {{critical to the success of}} the wood processing industry educational strategy and we describe the strategies that were used to foster this partnership.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was the design, {{development}} and evaluation of online problem-based learning resources for use with postgraduate teachers studying through distance education at the University of Birmingham. Following their participation in online problem-based learning within two modules of a <b>restructured</b> <b>programme,</b> feedback from the students was collected and analysed. The findings suggest that ‘traditional’ campus based learning and teaching approaches such as problem-based learning (PBL) can be adapted for use in professional training courses offered through distance learning. They also provide evidence that an appropriate induction programme, together with clear guidance on time management, as well as adequate tutor and technical support are important to enable students to overcome potential barriers to online learning and participation. The broader implications of the findings for embedding e-learning within PBL for similar profiles of students are explored in a Final Project Report with recommendations made for future practice...|$|R
