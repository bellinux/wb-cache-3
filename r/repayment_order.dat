5000|$|In February 20, several banks ordered their {{investors to}} repay about 20% to 25% of their loans {{to the bank}} within a few days. By some accounts, this {{was asked by the}} Central Bank of Myanmar. This led to further {{hardship}} for customers, where, in one geographic division, people who borrowed for purchasing homes were asked to return 25% of their loans back. Though there is no exact data on what followed, there is contemporary reporting that suggests people had to [...] "sell assets or downgrade their business and lifestyles” in order to meet these loan calls. By February 25, some banks revised their earlier demands for 25% of the outstanding loans repayments to 50%. The Central Bank of Myanmar’s timetable initially required that all required repayments were to be paid by the end of March 2003. General Khin Nyunt, on March 29 said in a press conference that he “would like to urge those who have taken loans from the banks to strive to repay their debts speedily in consideration of those who have deposited money in the banks, and to ensure the long term interest of the banks and strengthen the national economy". However, the deadline later got pushed back to May 2003 as a lot of the recalled debt was not paid back.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a method by which the {{economic}} value of loan advice can be measured. This is achieved by defining advice in terms of the forecasts of future <b>repayments</b> in <b>order</b> to produce a disutility-minimising loan strategy. The economic value of this strategy is then calculated by considering the fee one is willing to pay to avoid switching to a competing strategy during each period. Applying the methodology to UK fixed and variable mortgage rates produces performance fees that are high when advice takes account of the dynamics of repayments. Moreover, the conditions under which these fees are significantly different from zero are identified...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, I {{turn to a}} {{historical}} accounting {{of the development of}} Commission procedures and powers, and to the changing background conditions in which state aid controls existed. I focus on those developments which bear most strongly on the Commission’s ability to exercise effective control. The exposition will be partly chronological and partly thematic. First, I will examine the first major application of state aid rules, export aid for intra-Community trade. Second, I will turn to early Commission efforts in the area of regional aid, in which the system of differentiated aid maxima for different regions of the Community were created and expanded. Third, I will consider the impact that the addition of new, poorer member states has had on state aid policy. Fourth, I consider Commission efforts in two important sectors, textiles and automobiles. Fifth, I analyze the introduction and development of the most important horizontal framework, that for research and development. Sixth, the focus shifts to the question of efforts to evade legal history of state aid rules and their application. In particular, this will focus on Commission initiatives such as the Transparency Directive and the rules on cumulation of aids, and especially on the use of <b>repayment</b> <b>orders</b> beginning in the mid- 1980 s. Seventh, I consider the crucial cases defining the powers of the Commission (in particular, Philip Morris) and the rights of third parties.

40|$|Repayment {{rigidity}} in microfinance contracts {{has always}} been crucial in order to discipline borrowers and ensure repayments. However, a strict repayment schedule might also inhibit entrepreneurship and force borrowers to undertake low-risk but also low-return investments. A possible solution is therefore to introduce more flexibility in the repayment mechanism. We build a simple adverse selection model where a monopolistic microfinance lender faces two types of present-biased borrowers who have different misperceptions about their future utility; the MFI's problem is {{to decide whether or}} not to provide a flexible repayment schedule within the microfinance contract. Our main result is that if the pool of clients is made of a sufficiently high share of entrepreneurial borrowers, it is always more profitable for the lender to provide both a rigid and a flexible repayment schedule than simply a rigid repayment contract. Surprisingly, it is still more profitable even though the contract doesn't perfectly screen out very present-biased borrowers who enter the flexible schedule but end up not being able to repay in the final period. However, this implies that more entrepreneurial borrowers are always charged a higher <b>repayment</b> rate in <b>order</b> to compensate the other borrowers' potential default...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of credit}} scoring - the {{quantitative}} and statistical techniques {{to assess the}} credit risks involved in lending to consumers - {{has been one of}} the most successful if unsung applications of mathematics in business for the last fifty years. Now with lenders changing their objectives from minimising defaults to maximising profits, the saturation of the consumer credit market allowing borrowers to be more discriminating in their choice of which loans, mortgages and credit cards to use, and the Basel Accord banking regulations raising the profile of credit scoring within banks there are a number of challenges that require new models that use credit scores as inputs and extensions of the ideas in credit scoring. This book reviews the current methodology and measures used in credit scoring and then looks at the models that can be used to address these new challenges. The first chapter describes what a credit score is and how a scorecard is built which gives credit scores and models how the score is used in the lending decision. The second chapter describes the different ways the quality of a scorecard can be measured and points out how some of these measure the discrimination of the score, some the probability prediction of the score, and some the categorical predictions that are made using the score. The remaining three chapters address how to use risk and response scoring to model the new problems in consumer lending. Chapter three looks at models that assist in deciding how to vary the loan terms made to different potential borrowers depending on their individual characteristics. Risk based pricing is the most common approach being introduced. Chapter four describes how one can use Markov chains and survival analysis to model the dynamics of a borrower's <b>repayment</b> and <b>ordering</b> behaviour. These models allow one to make decisions that maximise the profitability of the borrower to the lender and can be considered as part of a customer relationship management strategy. The last chapter looks at how the new banking regulations in the Basel Accord apply to consumer lending. It develops models that show how they will change the operating decisions used in consumer lending and how their need for stress testing requires the development of new models to assess the credit risk of portfolios of consumer loans rather than a models of the credit risks of individual loan...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we use Household Budget Survey data {{to analyze the}} {{evolution}} of the household credit market in the Czech Republic over the period 2000 – 2008. While the share of households that borrow remained stable and below 40 %, the amount of debt outstanding increased. We estimate a series of models of the determinants of borrowing. We next merge our data with the Statistics on Income and Living Conditions in 2005 – 2008, which contain direct information on <b>repayment</b> behavior, in <b>order</b> to test the validity of the standard debt burden measure as a predictor of default. We propose an alternative indicator – the adjusted debt burden (ADB), defined as the ratio of loan repayments to discretionary income, constructed as net income minus the living minimum (the minimum cost of living for a given household composition as set by the Czech Statistical Office), which {{turns out to be a}} superior predictor of default risk. Limited by the data, we use a fairly broad concept of default, namely, the inability to make loan repayments on time. Based on the distribution of default risk across the levels of the adjusted debt burden, we suggest that a 30 % ADB threshold should be used as the definition of overindebtedness, with an average default risk of 17 %. Finally, we show that overindebtedness and local economic shocks are closely related, suggesting that default risk should be always considered in the context of regional economic conditions.

50|$|Courten had a son, Peter, by {{his first}} wife, who was made a baronet by James I in 1622 (see Courten baronets); married Jane, {{daughter}} of Sir John Stanhope, and died without issue early in 1625. He is usually described as of Aldington, Worcestershire. Courten's second wife was a daughter of Moses Tryon, and by her he had a son, William, and three daughters, Hester (wife of Sir Edward Littleton); Mary (wife of Anthony Grey, 9th Earl of Kent); Anna (wife (1) of Essex Devereux, heir of the 5th Viscount Hereford and (2) of Sir Richard Knightley). William, the younger, found his father's estate seriously embarrassed by the proceedings of his cousin Peter Boudean, who declined to surrender any of the Dutch property. Complicated litigation continued. Courten married Catharine Egerton, daughter of John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater; and, resolving to carry on his father's business, chartered with his father-in-law's aid, two vessels (Bona Esperanza and Henry Bonaventura) for trade in the East Indies. In this enterprise nearly all his money was invested, and the ships with their cargoes were seized by the Dutch in 1641. The Earl of Bridgewater declined to assist Courten further; the disturbed state of the government rendered any help from that quarter out of the question; and in 1643 bankruptcy followed. Courten's landed estates were alienated to his brother-in-law, the Earl of Kent, and Courten retired to Italy. His wife endeavoured in vain {{to come to terms}} with Peter Boudean, and finally joined her husband, who died intestate at Florence in 1655. Two children, William and Katharine, survived him. The former endeavoured to recover some of his father's property, and in 1660 Charles II granted to George Carew, who had been associated in business with Sir William Courten, power to administer the estates of Sir William and his son. Proceedings were also begun in Holland against the Dutch East India Company for compensation for the ships lost in 1641; the English courts of law and parliament were constantly petitioned for redress until the end of the century, but the greater part of the enormous wealth of Sir William Courten never reached his descendants. In August 1660 the privy council heard evidence in support of the claims of Courten's grandson to the ownership of the Barbadoes, but did not deem the proof sufficient. In 1677 petitions to the council and parliament rehearsed the loans of Courten and Sir Paul Pindar to Charles I, but <b>repayment</b> was never <b>ordered.</b> George Carew issued many tracts on the subject, but public interest was not excited.|$|R
40|$|The Pecos River is a {{lifeline}} {{of water that}} flows through the arid region of eastern New Mexico and west Texas. Along its course, farmers use its waters for irrigation and communities use it for drinking water and recreation. Through much of the twentieth century, the river could not meet all the demands placed on it, {{setting the stage for}} regular disputes among those reliant on its waters. Seeking a measure of predictability in their respective shares to the river, the states negotiated, and the U. S. Congress approved, the Pecos River Compact in 1949. Despite this mutual agreement, disputes continued. As the upstream state, New Mexico has control of all the river’s surface waters until it crosses into Texas. Texas claimed New Mexico was taking more than its share and ultimately sought its day in court—the U. S. Supreme Court sitting in its original jurisdiction. The Court designated a Special Master to hear the evidence, determine liability, and calculate the extent of damages (if any) in beyond the retirement of his predecessor, Special Master Charles Meyers found that for nearly forty years, New Mexico had breached the Compact by failing to deliver an accumulated 340, 100 acre-feet of water. Rather than converting that water deficit into monetary damages, his Report recommended that the Court <b>order</b> <b>repayment</b> in kind, or in specie. The Court agreed and ordered judgment in Texas’s favor, authorizing repayment in water. The Special Master also recognized that if damages could be awarded in specie, then interest in water might also be appropriate. He recommended that the Court award “water interest”—a novel version of postjudgment interest—to prevent New Mexico’s procrastination in repayment. While the Court approved of the in specie damages award, it summarily disposed of the water interest issue in a footnote, saying it was unpersuaded that water interest should be awarded “unless and until it prove[d] to be necessary. ” However, by failing to disapprove of the concept outright or outlining guiding principles for when and how water interest ought to be applied, the Court opened the door for potentially enormous liability. As competition for scarce natural resources increases, litigants are increasingly seeking to have courts apply “water interest” to in specie awards. This Comment analyzes the issue that the Court disposed of in a footnote. It examines the propriety of water interest, finding that additional water above the award is not necessary to fully compensate the plaintiff. However, because the upstream party is a fiduciary of the water and has heightened duties to protect the property of its downstream neighbor(s), courts should consider restitutionary remedies to prevent the upstream state’s unjust enrichment. This Comment establishes that interest is a necessary component of restitution, and thus water interest is a justified component of an in specie remedy. The Comment then explores practical implications of awarding water interest and establishes guidelines for its correct application through a case study of United States v. Board of Directors, Truckee-Carson Irrigation District...|$|R
40|$|POLICY QUESTION: “Based {{on results}} of pilot {{programs}} and policies implemented {{in other parts}} of the country, how can New York City/State best support and incentivize responsible small-dollar lending in low-income communities?” RECOMMENDATION: Design a borrower’s card system to collect information about consumers’ borrowing and repayment behaviors, to encourage lenders to extend loans to low-income individuals in need, and to incentivize consumers to take ownership of their own financial behavior. PROBLEM STATEMENT: In many states, the payday lending market has operated to meet the strong consumer demand for short-term small-dollar loans. In the realm of small-dollar lending, the payday lending market provides access for low-income individuals who might be classified as higher risk consumers, likely due to blemished credit histories. Lenders compensate for this higher risk by charging a higher interest rate, which would allow for the possibility that the borrower does not repay the loan. However, though the payday lending market is competitive, significant information asymmetries exist for both the lender and the borrower, which leave lenders unable to discern between high-risk and low-risk consumers, and leave borrowers with an unclear understanding of the terms of the loans and often, with increased amounts of debt. The reliance on payday loans poses significant problems for borrowers, however. Research has shown that consumers often are unable to repay within a single pay period and thus have to roll over their loan for another borrowing period, and accrue another fee. Therefore, for many borrowers, what starts off as a short-term loan turns into long-term payments because of rollover and chronic borrowing patterns. Furthermore, within the industry, only a few states seem to have a standardized database housing information on borrowing and repayment history for payday loan consumers. The lack of a centralized system makes it difficult to keep track of where consumers are originating their loans, how often they are taking out payday loans, and their true ability to repay. More responsible loan programs are characterized by a variety of criteria to ensure access to credit without trapping borrowers in additional debt. These characteristics include annual percentage rate caps, extended loan terms, multiple installment payment plans, proper underwriting of loans based on a borrower’s ability to repay, and financial counseling or a savings component. The tension in designing an alternative program is in balancing consumer need and incentive, market failures in information asymmetries, and business profitability concerns in order to meet the demand for these loans while not encouraging or incentivizing unscrupulous or predatory behavior. CRITERIA: 1) Minimize risk associated with consumers’ ability to repay loans: This criterion aims to reduce the risk associated with a consumer’s ability to repay by either better assessing consumer riskiness or ensuring that whatever consumer risk does exist does not prohibit or limit the potential for the loan to be repaid. 2) Provide incentive for lenders to make loans with a positive expected value: A viable alternative will provide the incentive for lenders to rationally extend a loan by reducing consumer risk, allowing lenders to better examine consumer risk, or by guaranteeing that they will be compensated for the risk associated with the population they are serving. 3) Provide incentive for consumers to improve behavior: A viable alternative should provide a mechanism by which consumers choose to improve their own <b>repayment</b> behavior, in <b>order</b> to ensure lenders receive the return on the loans that they make and continue to provide access to the small-dollar loans. 4) Maximize sustainability of program implementation: Any recommended program design should consider factors of sustainability, such as cost considerations, simplicity of implementation, political pushback, or scalability concerns. ALTERNATIVES: The following alternatives provide plausible program designs for a responsible small-dollar lending program. Each alternative is weighted against the specific criteria identified above. 1) Use a referral process to provide loans to approved low-income and/or high-risk consumers. 2) Design a borrower’s card system to collect information about consumers’ borrowing and repayment behaviors. 3) Fund a loan loss reserve pool to back loans made to low-income and/or high-risk consumers...|$|R
