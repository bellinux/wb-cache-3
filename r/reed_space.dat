When Eudena screamed they felt assured of their safety, and hurried to get the nearest places to the fires. The old woman laughed at the scream, and laughed again because Si, the little friend of Eudena, whimpered. Directly the dawn came they were all alert and looking towards the alders. They could see that Eudena had been taken. They could not help feeling glad to think that Uya was appeased. But across the minds of the men the thought of Ugh-lomi fell like a shadow. They could understand revenge, for the world was old in revenge, but they did not think of rescue. Suddenly a hyæna fled out of the thicket, and came galloping across the <b>reed</b> <b>space.</b> His muzzle and paws were dark-stained. At that sight all the men shouted and clutched at throwing-stones and ran towards him, for no animal is so pitiful a coward as the hyæna by day. All men hated the hyæna because he preyed on children, and would come and bite when one was sleeping {{on the edge of the}} squatting-place. And Cat's-skin, throwing fair and straight, hit the brute shrewdly on the flank, whereat the whole tribe yelled with delight.|$|E

With school, {{an internship}}, a part-time job and a strong desire to communicate through design, he managed to materialize his budding idea to establish Staple by silk-screening T-shirts in his spare time. On March 7, 1997, Jeff walked into the Triple Five Soul boutique in SoHo wearing a hand-printed Staple T-shirt. The manager took notice and placed the first ever order of 12 T-shirts from the line. With Staple’s door officially open for business, Jeff successfully turned his one-man T-shirt business into a men's collection as well as a full-service design firm; opening Staple Design that year and his own retail store/art gallery, <b>Reed</b> <b>Space,</b> in 2002.|$|E

In [3], Reed {{establishes}} a bijection between the (equivalence classes of) principal Tt-extensions of a topological space X and the compatible, cluster-generated, Lodato nearnesses on X. We extend Reed's result to the To case by obtaining a one-to-one {{correspondence between the}} principal To-extensions of a space X and the collections of sets (called "t-grill sets") which generate a certain class of nearnesses which we call "t-bunch generated " nearnesses. This correspondence specializes to principal To-compactifications. Finally, we {{show that there is}} a bijection between these t-grill sets and the filter systems of Thron [5], and that the corresponding extensions are equivalent. The notion of nearness spaces was first introduced by Herrlich in [2]. It has since proven to be a useful tool in the classification of extensions of topological <b>spaces.</b> <b>Reed</b> [3], Bentley and Herrlich [1], and others have used nearnesses to classify the principal T 1 -extensions of a Trspace.

The first part is a general introduction to the spectral theory of self–adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces. The topics for this part are- brief review of bounded operators on Hilbert <b>spaces</b> (<b>Reed</b> and Simon, volume 1, Chapter VI) - the spectral theorem for bounded self–adjoint operators (Reed and Simon, volume 1, Chapter VII) - unbounded self–adjoint operators (parts of Reed and Simon, volume 1, Chapter VIII) - introduction to Schrödinger operators The other two parts consist of two independent applications of the above general theory. - scattering theory of Schrödinger operators- spectral theory of periodic Schrödinger operators Prerequisites Permission of the instructor. You will need a very rudimentary knowledge of L 2 spaces and bounded operators on Hilbert spaces. See, for example, Chapters I and II and Sections VI. 1 –VI. 3 of Reed and Simon, volume I...|$|R

Not wanting to die before he is {{supposed}} to naturally, when Nihil learned that the UFF were from a different, younger universe he engineered a plan to escape and kill them. Johnny Storm, who for the entire trip had been experiencing discomfort, fell ill and was rushed by Sue back to their ship. Reed Richards and Ben Grimm went along with her but once they returned to tell Nihil of their situation Nihil revealed his intention to steal their ship, named by Johnny as the Awesome, and go to Earth. He exploded his translation devices, thereby rupturing <b>Reed</b> and Ben's <b>space</b> suits and exposing them to the N-Zone's highly acidic atmosphere. Nihil then sent his previously unseen soldiers to kill them but Reed sealed his damaged suit by covering his shattered face mask with his hand, and Ben discovered his lungs filter out poisons, enabling him to battle Nihil.|$|R
50|$|Staple Design {{has worked}} in {{conjunction}} with many big name companies in creating unique products which showcase the qualities of both parties involved. In 1999, Staple Design began its ongoing relationship with Nike. Staple worked on the then novel concept of limited-edition shoes {{and was able to}} parlay that into off and on graphic design work for Nike. Often time his work appears without even a mention of the Staple name, which only goes to show how well regarded Staple has become as a design firm. They designed the Navigation pack in 2005 and the Nordic pack in 2006; both were considered classic general releases and had no Staple branding attached to them. However, the most renowned product-to-date, did come with the STPL moniker attached to it, {{in the form of a}} skateboarding shoe called The Nike Dunk SB Low Pigeon. On February 22, 2005, the sneaker was released exclusively in New York and had a run of 202 pairs, 30 of which were released at Staple's retail store, <b>Reed</b> <b>Space.</b> That morning, a large crowd gathered outside of the store. When the NYPD were called in to control the crowd, a riot ensued. The news made the front page of The New York Post.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Finding out the {{hierarchy}} of settlement is considered as an important step for providing balanced regional development to any area. The present study focuses on the identification of settlement hierarchy {{on the basis of}} threshold of functions and to analyze the relationship between population and centrality score of rural service centres or central places for achieving balanced regional development. For this study secondary data pertaining to the socio-economic facilities or services has been collected for each rural settlements of the Aligarh District. To identify {{the hierarchy}} of rural settlements, Median Population Threshold (MPT) has been calculated by using <b>Reed</b> Muench Method. <b>Spacing</b> of rural settlements has been calculated using Mather’s model of Mean Spacing. The results shows that out of 1180 inhabited rural settlements found in Aligarh district only 268 rural settlements lie in the category of rural service centre or central place which are further categories under six hierarchic level. IntroductionThe development of a settlement hierarchy is considered to {{be the best way to}} assess and determine the settlements which support sustainable economic growth and reduce the need to travel. A settlement hierarchy refers to the arrangement of set-tlements within a given area into a certain order of importance based upon the population size, range, number of services pro...|$|R
50|$|On the ship, the {{survivors}} discover metal beneath Reed's skin, {{causing him to}} begin questioning his existence. Ross reveals that Reed is {{actually one of the}} first TR-5s, planted in the community with Ross as his handler. Reed's memories are all implants based on Ross's own memories. Bronson (Dustin Harnish) becomes paranoid and believes the other survivors are also androids, but Chloe (Lauren Walsh) dispels him by revealing she is pregnant. At the space station, the group battles the TR-4s en masse, resulting in Bronson's death and Tiffany (Lucinda Rogers) becoming separated from the others. Ross attempts to shut down the TR-4s but the control console fights back, repeatedly locking him out. Suddenly, the TR-4s all shut down, and Ross ominously realizes their power is being funneled to a much worse problem - the giant TR-5 that caused the rebellion in the first place. The massive robot appears and kills Ross with a blade mounted in its arm after shrugging off his EMP weapon, then attacks Chloe. Reed appears and baits the TR-5 into an airlock, and Chloe ejects both it and <b>Reed</b> into outer <b>space.</b> The TR-4s come back to life despite Tiffany hitting the shutdown switch, but when she rips the cords from the control box, they all die simultaneously. Chloe, Tiffany, Tanner (Mark Hengst), Laura (Krystle Connor) and Chloe's unborn child are left as the only survivors, possibly of all humanity.|$|R
