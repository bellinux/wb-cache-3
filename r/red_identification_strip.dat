5000|$|The 7N6M (M—Russian: Модернизированный; Modernizirovanniy or [...] "modernized") {{cartridge}} {{was introduced}} in 1987. In contrast to the original 7N6 unhardened steel rod penetrator the 7N6M rod penetrator is made of steel 65 and hardened to 60 HRC. The 7N6M 3.43 g boat-tail bullet can penetrate a 6 mm thick St3 steel plate at 300 m and 6Zh85T body armour at 80 m. 7N6(M) bullets have a <b>red</b> <b>identification</b> ring above the cartridge neck.The US Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory measured a ballistic coefficient (G7 BC) of 0.168 and form factor (G7 i) of 0.929 for the 7N6(M) projectile, which indicates good aerodynamic efficiency and external ballistic performance for the bullet diameter.|$|R
5000|$|The old 1993 {{format is}} still valid {{even though the}} new 2011 plates were {{introduced}} in February 2011. The old 1993 format was introduced around 1993 {{with the addition of}} the national <b>identification</b> <b>strip</b> (in 1995) on the left and a new bigger DIN 1451 font. Spacing between characters changed numerous times and a security hologram was added. The format starts with a two-letter abbreviation of an Albanian district name. For instance, the abbreviation for Korçë District is KO. A four-digit number follows with a serial letter indicating the order of allocation of each series of numbers. Thus, a plate ending in [...] "B" [...] will have been more recently released than one ending in [...] "A" [...] in the same district. Since 2002, a smaller font was introduced while plates with the older font are still valid.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study 443 strains of Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, a causative agent of {{respiratory}} disease in fowl, were investigated biochemically and serologically. In both ways O. rhinotracheale could be differentiated from other gram-negative rods and, more particularly, from the Pasteurella-like bacteria potentially pathogenic for fowl. For the biochemical characterization of O. rhinotracheale the API 2 ONE <b>identification</b> <b>strip</b> proved to be useful, although O. rhinotracheale {{is not included in}} the API system. Serologically, by using monovalent antisera in agar gel precipitation (AGP) tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), seven serotypes (serotypes A to G) of O. rhinotracheale could be discriminated. The AGP test was chosen as the preferred method to be used for serotyping. Isolates of serotype A were found to be the most prevalent, especially in chickens. Isolates from turkeys were more heterogeneously divided over the serotypes. Some strains showed cross-reactivity between serotypes A, B, and E. Five O. rhinotracheale strains could not be serotyped with the available antisera. Relationships between the geographic origin and the serotypes were found. By the ELISA the presence of antibodies against O. rhinotracheale could be detected in 1 -day-old birds as well as in birds with clinical signs, and therefore, it might be useful for diagnostic purposes...|$|R

40|$|While we were {{isolating}} Bartonella quintana from body lice, 40 Acinetobacter baumannii strains {{were also}} isolated and genotyped. One clone was unique {{and the other}} was ampicillin susceptible. A. baumannii DNA was later detected in 21 % of 622 lice collected worldwide. These findings show an A. baumannii epidemic in human body lice. The body louse has been demonstrated to be the vector of three human pathogens: Rickettsia prowazekii, the agent of epidemic typhus; Bartonella quintana, the agent of trench fever; and Borrelia recurrentis, the agent of louseborne recurrent fever (1). While trying to isolate Bartonella quintana from body lice of homeless persons in Marseille, we isolated six Acinetobacter spp. (2) subsequently identified as A. baumannii. They were susceptibile to ampicillin, whereas Acinetobacter are almost always resistant to ampicillin in France (3). We further isolated other A. baumannii from body lice in Marseille and now have 40 isolates; 21 are susceptible to ampicillin. To investigate the possibility of a clonal diffusion in lice, the recA gene sequence of isolates was determined and compared to that of the collection and strains. To test if the body louse–A. baumannii association is observed worldwide, we investigated the presence of A. baumannii DNA in a large collection of body lice. *Faculté de Médecine de Marseille, Marseille, France The Study The 40 body lice–associated A. baumannii were obtained during studies of homeless shelters in Marseille (4).

40|$|Poster - 170. Taste: no. 170. 21 /II 28 Recent neuroimaging {{studies have}} shown that {{attention}} on brain processing of tastes could increase the responsiveness of the insular cortex (putative primary taste cortex). However, how attention affects the identification of taste quality remains unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate brain response during a taste quality identification task, particularly the identification of salty and umami tastes, in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. The Human Experimentation Committee of Kyushu University approved all experimental procedures. Eighteen participants (9 males and 9 females; aged 22 - 33 years) participated in this study. Salty (0. 1 M sodium chloride) and umami (0. 1 M monosodium glutamate) solutions were used, and artificial saliva (25 mM potassium chloride with 2. 5 mM sodium bicarbonate) was used as control. An originally developed taste delivery system was used to spread the taste solution on the surface of the tongue as widely as possible preventing swallowing. Before scanning, the participants were exposed to a mock test. In the mock test, an umami solution was administrated for 8 sec; during this period, a <b>red</b> (<b>IDENTIFICATION</b> condition) or black cross (PASSIVE condition) was presented on the screen set in front of the participant’s face, which was followed by a control period of 12 sec with a black cross. Before the mock test, we instructed the participants to identify a salty solution in the umami solution when a red cross was presented on the screen. In the <b>IDENTIFICATION</b> condition, a <b>red</b> cross was presented, and a salty solution was administrated with the umami solution. We administered varying amounts of the salty solution and identified the smallest amount that could be detected by each participant. Next, we instructed them to identify the smallest amount of the salty solution in the umami solution during fMRI scanning. In the actual experiment using the 3. 0 -T MRI scanner, the salty solution was not administrated. Therefore, we administered only the umami solution in the IDENTIFICATION and PASSIVE conditions. Each condition consisted of 12 trials, and the two conditions were presented pseudorandomly. To evaluate the effect of attention on taste identification, IDENTIFICATION-PASSIVE contrast was performed using SPM 8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). This analysis revealed activity in the left anterior insula (PFWE-corrected < 0. 05). In conclusion, attention on identifying a taste quality resulted in the activation of the gustatory cortex (anterior insula). This finding may have an important implication in understanding the functional specialization of the taste cortex. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

For molecular characterisation, the most variable rDNA regions ITS 1, 5, 8 S ITS 2 and the region encoding the large ribosomal subunit (26 S) were amplified. This long region of the yeasts DNA was sequenced and compared by NCBI database for <b>identification.</b> The <b>red</b> yeasts <b>identification</b> was confirmed by data from DGGE method. Another aim of this thesis was to select the best yeasts producer of carotenoids and triacylglycerols. Rhodosporidium toruloides was found as the best producer and, thus, this strain was subjected to random mutagenesis by UV irradiation. The results of the production of metabolites by R. toruloides were compared with mutant strains, which were also adapted to the glycerol and waste whey substrates. The mutant strain G 33 was found as the best producer of total carotenoids with a yield of 7. 14 mg. g- 1 of biomass. The highest production of ergosterol was demonstrated by the mutant strain Y 34, the ergosterol yield was 47. 72 mg. g- 1 of biomass.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs {{a component of}} the Department of Homeland Security and the department’s lead for maritime security, the Coast Guard is charged with executing theUnited States domestic maritime anti-terrorism program. It is critical that Coast Guard policy, plans, and tactics maintain pace with the ever-changing risks associated with terrorism. This thesis examines alternative analysis red teaming and its potential value to the Coast Guard. Specifically, it seeks to answer how red teaming can be leveraged to enhance the value of domestic maritime anti-terrorism activities. The research reviews elements of the maritime domain and principles of red teaming, and proposes and provides implementation recommendations for a terrorism red teaming program for the domestic maritime domain. The study revealed that a red team program would be value added to the Coast Guard for domestic maritime anti-terrorism programs. Leveraging the concept of a minimal viable program, the thesis proposes a red team program and strategy to implement the program within the U. S. Coast Guard. The suggested program would be comprised of three elements: physical <b>red</b> teaming, <b>identification</b> of future attack scenarios, and policy red teaming. The thesis further provides insight into the implementation of these programs and suggests a minimal viable program approach to establishing a terrorism red teaming program for the domestic maritime domain.

40|$|The red {{sequence}} {{is an important}} feature of galaxy clusters and {{plays a crucial role}} in optical cluster detection. Measurement of the slope and scatter of the red sequence are affected both by selection of red sequence galaxies and measurement errors. In this paper, we describe a new error corrected Gaussian Mixture Model for <b>red</b> sequence galaxy <b>identification.</b> Using this technique, we can remove the effects of measurement error and extract unbiased information about the intrinsic properties of the red sequence. We use this method to select red sequence galaxies in each of the 13, 823 clusters in the maxBCG catalog, and measure the red sequence ridgeline location and scatter of each. These measurements provide precise constraints on the variation of the average red galaxy populations in the observed frame with redshift. We find that the scatter of the red sequence ridgeline increase mildly with redshift, and that the slope decreases with redshift. We also observe that the slope does not strongly depend on cluster richness. Usin...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{rights of}} trans people are {{protected}} by a range of international and regional mechanisms. Yet, punitive national laws, policies and practices targeting transgender people, including complex procedures for changing <b>identification</b> documents, <b>strip</b> transgender people of their rights and limit access to justice. This results in gross {{violations of human rights}} on the part of state perpetrators and society at large. Transgender people's experience globally is that of extreme social exclusion that translates into increased vulnerability to HIV, other diseases, including mental health conditions, limited access to education and employment, and loss of opportunities for economic and social advancement. In addition, hatred and aggression towards a group of individuals who do not conform to social norms around gender manifest in frequent episodes of extreme violence towards transgender people. This violence often goes unpunished. Discussion: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) views its work in the area of HIV through the lens of human rights and advances a range of development solutions such as poverty reduction, improved governance, active citizenship, and access to justice. This work directly relates to advancing the rights of transgender people. This manuscript lays out the various aspects of health, human rights, and development that frame transgender people's issues and outlines best practice solutions from transgender communities and governments around the globe on how to address these complex concerns. The examples provided in the manuscript can help guide UN agencies, governments, and transgender activists in achieving better standards of health, access to justice, and social inclusion for transgender communities everywhere. Conclusions: The manuscript provides a call to action for countries to urgently address the violations of human rights of transgender people in order to honour international obligations, stem HIV epidemics, promote gender equality, strengthen social and economic development, and put a stop to untrammelled violence...|$|R

The one-line BBC News logo was now used as the channel DOG and remained at the bottom left of the screen, however inside the 4:3 safe zone, inside a deep red box matching the same colour as the box logo design. To the immediate right, the channel clock was encased in a black box with white text and running {{from there to the}} far right of the screen is the news ticker, now grey in colour with white text. The ticker subject would rotate up from the far left side of the ticker and dissolved out once the news began to scroll across, separated by large dots.

40|$|General Description: Low, spreading, rhizomatous {{perennial}} typically {{growing on}} moist rock walls. Stems 2 - 12 inches long. Herbage with long soft hairs, sticky. Leaves opposite, palmately veined, somewhat heart or kidney shaped with small teeth along the margins. Flowers on long stalks extending above the leaves, yellow with some <b>red</b> dots. <b>Identification</b> Tips: Similar to {{other members of}} the genus, including M. moschatus and M. floribundus. M. moschatus has ovate to lance-ovate leaves rather than broadly ovate leaves; M. floribundus is an erect to subprostrate annual rather than a prostrate, spreading perennial. Additionally, its leaves are narrower than those of M. jungermannioides and mostly deltoidovate rather than reniform-cordate. Phenology: This species blooms from May to late August (as long as there is water present). Range: The species is known from Gilliam, Sherman, Umatilla and Wasco counties in Oregon and historically from Klickitat County, WA in the Columbia Basin physiographic province. Habitat: The species occurs in basalt crevices in seepage zones in vertical cliff faces and canyon walls. Associates include fragile fern (Cystopteris fragilis), stream saxifrage (Saxifraga arguta), lava alumroot (Heuchera cylindrica), cutleaf ladysfoot mustard (Thelypodium laciniatum), mock-orange (Philadelphus lewisii), poison oak (Rhus radicans), and hackberry (Celtis reticulata). The plant has been collected from elevations ranging from 500 to 3300 feet. Ecology: The species is dependent upon adequate seepage. It has a fragile root system and may therefore be easily affected by disturbance. There is very little vegetation on most of the cliffs within its range. However, a number of weedy species have invaded the seeps and may pose a competitive problem for the taxon. © 1959 University of Washington Press. Illustration by Jeanne R. Janish.
