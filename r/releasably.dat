40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a pyrotechnic actuated release mechanism which is mechanically two fault tolerant for effecting release. It is particularly {{well suited for}} <b>releasably</b> connecting structures {{to be used in}} the space environment or in other aerospace applications. The device comprises a fastener plate and fastener body, each attachable to either one of a pair of structures to be joined.

Each pin is individually retractable by combustion of a pyrotechnic charge. While retraction of all three pins releases the toggle, the fastener is mechanically two fault tolerant since the failure of any single or pair of the latch pins to retract results in an asymmetrical loading on the toggle and its pivotal movement to effect a release. An annular bolt is mounted on the fastener plate as a support for the socket mounting of the toggle whereby its selective axial movement provides a means for pre-loading the toggle...|$|E
