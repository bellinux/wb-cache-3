40|$|On 11 March 2011, {{the day of}} the unforgettable {{disaster}} of the 9 magnitude Tohoku earthquake and quickly followed by the devastating Tsunami, a damageable amount of radionuclides had dispersed from the Fukushima Daiichi’s damaged nuclear reactors. Decontamination of the dispersed radionuclides from seawater and soil, due to the huge amounts of coexisting ions with competitive functionalities, has been the topmost difficulty. Ferric hexacyanoferrate, also known as Prussian blue (PB), has been the most powerful material for selectively trapping the radioactive cesium ions; its high tendency to form stable colloids in water, however, has made PB to be impossible for the open-field <b>radioactive</b> cesium <b>decontamination</b> applications. A nano/nano combinatorial approach, as is described in this study, has provided an ultimate solution to this intrinsic colloid formation difficulty of PB. Cellulose nanofibers (CNF) were used to immobilize PB via the creation of CNF-backboned PB. The CNF-backboned PB (CNF/PB) was found to be highly tolerant to water and moreover, it gave a 139 [*]mg/g capability and a million (106) order of magnitude distribution coefficient (Kd) for absorbing of the radioactive cesium ion.

40|$|Photochemical and {{ultrasonic}} treatment of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), derived from PVA fabric material, with hydrogen peroxide was evaluated {{as a primary}} method for PVA mineralization into simpler organic molecules. PVA-based waste streams {{have been found to}} be compatible with nuclear process wastewater treatment facilities only when solubilized PVA is more than 90 percent mineralized with hydrogen peroxide. No undesirable solid particles are formed with other nuclear process liquid waste when they are mixed, pH adjusted, evaporated and blended with this type of oxidized PVA waste streams. The presence of oxidized PVA in a typical nuclear process wastewater has been found to have no detrimental effect on the efficiency of ion exchange resins, inorganic, and precipitation agents used for the removal of radionuclides from nuclear waste streams. The disappearance of PVA solution in hydrogen peroxide with ultrasonic/ ultraviolet irradiation treatment was characterized by pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. Radioactive waste contaminated PVA fabric can be solubilized and mineralized to produce processible liquid waste, hence, no bulky solid waste disposal cost can be incurred and the radionuclides can be effectively recovered.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in laser <b>radioactive</b> <b>decontamination</b> of metal surfaces. It offers advantages over conventional methods: improved safety, reduction of secondary waste, reduced waste volume, acceptable cost. The main mechanism of cleaning by lasers is ablation.

A brief theoretical analysis was made before the experiments. The laser beam was focused using a KBr-lens onto a surface contaminated with 137 Cs (b-, t 1 / 2 = 30. 17 y). Three different metals were used: stainless steel, copper and aluminium. The ablated material was pumped out in an air atmosphere and transferred to a filter. The presence of activity on the filter was shown by a germanium detector-multichannel analyzer. The activity levels were measured by a GM counter.

40|$|Decontamination of {{materials}} such as soils or waste water that contain radioactive isotopes, heavy metals, or hazardous components is a subject of great interest. Magnetic separation is a physical separation process that segregates materials {{on the basis of}} magnetic susceptibility. Because the process relies on physical properties, separations can be achieved while producing a minimum of secondary waste. Most traditional physical separation processes effectively treat particles larger than 70 microns. In many situations, the radioactive contaminants are found concentrated in the fine particle size fraction of less than 20 microns. For effective decontamination of the fine particle size fraction most current operations resort to chemical dissolution methods for treatment. High gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) is able to effectively treat particles from 90 to {approximately} 0. 1 micron in diameter. The technology is currently used on the 60 ton per hour scale in the kaolin clay industry. When the field gradient is of sufficiently high intensity, paramagnetic particles can be physically captured and separated from extraneous nonmagnetic material. Because all actinide compounds are paramagnetic, magnetic separation of actinide containing mixtures is feasible. The advent of reliable superconducting magnets also makes magnetic separation of weakly paramagnetic species attractive. HGMS work at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is being developed for soil remediation, waste water treatment and treatment of actinide chemical processing residues. LANL and Lockheed Environmental Systems and Technologies Company (LESAT) have worked on a co-operative research and development agreement (CRADA) to develop HGMS for <b>radioactive</b> soil <b>decontamination.</b> The program is designed to transfer HGMS from the laboratory and other industries for the commercial treatment of radioactive contaminated materials. 9 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{radioactive}} waste {{are found in}} the territory of Belarus at present. The first type is radioactive waste (RAW) which results from using radioactive sources in industry, medicine and at research institutions. This waste is placed in near-surface type repositories at the State facility "Ecores " (the Ecores facility). The industrial site of the Ecores facility has two repositories with RAW. Waste has been placed in two trenches that are isolated now with two other repositories currently in the stage of filling. The waste coming into the repositories is not compacted or sorted by the extent of its toxicity. Assessments of the potential danger from the repositories at the Ecores facility have shown that under the destruction of an engineered barrier the threat of radioactive contamination appears especially with long-lived radioisotopes in the upper aquifer with concentrations exceeding their maximum permissible values inside the sanitary-protection zone and beyond its boundaries.

40|$|Since September 11, 2001, {{there has}} been a renewed focus on the {{security}} of vital infrastructure, such as wastewater treatment and collection systems. Terrorism, combined with the potential destruction in the wake of natural disasters, has led to an all hazards approach when evaluating contaminants that could be introduced into a wastewater treatment and collection system either accidentally or intentionally. Prioritization is an evaluation technique that can prove useful to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in providing a list of contaminants that would cause the most deleterious effects to the plant and its surrounding area. A framework was developed to focus on four endpoints that would be of the greatest concern to WWTPs. It was applied to 78 contaminants, including biological agents, flammable chemicals, <b>radioactive</b> elements and <b>decontamination</b> agents. Those contaminants having the highest weighted score for each endpoint were considered the greatest threat to the physical treatment plant and its unit processes, the plant's workers, and human and animal populations in contact with its receiving waters. The prioritization process can provide utilities with information on which contaminants should be screened for throughout the plant and collection system. One such method for biological agents, such as Bacillus anthracis, is real-time, rapid cycle polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This rapid analytical technique allows for preliminary detection of pathogen presence in a much shorter time than is required for bacteria culturing. PCR used jointly with a field concentration method greatly improved the sensitivity of the screening process, with a detection limit of 20 cfu/mL in concentrated secondary effluent, as compared to 3. 50 x 103 cfu/mL in the unconcentrated sample. The detection limits of Salmonella typhimurium exceeded that expected from volume reduction with log recoveries of 3. 53 and 2. 24 compared to theoretical log recoveries of 2. 40 and 2. 10 for river water and secondary effluent, respectively. PCR cannot be applied for Brucella spp. screening due to cross-reactions with other bacteria present within the wastewater system, but for other pathogens, PCR may be a viable option for screening in treated and untreated wastewater...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of the transport and solidification of metal in the melting and casting processes is significant for the optimization of the radioactively contaminated metal recycling and refining processes.. In this research project, the transport process in the melting and solidification of metal was numerically predicted, and the microstructure and radionuclide distribution have been characterized by scanning electron microscope/electron diffractive X-ray (SEWEDX) analysis using cesium chloride (CSC 1) as the radionuclide surrogate. In the melting and solidification process, a resistance furnace whose heating and cooling rates are program- controlled in the helium atmosphere was used. The characterization procedures included weighing, melting and solidification, weighing after solidification, sample preparation, and SEM/EDX analysis. This analytical methodology {{can be used to}} characterize metal recycling and refining products in order to evaluate the performance of the recycling process. The data obtained provide much valuable information that is necessary for the enhancement of <b>radioactive</b> contaminated metal <b>decontamination</b> and recycling technologies. The numerical method for the prediction of the melting and solidification process can be implemented in the control and monitoring system-of the melting and casting process in radioactive contaminated metal recycling. The use of radionuclide surrogates instead of real radionuclides enables the research to be performed without causing harmfid effects on people or the community. This characterization process has been conducted at the Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) at Florida International University since October 1995. Tests have been conducted on aluminum (Al) and copper (Cu) using cesium chloride (CSCI) as a radionuclide surrogate, and information regarding the radionuclide transfer and distribution in melting and solidification process has been obtained. The numerical simulation of the solidification of molten metal has been very successful for aluminium; however, a stability problem in the simulation of iron/steel solidification poses a challenge. Thus, additional development is needed to simulate the radionuclide transfer and distribution behaviors in the melting and casting processes. This project was initially based on a two-year plan. However, due to technical and financial difficulties, the project ended in FY 96. The work which has been accomplished in the first year includes the {{characterization of}} radionuclide transfer and distribution in the melting-solidification process and the numerical simulation of metal solidification. The Argon-arc melting method was tested for the melting of copper and steel materials. Five tests were performed to characterize the transfer and distribution of radionuclides in the aluminiurn and copper melting/solidification process using CSC 1 as radionuclide surrogates.
