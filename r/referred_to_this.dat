5|$|The {{residents}} of Plymouth used terms {{to distinguish between}} the earliest settlers of the colony and those that came later. The first generation of settlers, generally thought to be those that arrived before 1627, called themselves the Old Comers or Planters. Later generations of Plymouth residents <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> group as the Forefathers.|$|E
5|$|Around 1925, {{having had}} little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to Padang, {{where he was}} a {{reporter}} for the daily Sinar Soematera. At the same time, he worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing stage plays. In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time, bangsawan, he promoted a more natural style, using dialogue instead of song to convey the story; he <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> as toneel, based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of Melati van Agam, a 1923 work by Swan Pen, and Sitti Nurbaya, a 1922 novel by Marah Roesli. These works were well received.|$|E

5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> group as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.|$|E
5|$|Going {{against the}} normal {{convention}} that the strongest characters {{should be the}} largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Balls most powerful characters, including Goku, with small statures. Toriyama explained that he had Goku grow up so that drawing fight scenes would be easier, even though Torishima was against it initially because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. Torishima later <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> as his own biggest crisis during the series, with Toriyama threatening to end it if Goku could not grow up. The editor said his concerns were unfounded, as readers accepted the change without complaint.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E

5|$|Robert E. Lee's United States {{citizenship}} was posthumously {{restored in}} 1975. Davis had been specifically excluded from earlier resolutions restoring rights to other Confederate officials, and a movement arose to restore Davis's citizenship as well. This was accomplished {{with the passing}} of Senate Joint Resolution 16 on October 17, 1978. In signing the law, President Jimmy Carter <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> as the last act of reconciliation in the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Verified status {{does not}} imply that Twitter {{continuously}} checks whether such accounts have been hacked. The account of Tesla Motors, for example, was impersonated briefly in 2015. Some users have tried to impersonate verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in their background images. Twitter <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult. In July 2016, Twitter began allowing anyone to apply for a verified account. The company announced that they will disable the verification progress in response to an outlash after white nationalist Jason Kessler got verified on Twitter.|$|E
5|$|As the NK 9th Division {{approached}} Yongsan, its 1st Regiment was on {{the north}} and its 2nd Regiment on the south. The division's attached support, consisting of one 76mm artillery battalion from the NK I Corps, an antiaircraft battalion of artillery, two tank battalions of the NK 16th Armored Brigade, and a battalion of artillery from the NK 4th Division, gave it unusually heavy support. Crossing the river behind it came the 4th Division, a greatly weakened organization, far understrength, short of weapons, and made up mostly of untrained replacements. A captured North Korean document <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> grouping of units that attacked from the Sinban-ni area into the Naktong Bulge as the main force of NK I Corps. Elements of the 9th Division reached the hills just west of Yongsan during the afternoon of September 1.|$|E

5|$|Canis dirus {{lived in}} the late Pleistocene to the early Holocene (125,000–10,000 years before present or YBP) in North and South America (although no members of Canis survive in the latter continent). The {{majority}} of fossils from the eastern C.d.dirus have been dated 125,000–75,000YBP, but the western C.d.guildayi fossils are not only smaller in size but more recent; thus it has been proposed that C.d.guildayi derived from C.d.dirus. However, there are disputed specimens of C.dirus that date to 250,000YBP. Fossil specimens of C.dirus discovered at four sites in the Hay Springs area of Sheridan County, Nebraska, were named Aenocyon dirus nebrascensis (Frick 1930, undescribed), but Frick did not publish {{a description of the}}m. Nowak later <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> material as C.armbrusteri; then, in 2009, Tedford formally published a description of the specimens and noted that, although they exhibited some morphological characteristics of both C.armbrusteri and C.dirus, he referred to them only as C.dirus. These Nebraskan fossil specimens may represent the earliest record of C.dirus.|$|E
5|$|In April 1922, Kenyatta began a job {{working as}} a stores clerk and meter reader for Cook, who had been {{appointed}} water superintendent for the Nairobi municipal council. In this position he earned 250 shillings a month, a particularly high wage for a native African, which brought him financial independence and {{a growing sense of}} self-confidence. Kenyatta lived in Kilimani, although financed the construction of a second home at Dagoretti; he <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> latter hut as the Kinyata Stores for he used it to hold general provisions for the neighbourhood. He had sufficient funds that he could lend money to European clerks in the offices, and could enjoy the lifestyle offered by Nairobi, which included cinemas, football matches, and imported British fashions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being {{the relationship between the}} personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother once told me, ‘We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful, but our life was destroyed by politics and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> theme as the search for security.|$|E

5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the end result of a holy life. Symeon <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E
5|$|The one Germanic-language {{speaking}} {{country that}} {{was not included in}} the Pan-Germanic unification aim was the United Kingdom, in spite of its near-universal acceptance by the Nazi government as being part of the Germanic world. Leading Nordic ideologist Hans F. K. Günther theorized that the Anglo-Saxons had been more successful than the Germans in maintaining racial purity and that the coastal and island areas of Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and Wales had received additional Nordic blood through Norse raids and colonization during the Viking Age, and the Anglo-Saxons of East Anglia and Northern England had been under Danish rule in the 9th and 10th centuries. Günther <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> historical process as Aufnordung ("additional nordification"), which finally culminated in the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Britain was thus a nation created by struggle and the survival of the fittest among the various Aryan peoples of the isles, and was able to pursue global conquest and empire-building because of its superior racial heredity born through this development.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the NK 9th Division, in their first {{offensive}} of the war, stood {{only a few miles}} short of Yongsan after a successful river crossing and penetration of the American line. The 3rd Regiment had been left at Inch'on, but division commander Major General Pak Kyo Sam felt the chances of capturing Yongsan were strong. As the NK 9th Division approached Yongsan, its 1st Regiment was on the north and its 2nd Regiment on the south. The division's attached support, consisting of one 76mm artillery battalion from the NK I Corps, an antiaircraft battalion of artillery, two tank battalions of the NK 16th Armored Brigade, and a battalion of artillery from the NK 4th Division, gave it unusually heavy support.
