The most important properties that can be improved by the addition of wax emulsions are matting & gloss, hydrophobicity, soft touch, abrasion & <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> scratch resistance, release, corrosion protection and anti-blocking.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to smearing, gradual fading of many inks {{can be a}} problem over time. Print lifetime is highly dependent on the quality and formulation of the ink. The earliest inkjet printers, intended for home and small office applications, used dye-based inks. Even the best dye-based inks are not as durable as pigment-based inks, which are now available for many inkjet printers. Many inkjet printers now utilize pigment based inks which are highly water resistant: at least the black ink is often pigment-based. Resin or silicone protected photopaper is widely available at low cost, introducing complete water and mechanical <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> for dye and pigment inks. The photopaper itself must be designed for pigment or for dye inks, as pigment particles are too large to be able to penetrate through dye-only photopaper protection layer.|$|E
30|$|The {{quantified}} pixel values obtained {{were considered}} as indirectly {{proportional to the}} <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> of an ink film: the higher the color value change of a rubbed ink film, the higher the extent of rubbing and, equivalently, the lower the <b>rub</b> <b>resistance.</b> The inverse of the color value change per pixel was therefore used as the quantitative measure of <b>rub</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E

30|$|Water-based ink {{formulations}} containing wax, surfactant, and defoamer additives {{were prepared}} and printed on polyethylene film substrates. Standard test methods for adhesion, <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> and gloss were {{done on the}} printed polyethylene films. Quantitative methods for the assessment and evaluation of the three print properties were developed. Image analyses were done to quantify adhesion and <b>rub</b> <b>resistance.</b> Quantitative measurement was done to quantify gloss. Data were analyzed using mixture design modelling and optimization. Modelling results show that adhesion and gloss are described by special cubic model equations, while <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> is described by a linear model equation. Contour plots and 3 D surface graphs were generated showing the response surfaces of the print properties. The effects of varying the mass fractions of wax, surfactant, and defoamer on adhesion, <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> and gloss were determined. It was found that increasing wax increases <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> while increasing surfactant increases gloss, and increasing defoamer increases adhesion. There is dependency found between the mass fraction of wax, surfactant and defoamer {{with respect to the}} <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> adhesion and gloss. Multi-objective optimization revealed that optimum adhesion, <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> and gloss is obtained by a formulation containing equal mass fractions of wax and surfactant but no defoamer.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} the effects of these additives, the most important print properties of the ink with modified formulation are analyzed- namely, adhesion, <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> and gloss. Adhesion and <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> are two important mechanical properties, while gloss is an optical property that is deemed important in many applications, such as in packaging. To evaluate ink performance and analyze ink formulations, modern techniques and classical chemical tests are done by manufacturers to establish quality and applicability of their products [7], as well as standard test methods that involve qualitative assessment. While there is a quantitative standard test method for gloss such as the ASTM Standard Test Method for Specular Gloss D 523 - 14, adhesion and <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> test methods are mostly qualitative, such as the color fastness analysis on a grey scale for testing <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> [8] and ASTM F 2252 - 03 peel test [9]. Hence, quantitative methods for evaluating adhesion and <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> must be developed to obtain more accurate and reliable results and to allow for performing optimization with the quantitative gloss measurements. In this study, an image-based technique is developed and employed to quantify adhesion and <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> and to analyze the effects of varying the relative amounts of the three additives on the three identified print properties. After gathering and analyzing the results, a formulation that would give best print properties is identified by using optimization methods.|$|E

Digital printing methods are getting popular now a days because of its quality and less production time. This paper throws light on comparison of <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> of sheet fed offset and digital printing process on uncoated, gloss coated and matte coated paper. To test the <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> a master chart was prepared consisting on line images, middle tone images and solid areas.

40|$|Transparent liquid {{repellent}} coatings with exceptional {{wear and}} abrasion resistance are very demanding to fabricate. The {{most important reason}} for this is the fact that majority of the transparent liquid repellent coatings have so far been fabricated by nanoparticle assembly on surfaces in the form of films. These films or coatings demonstrate relatively poor substrate adhesion and <b>rubbing</b> induced wear <b>resistance</b> compared to polymer-based transparent hydrophobic coatings. However, recent advances reported in the literature indicate that considerable progress has now been made towards formulating and applying transparent, hydrophobic and even oleophobic coatings onto various substrates which can withstand certain degree of mechanical abrasion. This is considered to be very promising for anti-graffiti coatings or treatments since they require resistance to wear abrasion. Therefore, this review intends to highlight the state-of-the-art on materials and techniques that are used to fabricate wear resistant liquid repellent transparent coatings so that researchers can assess various aptitudes and limitations related to translating some of these technologies to large scale stain repellent outdoor applications...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two primary}} types of {{throttle}} position sensors (TPS): a potentiometer or a non-contact sensor Hall Effect sensor (magnetic device). A potentiometer is a satisfactory way for non-critical {{applications such as}} volume control on a radio, but as it has a wiper contact <b>rubbing</b> against a <b>resistance</b> element, dirt and wear between the wiper and the resistor can cause erratic readings. The more reliable solution is the magnetic coupling, which makes no physical contact, so will never be subject to failing by wear. This is an insidious failure as it may not provide any symptoms until there is total failure. All cars having a TPS have {{what is known as}} a 'limp-home-mode'. When the car goes into the limp-home-mode it is because the accelerator and engine control computer and the throttle are not talking to each other {{in a way that they}} can understand. The engine control computer shuts down the signal to the throttle position motor and a set of springs in the throttle set it to a fast idle, fast enough to get the transmission in gear but not so fast that driving may be dangerous.|$|R
30|$|The print {{property}} {{test methods}} developed and proposed {{in this study}} are significantly more quantitative compared to the standard test methods used in the industry. For adhesion, the quantitative test method provides a more accurate evaluation of adhesion by getting the actual amount of ink adhered on the substrate. It is more accurate compared to the mostly qualitative ASTM standard test method. For <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> the quantitative method provides a significantly accurate evaluation of <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> by getting the actual degree of rubbing of the ink adhered on the substrate based on the total amount of color change of the rubbed ink to represent the actual degree of rubbing. Again, this is also more accurate compared to the ASTM standard test method that involves a totally qualitative assessment of <b>rub</b> <b>resistance.</b> Based from the experimental results, the proposed methods can be feasibly adopted for use in the industry.|$|E
30|$|The lowest <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> values {{correspond}} to the formulation purely containing the defoamer, which is Formulation H, which is expected since the mineral oil defoamer leaves behind ink particles (from small defoamer droplets) after drying, which can be rubbed easily because they migrate to the surface [18]. On the other hand, the region near the high mass fractions of wax achieves high <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> because hard wax particles protrude in the ink surface and act as physical spacer between a rubbing medium and the surface [19], thereby {{reducing the amount of}} ink removed during rubbing.|$|E
30|$|Image {{analysis}} {{was chosen as}} a method {{to have a more}} accurate and meaningful quantitative method for the responses adhesion and <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> tests, which are currently only evaluated qualitatively. Printed polyethylene films substrates from the three print property tests were scanned to obtain digital images. For adhesion test samples, the images were derived from the printed film parts where the tapes had been peeled off. For <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> test samples, the printed film parts that were rubbed by the rub tester were selected and cropped. Same image sizes were cropped per response to make results comparable.|$|E
30|$|Three {{tests were}} done, {{one for each}} print {{property}} (adhesion, <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> and gloss). The tests done were standard test methods used by the local industry for evaluating print properties of water-based inks. For adhesion, the adhesion tape test method was done, using a standard 3 M tape, 1 – 1.5 in. long, and manually pulling off the tape to determine the degree of ink adhesion or ink removal from the substrate. The results were interpreted as either percent ink adhesion or percent ink removal. For the <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> test, a rub tester machine was used. A 2 -lb weight was placed {{on top of the}} substrate and then rubbed back and forth for a set of 20 cycles, which corresponds to 40 rubs in total. The resulting degree of rubbing was recorded, as it is considered as inversely related to the <b>rub</b> <b>resistance.</b> For the gloss measurement method, a glossmeter set at 60 ° angle of light reflection was used to measure the gloss of the ink substrate in terms of gloss units.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Having been coated, {{the surface}} {{unevenness}} and pores on paper {{were covered by}} a coating layer composed of fine particles and binders, which can absorb ink well, thereby a good uniformity and smoothness of paper could be obtained, consequently, the reproducing capability for printing dot and good whiteness, gloss and opacity can be improved. In theory, the ink <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> for coated paper print is mainly affected by the ink absorbance property of paper, printing conditions, ink components, rub medium and so on. In this study, seven different kinds of coated papers, the viscosities of the inks were adjusted with a viscosity adjusting agent, and then the prints were prepared by proofing with the ink with different viscosities. After drying, the prints were used for rub testing. The impact of the basic properties of coated paper {{and the content of}} reducer in inks on <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> were discussed {{on the basis of a}} comparative analysis of the experimental data. Printing color density loss rate and print color difference were exploited in this paper to characterize the ink <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> for coated paper prints. In this study, it was found that ink <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> was mainly influenced by ink absorbency and smoothness of the paper. Under the similar conditions, the color density of coated paper print decreases with the rub strength increasing, color difference increased gradually, but not linearly. With the increase of ink viscosity reducer content, printing density loss rates as well as color difference changed, but not be linearly...|$|E

40|$|Modified {{yeast protein}} {{could be used}} for paper coating, but some {{properties}} such as IGT pick resistance, wet pick and wet <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> were not so good as that of milk casein. In order to improve these characteristics, sodium arginate, sodium carboxy methyl cellulose or milk casein was used, The addition of milk casein (modified yeast protein 10 %: milk casein 5 %) showed the best result with a flow curve, less non-Newtonian such as weak thixotropic flow, near to that of milk casein and the IGT pick resistance, wet pick or wet <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> were greatly improved compared with modified yeast protein itself. Wet pick resistance varied from 1. 5 to 3. 6, very near to that of milk casein (3. 5), and wet <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> was from 7 - 10 to lo- 13 compared with that of milk casein which was 12. The IGT pick resistance was from Ill- 121 to 155, while milk casein was 238. In the case of milk casein addition, the 2 hrs modification (10 % yeast protein, 1 % NaOH, 60 ℃) was clearly most suitable method for mixing with milk casein, the loss of protein which could not be recovered by acidprecipitation was 23 %. The modified yeast protein obtained with this method was good in color, purity and very transparent when dissolved in alkali solution. And from the flow curve of modified yeast protein and milk casein mixture solution, it was obvious that this sample was more appropriate applied with a roal coater than a brush or air knife coater...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{thought that the}} water pick-up rate and {{capacity}} of an ink may have a profound affect on the press performance of an ink. As the water content of ink changes so do the Theological characteristics of the ink and this effects ink performance attributes such as ink transfer, drying, <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> set-off and strength. An emulsification curve can {{shed some light on}} how ink might perform on a press but this alone is not enough. The objective of this thesis research was to study the interaction of fountain solution and ink as used in the printing of newspapers, in terms of ink water pick-up rates and capacity. Further, this is a study of the effect of the fountain solution and ink interaction on ink transfer, drying, <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> set-off and strength. In this study, three different black news inks and three different fountain solutions have been used to make a total of nine different ink and fountain solution combinations. One set was a specific black news ink and fountain solution combination, Flint Low Rub Black and Anchor Neutral Fountain Solution, used in the printing of USA Today at Boston Offset in Norwood, MA. The paper, a 30 # newsprint, was the only newsprint used throughout the testing. Water pick up rates have been determined and emulsification curves have been developed {{with the use of a}} Duke Tester for all nine ink and fountain solution combinations. The effect of these water pick-up rates on the rheological characteristics has been studied with the use of a Brookfield Rotational Viscometer. With the use of a motorized Little Joe printability tester, ink was laid down on the newsprint at a constant volume and any changes in ink strength were measured with a densitometer. <b>Rub</b> <b>resistance</b> was examined with a Rub Tester and a densitometer. The experimental data from this study show a direct correlation between the water pick-up capacity of an ink and the affect this has on the ink rheology and ink performance. The tests and data revealed that each ink had a tendency to pick-up more of the alkaline fountain solution than the neutral solution. The least was picked up with the acid fountain solution. The more fountain solution the inks picked up, the greater the changes in viscosity, strength, dryback and rub-off. With the low-rub premium and the dense black, the viscosity rose higher as the ink picked-up more fountain solution. The soy low-rub ink reacted differently. The soy ink had an initial drop in viscosity then, as the ink began to pick up more fountain solution, the viscosity seemed to stabilize. The more fountain solution the ink picked-up the weaker the strength became. At the same time, the more fountain solution that was picked-up, the less density was lost due to dryback and rub-off...|$|E
30|$|The {{scope of}} the study can be {{extended}} to printing to treated polyethylene films, or to other polymer films commonly used in the ink and printing industry including polypropylene films, since both plastics are popularly used in many printing applications including packaging and publications. Additionally, study for other print properties like scratch resistance, crinkle resistance, and wet <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> can be done. Resistance properties of the dried ink are important in many printing applications. It would be an essential contribution if these properties are also studied. Also, it is recommended to use other mixture designs of experiment like simplex lattice or augmented simplex lattice for modeling and optimization of the print properties. Lastly, cost analysis can {{be included in the}} study for the water-based ink formulations: it is recommended to also develop a cost equation that would describe the cost of the ink {{as a function of the}} ink components under study, which is in this case the three additives by including the cost as another response in the optimization.|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis comprises three studies dealing with water-based flexography on polymer-coated boards, {{which have been}} presented in the five papers included {{at the end of}} the thesis. The first study (covered in three papers) presents results from characterisation of a matrix of water-based inks with respect to their rheology, surface tension, wetting, and fulltone printing performance on PE-coated board. The commercial water-based inks used vary in type of pigment and acrylic vehicle, and in pigment/vehicle mixing proportions. For all mixing proportions, the inks were shear thinning, with viscosity increasing strongly with content of solution (versus emulsion) polymer in the vehicle. Increasing amount of solution polymer also gave the indirect consequence of lower surface tension values. The wet ink amount transferred to the board and the resulting print uniformity responded sensitively to ink formulation and could be correlated to the corresponding changes in these two ink properties. Transferred amount correlated well with ink plastic viscosity and static surface tension, exhibiting a maximum at intermediate values of both. Print mottle decreased with increasing content of solution polymer, principally due to the associated increase in low-shear viscosity and decreased surface tension, both serving to reduce substrate dewetting. In the second study, the effect of corona discharge treatment of PE-coated board on its surface chemistry and print resistance properties was evaluated. The increase in total surface energy, due to its polar component, with increasing corona level was strongly correlated to surface oxidation fraction from XPS. AFM revealed oxidised material nano-mounds, which increased in size and substrate coverage with corona level. Wet <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> (with water) first increased for lower corona dosages before decreasing at higher dosages. This worsened water resistance at higher dosages is presumably due to the oxidised material dissolved and dispersed in the ink film. The third study presents results from another set of water-based acrylic inks printed on boards coated with PE, OPP and PP. Print quality and resistance properties, though dependent on the polymer type, were strongly influenced by the choice of emulsion polymer and presence of silicone additive in the vehicle, with corona treatment level playing a lesser role. The emulsion polymer giving best resistance performance was generally found to give poorest press performance and visual appearance. Again the trends could be understood in terms of wet ink surface tension (versus substrate surface energy), dictating print uniformity, and dry print surface energy (and swellability), dictating resistance properties.

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of commercially printed digital {{documents}} (in particular, marketing and promotional items, direct mailers, business communications, and on-demand color books) was examined to find stress points where potential permanence problems could exist. The stress and life cycle overview covers the stages of processes in printing and finishing, mailing preparation and fulfillment, distribution, usage, and recycling. Stress points found in the different stages of the life cycle, whether physical or chemical, include (but are not limited to) scratching, rubbing, cracking, solvent exposure, light exposure, moisture exposure, heat exposure, and air contamination exposure. Tests for abrasion resistance, folding resistance, solvent resistance, light-fastness, water-fastness, thermostability, and gas/ozone fastness were researched. Based on a survey given to randomly selected printers, printing press vendors, and print buyers, the tests for abrasion resistance, folding resistance, and <b>rub</b> <b>resistance</b> were selected. Using offset lithography as a benchmark, three commercial digital presses as well as high-speed ink jet technology were included in this testing. Using a combination of solid circular test targets and the “Three Musicians” test target (an image for visual comparisons), the Taber Abraser testing method, the Sutherland Rub testing method, and a folding procedure outlined in ASTM document F 1351 were used to examine and to compare the five presses in this study (three commercial digital presses, one offset lithographic press, and one high-speed ink jet press). After testing was performed, visual ranking, changes in density, Delta E, and the abrasion resistance index were used as the criteria to evaluate results. Testing {{results showed that the}} high-speed ink jet held up the best in each test performed during this research; however, the image quality of the high-speed ink jet press was less than the image quality of any other press in this study. The second best performer in the testing was the offset lithographic press. The test performance of these particular presses, as compared with the commercial digital presses, was attributed to the different drying methods in each of the different printing technologies. In the ink jet and lithographic presses, the evaporation, absorption, and oxidation drying methods seemed to hold up better to the testing performed than the drying method of toner-based technology. With oxidation and evaporation, the image (i. e., the ink) actually becomes a part of the paper after drying, whereas, in toner technology, the image (i. e., the toner) is fused to the paper and actually sits on top of it. Within the digital printing industry, coatings have been put in place to alleviate some of these problems, but they have not been tested here. This research shows that offset lithography is the dominant technology in terms of offering abrasion and folding resistance of its printed product...|$|E
40|$|The offset {{printing}} process {{is complex and}} involves the meeting of two essentially complex materials, printing ink and paper, upon which the final product is formed. It can therefore be expected that a multitude of chemical and physical interactions and mechanisms {{take place at the}} ink-paper interface. Interactions between ink and paper are of interest to both the papermakers and ink producers, as they wish to achieve better quality in the final product. The objective of this work is to clarify the combined influence of paper coating structure, printing ink and fountain solution on ink setting and the problems related to ink setting. A further aim is to identify the mechanisms that influence ink setting problems, {{and to be able to}} counteract them by changing properties of the coating layer or by changing the properties of the ink. The work carried out for this thesis included use of many techniques ranging from standard paper and printability tests to advanced optical techniques for detection of ink filaments during ink levelling. Modern imaging methods were applied for assessment of ink filament remain sizes and distribution of ink components inside pigment coating layers. Gravimetric filtration method and assessment of print rub using Ink-Surface-Interaction-Tester (ISIT) were utilized to study the influence of ink properties on ink setting. The chemical interactions were observed with the help of modified thin layer chromatography and contact angle measurements using both conventional and high speed imaging. The results of the papers in this thesis link the press operational parameters to filament sizes and show the influence of these parameters to filament size distribution. The relative importance between the press operation parameters was shown to vary. The size distribution of filaments is important in predicting the ink setting behaviour, which was highlighted by the dynamic gloss and ink setting studies. Prediction of ink setting behaviour was also further improved by use of separate permeability factors for different ink types in connection to filtration equations. The roles of ink components were studied in connection to ink absorption and mechanism of print rub. Total solids content and ratio of linseed oil to mineral oil were found to determine the degree of print rub on coated papers. Wax addition improved print <b>rub</b> <b>resistance,</b> but would not decrease print rub as much as lowering the total solids content in the ink. Linseed oil was shown to absorb into pigment coating pores by mechanism of adsorption to pore walls, which highlights the need for sufficient pore surface area for improved chromatographic separation of ink components. These results should help press operators, suppliers of printing presses, papermakers and suppliers to papermakers, to better understand the material and operating conditions of the press as it relates to various print quality issues. Even though paper is in competition with electronic media, high quality printed products are still in demand. The results should provide useful information for this segment of the industry...|$|E
