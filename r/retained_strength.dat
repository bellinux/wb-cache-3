40|$|The {{behaviour}} of some commercial tool carbides and turbine ceramics {{has been}} investigated in regard to resistance to crack initiation, crack propagation and <b>retained</b> <b>strength</b> after thermal shock. New data are provided, particularly measurements of the fracture toughness of these materials at actual operating temperatures (up to 1200 ° C). Many of the materials did not follow the generally accepted Hasselman theory for thermal shock in ceramics, and instead of showing a discontinuity in <b>retained</b> <b>strength</b> at some critical quenching temperature difference, their residual strengths fell gradually at temperatures lower than their supposed critical quenching temperature. This behaviour is explicable when high temperature toughnesses, strengths and moduli {{are used in the}} damage resistance parameter (ER / gs f 2). It seems that materials not following the Hasselman model suffer cumulative damage with increasing number of shocks. Sub-critical crack growth occurs even if (K IC / gs f) 2 values are constant, and such damage, which reduces the room temperature <b>retained</b> <b>strength,</b> is enhanced by (K IC / gs f) 2 decreasing at temperatures below Δ T c. In contrast, materials obeying Hasselman's model appear to have a constant (K IC / gs f) 2 below ΔT c and for some temperature range above. Only then are “one-shock“ characterizations of materials possible, otherwise, the <b>retained</b> <b>strength</b> depends upon the number of prior shocks. Experiments are also reported which describe the effects of rate of testing on the unshocked and shocked mechanical properties of ceramics.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{magnesium}} aluminum silicate (MAS) {{glass on the}} thermal shock resistance and the oxidation behavior of h-BN matrix composites were systematically investigated at temperature differences from 600 degrees C up to 1400 degrees C.

The strengthening effect of MAS and the surface microstructural evolution of composites {{are responsible for the}} improved thermal shock resistance. Surface oxidation of the composites during the thermal shock process plays a positive role in enhancing the <b>retained</b> <b>strength</b> by self-healing cracks and the appearance of the compressive stress. The oxide layer also acted as a thermal barrier to decelerate the actual thermal stress. Furthermore, this dense layer also improved the oxidation resistance of h-BN matrix composites by prevent diffusion of oxygen.

40|$|The thermal-stress {{resistance}} and fracture strength behaviour of two oxide ceramics (a hot-pressed pure Al 2 O 3 and a composite ceramic NTK-HC 2) subjected to severe thermal shocks have been investigated.

Fracture strength behaviour of these two oxide ceramics is shown to follow Hasselman's model where the instantaneous strength loss at the critical quenching temperature may be calculated using appropriate (K IC / σ f) 2 values to give good agreement with experimental results. Repeated shocks show some further degradation in the <b>retained</b> <b>strength</b> for both ceramics so that these materials are susceptible to thermal fatigue.

Previous research has proposed that tensile strength ratio is a promising test for this application.

40|$|The use of {{geotextiles}} {{in coastal}} {{structures such as}} revetments and bund walls has become a common practice. The performance of these structures during their lifetime depends on the durability of geotextile used. During construction of these coastal structures, geotextiles are subjected to a drop load with high impact stress and that can damage the geotextile. In the current design practice, index tests are insufficient in predicting {{the performance of the}} geotextile. This puts the stability and performance of the coastal structures at risk. The current geotextile design guidelines are based on index tests and there is no standard procedure to account for the potential loss in the geotextile’s mechanical properties during installation (construction). This study aims to develop a standard procedure to estimate the properties of geotextile after its installation and using these properties for designing the performance of these structures. This paper describes the laboratory method of simulating large scale rock dumping on non-woven geotextiles and how to quantify the <b>retained</b> <b>strength</b> of damaged geotextiles.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effects of polyethylene (PE) fibers on the toughness and compressive and flexural strengths of engineered cementitious composite (ECC) cubes and slabs. In particular, this study discussed the reinforcing index (R. I.) as the main parameter. Tests were conducted in direct tension to evaluate the strain-hardening behavior of ECC with different PE fiber contents. Flexural toughness was also assessed following the ASTM C 1018 procedure and post-cracking strength technique (PCSm). Results showed that the compressive strength linearly decreased {{with the increase of}} the reinforcing index, which in turn decreased the first crack load and significantly increased the ultimate load and failure deflections, and the ultimate strength of slabs. The toughness indices 120 to I- 100 significantly increased with the increase in reinforcing index and even exceeded the considered limitations. Based on the observed results, a new definition for the ECC PE was proposed as an extension to the definition given in ASTM C 1018. All the residual strength factors increased when the reinforcing index increased, indicating a higher amount of the <b>retained</b> <b>strength.</b> Similarly, the <b>retained</b> <b>strength</b> had a higher amount when the PCS 24 values increased with increase in the reinforcing indices.
