40|$|Objective. The aim of {{the study}} was to compare under in vitro {{conditions}} marginal sealing of 4 different bulk-fill materials composite <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> class II. Methods. Comparative evaluation concerned 4 composites of a bulk-fill type: SonicFill, Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill, Filtek Bulk Fill, and SDR. The study used 30 third molars without caries. In each tooth 4 cavities of class II were prepared. The prepared tooth samples were placed in a 1 % methylene blue solution for 24 [*]h, and after that in each <b>restoration</b> the depth <b>of</b> dye penetration along the side walls was evaluated. Results. The highest rating (score 0, no dye penetration) was achieved by 93. 33 % <b>of</b> the <b>restorations</b> made <b>of</b> the SDR material, 90 % <b>of</b> <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> SonicFill system, 86. 66 % <b>of</b> <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> the composite Filtek Bulk Fill, and 73. 33 % <b>of</b> <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> the Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill. Conclusion. The performed study showed that bulk-fill flowable or sonic-activated flowable composite restorations have better marginal sealing (lack of discoloration) in comparison with bulk-fill paste-like composite...|$|R

5|$|Various {{fund-raising}} schemes, {{along with}} some financial support from local authorities, allowed small-scale work on the locks to continue, but the projected timescales for completion were missed. In 1983 the Manpower Services Commission, which had a remit to co-ordinate employment and training services in the United Kingdom, agreed to employ 50 men on work that included <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> Aldermaston Lock, its adjacent wharf, and Widmead Lock. The <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> the Dundas Aqueduct and several smaller schemes were later added to the list. Maintenance agreements were signed with local authorities along the route, while fund-raising activities continued. The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders sponsored a workshop, which opened in Shrivenham in 1987, to create new lock gates for the Crofton and Devizes flights. In 1988 the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> Woolhampton Lock was completed, but obstructions remained on either side. Frounds swing bridge could not be opened and the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> Midgham Lock had not been finished; both were completed the following year. Re-puddling of the Crofton pounds {{was carried out in}} 1989, along with the reconstruction of Midgham Bridge. <b>Restoration</b> <b>of</b> the turf-sided Monkey Marsh Lock proved difficult because of its status as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the consequent need to protect the historic site while improving safety.|$|E
