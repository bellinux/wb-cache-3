5000|$|Also in no-limit and pot-limit games, a raise may be {{expressed}} {{as either a}} <b>raise</b> <b>by</b> $X or a raise to $X. For example, suppose Alice opens by betting $5. If Dianne subsequently announces [...] "I <b>raise</b> <b>by</b> $15" [...] she will be <b>raising</b> <b>by</b> $15 {{over and above the}} opening bet of $5, for a total bet of $20. On the other hand, if Dianne subsequently announces [...] "I raise to $15" [...] she will be <b>raising</b> <b>by</b> only $10 for a total bet of $15. Today, most public cardrooms prefer for players to use the raise to standard as opposed to the <b>raise</b> <b>by</b> standard. In the event of any ambiguity in a player's verbal action while raising, the player will normally be bound to raise to the stated amount. For example, if Alice were to have opened with a $5 bet and Dianne subsequently announced [...] "raise, $15" [...] while putting $20 into pot, in most public cardrooms Dianne would be bound to a total bet of $15 and the [...] "excess" [...] $5 would be returned to her.|$|R
