40|$|According to most {{models of}} speech production, the {{planning}} of spoken words involves the independent retrieval of segments and metrical frames followed by segment-to-frame association. In some models, the metrical frame includes a specification of the number and ordering of consonants and vowels, but in the word-form encoding by activation and verification (WEAVER) model (A. Roelofs, 1997), the frame specifies only the stress pattern across syllables. In 6 implicit priming experiments, on each trial, participants produced 1 word out of a small set as quickly as possible. In homogeneous sets, the <b>response</b> <b>words</b> shared word-initial segments, whereas in heterogeneous sets, they did not.

When {{the category of}} the stimulus word predicted its <b>response</b> <b>word</b> category, and the response was relatively unique within its category, learning was extremely rapid, and negative transfer and RI were negligible. The more the competing primed items in the predicted response category, the slower the learning and the greater the RI. If cues and responses were unrelated, learning was very slow, and RI was appreciable. Thus, predictive relations that help stimuli retrieve unique responses greatly alter forgetting in RI paradigms. This research returns to a fundamental question in the psychology of memory: Why do people forget things they have once learned?

40|$|When a <b>response</b> <b>word</b> bearing an orthographic, acoustic, or {{semantic}} {{relation to a}} stimulus word is generated rather than read, later recall is enhanced.

40|$|Cued {{recall and}} item {{recognition}} {{are considered the}} standard episodic memory retrieval tasks. However, only the neural correlates of the latter have been studied in detail with fMRI. Using an event-related fMRI experimental design that permits spoken responses, we tested hypotheses from an auto-associative model of cued recall and item recognition [Chappell, M., & Humphreys, M. S. (1994). An auto-associative neural network for sparse representations: Analysis and application to models of recognition and cued recall. Psychological Review, 101, 103 - 128]. In brief, the model assumes that cues elicit a network of phonological short term memory (STM) and semantic long term memory (LTM) representations distributed throughout the neocortex as patterns of sparse activations. This information is transferred to the hippocampus which converges upon the item closest to a stored pattern and outputs a <b>response.</b> <b>Word</b> pairs were learned from a study list, with {{one member of the}} pair serving as the cue at test. Unstudied words were also intermingled at test in order to provide an analogue of yes/no recognition tasks. Compared to incorrectly rejected studied items (misses) and correctly rejected (CR) unstudied items, correctly recalled items (hits) elicited increased responses in the left hippocampus and neocortical regions including the left inferior prefrontal cortex (LIPC), left mid lateral temporal cortex and inferior parietal cortex, consistent with predictions from the model. This network was very similar to that observed in yes/no recognition studies, supporting proposals that cued recall and item recognition involve common rather than separate mechanisms.

40|$|Evidence from {{previous}} psycholinguistic {{research suggests that}} phonological units such as phonemes have a privileged role during phonological planning in Dutch and English (aka the segment-retrieval hypothesis). However, the syllable-retrieval hypothesis previously proposed for Mandarin assumes that only the entire syllable unit (without the tone) can be prepared in advance in speech planning. Using Cantonese Chinese as a test case, {{the present study was}} conducted to investigate whether the syllable-retrieval hypothesis can be applied to other Chinese spoken languages. In four implicit priming (form-preparation) experiments, participants were asked to learn various sets of prompt-response di-syllabic word pairs and to utter the corresponding <b>response</b> <b>word</b> upon seeing each prompt. The response words in a block were either phonologically related (homogeneous) or unrelated (heterogeneous). Participants' naming responses were significantly faster in the homogeneous than in the heterogeneous conditions when the response words shared the same word-initial syllable (without the tone) (Exps. 1 and 4) or body (Exps. 3 and 4), but not when they shared merely the same word-initial phoneme (Exp. 2). Furthermore, the priming effect observed in the syllable-related condition was significantly larger than that in the body-related condition (Exp. 4). Although the observed syllable priming effects and the null effect of word-initial phoneme are consistent with the syllable-retrieval hypothesis, the body-related (sub-syllabic) priming effects obtained in this Cantonese study are not. These results suggest that the syllable-retrieval hypothesis is not generalizable to all Chinese spoken languages and that both syllable and sub-syllabic constituents are legitimate planning units in Cantonese speech production...|$|E
40|$|In {{a reverse}} Stroop task, {{observers}} {{respond to the}} meaning of a color word irrespective of the color in which the word is printed—for example, the word red may be printed in the congruent color (red), an incongruent color (e. g., blue), or a neutral color (e. g., white). Although reading of color words in this task is often thought to be neither facilitated by congruent print colors nor interfered with incongruent print colors, this interference has been detected by using a response method that does not give any bias in favor of processing of word meanings or processing of print colors. On the other hand, evidence for the presence of facilitation in this task has been scarce, even though this facilitation is theoretically possible. By modifying the task such that participants respond to a stimulus color word by pointing to a corresponding <b>response</b> <b>word</b> on a computer screen with a mouse, the present study investigated the possibility that not only interference but also facilitation would take place in a reverse Stroop task. Importantly, in this study, participants’ responses were dynamically tracked by recording the entire trajectories of the mouse. Arguably, this method provided richer information about participants’ performance than traditional measures such as reaction time and accuracy, allowing for more detailed (and thus potentially more sensitive) investigation of facilitation and interference in the reverse Stroop task. These trajectories showed that the mouse’s approach toward correct response words was significantly delayed by incongruent print colors but not affected by congruent print colors, demonstrating that only interference, not facilitation, was present in the current task. Implications of these findings are discussed within a theoretical framework in which the strength of association between a task and its response method plays a critical role in determining how word meanings and print colors interact in reverse Stroop tasks...|$|E

When comparing episodic with semantic retrieval, the well-trained subjects showed significant left medial temporal lobe activation, which was also significantly greater than that shown by the poorly trained subjects, who failed to show significant medial temporal lobe activation. In contrast, the poorly trained subjects showed significant bilateral frontal lobe activation, which was significantly greater than that shown by the well-trained subjects who failed to show significant frontal lobe activation. The frontal activations occurred mainly in the dorsolateral region, but extended into the ventrolateral and, to a lesser extent, the frontal polar regions.

40|$|Differences {{between the}} {{cognitive}} {{processes involved in}} word reading and picture naming are well established (e. g. visual or lexico-semantic stages). Still, it is commonly thought that retrieval of phonological forms is shared across tasks. We report a test of this second hypothesis based on {{the time course of}} electroencephalographic (EEG) neural activity, reasoning that similar EEG patterns might index similar processing stages. Seventeen participants named objects and read aloud the corresponding words while their behavior and EEG activity were recorded. The latter was analyzed from stimulus onset onwards (stimulus-locked analysis) and from response onset backwards (response-locked analysis), using non-parametric statistics and the spatio-temporal segmentation of ERPs. Behavioral results confirmed that reading entails shorter latencies than naming. The analysis of EEG activity within the stimulus-to-response period allowed distinguishing three phases, broadly successive. Early on, we observed identical distribution of electric field potentials (i. e. topographies) albeit with large amplitude divergences between tasks. Then, we observed sustained cross-task differences in topographies accompanied by extended amplitude differences. Finally, the two tasks again revealed the same topographies, with significant cross-task delays in their onsets and offsets, and still significant amplitude differences. In the response-locked ERPs, the common topography displayed an offset closer to response articulation in word reading compared with picture naming, that is the transition between the offset of this shared map and the onset of articulation was significantly faster in word reading. The results suggest that the degree of cross-task similarity varies across time. The first phase suggests similar visual processes of variable intensity and time course across tasks, while the second phase suggests marked differences. Finally, similarities and differences within the third phase are compatible with a shared processing stage (likely phonological processes) with different temporal properties (onset/offset) across tasks. Overall, our results provide an overview of when, between stimulus and <b>response,</b> <b>word</b> reading and picture naming are subtended by shared- versus task-specific neural signatures. This in turn is suggestive of when the two tasks involve similar vs. different cognitive processes...|$|E
40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsych) Cognitive deficits, and in {{particular}} memory problems, are well documented in people with schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation programs {{have been found to}} be successful in remediating these cognitive deficits including memory. Mnemonics and other strategies have been found to assist with memory but it has also been found that people with schizophrenia trained in these strategies don’t utilise them to improve memory performance. Recent research in cognitive remediation has focused on motivation as a factor in engagement with mnemonic and other cognitive strategies. It is not known what motivational factors and program length improves cognition. In addition access to programs in rural and remote areas of Australia is limited yet it is unknown if people with schizophrenia would utilise online cognitive remediation programs. The purpose of this study was to establish whether online cognitive remediation therapy programs are feasible for use with people with schizophrenia. This thesis will focus on the second of two studies which examines whether Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) can improve memory using specific learning and motivational techniques. In this study, two purpose-built online CRT programs were developed, both identical except that one had no specific strategies (control) and one had mnemonic strategies and instructions (experimental). Participants were recruited from Newcastle and Lake Macquarie Mental Health services with a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia. Participants were randomly allocated to four different conditions: paid control, paid experimental, unpaid control or unpaid experimental. Initial assessments were completed with all participants that included two subtests of the WASI, the WTAR, SANS and SAPS, EMQ, GAF, and CVLT-II as well as the initial assessment on the online CRT program. The CRT program was made of several memory tasks in which participants paired a cue word or face with a <b>response</b> <b>word.</b> Different cues and response pairs were used in initial test, final test and in two training modules. The two training modules comprised of six training levels each. Participants completed the same learning, cued recall and two-alternative forced-choice recognition tasks during the pre and post-test as well training modules. After the initial assessment, participants were asked to complete two hours a week of the CRT training program over six weeks (or two levels a week). At the end of six weeks all participants completed a final assessment which included the EMQ, GAF, and CVLT-II in addition to a final assessment on the online CRT program. Results: In total 40 participants completed the study, 19 in the experimental condition and 21 in the control group with approximately equal numbers in the paid and unpaid conditions. There were few significant differences in between the different performances conditions on the memory focused CRT program, or on the other assessments employed. Payment had little effect, with only marginally more training being completed on average for the paid group than unpaid. There was little evidence for an association between symptoms and training levels completed. Given that a large number of participants did not complete any training only results from the pre and post CRT assessments were analysed. However, these analyses were supplemented by examining correlations between changes in performance from pre to post memory sessions with number of training levels completed. For learning tasks, word cues required significantly fewer tries than face cues. Approximately half the participants completed six or more training levels. Overall, all participants’ GAF and EMQ scores improved, but there were no significant differences between experimental and control groups. In the CVLT-II there were only two tasks which showed significant differences between conditions; the total number correct in four recall attempts was significantly greater post-test overall, but this improvement did not differ between instruction groups and the same was the case for the short (30 second) delay recall test...|$|E
