40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of collecting rapping system in electrostatic precipitators (ESP) and controlling the relevant damage under impact loading, fatigue durability of this system is analyzed in the present study based on the numerical and experimental results considering fatigue damage growth and vibration acceleration in the collecting system because of the successive impact of rapping hammers. By microscopic examination of the fracture surface of <b>rapping</b> <b>hammer,</b> beach marks obviously show typical fatigue failure in the <b>rapping</b> <b>hammer</b> arm. In addition, the microscopic examination of the cross section of the collecting plates indicates the corrosion voids which cause crack and eventually fatigue failure. The finite element method is applied to determine both the stress and concentration positions of dynamic stress on the rapping system under impact loading. The paper results can be utilized in system optimization and new material selection for the system by evaluating rapping system durability...|$|E

6000|$|I next tried my {{hand at the}} Organ-Grinding for a while, and may {{say that}} I made out pretty well. It is a plain, {{straightforward}} business, and requires no particular abilities.

This done, you have only to stroll along, with the mill on your back, until you see tanbark in the street, and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin. Then you stop and grind; looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday. Presently a window opens, and somebody pitches you a sixpence, with a request to [...] "Hush up and go on," [...] etc. I am aware that some grinders have actually afforded to [...] "go on" [...] for this sum; but for my part, I found the necessary outlay of capital too great to permit of my [...] "going on" [...] under a shilling.|$|R
