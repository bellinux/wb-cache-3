25|$|An optical {{keyboard}} technology utilizes {{light emitting}} devices and photo sensors to optically detect actuated keys. Most commonly the emitters and sensors {{are located in the}} perimeter, mounted on a small PCB. The light is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys. Most optical keyboards require at least 2 beams (most commonly vertical beam and horizontal beam) to determine the actuated key. Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks the light in a certain pattern, allowing only one beam per <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> (most commonly horizontal beam).|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{variants}} of the nyckelharpa {{used to have}} one or more drone strings. This {{is not the case}} for modern chromatic nyckelharpor with three <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> for three melody strings and one bass string. But there are today also types with four or even five <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Teletype Model 20 is an upper/lower case Type Bar Page Printer {{available}} as a receive only machine or a send-receive machine with four <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys,</b> using a six-bit code for TeleTypeSetter (TTS) use.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "home row" [...] is {{the center}} <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> on a {{typewriter}} or computer keyboard. On {{the most common type}} of English language keyboard, the QWERTY layout, [...] " [...] " [...] are the home keys on the home row.|$|E
5000|$|In the Maltron layout, {{the home}} <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> are [...] "ANISF" [...] {{for the left}} hand and [...] "DTHOR" [...] for the right hand. This home row {{can be used to}} type many more {{complete}} words than that found on a Qwerty keyboard.|$|E
50|$|The top <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys,</b> {{including}} {{the escape key}} and function keys, are small soft-touch keys with membrane dome switches. The remaining keys are standard size and {{each has its own}} Cherry MX brown key switch, providing a tactile feel, but no click. A piezo buzzer provides optional key click.|$|E
2500|$|The {{core section}} of a {{keyboard}} comprises character keys, {{which can be used}} to type letters and other characters. Typically, there are three <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> for typing letters and punctuation, an upper row for typing digits and special symbols, and the [...] on the bottom <b>row.</b> The positioning <b>of</b> the character <b>keys</b> is similar to the keyboard of a typewriter.|$|R
25|$|Solar's {{paintings}} are mainly sculptures, often using striking contrasts and bright colours, typically in relatively small formats. His visual style seems equidistant between Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee {{on the one}} hand and Marc Chagall on the other. He also worked in some extremely unorthodox artistic media, such as modifying pianos, including a version with three <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
50|$|Earlier {{teleprinters}} {{had three}} <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> and only supported upper case letters. They used the 5 bit ITA2 code and generally worked at 60 to 100 words per minute. Later teleprinters, specifically the Teletype Model 33, used ASCII code, an innovation {{that came into}} widespread use in the 1960s as computers became more widely available.|$|R

50|$|The QWERTY {{keyboard}} has 5 <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b> The number keys {{now have}} their own row, {{as opposed to the}} Rumor keyboard where they shared a row {{across the top of the}} keyboard. The keys are still made with rubber. Unlike the original Rumor, the Rumor 2 keyboard includes arrow keys for easier navigation and an “enter” and a “back” button.|$|R
5000|$|In other cases, the Delete key {{is in its}} {{original}} IBM notebook position of above {{and to the right}} <b>of</b> the Backspace <b>key.</b> Many laptops add <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> smaller <b>keys</b> above the Function key line to add keys on a non-standard size keyboard. On this <b>row</b> <b>of</b> smaller <b>keys,</b> the position <b>of</b> the Delete <b>key</b> is positioned at or near the right-hand end. On Apple's line of laptops (e.g. the MacBook and MacBook Pro), the forward delete function can be achieved using the [...] key combination.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> is {{differentiated}} {{from the}} one above and the one below by a different tactile feel: the even rows have round and raised keys and the odd rows have flat and oblong keys. The keys of the first machines, with their metal rims, {{are similar to the}} typewriters keys of the same period. Plastic keys were also introduced very early on but their rows do not have that tactile difference.|$|E
50|$|It has to {{be noted}} that previously, during 1893, a {{keyboard}} layout for the Blickensderfer typewriter model 5 was developed by George Blickensderfer after careful analysis of the English language with quite the same results for the home <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b> Blickensderfer determined that 70% {{of the most commonly}} used letters (ETAOIN SHRDLU) and 85% of words contained the letters DHIATENSOR. That's why he used these letters for the last row of the typewriter. The Dvorak's home row AOEUIDHTNS has the vowels on the left and has replaced the R by the U.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Apple Extended Keyboard's {{case was}} sloped upward towards the rear {{so that when}} viewed from the side it formed a continuous convex curve. The case extended downward {{to sit on the}} desk, so it provided considerable internal volume. The case also had a significant amount of empty space at the rear, behind the top <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b> This made for a relatively large and heavy case. The plastic of the case shell below the keyboard section on top was serrated, a common detail found on many Apple products of the era.|$|E
2500|$|The Blickensderfer typewriter, {{designed}} by George Canfield Blickensderfer in 1892, {{was known for}} its novel keyboard layout, its interchangeable font, and its suitability for travel. [...] The Blickensderfer keyboard had three banks (<b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys),</b> with special characters being entered using a separate Shift key; the home row was, uniquely, the bottom one (i.e. the typist kept {{her hands on the}} bottom row). [...] A computer or standard typewriter keyboard, on the other hand, has four banks <b>of</b> <b>keys,</b> with home <b>row</b> being second from bottom.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, LG {{announced}} the first Bluetooth keyboard that folds {{up along the}} four <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> that can be tossed in a purse or pocket. The Rolly keyboard is made of solid plastic. Two tiny plastic arms fold out {{from the end of}} the keyboard to support a tablet or smartphone, and it can toggle between two different Bluetooth-connected devices at a time. Battery life is an expected three months on a single AAA battery.|$|R
50|$|In 1882 Jankó {{patented}} the Jankó keyboard, {{with six}} <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys,</b> drawing upon earlier designs by Conrad Henfling (1708), Johann Rohleder (1791) and William Lunn (1843). From the year 1886 he used this instrument {{at his own}} concert journeys. The Norwegian pianist Tekla Nathan Bjerke was a pupil of Jankó, and played many concerts in Norway using this instrument. The Jankó keyboard wasn't used by many people as {{it was hard for}} them to relearn new fingering on a strange keyboard.|$|R
50|$|NOSTALGIA (Nosutarujia) {{was first}} {{released}} on March 1, 2017, available as an upgrade kit for BeatStream cabinets or {{as a new}} machine. The game serves as a spiritual successor to Keyboardmania, with its gameplay involving a keyboard-esque controller used to hit notes coming {{from the top of}} the screen. Unlike Keyboardmania though, you do not have to hit a specific key, just one in the note's general area. Only one <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> is used as well; while the cabinet does have black keys, they are solely for decoration. The touchscreen used by BeatStream is reused to navigate the game's interface.|$|E

5000|$|The Jankó {{keyboard}} is {{a musical}} keyboard layout for a piano designed by Paul von Jankó in 1882. It {{was designed to}} overcome two limitations on the traditional piano keyboard: the large-scale geometry of the keys (stretching beyond a ninth, or even an octave, can be difficult or impossible for pianists with small hands), {{and the fact that}} each scale has to be fingered differently. Instead of a single row, the Jankó keyboard has an array of keys consisting of two interlocking manuals with three touch-points for each key lever. Each vertical column of keys is a semitone away from its neighboring columns, and on each horizontal <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> the interval from one note to the next is a whole step.|$|E
50|$|Released in June, 2012, the W530 has a {{very similar}} {{exterior}} appearance to the prior W models. Being the last W model prior to the W540 redesign, {{it is the last}} W to feature the lid lock, keyboard light and wireless and HDD LED indicators, and the first W model to feature the controversial yet well-reviewed chicklet-style keyboard, which features 6 rows rather than 7 <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> and a more modern key shape. The W530 comes equipped with Ivy Bridge processors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coordinates}} <b>of</b> a <b>key</b> can {{be calculated}} using {{the size of the}} generator (in cents), where the vertical position is the number of generators away from the starting pitch, (positive or negative depending on whether they are in the sharp or flat direction), which Bosanquet rounded to the nearest semitone, giving 12 vertically aligned <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> in each octave. Wilson introduced alternate arrangements with combinations of seven or five (and in some cases, i.e., a division of the octave in 13 tones, eight) vertical lines <b>of</b> <b>keys,</b> and so Bosanquet keyboard sometimes is used to distinguish the original arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|When {{hexadecimal}} is selected, the <b>row</b> <b>of</b> six <b>keys</b> {{normally used}} for floating-point functions (trigonometry, logarithms, exponentiation, etc.) are instead {{allocated to the}} hex digits A to F (although they are physically labelled [...] to [...] ).|$|R
5000|$|A {{program could}} be saved to mylar-based magnetically coated cards (71 mm &times; 9.5 mm), which were fed through the reader by a small {{electric}} motor through a worm gear and rubber roller at a speed of 6 cm/s. [...] The recording area used {{only half of the}} width of the card. While reversing the card to store a second program was possible, it was officially discouraged (unlike in later models such as the HP-67) because {{the other half of the}} card was touched by the rubber wheel during transport, causing extra abrasion. When inserted into an extra slot between the display and the keyboard, the printing on top of the card would correspond to the top <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> (A - E), which served as shortcuts to the corresponding program entry points.|$|E
5000|$|Blickensderfers {{were also}} notable for their unique {{keyboard}} layout developed by George Blickensderfer after careful {{analysis of the}} English language. The home, or lowest <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys,</b> contained {{the most commonly used}} letters. Blickensderfer determined that 70% of the most commonly used letters and 85% of words contained the letters DHIATENSOR. This positioning allowed the typist to keep his hands on the home row as much as possible, minimizing extraneous hand movement and increasing efficiency. The QWERTY keyboard introduced on the Sholes & Glidden typewriter in 1874 was designed for purely mechanical reasons and the chances of the keys striking each other and jamming was more limited with this configuration. Because the Blickensderfer used the typewheel, the [...] "scientific" [...] keyboard layout could be used for maximum typing efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, Masakowski {{invented the}} keytar, a guitar-like {{instrument}} with seven rows of keys instead of strings, one key at each fret. This pre-MIDI controller was hardwired to a Moog synthesizer. One advantage {{of such an}} instrument was that it allowed playing more than one note in a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> at the same time, the equivalent on the guitar of playing multiple simultaneous notes on one string. Masakowski's song [...] "Stepping Stone" [...] was composed on the keytar, which allowed for the cluster-type chord voicings. For {{the duration of the}} Mars era, his rig included a Gretsch seven-string guitar, with the keytar fastened to the top. He chose not to pursue a patent for the keytar, opting to concentrate on a revised prototype of the instrument that failed due to lack of funding.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "home position," [...] {{the fingers}} of the left hand rest along {{the gap between the}} two main <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> {{to the left of the}} {{asterisk}} (little finger on the [...] "S" [...] to forefinger on the [...] "H" [...] and [...] "R"). These fingers are used to generate initial consonants. The fingers of the right hand lie in the corresponding position to the right of the asterisk (forefinger on [...] "FR" [...] to little finger on [...] "TS"), and are used for final consonants. The thumbs produce the vowels.|$|R

5000|$|Her first {{books were}} written by hand in {{exercise}} books and then typed out on her father's early 20th century Corona typewriter which had three <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b> Thereafter she had a larger machine. This situation continued until {{she could no longer}} read her own typescript at which point she [...] "wrote" [...] straight onto C90 cassette, copying this on to a second cassette on a twin track tape recorder making alterations along the way through the microphone. She typed out a copy of this (which she was unable to read) and passed this to a professional typist to make a fair copy for the publisher.|$|R
