40|$|Research {{investigating}} {{the role of}} maladaptive emotion regulation on food intake has exclusively focused on food intake in a forced consumption situation. In contrast, the present study examined the effect of negative emotions (fear, negative affect) and emotion regulation strategies (suppression, reappraisal) on food intake in a non-forced, free eating setting where participants (N = 165) could choose whether {{and how much they}} ate. This free (ad libitum) eating approach enabled, for the first time, the testing of 1) whether eating (yes/no) is used as a secondary emotion regulation strategy and 2) whether the amount of food intake differed, depending on the emotion regulation strategy. In order to produce a more ecologically valid design, emotion regulation strategy manipulation was realized while exposing participants to emotion-induction procedures. To induce an initial negative emotional state, a movie clip was presented without emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>instruction.</b> The instructions to regulate emotions (suppression, reappraisal, no emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>instruction)</b> then preceded a second clip. The results show that whereas about two-thirds of the control (no emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>instruction)</b> and suppression groups began to eat, only one-third of the reappraisal group did. However, when reappraisers began to eat, they ate as much as participants in the suppression and control groups. Accordingly, the results suggest that when people are confronted with a negative event, eating is used as a secondary coping strategy when the enacted emotion regulation is ineffective. Conversely, an adaptive emotion regulation such as reappraisal decreases the likelihood of eating in the first place, even when emotion regulation is employed during rather than before the unfolding of the negative event. Consequently, the way we deal with negative emotions might be more relevant for explaining emotional eating than the distress itself...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at the {{investigation}} of cognitive reappraisal and its short-term outcomes on three emotional response systems: behavior, physiology and subjective experience. 163 nursing {{students were asked to}} watch the same high-impact event (amputation of an arm) which was incorporated within a longer clip assembled using the films provided by the previous study (Study 2). Two different reappraisal strategies were compared: in one group, subjects (N= 83) were asked to distance themselves in front of the negative event to down-regulate negative emotions, whereas in the second group (N= 80) participants were asked to adopt an immersed and participated attitude towards the events. The study presents the results about the effect of the type of scenario and type of <b>regulation</b> <b>instruction</b> on emotional responses belonging to subjective experience (indexes of emotional impact), behavioral expression (face, gaze, posture and head movements) and physiological arousal (HR and EDA) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{accounting}} standardization project, {{kicked off}} by the passage of US securities laws in the 1930 s, has steadily gained momentum over seven decades. Today, written standards dominate accounting thought, practice, <b>regulation,</b> <b>instruction,</b> even research. Generally accepted accounting principles—originally a mere description in its plain English meaning—have since been capitalized into a proper name—Generally Accepted Accounting Principles—and the phrase now describes rules and regulations issued by authorities with power to inflict punishment on {{those who do not}} choose to accept them. How and why did financial reporting get caught in the standardization project, replacing social norms of corporate and professional behavior by written rules and standards? What are the consequences of this transformation? What alternative courses are available to accounting and corporate governance? I argue that heavy reliance on the codification of financial reporting has been a wrong path. A shift from rules towards norms of behavior may yet help accounting and corporate governance recover a better balance...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} regulating emotions through reappraisal does not incur cognitive costs. However, in those experiments, cognitive costs were often assessed by recognition memory for information that was contextually related to the emotionally evocative stimuli and may have been incorporated into the reappraisal script, facilitating memory. Furthermore, there is little research on the cognitive correlates of regulating positive emotions. In the current experiment, we tested memory for information that was contextually unrelated to the emotional stimuli and could not easily be related to the reappraisal. Participants viewed neutral and mildly positive slides and either reappraised, suppressed their emotions, or viewed the images with no emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>instruction.</b> At the same time, they heard abstract words that were unrelated to the picture stimuli. Subsequent verbal recognition memory was lower after reappraising than viewing, whereas non-verbal recognition memory (of the slides) was higher after reappraising, but only for positive pictures and when participants viewed the positive pictures first. Suppression had no significant effect on either verbal or non-verbal recognition scores, although there was a trend towards poorer recognition of verbal information. The findings support the notion that reappraisal is effortful and draws on limited cognitive resources, causing decrements in performance in a concurrent memory task...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive reappraisal (CR) is a {{commonly}} used emotion-regulation strategy {{that has been}} shown to influence affective, cognitive, and social outcomes. Although {{progress has been made in}} elucidating the mechanisms underlying CR, the role of attention remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of attention in CR by tracking participants ’ gazes during the presentation of videos depicting people in negative moods. Participants were asked to attend naturally or to use reappraisal to increase or decrease their emotions while viewing the videos. After each video, they rated their negative emotion experience. Results showed that participants spent more time looking at the emotional regions in the target’s face (eyes and mouth) when asked to up-regulate their emotions, compared with when they simply attended to the videos. The reverse pattern was found for down-regulation of emotions. In addition, the effects of cognitive reappraisal on negative emotion experience were mediated by the time spent looking at the emotional regions, with a stronger effect for the down-regulation instruction. Finally, direct effects of <b>regulation</b> <b>instruction</b> on negative emotion were observed even when controlling for time spent viewing emotional regions, which suggests that attention and CR are distinct components that uniquely influence negative emotions. These results complement and extend previous findings on the role of attention in CR, and highlight the importance of taking attentional mechanisms into account when designing CR training...|$|E

40|$|Children {{regulate}} {{negative emotions}} {{in a variety}} of ways. Emotion education programs typically discourage emotional disengagement and encourage emotional engagement or “working through ” neg-ative emotions. The authors examined the effects of emotional disengagement and engagement on children’s memory for educational material. Children averaging 7 or 10 years of age (N 200) watched either a sad or an emotionally neutral film and were then instructed to emotionally disengage, instructed to engage in problem solving concerning their emotion, or received no emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>instructions.</b> All children then watched and were asked to recall the details of an emotionally neutral educational film. Children instructed to disengage remembered the educational film better than children instructed to work through their feelings or children who received no emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>instructions.</b> Although past research has indicated that specific forms of emotional disengagement can impair memory for emotion-ally relevant events, the current findings suggest that disengagement is a useful short-term strategy for regulating mild negative emotion in educational settings...|$|R

Emotion regulation refers to the various ways of managing or controlling emotional responses. External stimuli play specific role in electing emotions.

40|$|Abstract This study {{examined}} neural features of emotional responses to errors. We specifically examined whether directed emotion regulation of negative emotion associated with error modulates action-monitoring functions of anterior cingulate cortex, including conflict monitoring, error pro-cessing, and error prevention. Seventeen healthy adults performed a continuous performance task during assessment by fMRI. In each block, {{participants were asked}} either to increase or decrease their negative emotional responses or to react naturally after error commission. Emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>instructions</b> were associated with modulation of rostral and dorsal anterior activity and of their effective connectivity following errors and conflict. Cingulate activity and connec-tivity predicted subsequent errors. These data may suggest that responses to errors are affected by emotion and that aspects of emotion and cognition are inextricably linked, even during a nominally cognitive task...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that emotion regulation improves with aging. Here, we investigated age differences in emotion regulation by studying modulation of the late positive potential (LPP) by emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>instructions.</b> The electroencephalogram of younger (18 - 26 years) and older (60 - 77 years) adults was recorded while they viewed neutral, unpleasant, and pleasant pictures and while they were instructed to increase or decrease the feelings that the emotional pictures elicited. The LPP was enhanced when participants were instructed to increase their emotions. No age differences were observed in this emotion regulation effect, suggesting that emotion regulation abilities are unaffected by aging. This contradicts studies that measured emotion regulation by self-report, yet accords with studies that measured emotion regulation by means of facial expressions or psychophysiological responses. More research is needed to resolve the apparent discrepancy between subjective self-report and objective psychophysiological measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{process by}} which {{emotions}} affect eating behavior emerges {{as one of the}} central unresolved questions in the field of emotional eating. The present studies address the hypothesis that the regulation strategies people use to deal with these emotions are responsible for increased eating. Negative emotions were induced and intake of comfort food and non–comfort food was measured by means of taste tests. Emotion induction was preceded by measuring individual differences in emotion regulation strategies (Study 1) or by instructions to regulate emotions in either an adaptive (reappraisal) or maladaptive (suppression) manner (Study 2). Study 3 also entailed a control condition without any <b>regulation</b> <b>instructions.</b> Relative to reappraisal and spontaneous expression, suppression led to increased food intake, but only of the comfort foods. Emotions themselves were not responsible for this effect. These findings provide new evidence that the way in which emotions are regulated affects eating behavior...|$|R
