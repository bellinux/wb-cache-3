5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. The {{life expectancy of}} slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a <b>rapid</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the numbers of slaves. Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.

5|$|Heat bursts {{are rare}} {{atmospheric}} phenomenon characterized by gusty winds and a <b>rapid</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> temperature and decrease in dew point (moisture). Heat bursts typically occur during night-time and {{are associated with}} decaying thunderstorms. In association with wake lows, heat bursts are caused when rain evaporates (virga) into a parcel of cold dry air high in the atmosphere making the air denser than its surroundings. The parcel descends rapidly, warming due to compression, overshoots its equilibrium level and reaches the surface, similar to a downburst.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rapid</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> total {{lightning}} (also termed "lightning jumps") {{have been}} observed for many decades. Lightning jumps have been well correlated to severe and hazardous weather occurrence. The main focus of lightning jump work {{has been on the}} development of lightning algorithms to be used in realtime assessment of storm intensity. However, in these studies it is typically assumed that the updraft "increases" without direct measurements of the vertical motion, or specification of which updraft characteristic actually increases (e. g., average speed, maximum speed, or convective updraft volume). Therefore, an endtoend physical and dynamical basis for coupling <b>rapid</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> total flash rate to <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> updraft speed and volume must be understood in order to ultimately relate lightning occurrence to severe storm metrics. Herein, we use polarimetric, multiDoppler, and lightning mapping array measurements to provide physical context as to why <b>rapid</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> total lightning are closely tied to severe and hazardous weather...|$|R

5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the <b>rapid</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} taxonomic {{revisions}} by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, {{the number of}} recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008. With continuing cytogenetic and molecular genetic research, as well as ongoing field studies, particularly with cryptic species such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur species is likely to keep growing. However, the <b>rapid</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the number of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the species concept used, conservationists often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection. Others favor a more thorough analysis.|$|E
40|$|Inflammation {{may play}} a role in the {{development}} of benign prostatic hyperplasia and/or lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) may therefore be associated with the development of these outcomes. The authors examined the association of CRP levels measured <b>in</b> 1996 with <b>rapid</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen levels, and LUTS as well as rapid decreases in peak flow rates (through 2005) in a population-based cohort of men residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Men with CRP levels of ≥ 3. 0 mg/L were more likely to have <b>rapid</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> irritative LUTS (odds ratio (OR) [*]=[*] 2. 14, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 18, 3. 85) and rapid decreases in peak flow rates (OR[*]=[*] 2. 54, 95 % CI: 1. 09, 5. 92) compared with men with CRP levels of < 3. 0 mg/L. CRP levels were not significantly associated with <b>rapid</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> prostate volume, obstructive LUTS, or prostate-specific antigen levels. Associations were attenuated after adjusting for age, body mass index, hypertension, and smoking history (irritative LUTS: OR = 2. 00, 95 % CI: 1. 04, 3. 82; peak flow rate: OR = 2. 45, 95 % CI: 0. 73, 8. 25). These results suggest that <b>rapid</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> irritative LUTS and rapid decreases in peak flow rates may be due to inflammatory processes...|$|R

5|$|Electroporation is the <b>rapid</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> bilayer {{permeability}} {{induced by}} {{the application of a}} large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, electroporation {{is one of the key}} methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Rusty's landfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services placed 30personnel {{on standby}} and began aerial surveys {{to determine if}} residents needed aid. Residents in Pilbara were warned {{of the dangers of}} asbestos in damaged or destroyed structures in early March as they were allowed to return home. A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from the seafloor and brought it to the surface, causing the <b>rapid</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting effects in the region.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its {{primary goal is}} to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} <b>rapid</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|E

5|$|The rise {{in global}} demand {{has been driven}} by high growth rates in glass fiber, {{fiberglass}} and borosilicate glassware production. A <b>rapid</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.|$|E

5|$|In 1820 Accum {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, {{and used as}} preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a <b>rapid</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.|$|E
