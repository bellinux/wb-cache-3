2500|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{successfully}} foraging Western honey bees perform a dance on their return to the hive, known as waggle dance, indicating that food is farther away, while the <b>round</b> <b>dance</b> is a short version of the waggle dance, indicating that food is nearby. The laden forager dances on the comb in a circular pattern, occasionally crossing the circle in a zig-zag or waggle pattern. Aristotle described this behaviour in his Historia Animalium. This waggle pattern of movement was thought {{to attract the attention of}} other bees.|$|E

2500|$|Very little survives of an {{indigenous}} musical or dance tradition. Written testimony from the 20th century (Frank Le Maistre; George F. Le Feuvre) {{points to the}} practice of [...] archaic dance-forms such as the [...] "ronde" [...] or <b>round</b> <b>dance,</b> 18th-century dances such as the cotillon and [...] 19th-century forms such as the polka, the schottische and the quadrille. Dances such as the [...] "Gigoton" [...] and [...] "La Bébée" [...] are both forms of polka. The violin, the chifournie (hurdy-gurdy), and later the accordion [...] were traditional instruments for sonneurs (country dances). The decline of these dances has often been ascribed to the influence of Nonconformist Christianity that discouraged such cultural frivolities, or at least placed such a low value on these activities that they were not thought worth recording. It is more likely that, as in many other parts of Europe, they were a victim of changing fashion and a cultural shift away from traditional regional society and toward English-speaking modernity.|$|E

They go round the room very slowly, immediately behind one another; {{it is a kind of}} straight polka, with a peculiar, rhythmic swaying of the body; the feet are not lifted off the floor, and you do not turn at all. The highest gravity is preserved throughout, and the whole performance is--well, very oriental.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, in each village, pyres of dry wood, {{amounting to}} thirty, fifty, {{or even a}} hundred cartloads, have been piled up. The wood is set on fire before the {{procession}} goes forth to the hallowing of the fountains. On returning, the crowd dances a horo (<b>round</b> <b>dance)</b> about the glowing logs. Heaps of embers (Pineus acervus) are made, and water is thrown on the ground. The musicians play the tune called 'L'Air Nistinar.' A Nistinare breaks through the dance, turns blue, trembles like a leaf, and glares wildly with his eyes. The dance ends, and everybody goes to the best point of view. Then the wildest Nistinare seizes the icon, turns it to the crowd, and with naked feet climbs the pyre of glowing embers. The music plays, and the Nistinare dances to the tune in the fire. If he is so disposed he utters prophecies. He dances till his face resumes its ordinary expression; then he begins to feel the burning; he leaves the pyre, and places his feet in the mud made by the libations of water already described. The second Nistinare then dances in the fire, and so on. The predictions apply to villages and persons; sometimes sinners are denounced, or repairs of the church are demanded in this queer parish council. All through the month of May the Nistinares call out for fire when they hear the Nistinare music playing. They are very temperate men and women. Except in May they do not clamour for fire, and cannot dance in it.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{the last}} week of the Carnival, and the streets of Florence were at their fullest and noisiest: there were the masqued processions, {{chanting}} songs, indispensable now they had once been introduced by Lorenzo the Magnificent; there was the favourite rigoletto, or <b>round</b> <b>dance,</b> footed [...] "in piazza" [...] under the blue frosty sky; there were practical jokes of all sorts, from throwing comfits to throwing stones-- especially stones. For the boys and striplings, always a strong element in Florentine crowds, became at the height of Carnival-time as loud and unmanageable as tree-crickets, and it was their immemorial privilege to bar the way with poles to all passengers, until a tribute had been paid towards furnishing those lovers of strong sensations with suppers and bonfires: to conclude with the standing entertainment of stone-throwing, which was not entirely monotonous, since the consequent maiming was various, and it was not always a single person who was killed. So that the pleasures of the Carnival were of a checkered kind, and if a painter were called upon to represent them truly, he would have to make a picture in which there would be so much grossness and barbarity that it must be turned with its face to the wall, except when it was taken down for the grave historical purpose of justifying a reforming zeal which, in ignorance of the facts, might be unfairly condemned for its narrowness. Still there was much of that more innocent picturesque merriment which is never wanting among a people with quick animal spirits and sensitive organs: there was not the heavy sottishness which belongs to the thicker northern blood, nor the stealthy fierceness which in the more southern regions of the peninsula makes the brawl lead to the dagger-thrust.|$|E

5000|$|Waggle {{dance is}} a term used in {{beekeeping}} and ethology for a particular figure-eight dance of the honey bee. By performing this dance, successful foragers can share, {{with other members of}} the colony, information about the direction and distance to patches of flowers yielding nectar and pollen, to water sources, or to new nest-site locations. [...] The waggle dance and the <b>round</b> <b>dance</b> are two forms of dance behaviour that are part of a continuous transition. The <b>round</b> <b>dance</b> occurs for resources that are nearby (typically less than 10-20 m from the nest for Apis mellifera ligustica). As the distance to the resource increases, the <b>round</b> <b>dance</b> transforms into the waggle dance. However, even close to the nest, the <b>round</b> <b>dance</b> can contain elements of the waggle dance, such as a waggle portion. It has therefore been suggested that the term [...] "waggle dance" [...] is better for describing both the waggle dance and the <b>round</b> <b>dance.</b> Austrian ethologist and Nobel laureate Karl von Frisch was one of the first who translated the meaning of the waggle dance.|$|E
