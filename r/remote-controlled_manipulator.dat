40|$|Acoustic imaging {{techniques}} {{are used in}} the field of nondestructive testing of technical components to measure defects such as lack of side wall fusion or cracks in welded joints. Data acquisition is performed by a <b>remote-controlled</b> <b>manipulator</b> and a PC for the mass storage of the high-frequency time-of-flight data at each probe position. The quality of the acoustic images and the interpretation relies on the proper understanding of the transmitted wave fronts and the arragement of the probes in pulse-echo mode or in pitch-and-catch arrangement. The use of the Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique allows the depth-dependent resolution {{to be replaced by a}} depth-independent resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio to be improved. Examples with surface-connected cracks are shown to demonstrate the improved features. The localization accuracy could be improved by entering 2 -dimensional or 3 -dimensional reconstructed data into the environment of a 3 -dimensional CAD drawing. The propagation of ultrasonic waves through austenitic welds is disturbed by the anisotropic and inhomogeneous structure of the material. The effect is more or less severe depending upon the longitudinal or shear wave modes. To optimize the performance of an inspection software tool, a 3 -dimensional CAD-Ray program has been implemented, where the shape of the inhomogeneous part of a weld can be simulated together with the grain structure based on the elastic constants. Ray-tracing results are depicted for embedded and for surface-connected defects...|$|E
40|$|At present {{only small}} sewers shap can {{automatically}} be renewed. Large brick sewers {{which are often}} found in nearly every large city {{still have to be}} repaired manually. Therefore, the company HOCHTIEF and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft have developed a <b>remote-controlled</b> <b>manipulator</b> system. This machine is a hydraulic powered robot with 5 degrees of freedom that automatically cuts out the mortar and refills the grooves. Two CCD-cameras are integrated in the wrist axes, directed at the tool, while a third camera is mounted on the vehicle and gives the operator an overview of the working area. The operator defines, via the TV-image, the edges of the brick sewers that have to be renewed. This operation is mostly computer-aided. The task of the operator is reduced to the monitoring the robot's movement and the correcting the computed robot path with a joystick. Initially the joints are cut by a finger milling cutter, then mortar is pressed into the groove and smoothed. The robot can be dismantl ed and therefore can be transported through manholes with a diameter of 625 mm. The current version was designed for oval sewers with a height of 1400 mm and a width of 850 mm. The robot is mounted on a walking gear to move through the sewer. In a container outside the sewer, control instruments and monitors inform the operator {{about the state of the}} machine and the state of the work process...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of a 2 nd generation MR-compatible, <b>remote-controlled</b> <b>manipulator</b> (RCM) {{as an aid to}} perform MR-guided transrectal prostate biopsy in males with suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: This prospective phase I study was approved by the local ethical committee and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Twenty patients with >/= 1 cancer suspicious region (CSR) with a PI-RADS score of >/= 3 detected on the diagnostic multi-parametric MRI and no prior prostate treatment underwent MR-guided biopsy with the aid of the RCM. Complications were classified according to the modified Clavien system for reporting surgical complications. For evaluation of the workflow, procedure- and manipulation times were recorded. RESULTS: All CSR's (n= 20) were reachable with the MR-compatible RCM and the cancer detection rate was 70 %. The median procedure time was 36 : 44 minutes (range, 23 - 61 minutes) and the median manipulation time for needle guide movement was 5 : 48 minutes (range, 1 : 15 - 18 : 35 minutes). Two Clavien grade 1 complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible and safe to perform transrectal MR-guided prostate biopsy using a MR-compatible RCM as an aid. It is a fast and efficient way to biopsy suspicious prostate lesions with a minimum number of biopsies per patient. KEY POINTS: * It is feasible to perform transrectal prostate biopsy using a MR-compatible RCM. * Using a RCM for MR-guided biopsy is safe, fast, and efficient. * All cancer suspicious regions were reachable with the RCM...|$|E
50|$|Planning for {{handling}} returned lunar samples began {{early in the}} Apollo program. In 1964, a proposal was made for a small (10 m2) sample receiving laboratory equipped with <b>remote-controlled</b> <b>manipulators</b> operating in a sterile, high-vacuum chamber to prepare samples for distribution to scientists, and this proposal was subsequently expanded to include a clean room with analytical instruments for performing preliminary analyses on the samples.|$|R
40|$|A <b>remote-controlled</b> robotic <b>manipulator</b> {{provides}} a convenient way to perform in-flight simulations involving multiple activities or stages. In this study, an advanced 4 -axis robotic manipulator {{was employed to}} conduct laterally loaded and torsionally loaded single pile tests in sand. In both types of tests, the model piles were tested consecutively without stopping the centrifuge, which accordingly maximized consistency of the soil sample among the tests. In the laterally loaded pile test, four model piles, instrumented externally along the shafts, were jacked into a sand bed and laterally loaded at different loading rates. In the torsionally loaded pile tests, an instrumented model pile was installed at six different locations and loaded at different torsional loading rates at each location. The whole process of pile jacking, torsional loading and pile pulling at the six locations was conducted consecutively without stopping the centrifuge. Tests in both loose and dense sands were carried out. Detailed information about the test devices and test procedures for the two types of tests is described in this paper. Horizontal force-displacement curves and torque-torsional angle curves are presented...|$|R
