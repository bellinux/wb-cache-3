5|$|Citizen's Briefing Book {{is a work}} of {{suggestions}} by individuals compiled into a book format and submitted to President Barack Obama after his inauguration on January 20, 2009. Internet users originally posted their suggestions at Change.gov, with the plan that after Barack Obama was sworn in as President the website hosting the recommendations would direct users to Whitehouse.gov. The option to participate in the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>comment</b> format was open until January 20, 2009, where users were able to post suggestions to the President, read others' recommendations, and comment on each other's ideas. Users voted on individual recommendations with an up or down vote for each suggestion.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1940, George Stibitz {{transmitted}} {{problems for}} his Complex Number Calculator in New York using a teletype, {{and received the}} computed results back at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This configuration of a centralized computer (mainframe) with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the 1970s. However, already in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate packet switching, a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting {{the beginnings of the}} ARPANET, which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes. ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the Internet. While Internet development was a focus of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who published a series of <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Comment</b> documents, other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories, such as the local area network (LAN) developments of Ethernet (1983) and the token ring protocol (1984).|$|E

5|$|On March 31, 2014, the FCC voted 3–2 {{to approve}} the {{proposed}} ban on joint sales agreements and voted 5–0 {{to approve the}} proposed ban on coordinated retransmission consent negotiations {{between two of the}} four highest-rated stations within a given market; the JSA ban went into effect on June 19, 2014. Under the restrictions, the FCC would rule on waivers to maintain select existing JSAs within 90 days of the application's filing. The FCC also began a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>comment</b> on policies to address other agreements, such as shared services agreements. The prohibition on television JSAs had been proposed as early as 2004, a year after the FCC voted to treat JSAs between radio stations as duopolies. Despite this fact, broadcasting companies criticized the ban, accusing the Commission of using it as a move to encourage participation in a spectrum incentive auction then set to occur in 2015, and stating that the ban would place them at a disadvantage during retransmission consent negotiations with pay television providers.|$|E
5|$|On November 30, Louisiana Tech {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} Independence Bowl but asked for more time as they were in {{negotiations}} with the Liberty Bowl and Heart of Dallas Bowl. Louisiana Tech athletic director Bruce Van De Velde and WAC commissioner Jeff Hurd both claimed that on December 1, the Liberty Bowl executive director Steve Ehrhart guaranteed the Bulldogs a bowl invite. After the Independence Bowl's deadline for Louisiana Tech to accept their invitation passed, the Independence Bowl selected the MAC's Ohio (8–4) instead. On December 2, the Liberty Bowl extended their remaining bid to Iowa State (6–6) instead of Louisiana Tech (9–3). The Liberty Bowl did not respond to The Times' <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>comment</b> on the situation. Louisiana Tech did not end up playing in any bowl game despite boasting the nation's top scoring offense.|$|E

The team of Enquirer reporters encountered Edwards on the hotel premises sometime after 2 a.m. on the morning of July 22. According to Perel, Edwards, who was not a registered guest of the hotel, retreated from the reporters to a washroom, where he remained until being escorted from the premises by hotel security.

500|$|Prior to any {{announcement}} regarding Knights of the Nine, Bethesda had {{pursued a}} somewhat novel plan to distribute downloadable content through micropayments, priced from US$0.99 to US$2.99, {{instead of the}} more common practice of releasing expansion packs. The program was initially met with criticism by customers due to its alleged low value, but later releases—at a reduced price, and with more content—proved more popular. The releases, in addition to stirring controversy, raised questions regarding Bethesda's future content release plans, and as to whether expansion pack releases were necessary at all. In August 2006, one Bethesda employee wrote in a post to Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls forums {{that the company had}} [...] "no plans to make an expansion for Oblivion". Further questions were raised by a product listing found on game retailer GameStop's website September 11, 2006, listing a Knights of the White Stallion Expansion Pack for Oblivion. The game had a listed shipping date of November 21, 2006. The title was kept on the website only brieflyremoved after gaming news site GameSpot sent Bethesda a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>comment</b> on the product.|$|E
