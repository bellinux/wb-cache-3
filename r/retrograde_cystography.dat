40|$|ObjectiveTo compare colour Doppler {{ultrasonography}} (CDU) and <b>retrograde</b> <b>cystography</b> in {{the assessment}} of the patency of internal ureteral stents. Patients and MethodsThirty-two patients with 33 internal ureteral stents were evaluated for patency of the internal ureteral stent using both CDU and <b>retrograde</b> <b>cystography.</b> Real-time ultrasonography and CDU were performed before <b>retrograde</b> <b>cystography.</b> Stent patency was defined as seeing flow from the distal end of the stent in the urinary bladder or iodinated contrast in the renal pelvis. The two investigators had no prior knowledge of the other's results. After completion of both investigations, stent patency was proved by direct inspection of the stent after removal. ResultsBoth investigations showed the same result in 27 of the 33 stents. Stent patency was found if either investigation was positive. The accuracies of <b>retrograde</b> <b>cystography,</b> CDU and both were 73 %, 79 % and 85 %, respectively. ConclusionsCDU is a noninvasive method with high accuracy. Detection of flow at the distal end of the stent is helpful, but absence of flow may or may not indicate an obstructed stent and further investigation should be performed...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Plain x-rays and {{contrast}} urography {{are important for}} diagnosing urinary tract diseases. The first plain film of the urinary tract was made in 1896, and the first tests using contrasts started in 1904. Excretory urography has been used since 1930. Plain film of the urinary tract Plain films of the urinary tract {{are used in the}} kidney area, the area of the ureter and urinary bladder. They also show structures (lumbar and sacral spine and pelvis), muscles (m. iliopsoas) as well as calculi. Excretory urography X-ray visualization of the urinary tract with contrast substances is intravenous urography. It is used for diagnosing diseases of the upper urinary system with symptoms such as: pain, colic, hydronephrosis, as well as acute cortical infections, urinary bladder tumors, etc. Retrograde urography Retrograde urography is a procedure recommended when either the pyelocalyx system or the ureter are not seen unilaterally or bilaterally. Cystography and urethrocystography Cystography is used to visualize the bladder. It is recommended in case of intravesical obstruction. Urethrocystography is a technique for investigation of the anterior and prostatic urethra as well as the neck of the urinary bladder. Conclusion Plain film of the urinary tract, excretory urography, <b>retrograde</b> pyelography, <b>cystography</b> and urethrocystography, used along with ultrasonography, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance, are useful diagnostic procedures which provide accurate diagnosis and effective treatment...|$|R
40|$|Urinary tract {{infection}} {{is very common}} in children. Its diagnosis, management and treatment have led to abundant literature and many controversies. The main challenges are to identify patients at risk of infection and those at risk of complicated infections. Long-term complications include reflux nephropathy, renal hypertension and stage renal disease. Imaging has a triple role :to confirm the diagnosis in patients with equivocal clinical symptoms;to determine patients at risk of recurrence;prevention of infection by detecting already in utero patients with congenital malformation. During the acute phase, Ultrasound has {{an important role in}} detecting favouring conditions such as urinary tract dilatation. The use of color Doppler increases the sensibility and specificity of ultrasound. To date, DMSA scan is the key examination for demonstrating the parenchymal lesions. CT-scan and MRI are rarely used in this acute phase. <b>Retrograde</b> voiding <b>cystography</b> (RVC) will be used whenever vesico-ureteric reflux is suspected. A decision algorithm can be proposed bases on US and DMSA;RVC will be performed whenever one of them is positive. CT or MRI will be used to look for abscesses complicating the UTI. DMSA scan is the gold standard for detecting renal scanning, sequellae of the infection.

Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of clinical records of 230 patients submitted to dismembered pyeloplasty in an 8 -year period, from 1999 until 2007. Pre-operative data, early and long-term complications were registered. Image studies included renopelvic ultrasonography, mercapto-acetyl triglycine (MAG 3) renal scan with furosemide test and, in some cases, elimination urography and <b>retrograde</b> <b>cystography.</b> Pre-operative and post-operative results were compared. Results: Median age of our patients at time of surgery was 14. 9 months (range: 21 days until 16. 6 years). The majority of patients were male (72 %, n = 166) and 74 % (n = 120) had pre-natal diagnosis. The majority of hydronephrosis were in the left side (61 %, n = 141).

40|$|Context: Impalement {{injuries}} of the rectum with bladder perforation {{have been}} rarely reported. Such lesions {{have been associated}} with increased postoperative morbidity. A well-conducted preoperative evaluation of the lesions tends to prevent such complications. Aims: To increase awareness about patients with rectal impalement that involve bladder injuries and to examine the significance of thorough clinical examination and complementary investigation for these patients′ management. Materials and Methods: Retrospectively, we identified three patients with rectal impalement and bladder perforation treated in University Hospital Hassan II, Fez, Morocco. We recorded the symptoms, subsequent management, and further follow-up for each patient. All available variables of published cases were reviewed and analyzed. Results: Evident urologic symptoms were present in only one patient. Bladder perforation was suspected in two other patients on the basis of anterior rectal perforation in digital exam. Retrograde uroscanner could definitely confirm the diagnosis of bladder perforation. Fecal and urine diversion was the basis of the treatment. No postoperative complications were noted. We have reviewed 14 previous reports. They are presented mainly with urine drainage through the rectum. Radiologic investigation (<b>retrograde</b> <b>cystography</b> and retrograde uroscanner) confirmed bladder perforation in 10 patients (71. 4 %).

MethodsA total of 350 patients who underwent RALP by a single surgeon were reviewed. We followed Dr Patel's RALP procedure with minor modifications. VUA was checked with 120  mL and 200  mL saline in sequence. The urinary bladder was then pressed with endoscopic instruments. If a VUA leak was detected, it was sutured immediately. An 18 -French silicon Foley's catheter was inserted and removed 7 – 14 days after RALP. Preoperative characteristics and perioperative complications were assessed. ResultsOverall, 332 (94. 85 %) patients were without any leakage in {{the first step of}} the challenge, eight of whom had leakage in the second step. After repair, all were free from leakage. The other 18 patients had leakage in the first step of the challenge (5. 14 %). After repair, 12 patients were without leakage in the second step. However, one patient had urine leakage postoperatively. The other six patients had leakage in the second step. After repair, two patients were free from leakage, but the remaining four suffered from persistent minor urine leakage postoperatively. The urine leakage rate after RALP was 1. 43 % (5 / 350).

40|$|Although radiographical {{techniques}} {{to examine the}} urinary system are well established in dogs and humans, these techniques have not been widely accepted or applied to examine the feline urinary system. Considerable confusion and controversy exist regarding anatomical features and radiographical interpretation of the feline urinary system. Much of the currently available information on the feline urinary system has been assumed from comparative studies in other species, particularly the dog. This study comprises a comprehensive literature review of the anatomy and radiography in the feline urinary tract and includes results of a limited radiographical study of the urinary tract in 27 clinically normal cats. The cats studied were prepared for radiography and restrained with various anaesthetic agents and techniques. Radio-graphical examinations of the urinary system involved standard radiography, {{and the use of}} an image intensifier connected with a television monitor and 70 mm spot films. The kidney was studied using plain radiography, intravenous and intramuscular excretory urography, renal arteriography and renal venography. With these techniques the kidney location, size, outline, radiographical density and blood supply were observed. Changes in kidney position in various postures relative to the lumbar vertebrae were also studied. The ureteral course, size and blood supply were studied following excretory urography and in some cats the presence of vesico-ureteral reflux enabled retrograde ureterography. The location, shape, size and radiographical density of the urinary bladder were studied by plain radiographyt excretory radiography, and <b>retrograde</b> <b>cystography</b> including positive, negative and double contrast techniques. The urethral course, shape, size and sex differences were studied by retrograde and micturating urethrography. Following the radiographical studies, all cats were euthanized and their urinary system were macroscopically examined at postmortem. Selective findings of this study are as follows. The internal structures of the kidney, namely the cortex, medulla, renal columns, pelvic diverticuli, pelvis and renal vessels were visualized. using contrast radiography. The internal venous drainage of the kidney was demonstrated by selective renal venography. As previously described in the literature, the kidney location varied in individual cats posture respiratory phase and the geometrical relationship between the x-ray tube and the animal. However the angle of the longitudinal axis, the length and width of the kidney and the ratio between the length of the kidney and lumbar vertebrae were relatively consistent. The proximal ureters had a characteristic step-wise course. Vesicoureteral reflux was observed in 36 % of cats studied during micturating cysto-urethrography but no evidence of this reflux was found in cats sedated with xylazine. Although the urinary bladder expanded proportionally during filling, it assumed an hour-glass-shape during micturition. The male urethra narrowed at the levels of the prostate and bulbourethral glands. The female urethra formed a bulbous enlargement immediately proximal to its narrow external orifice.
