30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6 a, <b>regenerative</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is one of}} the most {{effective}} solutions but the residual power is not utilized in this solution. Tie feeding shown in Fig.  6 b is a low-cost solution, and it was reported that it contributed to realize about 2 % of energy saving by some railway companies. If there are enough electric loads on the 6  kV distribution lines to feed residual regenerative power to stations and signaling systems along the railroad trackside, regenerative inverter shown in Fig.  6 c will be able to become one of the most effective solutions for regenerative power utilization. In a DC traction power supply system for subway, it is the most feasible countermeasure against regenerative brake cancelation because the load of railway station for subway is large enough for simultaneous utilization of residual regenerative power. PWM converter shown in Fig.  6 d is almost the same as regenerative inverter, but the regenerative power is reversed from DC power system for railway to the utility grid directly.|$|E

40|$|Technological {{developments}} {{based on}} the use of autologous white adipose tissue (WAT) attracted attention to minor fat depots as possible sources of adipose tissue. In plastic surgery, the trochanteric fatty pad {{is one of the most}} used WAT depots for its location and organoleptic characteristics that make it particularly suitable for reconstructive procedures. Despite its wide use in clinic, the structure of this depot has never been studied in detail and it is not known if structural differences exist among trochanteric fat and other subcutaneous WAT depots. The present study was performed on trochanteric fat pad with the aim to clarify the morphology of its adipocytes, stroma and microcirculation, with particular reference to the stem niches. Histological and ultrastructural studies showed that the main peculiar feature of the trochanteric fat concerns its stromal component, which appears less dense than in the other subcutaneous WATs studied. The intraparenchymal collagen stroma is poor and the extracellular compartment shows large spaces, filled with electron-light material, in which isolated collagen bundles are present. The adipocytes are wrapped in weak and easily detachable collagen baskets. These connective sheaths are very thin compared to the sheaths in other subcutaneous WAT depots. The capillaries are covered by large, long and thin elements surrounded by an external lamina; these perivascular cells are poor in organelles and mainly contain poly-ribosomes. In conclusion, when compared to other WAT deposits, the trochanteric fatty pad shows structural peculiarities in its stroma and microcirculation suggesting a high <b>regenerative</b> potential. <b>Resistance,</b> dissociability, microvascular weft and high regenerative potential make the trochanteric fatty pad a privileged source for harvesting in autologous WAT-based regenerative procedures...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} discusses {{a method}} of accounting for realistic levels of driver aggression to higher-level vehicle studies, including the impact of variation in real-world driving characteristics (acceleration and speed) on vehicle energy consumption and different powertrains (e. g., conventionally powered vehicles versus electrified drive vehicles [xEVs]). Aggression variation between drivers can increase fuel consumption by more than 50 % or decrease it by more than 20 % from average. The normalized fuel consumption deviation from average {{as a function of}} population percentile was found to be largely insensitive to powertrain. However, the traits of ideal driving behavior are a function of powertrain. In conventional vehicles, kinetic losses dominate rolling resistance and aerodynamic losses. In xEVs with <b>regenerative</b> braking, rolling <b>resistance</b> and aerodynamic losses dominate. The relation of fuel consumption predicted from real-world drive data to that predicted by the industry-standard HWFET, UDDS, LA 92, and US 06 drive cycles was not consistent across powertrains, and varied broadly from the mean, median, and mode of real-world driving. A drive cycle synthesized by NREL's DRIVE tool accurately and consistently reproduces average real-world for multiple powertrains within 1 %, and can be used to calculate the fuel consumption effects of varying levels of driver aggression...|$|R
40|$|Ranunculus acris subsp. acris L. is a vigorous, {{perennial}} weed, and {{a serious}} problem in dairying regions of New Zealand. Evolved resistance to the phenoxy herbicides (MCPA, MCPB and 2, 4 -D) prompted the search for an alternative method of control, based on the mycoherbicide strategy. Nineteen isolates of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and three isolates of Sclerotinia minor were inoculated onto excised tissues and intact plants of R. acris to evaluate their pathogenicity. All isolates proved pathogenic, with S. sclerotiorum more pathogenic than S. minor, on both excised tissues and intact plants. Seven of the S. sclerotiorum isolates were more pathogenic than the others on excised tissues, but no differences in pathogenicity were found between any of the isolates when inoculated onto intact plants. Many plants were able to recover from buds on the crown, the underground perennating organ of R. acris. The results from the two screening tests did not correlate because the capacity of an isolate to invade the living crown could not be determined using the excised tissue method. This indicated that the excised tissue method {{could not be used}} to predict whole plant mortality, nor therefore the mycoherbicide potential of isolates of S. sclerotiorum for this weed. Aspects of the infection process in intact plants, and in the crown of R. acris, were investigated. The apical and axillary buds on the crown were identified as the specific targets for S. sclerotiorum inoculation since recovery occurred from these sites. The relative importance of crown resistance, and rapid rate of regrowth of R. acris, were ascertained by inoculating plants with and without pre-treatment with chlorsulfuron to suppress <b>regenerative</b> growth. Crown <b>resistance</b> prevented plant mortality, and all plants retained potentially viable axillary buds on remaining crown fragments. Crown resistance was identified as the key factor facilitating plant recovery. An anatomical study of the crown of R. acris was combined with histopathological studies of S. sclerotiorum infection in the crown. Crown tissues varied in their susceptibility to S. Sclerotiorum. Resistance was largely related to morphological features of the crown, these being a thickened, possibly suberised peripheral cortex, apparent deposition of lignin and suberin at the margin of infected tissue, and the resistance of the crown's dense network of vascular tissues. In addition, flowering stems were not rapidly invaded by the pathogen. Together, these non-specific defence mechanisms limited infection within the crown of vegetative and flowering plants, and enabled recovery of the plant from the regenerative buds. Factors influencing the regenerative potential of R. acris were investigated. The biomass and available carbohydrate status of the crown, and the regenerative potential of R. acris were studied at six phenological stages from pre- to post-flowering. There was no obvious period of reserve depletion in the crown during flowering to provide an opportunity for control with S. sclerotiorum. The crown biomass and available carbohydrate status were lowest at preflowering, and increased during the flowering period. Crown available carbohydrate reserves constituted 60 % of crown dry weight at post-flowering. The regenerative potential of R. acris after S. sclerotiorum inoculation was generally lowest at pre-flowering, and greatest at late flowering. The capacity of this weed for vegetative multiplication following S. sclerotiorum inoculation, particularly at late-flowering, was an important factor influencing regenerative potential, and hence plant survival. The effect of repeated defoliation on regenerative potential, crown biomass, crown available carbohydrate, and susceptibility to S. sclerotiorum, was evaluated. Six month old plants of R. acris maintained regrowth during repeated defoliation without depletion of crown biomass nor crown available carbohydrate. This indicated that these plants utilised resources other than carbohydrate reserves to support regrowth. In contrast, the regenerative potential of two year old plants of R. acris declined during repeated defoliation, and the crown biomass, and available carbohydrate reserves were depleted. This provided strong evidence for utilisation of carbohydrate reserves to support regrowth in these plants. Six month old plants which had been repeatedly defoliated were more susceptible to S. sclerotiorum. In all plants, repeated defoliation reduced the recovery response following S. sclerotiorum inoculation. The results of this study have demonstrated how the perennial nature of R. acris limits the efficacy of S. sclerotiorum as a mycoherbicide. An effective control strategy for R. acris may require an integrated approach which combines defoliation followed by inoculation with S. sclerotiorum during the pre-flowering phase, when regenerative potential may be lowest...|$|R
