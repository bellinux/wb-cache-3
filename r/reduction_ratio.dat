The rotor blades (which turn in opposite directions) are built with a wooden spar and fiberglass trailing edge sections.

The pilot controls blade pitch with tubes running inside the mast and rotor blades to move servo flaps that pitch the blades, reducing required force and avoiding the added weight, cost and maintenance of hydraulic controls.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{stressed}} the importance of dialysis time in the removal of uremic retention solutes. To further investigate this, nine stable chronic hemodialysis patients were dialyzed for 4, 6, or 8 [*]h processing the same total blood and dialysate volume by the Genius system and high-flux FX 80 dialyzers. Inlet blood and outlet dialysate were analyzed for urea, creatinine, phosphorus, and β 2 -microglobulin at various times. Total solute removal, dialyzer extraction ratios, and total cleared volumes were significantly larger during prolonged dialysis for urea, creatinine, phosphorus, and β 2 -microglobulin. <b>Reduction</b> <b>ratios</b> increased progressively, except for phosphate and β 2 -microglobulin, where the ratios remained constant after 2 [*]h. In contrast, no significant difference was found for the <b>reduction</b> <b>ratios</b> of all solutes and Kt/Vurea between the three different sessions.
