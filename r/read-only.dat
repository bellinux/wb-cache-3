5|$|<b>Read-Only</b> Memory is a British {{publisher}} of art books on topics of video game history and culture. Following {{a resurgence of}} interest in 1980s and '90s British video game development, the company crowdfunded and produced four art books: an oral history of that Britsoft era, two books on British developers Sensible Software and The Bitmap Brothers, and a definitive volume on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, for which the publisher became best known. <b>Read-Only</b> Memory's books are archival anthologies, including original design documents juxtaposed with developer interviews and high-quality prints of in-game graphics. Reviewers were particularly impressed with each book's breadth of unreleased concepts.|$|E
5|$|Using BootROM, a <b>read-only</b> memory (ROM) {{computer}} chip containing OpenFirmware, a graphical bootsplash is shown briefly on all compatible Macintosh computers as a grey Apple logo with a spinning cursor that appears during the startup sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{latest version}} of BitLocker, first {{included}} in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, adds the ability to encrypt removable drives. On Windows XP or Windows Vista, <b>read-only</b> access to these drives can be achieved through a program called BitLocker To Go Reader, if FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT filesystems are used. In addition, a new command-line tool called manage-bde replaced the old manage-bde.wsf.|$|E
5|$|As the company's only engineer, Bristow rapidly {{developed}} a prototype himself before turning the game over to new hire Lyle Rains {{to develop into}} a finished product, codenamed K2 Tank. Rains added the maze and central minefield to the game design and developed the final hardware, including the simple control scheme. Peter Takaichi designed a large custom cabinet to house it. Tank {{was one of the}} first games to use integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (<b>read-only</b> memory)—to store graphical data, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used; it is sometimes claimed in sources to be the very first, but was preceded at minimum by Atari's Gran Trak 10 (1974). Integrated circuit-based memory thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. Before the game could be completed, in September 1974 Atari announced plans to merge itself and Kee Games back together; Tank was released that November just prior to the merger in December 1974.|$|E
5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons {{and trying to}} pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a gear stick, and the car crashes and spins if it hits a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based <b>read-only</b> memory, rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, Atari began work on a driving game, an idea founder Nolan Bushnell had wanted to do since the company was {{initially}} founded in June 1972 before it was shelved in favor of Pong. The design work itself was handled by Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari and had previously handled the prototype design of Gotcha. Larry Emmons developed the circuits to control the car itself in the game, creating the feel of braking, acceleration, and movement. Emmons also used integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (<b>read-only</b> memory)— in his circuit design to store graphical data such as the tracks, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used. This {{is believed to be}} the first use of integrated circuit-based memory in an arcade game, and ROMs thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. The mechanical designs for the game, including the steering wheel, pedal, and gear shift controllers, were developed by Eigen Systems, located in the same building as Cyan and founded by ex-coworkers of the Cyan founders Emmons and Steven Mayer. At one point, the game's design included a small printer that would print high scores when achieved, but this was removed prior to the final design.|$|E
25|$|Pools can be {{imported}} in <b>read-only</b> mode.|$|E
25|$|Usually, such drives will be custom-stamped with a company's logo, {{as a form}} of advertising. The drive may be blank, or {{preloaded}} with graphics, documentation, web links, Flash animation {{or other}} multimedia, and free or demonstration software. Some preloaded drives are <b>read-only,</b> while others are configured with both <b>read-only</b> and user-writable segments. Such dual-partition drives are more expensive.|$|E
25|$|A <b>read-only</b> {{mirror of}} all {{repositories}} {{can be found}} on Github.|$|E
25|$|Memory pages can {{be marked}} as <b>read-only,</b> to prevent data corruption.|$|E
25|$|Manage {{access to}} project data. Access ranges from full-access for team members to {{anonymous}} <b>read-only</b> access for potential reviewers.|$|E
25|$|Cards sold with {{content that}} {{must not be}} altered are {{permanently}} marked <b>read-only</b> by having a notch and no sliding tab.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a notch, and the presence and position of a tab, {{have no effect on}} the SD card's operation. A host device that supports write protection should refuse to write to an SD card that is designated <b>read-only</b> in this way. Some host devices do not support write protection, which is an optional feature of the SD specification. Drivers and devices that do obey a <b>read-only</b> indication may give the user a way to override it.|$|E
25|$|Windows 9x {{does not}} {{natively}} support NTFS or HPFS, {{but there are}} third-party solutions which allow Windows 9x to have <b>read-only</b> access to NTFS volumes.|$|E
25|$|On {{the left}} side, {{there may be}} a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is <b>read-only.</b> If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or {{downward}} to declare it <b>read-only.</b> The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write-protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{host device}} can command the SD card to become <b>read-only</b> (to reject {{subsequent}} commands to write information to it). There are both reversible and irreversible host commands that achieve this.|$|E
25|$|EPROMs (Erasable Programmable <b>Read-Only</b> Memory) are erased by {{exposure}} to UV radiation. These modules have a transparent (quartz) window {{on the top of}} the chip that allows the UV radiation in.|$|E
25|$|In {{spacecraft}} {{and other}} high-radiation environments, the on-chip charge pump {{is the first}} part of the flash chip to fail, although flash memories will continue to work in <b>read-only</b> mode at much higher radiation levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{user can}} {{designate}} most full-size SD cards as <b>read-only</b> {{by use of}} a sliding tab that covers a notch in the card. The miniSD and microSD formats do not support a write protection notch.|$|E
25|$|At a December 2010 press conference, Google {{claimed that}} Chrome OS {{would be the}} most secure {{consumer}} operating system due in part to a verified boot ability, in which the initial boot code, stored in <b>read-only</b> memory, checks for system compromises.|$|E
25|$|Properties Editor: The Properties Editor tool {{is used to}} edit {{properties}} in a GUI pane inside Visual Studio. It lists all available properties (both <b>read-only</b> and those which can be set) for all objects including classes, forms, web pages and other items.|$|E
25|$|When the {{operating}} system is booted from a <b>read-only</b> medium such as a CD or DVD, any user data {{that needs to be}} retained between sessions cannot be stored on the boot device but must be written to another storage device, such as a USB flash drive or a hard disk drive.|$|E
25|$|Toshiba {{developed}} {{flash memory}} from EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable <b>read-only</b> memory) {{in the early}} 1980s and introduced it to the market in 1984. The two main types of flash memory are named after the NAND and NOR logic gates. The individual flash memory cells exhibit internal characteristics {{similar to those of}} the corresponding gates.|$|E
25|$|The {{computer}} had 2048 {{words of}} erasable magnetic core memory and 36 kilowords of <b>read-only</b> core rope memory. Both had cycle times of 11.72microseconds. The memory word length was 16 bits: 15 bits {{of data and}} one odd-parity bit. The CPU-internal 16-bit word format was 14 bits of data, one overflow bit, and one sign bit (ones' complement representation).|$|E
25|$|A stored-program {{computer}} {{requires an}} initial computer program stored in its <b>read-only</b> memory to boot. The boot {{process is to}} identify and initialize {{all aspects of the}} system, from processor registers to device controllers to memory contents. Following the initialization process, this initial computer program loads the operating system and sets the program counter to begin normal operations.|$|E
25|$|The initial MyKad was {{a contact}} card {{solution}} developed and manufactured by IRIS Corporation. Made of PC with the dimensions in the ISO/IEC 7816 ID-1 format (standard credit card format), the initial card had a 32kb EEPROM (Electronically Erasable Programmable <b>Read-Only</b> Memory) embedded chip running on M-COS (MyKad Chip Operating System). In November 2002, the capacity was increased to 64kb.|$|E
25|$|AGC {{software}} {{was written in}} AGC assembly language and stored on rope memory. The bulk of the {{software was}} on <b>read-only</b> rope memory and thus couldn't be changed in operation, but some key parts of the software were stored in standard read-write magnetic-core memory and could be overwritten by the astronauts using the DSKY interface, as was done on Apollo 14.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{bounding}} {{the time}} complexity of an algorithm that recognizes an MSO property on bounded-treewidth graphs, {{it is also}} possible to analyze the space complexity of such an algorithm; that is, the amount of memory needed above and beyond the size of the input itself (which is assumed to be represented in a <b>read-only</b> way so that its space requirements cannot be put to other purposes).|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, several {{manufacturers}} {{were prepared to}} introduce read/write digital audio formats to the United States. These new formats were a significant improvement over the newly introduced <b>read-only</b> digital format of the compact disc, allowing consumers to make perfect, multi-generation copies of digital audio recordings. Most prominent among these formats was Digital Audio Tape (DAT), followed in the early 1990s by Philips' Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) and Sony's Minidisc.|$|E
25|$|Super Audio CD (SACD) is a {{high-resolution}} <b>read-only</b> optical audio disc {{format that}} was designed to provide higher fidelity digital audio reproduction than the Red Book. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the Red Book. SACD was in a format war with DVD-Audio, but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the Scarlet Book standard.|$|E
25|$|The {{names and}} {{locations}} of {{documents in the}} system are exposed as a table with the column names System. ItemName and System. ItemURL respectively. A SQL query can directly reference these tables and index catalogues and use the MSIDXS provider to run queries against them. The search index {{can also be used}} via OLE DB, using the CollatorDSO provider. However, the OLE DB provider is <b>read-only,</b> supporting only SELECT and GROUP ON SQL statements.|$|E
25|$|On August 4, 2010, Google {{announced}} {{the suspension of}} stand-alone Wave development and the intent of maintaining the web site {{at least for the}} remainder of the year, and on November 22, 2011, announced that existing Waves would become <b>read-only</b> in January 2012 and all Waves would be deleted in April 2012. Development was handed over to the Apache Software Foundation which started to develop a server-based product called Wave in a Box.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the aforementioned three components, the black box audit log file {{is also an important}} part of continuous auditing. This file can be viewed {{as an extension of the}} existing practice of documenting audit activities in manual or automated work papers. A black box log file is a <b>read-only,</b> third-party controlled record of the actions of auditors. The objective of black box logging is to protect a continuous auditing system against auditor and management manipulations.|$|E
25|$|Live File System: A writable UDF {{file system}}. The Windows UDF file system (UDFS) {{implementation}} was <b>read-only</b> in OS releases prior to Windows Vista. In Windows Vista, Packet writing (incremental writing) {{is supported by}} UDFS, which can now format and write to all mainstream optical media formats (MO, CDR/RW, DVD+R/RW, DVD-R/RW/RAM). Write support is included for UDF format versions {{up to and including}} 2.50, with read support up to 2.60. UDF symbolic links, however, are not supported.|$|E
25|$|The default catalog {{is called}} SystemIndex and it stores all the {{properties}} of indexed items with a predefined naming pattern. For example, the name and location of documents in the system is exposed as a table with the column names System. ItemName and System. ItemURL respectively. An SQL query can directly refer these tables and index catalogues and use the MSIDXS provider to run queries against them. The search index {{can also be used}} via OLE DB, using the CollatorDSO provider. However, OLE DB provider is <b>read-only,</b> supporting only SELECT and GROUP ON SQL statements.|$|E
25|$|The {{flash storage}} on Android devices is split into several partitions, such as /system for the {{operating}} system itself, and /data for user data and application installations. In contrast to desktop Linux distributions, Android device owners are not given root access to {{the operating system}} and sensitive partitions such as /system are <b>read-only.</b> However, root access {{can be obtained by}} exploiting security flaws in Android, which is used frequently by the open-source community to enhance the capabilities of their devices, but also by malicious parties to install viruses and malware.|$|E
