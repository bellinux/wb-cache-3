40|$|Abstract The {{incidence}} {{of mental health}} disorders is significantly higher in individuals with a <b>rare</b> <b>disease,</b> compared to the general population. This letter considers the possible reasons for {{this in terms of}} the many ways in which a <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> impacts on an individual’s life, and how these impacts can be strongly related to factors which predispose to mental health difficulties. Furthermore, issues surrounding mental health can also {{play a significant role in}} the process of diagnosing a <b>rare</b> <b>disease.</b> The unusual nature of such diseases intrinsically predisposes an individual to obtain an inaccurate diagnosis of a psychosomatic disorder, a diagnosis which can often be further complicated by the presence of genuine psychiatric symptoms. This letter argues that these common experiences of <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> patients have impacts upon the way in which their psychiatric care should be offered and managed, and that sensitivity and understanding surrounding these issues should be considered a necessary part of effective care for <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> patients...|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} the past and planned future workshops for the <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> (RD) domain {{within the context of}} the ELIXIR-EXCELERATE project with the aims (1) to identify key training contacts/subjects in the RD community, (2) to identify specific training needs in the RD community and (3) to spread specific knowledge needed in the RD community. An important mission of EXCELERATE WP 8 ‘ELIXIR infrastructure for <b>Rare</b> <b>Disease</b> research’, defined at the kick-off meeting on November 24, 2015 in Leiden, is to help the <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> community in different nodes to raise its infrastructure activities to the level of best practices in ELIXIR infrastructure, i. e. where <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> data, metadata, tools, and catalogues are shared, interoperable, and sustainable at the source, conform a common set of principles and standards across participating countries/nodes and in agreement with the ELIXIR platforms. To achieve optimal knowledge exchange between the domains, workshops in this WP are typically co-organised with members from the <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> community and co-sponsored by relevant projects such as RD-Connect. Events were either organised specifically with the <b>Rare</b> <b>Disease</b> (RD) community, or a separate stream/session for the RD community was co-organised around other events. Training workshops and courses were delivered in partnership with WP 11 ‘EXCELERATE Training Programme’. The delivery of workshops was complemented by the ELIXIR implementation study/RDConnect proof-of-concept to test interoperability backbone components for enabling queries across <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> biobanks and registries...|$|R

25|$|Economic demand {{influences}} {{the location of}} particular specialties. For example, more orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry {{are more likely to}} practice in high income areas. Small populations can usually only support primary care. A large population is needed to support specialists who treat <b>rare</b> <b>diseases.</b> Some specialties need to cooperate and thus locate near each other, such as hematology, oncology, and pathology, or cardiology, thoracic surgery and pulmonology.|$|E
25|$|Pediatric {{endocrinology}} {{became a}} recognizable specialty in the 1950s, {{but did not}} reach board status in the U.S. until the late 1970s.

25|$|There are {{a variety}} of <b>rare</b> <b>diseases</b> which {{resemble}} GH deficiency, including the childhood growth failure, facial appearance, delayed bone age, and low IGF levels. However, GH testing elicits normal or high levels of GH in the blood, demonstrating that the problem is not due to a deficiency of GH but rather to a reduced sensitivity to its action. Insensitivity to GH is traditionally termed Laron dwarfism, but over the last 15 years many different types of GH resistance have been identified, primarily involving mutations of the GH binding protein or receptors.|$|E
25|$|A {{major factor}} {{for such an}} {{absolute}} difference {{is the power of}} the test itself, such as can be described in terms of, for example, sensitivity and specificity or likelihood ratio. Another factor is the pre-test probability, with a lower pre-test probability resulting in a lower absolute difference, with the consequence that even very powerful tests achieve a low absolute difference for very unlikely conditions in an individual (such as <b>rare</b> <b>diseases</b> {{in the absence of any}} other indicating sign), but on the other hand, that even tests with low power can make a great difference for highly suspected conditions.|$|E
500|$|The {{syndrome}} {{was initially}} described in 1973 by James A. Keipert and associates.

Although no specific rate of incidence has been determined, the syndrome is considered a rare disease by both the Office of <b>Rare</b> <b>Diseases</b> (ORDR) at the National Institutes of Health, and Orphanet. This suggests, respectively, that Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome affects less than 200,000 people in the U.S., or affects no greater than 1 per 2,000 people in Europe.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} {{indicates that}} the expenditure on orphan drugs will be increasing over the coming years. The market for orphan drugs has inherent market characteristics that sometimes result in high prices. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse whether awarding orphan designation status has an influence on the price setting of drugs for <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> indications. To this effect, prices of designated orphan drugs were compared with other non-designated drugs for <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> indications. We identified 28 designated orphan drugs and 16 comparable non-designated drugs for <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> indications for which we collected official hospital prices (per defined daily dose) in Belgium in 2010. Orphan-designated drugs had a higher median price (138. 56 Euros [interquartile range; IQR 406. 57 Euros]) than non-designated drugs (16. 55 Euros [IQR 28. 05 Euros]) for <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> indications (p < 0. 01). In conclusion, our results suggest that awarding orphan designation status in itself is associated with higher prices for drugs for <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> indications. In order to gain full insight into orphan drug pricing mechanisms, future research should focus on collecting information about the different factors influencing orphan drug pricing. status: publishe...|$|R

Like other porphyrias, attacks of HCP can be induced by certain drugs, environmental stressors or diet changes. [...] Biochemical and molecular testing can be used to narrow down the diagnosis of a porphyria and identify the specific genetic defect. [...] Overall, porphyrias are <b>rare</b> <b>diseases.</b> [...] The combined incidence for all forms of the disease has been estimated at 1:20,000.
