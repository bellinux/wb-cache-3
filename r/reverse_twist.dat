40|$|Abstract. We study forcing of {{periodic}} {{points in}} orientation <b>reversing</b> <b>twist</b> maps. First, we observe that the fourth iterate of an orientation <b>reversing</b> <b>twist</b> map {{can be expressed}} as the composition of four orientation preserving positive twist maps. We then reformulate the problem in terms of parabolic flows, which form the natural dynamics on a certain space of braid diagrams. Second, we focus our attention on period- 4 points, which we classify {{in terms of their}} corresponding braid diagrams. They can be categorized in two types. If an orientation <b>reversing</b> <b>twist</b> map has a period- 4 point of one type, then there is a semi-conjugacy to symbolic dynamics and the system is forced to be chaotic. We also show that this result is sharp {{in the sense that the}} remaining type does not necessarily lead to chaos. 1...|$|R

50|$|While Tchaikovsky {{struggled}} {{with his first}} three symphonies, developments in Europe led to an alternative to this genre that, in a <b>reverse</b> <b>twist,</b> offered to change {{the scope of the}} symphony. Hungarian composer Franz Liszt desired a form of orchestral music that would offer greater flexibility in developing musical themes than the symphony then allowed but also preserve the overall unity of a musical composition. His objective was to expand single-movement works beyond the concert overture format. By doing so, he hoped to combine the dramatic, emotive and evocative qualities of concert overtures with the scale and musical complexity normally reserved for the opening movements of symphonies.|$|E

He uses an American twist as his regular delivery, but varies it with a sharp slice, a <b>reverse</b> <b>twist</b> of great spin, and a fast cannon-ball smash." [...] His volleying was [...] "brilliant...but very erratic" [...] and his overhead smashes were judged likewise. He had great fighting skills and played at his best when behind but was prone to anxiety lapses. Tilden concludes that [...] "Laurentz might beat {{anyone in the world}} on his day or lose to the veriest dub when at his worst.".|$|E

50|$|Shimizu {{was mainly}} a {{baseline}} player. His forehand grip {{was described as}} 'faulty' but nevertheless his passing shots, which he hit low and with topspin, were judged as excellent. Shimizu's backhand was orthodox and played with force from the baseline. His service was hit at shoulder height with precision and <b>reverse</b> <b>twist</b> but without great speed. His forehand volleys were comparatively weak but his backhand volleys and his smash were first-class. In his book The Art of Lawn Tennis Bill Tilden describes Shimuzu as a baseline player and marvelous court coverer with an uncanny accuracy in his shots. In comparing Shimuzu to his countryman Kumagae he states that Shimizu had a superior backhand and low volleying skills but lacked Kumagae's forehand drive and had a weaker service. Their high volleying skills and overheads were judged equal.|$|E

40|$|It was {{twenty-five years}} ago that Guido Calabresi and Douglas Melamed {{published}} their article on property rules, liability rules, and inalienability 2 ̆ 7 Calabresi, then a law professor, later a dean, is now a federal judge. Melamed, formerly a student of Calabresi 2 ̆ 7 s, is now a seasoned Washington attorney. Their article-which, thanks to its subtitle, we shall call The Cathedral-has had a remarkable influence on our own thinking, as we tried to show in a recent paper 2 This {{is not the place}} to rehash what we said then, but a summary might be in order. First, we demonstrated that the conventional wisdom about liability (damage) rules, that judges should use them when transaction costs are high, is incorrect, because the costs of assessing damages might in fact be higher still; if they are, property (injunction) rules are superior; at least from the standpoint of efficiency Second, and relatedly, we identified problems of correlation and synergy that come into play as one tries to choose between damages and injunctive relief. Correlation problems arise because the same considerations that yield high transaction costs usually yield high assessment costs as well; synergy problems arise because the use of damage rules can inhibit the development of more effective bargaining practices. Third, we showed that Calabresi and Melamed 2 ̆ 7 s celebrated Rule 4 (reverse damages) contains a paradox, which we went on to resolve by inventing reverse-reverse damages (the 2 ̆ 2 double <b>reverse</b> <b>twist</b> 2 ̆ 2). The trick of the double <b>reverse</b> <b>twist</b> relates to our fourth point, having to do with a 2 ̆ 2 best-chooser axiom 2 ̆ 2 which can be used to illuminate matters of institutional (not just judicial) design generally Finally, we suggested in conclusion the relationship of much of the foregoing to relevant literature in other disciplines...|$|E
40|$|In {{a process}} for {{manufacturing}} a singles ring yarn, firstly a first twist is supplied to a strand of traveling drafted fibers at a false twist device for producing a preliminary singles yarn. The false twist device rotates at a first speed for twisting the fibers. Immediately after the first twisting step, a joint twist of a second twist {{in the same direction}} as the first twist and a third <b>twist</b> in a <b>reversed</b> direction is supplied to the preliminary yarn for producing a final singles ring yarn. The second twist is produced by a rotatable take-up package onto which the final singles yarn is drawn. The <b>reversed</b> <b>twist</b> results in correspondence to the first twist, and the take-up package rotates at a second speed. The final singles yarn is then drawn onto the take-up package. Furthermore, a ratio of the first speed to the second speed is controlled for controlling the amount of a residual torque in the final singles ring yarn.

40|$|The 4 '-n-alkyl- 4 -cyanobiphenyls and 4 '-n-alkoxy- 4 -cyanobiphenyls provide {{colourless}} liquid crystal phases which are chemically and photochemically stable. In many cases, the mesophases are produced at quite low temperatures, and indeed {{two members of}} the n-alkyl series are nematic at room temperature. Eutectic mixtures prepared from members of the two series give wide nematic ranges, e. g., from about - 2 °C to above 60 °C. All the compounds are of high positive dielectric anisotropy and either individually or in admixture their nematic phases perform well in twisted nematic displays. The nematic ranges have been further extended, without adversely affecting the stability characteristics or the electrical properties by incorporating certain members of the series of 4 "-n-alkyl- 4 -cyano-p-terphenyls. For example, one eutectic mixture is nematic from 5 °C to 91 °C. Two optically active analogues of the cyanobiphenyls and cyano-p-terphenyls have been prepared by using a branched chain as the alkyl or alkoxy group. Incorporation of these compounds in mixtures with the 4 '-n-alkyl- and 4 '-n-alkoxy- 4 -cyanobiphenyls gives long pitch cholesteric phases which exist in the room temperature range, and which are colourless and both chemically and photochemically stable. These phases perform well in cholesteric-nematic phase change devices. These chiral solutes used in low concentration (1 %) also prevent areas of <b>reversed</b> <b>twist</b> in twisted nematic displays. 4 '-n-octyl- 4 -cyanobiphenyl gives a room temperature smectic phase. This phase and those shown by other higher homologues of the two series have been shown by miscibility to be smectic A. However, the smectic phases have unusual X-ray characteristics. The smectic polymorphism of the 4 "-n-alkanoyl- 4 -bromo-p-terphenyls has been studied; the heptanoyl compound provides only the third known example of a direct SB-N transition. The four series of 4 "-chloro-, 4 "-methyl-, 3 "-chloro- and 3 "-methyl-ω-phenylalkyl 4 -(4 '-cyanobenzylideneamino) cinnamates have been studied. It is concluded that the extremely large alternations in the N-I transition temperatures as the series are ascended are explained in terms of changes in the spatial distribution of the terminal ring of the ester function which are determined by the stereochemistry of the alkylene chain...|$|R
40|$|Citation: Clark, Roy H. Underground {{telephone}} cables. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: For {{many years}} after {{the introduction of the}} telephone the difficulties of working through underground wires seemed almost insurmountable. The electrostatic capacity of the underground wires of early days was so much greater than that of overhead circuits as to materially interfere with telephonic transmission. In late years however, the methods of insulation have been so much improved that the underground construction of telephone circuits is the general rule in large cities, and is rapidly being adopted even in small towns. The standard type of cable for telephone work contains two hundred pairs of insulated wires. One hundred pairs and fifty pairs and various smaller numbers are used for distribution. The insulation of cables is now mostly of dry paper. The requisite number of pairs of wires to form the desired cable is taken, and each wire insulated from its mate by a loose wrapping of well dried paper. It is usual to color in some manner the individual wires after they are wrapped, in order that the component of each pair may be known without testing. The wires to be wrapped are simply separated by a sheet of paper, and then lightly twisted together, the twist being sufficient to hold both conductors and insulation in their proper relative positions. A single twisted pair of wires is taken to form the core of the completed cable and around that the required number of pairs are assembled in regular layers, each successive layer being wound about the preceding one with a <b>reverse</b> <b>twist,</b> making a complete turn in from eighteen to thirty-six inches. The use of paper gives an insulator of low electrostatic capacity yet strong enough to maintain an insulation of many thousand meg ohms against the weak electro-motive force of telephone currents. By twisting the several pairs of wires very loosely about each other a considerable volume filled with air remains. Capacity is decreased by leaving as much space between conductors as possible...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} natural β-sheet {{proteins}} are usually soluble but that fragments or designs of β structure usually aggregate suggests that natural β proteins must somehow {{be designed to}} avoid this problem. Regular β-sheet edges are dangerous, because they {{are already in the}} right conformation to interact with any other β strand they encounter. We surveyed edge strands in a large sample of all-β proteins to tabulate features that could protect against further β-sheet interactions. β-barrels, of course, avoid edges altogether by continuous H-bonding around the barrel cylinder. Parallel β-helix proteins protect their β-sheet ends by covering them with loops of other structure. β-propeller and single-sheet proteins use a combination of β-bulges, prolines, strategically placed charges, very short edge strands, and loop coverage. β-sandwich proteins favor placing an inward-pointing charged side chain on one of the edge strands where it would be buried by dimerization; they also use bulges, prolines, and other mechanisms. One recent β-hairpin design has a constrained twist too great for accommodation into a larger β-sheet, whereas some β-sheet edges are protected by the bend and <b>reverse</b> <b>twist</b> produced by an Lβ glycine. All free edge strands were seen to be protected, usually by several redundant mechanisms. In contrast, edge strands that natively form β H-bonded dimers or rings have long, regular stretches without such protection. These results are relevant to understanding how proteins may assemble into β-sheet amyloid fibers, and they are especially applicable to the de novo design of β structure. Many edge-protection strategies used by natural proteins are beyond our current abilities to constrain by design, but one possibility stands out as especially useful: a single charged side chain near the middle of what would ordinarily be the hydrophobic side of the edge β strand. This minimal negative-design strategy changes only one residue, requires no backbone distortion, and is easy to design. The accompanying paper [Wang, W. & Hecht, M. H. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 2760 – 2765] makes use of the inward-pointing charge strategy with great success, turning highly aggregated β-sandwich designs into soluble monomers...|$|E
40|$|Ronald Coase 2 ̆ 7 s {{essay on}} 2 ̆ 2 The Problem of Social Cost 2 ̆ 2 {{introduced}} {{the world to}} transaction costs, and the introduction {{laid the foundation for}} an ongoing cottage industry in law and economics. And of all the law-and-economics scholarship built on Coase 2 ̆ 7 s insights, perhaps the most widely known and influential contribution has been Calabresi and Melamed 2 ̆ 7 s discussion of what they called 2 ̆ 2 property rules 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 liability rules. 2 ̆ 2 Those rules and the methodology behind them are our subjects here. We have a number of objectives, the most basic of which is to provide a much needed primer for those students, scholars, and lawyers who are interested but not particularly fluent in the economic analysis of law. Like Coase before them, Calabresi and Melamed figure regularly {{in the work of the}} legal academy, but—again like Coase before them—their ideas are not understood as well as they should be, notwithstanding an excellent explanation by Professor Polinsky published some fifteen years ago. Since Polinsky 2 ̆ 7 s contributions have been all too routinely ignored, we shall restate several of his central points emphatically. But we also take issue with parts of Polinsky 2 ̆ 7 s analysis, and we aim, in any event, to extend his account, and the literature on property rules and liability rules generally, into previously undiscovered territory. In Parts I and II we set out first the background and next the conventional understanding of the 2 ̆ 2 four rules 2 ̆ 2 that figure in the work of Calabresi and Melamed. Then, in Part III, the centerpiece of our discussion, we shift from description to critique and from the familiar to the novel. We question some of the typical thinking about transaction costs, and about 2 ̆ 2 objective 2 ̆ 2 versus 2 ̆ 2 subjective 2 ̆ 2 accounts of reality (as in objective versus subjective damages). We consider the irony in the standard analysis of 2 ̆ 2 extortion 2 ̆ 2 and the paradox of Calabresi and Melamed 2 ̆ 7 s so-called rule four of reverse damages. We present a way out of the paradox—namely reverse-reverse damages, or what we prefer to call 2 ̆ 2 the double <b>reverse</b> <b>twist</b> 2 ̆ 2 —and in the course of doing so introduce a 2 ̆ 2 best-chooser 2 ̆ 2 principle that adds a new element to the conventional methodology. We then use the best-chooser principle to show that much that seems strange in our account is in fact familiar, provided one thinks about legal institutions in a sufficiently systematic way. Throughout, we mean to be both constructive and critical, trying to enhance a useful method of legal analysis but at the same time questioning whether the method, rightly understood, entices its practitioners into a game not worth the candle. So there is a tension in our account. It is addressed in the Conclusion...|$|E

40|$|The most geoeffective solar {{drivers are}} {{magnetic}} clouds - a subclass of coronal mass ejections (CME's) distinguished by the smooth {{rotation of the}} magnetic field inside the structure.

In this study, we investigated the functional role of Twist, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcriptional factor, in myofibroblastic differentiation activity of OSF. Methods: Arecoline, a major areca nut alkaloid, was used to explore whether expression of Twist could be changed dose-dependently in human primary buccal mucosal fibroblasts (BMFs). Collagen gel contraction and migration capability in arecoline-stimulated BMFs and primary oral submucous fibrosis-derived fibroblasts (OSFs) with Twist knockdown was presented.

The myofibroblast activity including collagen gel contraction and migration capability also induced by arecoline, while knockdown of <b>Twist</b> <b>reversed</b> these phenomena. Importantly, inhibition of Twist led to the suppression collagen contraction and wound healing capability of primary cultivated OSFs.
