5000|$|The main {{setting of}} the novel is the Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths of some {{ambiguous}} and unnamed city. This municipal archive holds the <b>record</b> <b>cards</b> for all residents of the city stretching back endlessly into the past. The protagonist is named Senhor José; the only character to be given a proper name (all of the others are referred to simply by some unique and defining characteristic). Senhor José is around fifty years old and has worked as a low-level clerk in the Central Registry for more than twenty years. His residence, where he lives alone, adjoins the building and contains the only side entrance into it. Lost in the tedium of a bureaucratic job, he starts to collect information about various famous people and decides, one evening, to use the side entrance to sneak in and steal their <b>record</b> <b>cards.</b> On one nocturnal venture he grabs the record card of an [...] "unknown woman" [...] by mistake and quickly becomes obsessed with finding her. Senhor José uses his power as a registry clerk to gather information from her past neighbors and, when it is suggested to look her up in a phone book, he ignores the advice choosing instead to keep his distance. The search begins to consume him and affects his work enough to draw attention from the Registrar, head of the Central Registry, who, strangely, begins to regard Senhor José with sympathy. This special attention given to a clerk by the Registrar is unprecedented in the known history of the Central Registry and begins to worry his fellow employees. Senhor José further neglects his duties as a civil servant and risks his career to pursue a woman he knows basically nothing about.|$|E

All of that information is detailed by the Hopkins <b>Record</b> <b>cards.</b> The cards are the only link that exists between the sample and its physical provenance.At some archive locations, the early records included the above-mentioned notebooks or ledgers containing more detailed information.

The System has been applied differently at the various field locations; some units have only the numerical file.|$|E

The ports of the town were formed by projecting houses stretching across the street from both sides and a gate being placed in the centre. In the late 19th century, one of these projecting houses still stood {{at the site of the}} West Port, and was a thing, in his opinion, ‘anything but ornamental to the town’.

50|$|In 1986, Wilmshurst, a {{cardiologist}} then working at St. Thomas' Hospital, London, approached The Guardian newspaper with a substantial dossier detailing alleged misconduct {{in the development}} of Amrinone, a cardiac drug manufactured by Sterling-Winthrop. The drug was supported by a study at Harvard Medical School and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, whose lead author was Eugene Braunwald, a leader in his field. Wilmshurst's group ran a series of experiments on the promising new drug but found no effect on contractility and frequent life-threatening side effects. Wilmshurst reported these findings to Sterling-Winthrop, who asked him to suppress the data. He refused, and they retaliated by threatening litigation. He continued the research and published his adverse findings in abstracts and conference presentations, until Sterling-Winthrop staff removed all stocks of the drug from the hospital pharmacy. A review by the Netherlands Committee for the Evaluation of Medicine found substantial discrepancies between the <b>record</b> <b>cards</b> of Wilmshurst's group and those submitted by Sterling-Winthrop. Wilmshurst showed that they had falsified the records, suppressing the adverse events he had reported. He then contacted the UK's Committee for the Safety of Medicines and discovered that Sterling-Winthrop had also failed to report the adverse events to the UK; they had also threatened the UK Government with closure of a large manufacturing plant in the UK. Sterling-Winthrop subsequently reported over 1,400 adverse events to the US Federal Food and Drug Administration, and terminated research and marketing in the US, while continuing to market the drug in the developing world. Finally, after a substantial Guardian feature, they withdrew the oral drug entirely in 1986. In 2003 he was given the Health Watch Award for this work.|$|E

It is demonstrated the advantages of these devices application in the optical system and reasoned their spatial position relative to one to another. The researches on the experimental desk permit to determine the factors which impact on the accuracy of spatial coordinate determination by the given method. Proposed method permits to automate a testing process and form the <b>record</b> <b>card</b> in a portable computer memory were the image of performed operation in spatial coordinates of defectoscope transducer position will be displayed.
