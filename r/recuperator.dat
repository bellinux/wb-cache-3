5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} {{a combination of the}} barrel of the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic <b>recuperator.</b> The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E

25|$|The barrel, {{much longer}} than that of older designs, was fitted with an {{interrupted}} screw breechblock with recoil devices consisting of hydraulic recoil buffer and hydropneumatic <b>recuperator.</b> The recoil length was variable.

25|$|The {{barrel of}} the M-30 was of {{built-up}} construction and consisted of a liner, jacket and breech. The breechblock was of interrupted screw type, with forced cartridge case extraction. The gun was equipped with a hydraulic recoil buffer and hydropneumatic <b>recuperator.</b> A panoramic sight was used for both indirect and direct fire.|$|E
25|$|The gun {{carriage}} {{was designed to}} be towed behind a limber and six horses; the lower carriage comprised a box trail. The QF 4.5 fired a separate round (i.e. shell and cartridge were loaded separately). The barrel was of built-up type, with a horizontal sliding block breech. A limited traverse saddle supported the elevating mass and a shield. It was designed for one-man laying with both traverse and elevation controls and sights on the left. The recoil system was below the barrel and used a hydraulic buffer with a hydro-pneumatic <b>recuperator</b> to return the barrel to its firing position.|$|E
25|$|Finnish coastal {{artillery}} made {{modifications to}} the gun mountings during the interwar period. The most significant of these was inverting the gun so that the recuperating spring {{was on top of}} the gun which allowed increasing the maximum elevation and thus the range. Inverting the gun however required also strengthening the <b>recuperator,</b> adding an equilibrator to correct the changed balance and other changes to the mounting and elevation mechanism. Increased maximum elevation also allowed using the gun as an anti-aircraft weapon. To increase maximum range even more the ammunition for the guns was modified by adding a ballistic cap to existing ammunition which increased the range by a factor of 1.5. Additionally Finns changed the gun loading practice to allow reloading without the need to return the gun to zero elevation after each shot. This practice increased the rate of fire.|$|E

25|$|It took {{eight to}} twenty hours in soft soil or gravel to {{excavate}} the large firing pit required {{to hold the}} halves of the base box. Six to eight hours were required to actually assemble the gun itself. Each half of the base box was maneuvered into position on rails that ran along {{each side of the}} pit and then it was jacked up off the wagon and the wagon was then removed. Each base box half was jacked down onto wheels that ran on the guide rails and then they were bolted together. The complete base box was pulled over the pit, the wheels removed and it was jacked down into the pit. Three rails were placed on top of the base box to guide the carriage wagon into position and the carriage was jacked up while the wagon was removed and it was then jacked down and bolted to the base box. The barrel wagon was guided into place using the same rails and two block and tackles were attached to the barrel clamp. The crew pulled on the ropes and slid the barrel into the cradle. The last steps were to connect the recoil brakes' pistons to the barrel, fill and test the recoil brake and <b>recuperator,</b> and install the roller race. Disassembly took around six hours.|$|E
500|$|The QF 25-pounder Short {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} design features which sought to increase its mobility.

The gun carriage was very different from that in the standard 25-pounder, and included a new cradle, trail and axles.

500|$|The new gun used as many {{standard}} 25-pounder parts as possible, but {{included a}} number of major differences {{in order to reduce the}} weapon's weight.

The guns weighed 1.25 tons, had a [...] long barrel and a maximum range which was approximately 87 percent that of the standard gun.

40|$|Steel {{reheating}} is an energy-intensive process requiring uniform {{temperature distribution}} within reheating furnaces. Historically, <b>recuperators</b> have ben used to preheat combustion air, thereby conserving energy. More recent innovations include oxygen enrichment {{and the use}} of regenerative burners, which provide higher preheat air temperatures than <b>recuperators.</b> These processes have limitations such as equipment deterioration, decreasing energy efficiency over time, high maintenance costs, and increased NO{sub x} emissions with increased air preheat temperature, unless special equipment is used. Praxair, Inc., supplier of oxygen and other industrial gases to the steel industry, proposes to introduce an innovative oxy-fuel burner technology (using 100 % oxygen) to the steel reheating industry. Oxy-fuel combustion reduces or eliminates nitrogen in combustion air and substantially reduces waste heat carried out with flue gas. Based on technology currently used in the glass, hazardous waste, and aluminum industries, Praxair has developed and patented low temperature, oxy-fuel burners {{that can be used in}} high temperature industrial furnaces where temperature uniformity is critical and extremely low NO{sub x} emissions are desired. The technical goal of the project is to demonstrate the use of oxy-fuel burners in a slab reheat furnace while reducing energy consumption by 45 % and NO{sub x} emissions by 90 % within the converted furnace zones. Successful implementation of this technology also will eliminate the need to periodically replace <b>recuperators</b> and install NO{sub x} removal equipment...|$|R

40|$|Engineering ceramics, {{particularly}} {{silicon carbide}} (SiC), {{are increasingly being}} used as materials in high temperature <b>recuperators</b> for preheating combustion air from furnace exhaust gases. As typical flue gases from these furnaces may contain sodium, potassium, halides, etc. that may attack SiC, protective coatings, such as alumina, zirconia and others, have been investigated {{as a means of}} increasing the life and reliability of these SiC <b>recuperators.</b> The objective of this work was to determine the effect of coating properties, such as emissivity and thermal conductivity, on the heat transfer performance of these high temperature ceramic <b>recuperators.</b> The approach was to formulate a simple rectangular cross section flow model to determine the amount of heat transferred by radiation from H 2 O and CO 2 in the combustion gases to the coating surface as well as by convection to the same surface and by conduction through the coating and plate material to the combustion air on the other side. The results indicated that the thermal conductivity of the coating and coating thickness had a negligible effect on the overall heat transfer coefficient. Further, increasing the surface emissivity from 0. 5 to 0. 8 resulted in an increase of 10 % in the overall heat transfer coefficient in typical waste heat recovery applications. It was concluded that by combining enhancement techniques on the air side with high emissivity materials on the gas side, one obtains optimal performance in a gas to gas heat exchanger...|$|R
500|$|QF 25-pounder Short {{guns were}} first issued to front line {{artillery}} regiments in August 1943 {{as part of}} the reorganisation of the Australian Army's fighting units to the [...] "Jungle division" [...] structure. Under this structure, one of each field regiment's three batteries was re-equipped with the new guns. Field batteries equipped with the guns normally consisted of a headquarters and two troops each with four guns, seven jeeps and a D6 tractor. Like the standard 25-pounder, each gun had a crew of six men. The commander of New Guinea Force's artillery, Brigadier L.E.S. Barker, preferred the 75mm pack howitzer to the 25-pounder Short, and tried to prevent the new gun being issued, but was overruled by Brigadier O'Brien. The guns were first used in action by the 7th Division during the landing at Nadzab, when a 32-man detachment of the 2/4th Field Regiment was dropped by parachute from five C-47 transports with two guns. One gun was assembled and ready to fire within an hour, but the buffer and <b>recuperator</b> of the other took two days to locate in the long grass.
