[...] During a 1996 panel at the University of Colorado at Boulder's Conference on World Affairs, Ebert coined the Boulder Pledge, by which he vowed never to purchase anything offered through the result of an unsolicited email message, or to forward chain emails or mass emails to others.

500|$|The most {{important}} thing for Paterson was to keep the spirit of the book alive while finding a way to transform it from [...] "a novel that takes place mostly in the characters' heads to a dynamic visual medium". Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination. While Paterson focused on [...] "bringing out the emotions of the story," [...] he admitted to having difficulty writing about Terabithia [...] "because it was too close". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film. [...] "What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn't so attached to the story was to <b>really</b> <b>let</b> his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way", David said. Csupó noted that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film than they are in the book.

[...] Scott said, [...] "I got the crew together and said, 'Okay guys, here we go. This {{is going to be}} a lot more vampy and fun,' and cranked up the ghetto blaster with rock music and away we went." [...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] Scott said, [...] "we did two takes that were on the edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, and we did a third take where Lucy <b>really</b> <b>let</b> loose. Of course, we all died laughing and said, 'Okay, that one is never going to make it to the screen'; we definitely pushed it too far!"

500|$|... "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews. IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10, describing {{it as an}} [...] "epic" [...] mid-series finale which [...] "opened with a grandstanding, wonderfully [...] pre-credits tease and didn't <b>really</b> <b>let</b> up from there". He praised the spectacle and character development, but felt it led to {{a certain amount of}} [...] "the odd rushed scene...forgettable supporting , and little opportunity to develop the Headless Monks into anything particularly imposing". Dave Golder of SFX gave [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] four and a half out of five stars, feeling it [...] "saved" [...] the sixth series and offered [...] "a satisfying slice of fantasy television which ticked lots of boxes: it featured dashing, daring storytelling which was bold and confident; it looked fantastic, there were some hilarious lines and the performance of the star upped his wattage a couple of notches once again". However, he was more critical of the Headless Monks and the direction of the battle at the end. Neela Debnath of The Independent was also favourable, praising the use of the cliffhanger and felt the complicated nature of the episode [...] "draws people more into the show and gets them thinking about it".|$|E

500|$|... "Anticipating" [...] is a teen pop and dance-pop {{that lasts}} {{for three minutes}} and 16 seconds. Corey Moss of MTV noted the song also has a 1970s disco sound, while Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe {{compared}} it to early Madonna tracks such as [...] "Holiday" [...] (1983). Glenn Gamboa of Newsday compared the song to Janet Jackson's [...] "All for You", calling it [...] "pleasant, shimmering R-styled pop". According to the sheetmusic published at musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, the song is composed in the key of F major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 112 beats per minute. Spears vocal range spans from the low-key of F3 to the high-note of A4. The song has a basic sequence of B(9)–C–Dm7–B(9) as its chord progression. Lyrically, it talks about friendship and camaraderie between women. During the bridge, Spears sings, [...] "Gotta <b>really</b> <b>let</b> me know {{if you want me}} / You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy".

500|$|The storyline {{continued}} throughout 1993 as Christine makes greater {{demands on}} Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair unless {{he does so}} himself. In September 1993, the situation finally reaches a climax on-screen. The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would {{find out about the}} affair; [...] "should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?" [...] In the end it was felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he does, Pauline becomes violent and hits him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this was something different, [...] "an act of betrayal on a massive scale." [...] Series production manager, Rona McKendrick, has commented on this [...] "iconic" [...] scene: [...] "It {{was one of the few}} times when you saw Pauline really, <b>really</b> <b>let</b> rip... you really felt the anger, understood the anger and realised why she went as far as she did."

Simpson also said {{that she did not}} want to meet with Jessica's record label (Columbia) because she wanted to be signed because of her music, rather than her sister. She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with the whole concept of the song. To me, writing is a very important thing. It's what I've always done and what I've always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. So my label was amazing because they <b>really</b> <b>let</b> me have my hands in there. I got to write a lot." [...] Simpson said of making the album: [...] "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work."

Lon Grahnke of Chicago Sun-Times reacted positively toward the episode, {{calling it a}} [...] "stunning" [...] season finale. Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Gethsemane" [...] two stars out of four, noting that it [...] "withholds so much information that it barely qualifies as a complete episode". Vitaris felt that the large degree of ambiguity in the episode's script left the actors' performances [...] "curiously neutral", adding that the cast [...] "struggle manfully" [...] with the material. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B+, noting that [...] "everything here has a ring of familiarity to it". Handlen felt that the episode's premise and ending were poorly executed, as [...] "trying to balance possible truths while maintaining the plausibility of both is incredibly difficult to pull off on a long-running show", adding that the episode [...] "comes down on the only {{side of the fence}} it really could" [...] given that [...] "there've been too many scenes of shape-changing bounty hunters and mystical alien healers to <b>really</b> <b>let</b> this idea play out know [...] in any real way". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, noting that while it [...] "attempts to do too much", it [...] "has a passion behind it which makes it gripping". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's cliffhanger ending, centering on the apparent death of Mulder, was too unbelievable, noting that it would be out of character for him to grow so disillusioned as to take his own life. In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Gethsemane" [...] (along with [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to the United States, California Chrome was turned out for a month at Taylor Made Farm, then resumed {{training}} with Sherman. On July 23, the horse was entered in the San Diego Handicap where he faced Dortmund, who had finished third in the 2015 Kentucky Derby to American Pharoah. California Chrome tracked behind Dortmund until the far turn, then moved to the front. Dortmund fought back and the two dueled down the stretch, with California Chrome prevailing by half a length while carrying five pounds more than Dortmund. [...] A month later, California Chrome challenged an all-star field in the Pacific Classic, which included a rematch with Dortmund as well as long-time rival Hoppertunity. [...] Most notably, Chrome met the champion mare Beholder for the first time. Beholder, third favorite on the morning line, had won the previous year in her debut against male horses, the only female horse to have ever won that race. California Chrome got the number one post position in the nine-horse field, viewed as an unfavorable draw because, other than his prep race win at Meydan Racecourse, he previously did poorly on the rail. [...] The post position {{turned out not to be}} a problem, as the horse broke cleanly and quickly went to the lead, led throughout the entire race, and only Beholder kept close to him until the mile pole, at which point he pulled ahead of the field and won by five lengths. [...] Espinoza kept a relatively firm hold on the horse throughout the race, and Beholder's rider, Gary Stevens, commented, [...] "Victor was playing with us. I don't think he <b>really</b> <b>let</b> him run. That's scary to think about." [...] In similar form, he again was challenged by Dortmund in the Awesome Again Stakes on October 1. [...] The two horses at one point outdistanced the rest of the field by 12 lengths, but California Chrome led throughout and won by [...] lengths. [...] Art Sherman commented, [...] "You're looking at maybe the best horse in the world right now." ...|$|E

[...] In a later interview with Randall Kenan, Butler explained how debilitating this trauma has been for Americans, especially for African Americans, as symbolized by the loss of her protagonist’s left arm: [...] "I couldn’t <b>really</b> <b>let</b> [...] come all the way back. I couldn’t let her return to what she was, I couldn’t let her come back whole and , I think, really symbolizes her not coming back whole. Antebellum slavery didn’t leave people quite whole." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nick was not {{away from}} Walford for long. In 1991, he {{returned}} with a heroin addiction but Dot initially shunned him and ignored his pleas for help. It was only after discovering Charlie had died that Nick was her only family left and was determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: [...] "I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and my hair was always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes I met {{with a guy who}} was an addict, and he told me things that you go through, like you can’t relax when you’re trying to come off it. You can‘t sleep so you drink loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they <b>really</b> <b>let</b> me go as far as I could on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‘s put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job." [...] As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey with the help of Pete Beale. During this period, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle is murdered. The murder was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. The episode Eddie was murdered was written by Tony McHale, it finished with a cliffhanger featuring Clyde Tavernier in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife, which Nick witnessed from his bedroom window. Nick tells the police what he saw, leading to Clyde going on the run with the help of Michelle Fowler. Joe Wallace eventually came forward, saying he saw Nick out on the square on the night of Eddie’s murder, having escaped his room and climbed down a drain pipe. Nick confesses to Dot that he was responsible but insists that it was an accident. Nick is subsequently arrested and charged with Eddie’s murder and he stands trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by Tony Jordan. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Altman summarised: [...] "Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, he got away with murder".|$|E
