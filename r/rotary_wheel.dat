40|$|<b>Rotary</b> {{desiccant}} <b>wheels</b> {{are used}} to regulate the relative humidity of airstreams. These are commonly integrated into Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning units to reduce the relative humidity of incoming ventilation air. To maximise the surface area, desiccant materials are arranged in a honeycomb matrix structure which results in a high pressure drop across the device requiring fans and blowers to provide adequate ventilation. This restricts the use of <b>rotary</b> desiccant <b>wheels</b> to mechanical ventilation systems. Passive ventilation systems are able to deliver adequate ventilation air but cannot control the humidity of the incoming air.

Solid desiccants have long been used in dehumidification and cooling systems for energy efficiency or reduce electricity.

The results indicated that Ackermann correction factor had a significant effect on performance efficiency. Air stream velocity was one of the most effective parameter on performance and dehumidification rate of wheel. The performance was increased when process air stream velocity decreased.

This means that conventional amine processes will result in a relatively high energy penalty, whereas novel adsorbents and adsorption processes have the potential to improve the efficiency of separation. High-selectivity adsorbents are required to achieve relatively high CO 2 uptake at low partial pressures, which means that the separation process should be based on either very strong physisorption or chemisorption with thermal regeneration. From the process point of view, the main challenge is to develop efficient separation processes with rapid thermal cycles. In this report we present a detailed overview of the methodology behind the development of novel materials and processes as part of the “Adsorption Materials and Processes for Gas-fired power plants” (AMPGas) project.

To overcome the coupling between drive and sense modes, numerous necessary frames, beams, and anchors are delicately figured out and properly arranged.

The proportions of 0, 20, 40 and 60 percent gum arabic (w/w) in the carrier blend and 10, 20 and 30 percent nutmeg oil (w/w) as flavor load were studied. Emulsions were microencapsulated in a vertical co-current spray drier equipped with a <b>rotary</b> <b>wheel</b> atomizer operated at 18000 rpm. The inlet air temperature was set at 180 ± 2 o C. The microcapsules formed were then analyzed for their physical characteristics. Flavor load was found to have no influence whereas blend proportion was found to influence the moisture content. True density increased until 40 % gum arabic and decreased thereafter. Solubility increased with increase in flavor load and blend ratio. Though the highest encapsulation efficiency of 70. 1 % was obtained at a flavor loading of 10 % at a carrier proportion of 40 % gum arabic, further decrease was marginal with increase in flavor load up to 20 %. Considering the product characteristics, a 40 % gum arabic in the carrier blend and a flavor loading of 20 % nutmeg oil were found to be optimum.

The <b>rotary</b> <b>wheel</b> consists {{of a large number}} of micro-channels with oxygen carriers (OC) coated on the inner surface of the channel walls.

In this two-part series, the effect of the reactor design parameters is evaluated and its performance with different OCs is compared. In Part 1, the design objectives and criteria are specified and the key parameters controlling the reactor performance are identified. The fundamental effects of the OC characteristics, the design parameters, and the operating conditions are studied. The design procedures are presented on the basis of the relative importance of each parameter, enabling a systematic methodology of selecting the design parameters and the operating conditions with different OCs.
