5|$|Parakramabahu V (1344 – 59) a king of Gampola {{who ruled}} from Dedigama <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{southeast}} of the island, to a place called Magul Maha Viharaya in the Ampara District after a confrontation with the Aryacakravarti. This is evident from inscriptions {{in a place called}} Lahugala.|$|E
5|$|Chiang and his KMT {{government}} <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{island of}} Taiwan. Confronted with the communist revolution in China {{and the end}} of the American atomic monopoly in 1949, the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand its containment policy. In NSC-68, a secret 1950 document, the National Security Council proposed to reinforce pro-Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the battle}} Philippicus rewarded the {{soldiers}} who had distinguished themselves and divided the spoils of the defeated Persians among them. He then proceeded to invade Arzanene again. However, his attempt to capture the fortress of Chlomaron was thwarted when Kardarigan arrived with reinforcements. The Byzantine army <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fortress of Aphumon, fighting rear-guard actions with the shadowing Persians.|$|E

5|$|General Vandegrift and {{his staff}} were aware that Kawaguchi's troops had <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area west of the Matanikau and that {{numerous}} groups of Japanese stragglers were scattered throughout the area between the Lunga Perimeter and the Matanikau River. Vandegrift, therefore, decided to conduct {{a series of small}} unit operations around the Matanikau Valley.|$|E
5|$|The University {{closed its}} doors during the Philippine Revolution of 1896 {{because of the}} ensuing disorder. It reopened though for the school year 1897–1898 when the rebels <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> provinces. The arrival of the Spanish–American War to the Philippines and the {{resumption}} of the Revolution in 1898 led again to the suspension of classes. UST closed for the school year 1898–1899.|$|E
5|$|The four {{remaining}} North Korean pilots immediately <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. The aircraft likely staged at Pyongyang Air Base, {{and informed}} their superiors. No additional North Korean aircraft were spotted {{in the area}} {{for the rest of the}} day. By the end of the day the US aircraft from the three squadrons had flown 163 sorties.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg at Bruinsburg and driving northeast, Grant won battles at Port Gibson and Raymond and captured Jackson, the Mississippi state capital, on May 14, 1863, forcing Pemberton to withdraw westward. Attempts {{to stop the}} Union advance at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge were unsuccessful. Pemberton knew that the corps under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman was preparing to flank him from the north; {{he had no choice}} but to withdraw or be outflanked. Pemberton burned the bridges over the Big Black River and took everything edible in his path, both animal and plant, as he <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> well-fortified city of Vicksburg.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} battle, which {{resulted}} in an Ottoman victory and in Petar Kružić's death, the Klis defenders, who were lacking in water supplies, finally surrendered to the Ottomans {{in exchange for their}} freedom on 12 March 1537. Citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Senj, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army. Klis became an administrative centre or sanjak (Kilis Sancağı) of the Bosnia Eyalet, and would remain so for a century.|$|E
5|$|As he withdrew, Frederick {{established}} a fighting line {{north of the}} village, and it eventually served as a rallying point for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with a wall of musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army were {{out of range of}} the Austrian army by the time they had reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.|$|E

5|$|As {{the glaciers}} <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{northeast}} about 20,000 years ago, glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that diverted {{the headwaters of}} South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. The retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20to 30feet (6.1to 9.1m) thick, which formed a dam blocking water from draining into Big Run. Instead water from Ganoga Lake and the area that later became Lake Jean was diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek. These diversions added about 7square miles (18km²) to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50percent to 20.1square miles (52km²).|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the house}} saw {{service as a}} {{depository}} for the evacuated Wallace Collection and a convalescent home. A troop of gunners occupied the decaying service wing, and the park {{was used for the}} inflation of barrage balloons. During this turmoil, the Dashwoods <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper floor and took in lodgers to pay the bills, albeit very superior lodgers, who included Nancy Mitford and James Lees-Milne, who was secretary of the Country House Committee of the National Trust and instrumental in the Trust's acquisition of many such houses. In 1943, Sir John gave the house and grounds to the National Trust, on condition that he and his descendants could continue living in the house.|$|E
5|$|He {{would have}} tried to reconquer the {{province}} if he had the resources, but now he had neither the men nor the money to defend the province any more. Instead he <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cathedral of Antioch, where he observed a solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously, and accepted the fact, that the defeat was God's decision and a result of the sins {{of the people of the}} land, including him. Heraclius took to the sea on a ship to Constantinople in the night.|$|E

5|$|On 25 November, the Chinese {{entered the}} war in defense of North Korea. The People's Liberation Army force, which totaled 260,000 troops, flooded into North Korea and caught the Eighth Army by surprise. Chinese forces crushed the UN and South Korean forces with {{overwhelming}} numbers, surrounding and destroying elements of the US 2nd Infantry Division, 7th Infantry Division, and South Korean forces. The 24th Infantry Division, {{on the west coast}} of the Korean peninsula, was hit by soldiers from the 50th and 66th Chinese field armies. Amid heavy casualties, the Eighth Army <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Imjin River, south of the 38th parallel, having been devastated by the overwhelming Chinese force.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August, a {{fleet of}} Sasanian rafts {{ferrying}} troops across the Bosphorus was surrounded and destroyed by Byzantine ships. The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the Golden Horn, while the main Avar host attacked the land walls. Patrician Bonus' galleys rammed and destroyed the Slavic boats; the Avar land assault from 6 to 7 August also failed. With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Balkan hinterland within two days, never to threaten Constantinople seriously again. Even though the army of Shahrbaraz was still encamped at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople was over.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the battlefield the Athenians had triumphed in a tough battle against the Thebans. The other Greeks fighting for the Persians had deliberately fought badly, according to Herodotus. The Thebans retreated from the battle, but in a different direction from the Persians, allowing them to escape without further losses. The Greeks, reinforced by the contingents who had not taken part in the main battle, then stormed the Persian camp. Although the Persians initially defended the wall vigorously, it was eventually breached; the Persians, packed tightly together in the camp, were slaughtered by the Greeks. Of the Persians who had <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp, scarcely 3,000 were left alive.|$|E

5|$|Pope Gregory IX's {{crusade against}} the Bogumils in Bosnia, who were deemed heretics, {{did not bring}} good results. Central Bosnia was not conquered, and Bosnian Ban Matej Ninoslav and his nobility <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republic of Ragusa in 1240. In an edict issued by Ninoslav on 22 March 1240, Ninoslav promised to protect the city of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) if Vladislav attacked. At the time, Serbian bands roamed around the outside of Dubrovnik, and Vladislav himself {{was a member of}} the bands. The Ragusans may have feared Vladislav due to the earlier {{disputes}} with him, or Vladislav may have posed an actual danger to Ragusa.|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a moraine consisting of clay, sand, and gravel that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits are constantly being re-worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to longshore drift.|$|E
5|$|Some {{philosophers}} and Christians resisted {{the demands of}} the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished, trade routes were disrupted, and the rich <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more limited self-sufficiency of their country estates. As an urban lifestyle came to be associated with decadence, the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple, virtuous ways of life.|$|E
