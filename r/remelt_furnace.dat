40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{theoretical and}} scoping experimental efforts {{to investigate the}} decontamination potential of a slag remelting process for decontaminating irradiated vanadium alloys. Theoretical calculations, using a commercial thermochemical computer code HSC Chemistry, determined the potential slag compositions and slag-vanadium alloy ratios. The experiment determined the removal characteristics of four surrogate transmutation isotopes (Ca, Y - to simulate Sc, Mn, and Ar) from a V- 5 Ti- 5 Cr alloy with calcium fluoride slag. An electroslag <b>remelt</b> <b>furnace</b> {{was used in the}} experiment to melt and react the constituents. The process achieved about a 90 percent removal of calcium and over 99 percent removal of yttrium. Analyses indicate that about 40 percent of the manganese may have been removed. Argon analyses indicates that 99. 3 % of the argon was released from the vanadium alloy in the first melt increasing to 99. 7 % during the second melt. Powder metallurgy techniques were used to incorporate surrogate transmutation products in the vanadium. A powder mixture was prepared with the following composition: 90 wt % vanadium, 4. 7 wt % titanium, 4. 7 wt % chromium, 0. 35 wt % manganese, 0. 35 wt % CaO, and 0. 35 wt % Y{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }. This mixture was packed into 2. 54 cm diameter stainless steel tubes. Argon was introduced into the powder mixture by evacuating and backfilling the stainless steel containers to a pressure of 20 kPa (0. 2 atm). The tubes were hot isostatically pressed at 207 MPa (2000 atm) and 1473 K to consolidate the metal. An electroslag <b>remelt</b> <b>furnace</b> (crucible dimensions: 5. 1 cm diameter by 15. 2 cm length) was used to process the vanadium electrodes. Chemical analyses were performed on samples extracted from the slags and ingots. Ingot analyses results are shown below.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Industrial Programs, has {{sponsored}} {{the development of}} a Fluidized Bed Waste Heat Recovery System (FBWHRS) and a higher temperature variant, the Ceramic Tubular Distributor Plate (CTDP) Fluidized Bed Heat Exchanger (FBHX) system. Both systems recover energy from high-temperature flue gases and produce steam. In a one-year evaluation test on an aluminum <b>remelt</b> <b>furnace,</b> the FBWHRS generated about 26 million lb of saturated steam at 150 psig. Before entering the FBWHRS, the flue gases were diluted to 1100 ?F to protect the fluidized bed distributor plate. In a second project, this FBWHRS concept was further developed by replacing the metallic distributor plate with a Ceramic Tubular Distributor Plate (CTDP), a closely spaced row of alumina rods. The ceramic unit permitted energy from flue gases to be recovered without diluting gases. Elimination of the air diluent system reduced the FBHX fluidized bed volume by 70 % and increased heat recovery by 30 %. Both systems offer several advantages. The fluidized bed particles enhance heat transfer and continually clean the finned tubes in the fluidized beds. Also, only the distributor plate is exposed to the hot fouling and corrosive flue gases since the fluidized bed quickly cools these gases to a uniform 500 ?F...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{control of}} the {{electrode}} gap in a vacuum arc <b>remelting</b> (VAR) <b>furnace</b> has been a goal of melters for many years. The size of the electrode gap has a direct influence on ingot solidification structure. At the high melting currents (30 to 40 kA) typically used for VAR of segregation insensitive Ti and Zr alloys, process voltage is used {{as an indicator of}} electrode gap, whereas drip-short frequency (or period) is usually used at the lower currents (5 to 8 kA) employed during VAR of superalloys. Modem controllers adjust electrode position or drive velocity to maintain a voltage or drip-short frequency (or period) set-point. Because these responses are non-linear functions of electrode gap and melting current, these controllers have a limited range for which the feedback gains are valid. Models are available that relate process voltage and drip-short frequency to electrode gap. These relationships may be used to linearize the controller feedback signal. An estimate of electrode gap may then be obtained by forming a weighted sum of the independent gap estimates obtained from the voltage and drip-short signals. By using multiple independent measures to estimate the gap, a controller that is less susceptible to process disturbances can be developed. Such a controller was designed, built and tested. The tests were carried out at Allvac Corporation during VAR of 12 Cr steel at intermediate current levels...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{behavior}} of a metal vapor plasma arc in a vacuum arc <b>remelting</b> (VAR) <b>furnace</b> is believed {{to contribute to the}} formation of defects in reactive metal and super-alloy ingots. Industry standard instrumentation, which includes electric current and voltage measurements, can asses the stability of an arc but cannot predict the location of an arc. It is known that Maxwell’s equations predict a magnetic flux density at a distance from an arc. It is shown that a single arc’s location can be uniquely determined in a cross section by using an externally mounted 2 -axis Hall Effect magnetic flux density sensor provided that the system’s electric current is also measured and the geometry of the VAR furnace is known. The solution is based on the Biot-Savart Law with finite element modeling assisting the analysis. The methodology is validated using controlled, static experiments. The measurement system is deployed on a small scale, experimental VAR furnace to investigate arc behavior. Results from VAR operation show a time averaged arc distribution that does not significantly change {{over the course of a}} melt. By comparing the results from multiple sensors, observed arc motions are categorized as being either retrograde or sympathetic. The former is characterized by large periodic motions, and the latter either small random motions or motions associated with an event such as a liquid metal drip short. Significant alternating currents are found to exist in the DC VAR furnace. A magnetostatic single arc model is not sufficient to describe the current distribution in the VAR furnace at an instant but it may be an effective means to detect quasi static non-axisymmetry or slow time varying current profile changes during VAR operation...|$|R

Lanthanide borosilicate glasses (LaBS) {{designed in the}} U. S. A. {{are known to be}} one of the prospective vitreous matrices for actinides waste immobilization. In this study results of current study on composition and structure of remelted lanthanide borosilicate glasses have been focused on. The samples were prepared by repeated melting of initial LaBS-glass precursor. Both conventional high-temperature resistive furnace and inductively heated melter with cold crucible were employed for fabrication of the glasses.

40|$|The {{global demand}} for {{aluminium}} and aluminium products is progressively increasing. However, {{the production of}} primary aluminium is an energy intensive process and emits at the world average ~ 12 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CDE) per tonne metal. However, aluminium recycling is attractive because one can save up to 90 % of the energy, as well as 95 % of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The aluminium recycling industry is facing several challenges, such as treatment and disposal of by-products, emissions control and requirements related to energy efficiency. A {{state of the art}} <b>remelting</b> <b>furnace</b> requires 2. 5 GJ/tonne metal, which is more than twice the theoretical energy consumption. Also, remelting of fine scrap, such as turnings and chips leads to significant metal loss. However, solid state recycling methods not involving remelting might offer higher metal yield and lower energy consumption than conventional recycling based on remelting. In the present study, solid state recycling of aluminium turnings and sawing scrap was investigated by cold compaction and subsequent hot extrusion and Cyclic Extrusion and Compression (CEC), respectively. Degreasing of aluminium scrap by thermal treatment or acetone treatment was compared with respect to the recycled metal products. In addition, ECAP of hot extruded materials was used for evaluating the internal bonding and deformation behaviour during severe plastic deformation. Mechanical properties and microstructures of the extruded and ECAPed materials were carefully investigated. Also, characterization of aluminium scraps, e. g. automotive aluminium scrap and aluminium primary dross was performed using state of the art techniques, such as EPMA and XRD with Rietveld refinement. Finally, the energy requirement for solid state recycling processing was calculated and discussed. Characterization of aluminium scraps revealed that impurities were quite common in industry scraps. Also contaminations, e. g. metallic iron and its oxides, lead and TiO 2 were observed in the automotive scrap collected from a commercial shredder. Aluminium dross has a complicated composition, containing metallic aluminium particles, corundum, spinel etc. The EPMA results showed that iron and manganese and their oxides were widely distributed in the dross fines. Metallic aluminium in dross tended to solidify as large size particles. The leachate from aluminium dross water leaching exhibited a high content of fluoride and H 2 gas bubbles after leaching for 72 hours. The results from the TG/DTA-MS analysis indicated an optimal thermal degreasing temperature, e. g. ~ 428 C. High temperature thermal treatment of turnings resulted in a significant increase of scrap surface oxide films. However, the combustion peak for the lubricants was ~ 374 C, corresponding to the second DTG peak at ~ 350 C. In addition, the thermal treatment time should be optimized so as to complete the decomposition and combustion of the lubricants. CEC processed aluminium sawing scrap turned out to be fully dense. However, room temperature tensile properties after CEC revealed high variability, indicating the presence of material inhomogeneity. Besides, microstructure observations showed that the scrap from sawing contained a mixture of different aluminium alloys. This could be part of the explanation versus the inhomogeneity. Also, a fully dense material was obtained for the aluminium turnings processed by hot extrusion at 500 C at an extrusion ratio of 15 : 1. The corresponding hardness and room temperature tensile strength values constituted 95 - 98 % of the properties of conventional reference material. To be noticed, the thermal treatment of feedstock turnings at 350 C for 30 minutes did not introduce obvious differences in mechanical properties of the recycled extruded materials as compared to acetone treated feedstock. Post extrusion ECAP showed improved mechanical properties and enhanced internal interface bonding. Oxides produced at the feedstock surfaces could be broken and redistributed upon hot extrusion and especially after ECAP applying a high number of passes at elevated temperatures, e. g. 8 passes at 100 C or 200 C. As a consequence, the key mechanical properties, such as the fracture elongation and the UTS, could be nearly as good as the conventional material counterparts. Energy requirement estimations for solid state recycling revealed that the precompaction process uses less than 7 % of the energy required for the world’s best practice conventional remelting, and resulted in a 93 % carbon dioxide equivalent emission reduction.
