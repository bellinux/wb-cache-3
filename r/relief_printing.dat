25|$|Letterpress {{printing}} is {{a technique}} of <b>relief</b> <b>printing.</b> A worker composes and locks movable type into the bed of a press, inks it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type which creates an impression on the paper.|$|E
25|$|Engraving is the {{practice}} of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or glass are engraved, or may provide an intaglio printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called engravings. Wood engraving {{is a form of}} <b>relief</b> <b>printing</b> and is not covered in this article.|$|E
25|$|Woodcut is a <b>relief</b> <b>printing</b> artistic {{technique}} in printmaking {{in which an}} image is carved into {{the surface of a}} block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along the grain of the wood (unlike wood engraving where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe beechwood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of cherry wood was popular.|$|E

500|$|Typically, wordless novels used <b>relief</b> <b>printing</b> {{techniques}} such as woodcuts, wood engraving, metalcuts, or linocuts. [...] One of the oldest printing techniques, <b>relief</b> <b>printing</b> has its origins in 8th-century China and was introduced to Europe in the 15th century. [...] It requires an artist to draw or transfer an image to a printing block; the areas not to be printed (the white areas) are cut away, leaving raised areas to which ink is applied to make prints. [...] The monochrome prints were usually in black ink, and occasionally in a different colour such as sienna or orange.

500|$|In the 1830s George Baxter repopularised colour <b>relief</b> <b>printing,</b> {{known as}} chromoxylography, {{by using a}} [...] "background detail plate printed in {{aquatint}} intaglio, followed by colours printed in oil inks from relief plates—usually wood blocks". [...] Evans followed the Baxter process, with the modification of using relief wood blocks only. For The Poems of Oliver Goldsmith, Evans created a facsimile of a watercolour, by superimposing colours {{with the use of}} separate colour blocks, one by one, to achieve the graduated colours of the original. First, Foster drew the illustration directly on the woodblocks that were to be cut, and he then recreated a coloured paper copy of the drawing. Evans, using the same pigments as Foster, grinding them himself, produced inks to match Foster's colours. The printing was done using a hand-press, with nine or ten print runs required for each illustration. For A Chronicle of England, Evans engraved prints dropped into the text at six-page intervals. Doyle drew the illustrations directly onto the wood blocks and created coloured proofs. Nine or ten wood blocks (colour blocks) were used for each of the 80illustrations, which Evans again printed on a hand-press. The use of colour and the ability to create subtle tones are characteristic of Evans' skill as a colourist. His work was distinctive because of the characteristic quality of the wood engraving (carving) and his manner of limiting the use of ink to create a more striking result.|$|E
