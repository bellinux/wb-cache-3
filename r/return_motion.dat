50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} adoption of electronic fuel injection, most carbureted automobile engines used mechanical fuel pumps to transfer fuel from {{the fuel tank}} into the fuel bowls of the carburetor. Most mechanical fuel pumps are diaphragm pumps, which are a type of positive displacement pump. Diaphragm pumps contain a pump chamber whose volume is increased or decreased by the flexing of a flexible diaphragm, similar to the action of a piston pump. A check valve is located at both the inlet and outlet ports of the pump chamber to force the fuel to flow in one direction only. Specific designs vary, but in the most common configuration, these pumps are typically bolted onto the engine block or head, and the engine's camshaft has an extra eccentric lobe that operates a lever on the pump, either directly or via a pushrod, by pulling the diaphragm to bottom dead center. In doing so, the volume inside the pump chamber increased, causing pressure to decrease.This allows fuel to be pushed into the pump from the tank (caused by atmospheric pressure acting on the fuel in the tank). The <b>return</b> <b>motion</b> of the diaphragm to top dead center is accomplished by a diaphragm spring, during which the fuel in the pump chamber is squeezed through the outlet port and into the carburetor. The pressure at which the fuel is expelled from the pump is thus limited (and therefore regulated) by the force applied by the diaphragm spring.|$|E

40|$|A bond graph {{model has}} been {{developed}} in this paper concerning a high pressure industrial hydraulic system. The accuracy of the bond graph model was verified by comparing its response to the response of an actual hydraulic system and the correlation of these results is high concerning the shape, magnitude and response times. Three different tests were conducted, depending on the motion profile of the valve spool, from which an important conclusion drawn is that a long duration in the valve spool <b>return</b> <b>motion</b> has the most noticeable effect on the maximum vertical travel of the load as it significantly reduces the load oscillation amplitude after the load has reached its topmost position. What follows is an increase of the residual pressure in the hydraulic cylinder top chamber with a lesser effect on the load maximum velocity. The results of this work are used for proactive fault finding in cases of valve spool malfunctions, particularly anomalies during the valve spool motion {{and can be used}} to optimize the valve spool motion profile.

40|$|Splinting {{the hand}} with a peripheral-nerve injury is both easy and difficult. The ease of {{splinting}} results from the readily recognizable and often identical deformities. Therefore, unlike many other hand injuries, the deformities resulting from isolated peripheral nerve paralysis are usually effec-tively splinted using standard splinting designs. The diffi-culty, however, in splinting peripheral nerve paralysis arises from the impossibility of building a static external device that substitutes for the intricately balanced muscles the splint attempts to replace.

40|$|The {{distributional}} form {{of financial}} asset returns {{has important implications}} for the theoretical and empirical analyses in economics and finance. It is now a well-established fact that financial return distributions are empirically nonstationary, both in the weak and the strong sense. One first step to model such nonstationarity is to assume that these return distributions retain their shape, but not their localization (mean) or size (volatility) as the classical Gaussian distributions do. In that case, one needs also to pay attention to skewedness and kurtosis, in addition to localization and size. This modeling requires special Zolotarev parametrizations of financial distributions, with a four parameters, one for each relevant distributional moment. Recently popular stable financial distributions are the Paretian scaling distributions, which scale both in time T and frequency. For example, the volatility of the lognormal financial price distribution, derived from the geometric Brownian asset <b>return</b> <b>motion</b> and used to model Black-Scholes (1973) option pricing, scales according to T^{ 0. 5 }. More generally, the volatility of the price return distributions of Calvet and Fisher's (2002) Multifractal Model for Asset Returns (MMAR) scales according to T^{(1 /(_{Z})) }, where the Zolotarev stability exponent _{Z} measures the degree of the scaling, and thus of the nonstationarity of the financial returns.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{experimental}} studies {{of the character of}} phase transitions in the quasi- 1 D organic compound (TMTSF) 2 PF 6 in the close vicinity of the borders between the paramagnetic metal PM, antiferromagnetic insulator AF, and superconducting SC states. In order to drive the system through the phase border P_ 0 (T_ 0), the sample was maintained at fixed temperature T and pressure P, whereas the critical pressure P_ 0 was tuned by applying the magnetic field B. In this approach, the magnetic field was used (i) for tuning (P-P_ 0), and (ii) for identifying the phase composition (due to qualitatively different magnetoresistance behavior in different phases). Experimentally, we measured R(B) and its temperature dependence R(B,T) in the pressure range (0 - 1) GPa. Our studies focus on the features of the magnetoresistance at the phase transition between the PM and AF phases, in the close vicinity to the superconducting transition at T~ 1 K. We found pronounced history effects arising when the AF/PM phase border is crossed by sweeping the magnetic field: the resistance depends on a trajectory which the system arrives at a given point of the P-B-T phase space. In the transition from the PM to AF phase, the features of the PM phase extends well into the AF phase. At the opposite transition from the AF to PM phase, the features of the AF phase are observed in the PM phase. These results evidence for a macroscopically inhomogeneous state, which contains macroscopic inclusions of the minority phase. When the system is driven away from the transition, the homogeneous state is restored; upon a <b>return</b> <b>motion</b> to the phase boundary, no signatures of the minority phase are observed up to the very phase boundary.

40|$|Purpose: Evidence of {{intervertebral}} mechanical markers in chronic, non-specific {{low back}} pain (CNSLBP) is lacking. This research used dynamic fluoroscopic studies to compare intervertebral angular motion sharing inequality and variability (MSI and MSV) during continuous lumbar motion in CNSLBP patients and controls. Passive recumbent and active standing protocols were used and the relationships of these variables to age and disc degeneration were assessed. Methods: Twenty patients with CNSLBP and 20 matched controls received quantitative fluoroscopic lumbar spine examinations using a standardised protocol for data collection and image analysis. Composite disc degeneration (CDD) scores comprising the sum of Kellgren and Lawrence grades from L 2 -S 1 were obtained. Indices of intervertebral motion sharing inequality (MSI) and variability (MSV) were derived and expressed in units of proportion of lumbar range of motion from outward and <b>return</b> <b>motion</b> sequences during lying, (passive) and standing (active) lumbar bending and compared between patients and controls. Relationships between MSI, MSV, age and CDD were assessed by linear correlation. Results: MSI was significantly greater in the patients throughout the intervertebral motion sequences of recumbent flexion (0. 29 vs 0. 22, p= 0. 02) and when flexion, extension, left and right motion were combined to give a composite measure (1. 40 vs 0. 92, p= 0. 04). MSI correlated substantially with age (R= 0. 85, p= 0. 004) and CDD (R= 0. 70, p= 0. 03) in lying passive investigations in patients and not in controls. There were also substantial correlations between MSV and age (R= 0. 77, p= 0. 01) and CDD (R= 0. 85, p= 0. 004) in standing flexion in patients and not in controls. Conclusion: Greater inequality and variability of motion sharing was found in patients with CNSLBP than in controls, confirming previous studies and suggesting a biomechanical marker for the disorder at intervertebral level. The relationship between disc degeneration and MSI was augmented in patients, but not in controls during passive motion and similarly for MSV during active motion, suggesting links between in vivo disc mechanics and pain generation...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To review {{records of}} 166 {{patients}} who underwent treatment for Mycobacterium marinum tenosynovitis {{of the hand}} and wrist to identify factors associated with functional outcome. METHODS: Records of 97 men and 69 women aged 13 to 85 (mean, 50) years who underwent treatment for suspected M marinum tenosynovitis of the hand and wrist were retrospectively reviewed. All underwent open biopsy; synovectomy was performed when florid synovitis was present. Rifampicin and ethambutol were usually prescribed. Clarithromycin, minocycline and/or levofloxacin were used as adjuvants if there was drug intolerance, allergy, or relapse. The duration of antibiotic treatment depended on the clinical recovery. Patients were followed up for one year after completion of drug treatment. Functional outcome was considered excellent for those with > 195 masculine total active motion (TAM) and > 75 % <b>return</b> of <b>motion,</b> good for those with 130 masculine to 195 masculine TAM and 50 to 75 % <b>return</b> of <b>motion,</b> fair for those with 65 masculine to 129 masculine TAM and 25 to 49 % <b>return</b> of <b>motion,</b> and poor for those with 2 months after injury (27 % [21 / 79] vs. 9 % [7 / 77], p= 0. 004, Pearson Chi squared test), and have undergone synovectomy (23 % [28 / 124]) vs. 0 % [0 / 32], p= 0. 001, Fisher's exact test). Worse functional outcome correlated with late presentation (r= 0. 218) and the greater number of debridement procedures (r= 0. 453). CONCLUSION: Delayed antibiotic treatment of M marinum infections and steroid injections were associated with unsatisfactory outcome. Clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for this condition and avoid inappropriate management such as intralesional steroid injections.
