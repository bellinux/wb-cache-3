25|$|When light travels from {{a medium}} {{with a higher}} {{refractive}} index to one with a lower refractive index, Snell's law seems to require in some cases (whenever the angle of incidence is large enough) that the sine of the angle of refraction be greater than one. This of course is impossible, and the light in such cases is completely reflected by the boundary, a phenomenon known as total internal reflection. The largest possible angle of incidence which still results in a <b>refracted</b> <b>ray</b> is called the critical angle; {{in this case the}} <b>refracted</b> <b>ray</b> travels along the boundary between the two media.|$|E
25|$|Snell's law is {{generally}} true only for isotropic or specular media (such as glass). In anisotropic media such as some crystals, birefringence may split the <b>refracted</b> <b>ray</b> into two rays, the ordinary or o-ray which follows Snell's law, {{and the other}} extraordinary or e-ray {{which may not be}} co-planar with the incident ray.|$|E

25|$|In a {{birefringent}} material, a wave {{consists of}} two polarization components which generally are governed by different effective refractive indices. The so-called slow ray is the component for which the material has the higher effective refractive index (slower phase velocity), while the fast ray is the one with a lower effective refractive index. When a beam is incident on such a material from air (or any material with a lower refractive index), the slow ray is thus refracted more towards the normal than the fast ray. In the figure {{at the top of}} the page, it can be seen that <b>refracted</b> <b>ray</b> with s polarization in the direction of the optic axis (thus the extraordinary ray) is the slow ray in this case.|$|E
2500|$|The law of {{refraction}} {{says that}} the <b>refracted</b> <b>ray</b> lies in the plane of incidence, and the sine of the angle of refraction divided by the sine of the angle of incidence is a constant: ...|$|E
2500|$|The factor {{multiplying}} [...] is the sine of {{angle of}} the incident ray with the x axis, and the factor multiplying [...] is the sine of {{angle of the}} <b>refracted</b> <b>ray</b> with the x axis. [...] Snell's law for refraction requires that these terms be equal. As this calculation demonstrates, Snell's law is equivalent to vanishing of the first variation of the optical path length.|$|E
50|$|In {{the diagram}} on the right, an {{incident}} light ray, IO, strikes {{the interface between}} two media of refractive indices n1 and n2 at point, O. Part of the ray is reflected as ray, OR, and part <b>refracted</b> as <b>ray,</b> OT. The angles that the incident, reflected and <b>refracted</b> <b>rays</b> make to the normal of the interface are given as θi, θr and θt, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Like Hero, Ptolemy (c. 90-c. 168) {{considered}} the visual rays as proceeding from {{the eye to}} the object seen, but, unlike Hero, considered that the visual rays were not discrete lines, but formed a continuous cone. Ptolemy extended the study of vision beyond direct and reflected vision; he also studied vision by <b>refracted</b> <b>rays</b> (dioptrics), when we see objects through the interface between two media of different density. He conducted experiments to measure the path of vision when we look from air to water, from air to glass, and from water to glass and tabulated {{the relationship between the}} incident and <b>refracted</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|R
30|$|Fundamentally, {{schlieren optics}} {{are able to}} detect changes in the {{refractive}} index n of a medium through which a light beam is passed. If the beam travels in the z-direction, then refractive-index gradients ∂n/∂x and ∂n/∂y <b>refract</b> light <b>rays,</b> but this is normally not visible to the eye. In schlieren optics the light beam is brought to a sharp focus and the <b>refracted</b> <b>rays</b> are detected by applying a spatial filter.|$|R

2500|$|Like Hero, Ptolemy in his Optics (preserved only in {{the form}} of a Latin {{translation}} of a gravely defective Arabic version) considered the visual rays as proceeding from the eye to the object seen, but, unlike Hero, considered that the visual rays were not discrete lines, but formed a continuous cone.

60|$|Much {{after the}} same manner, if ACBD [in Fig. 3.] {{represent}} a Glass spherically convex {{on both sides}} (usually called a Lens, such as is a Burning-glass, or Spectacle-glass, or an Object-glass of a Telescope) and it be required to know how Light falling upon it from any lucid point Q shall be refracted, let QM represent a Ray falling upon any point M of its first spherical Surface ACB, and by erecting a Perpendicular to the Glass at the point M, find the first <b>refracted</b> <b>Ray</b> MN by the Proportion of the Sines 17 to 11. Let that Ray in going out of the Glass be incident upon N, and then find the second <b>refracted</b> <b>Ray</b> Nq by the Proportion of the Sines 11 to 17. And after the same manner may the Refraction be found when the Lens is convex {{on one side and}} plane or concave on the other, or concave on both sides.|$|E
60|$|In like manner, {{if there}} be a Prism of Glass (that is, a Glass bounded with two Equal and Parallel Triangular ends, and three plain and well {{polished}} Sides, which meet in three Parallel Lines running from the three Angles of {{one end to the}} three Angles of the other end) and if the Refraction of the Light in passing cross this Prism be desired: Let ACB [in Fig. 2.] represent a Plane cutting this Prism transversly to its three Parallel lines or edges there where the Light passeth through it, and let DE be the Ray incident upon the first side of the Prism AC where the Light goes into the Glass; and by putting the Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction as 17 to 11 find EF the first <b>refracted</b> <b>Ray.</b> Then taking this Ray for the Incident Ray upon the second side of the Glass BC where the Light goes out, find the next <b>refracted</b> <b>Ray</b> FG by putting the Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction as 11 to 17. For if the Sine of Incidence out of Air into Glass be to the Sine of Refraction as 17 to 11, the Sine of Incidence out of Glass into Air must on the contrary be to the Sine of Refraction as 11 to 17, by the third Axiom.|$|E
40|$|A novel polarized-type phase Doppler {{method is}} {{proposed}} for simultaneous measurements of particle size, velocity and refractive index {{on the basis}} of. the phases of two polarized Doppler beat signals in a single scattering direction.

The particle diameter can be determined from the phase of reflected ray, whereas the particle refractive index can be obtained from the phase ratio of reflected and <b>refracted</b> <b>rays.</b> We carried out numerical computations and experiments to confirm the usefulness of the proposed method for simultaneous measurements of the particle size and refractive index...|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} imaging, {{the geometry}} of image formation is described by the pinhole camera model, and it allows multi view reconstruction based on the perspective projection. If a light ray passes through different media, however, the pinhole camera model becomes invalid due to refraction, causing changes in direction. In this paper, we present a method for 3 D trajectory reconstruction under refraction at a cylindrical surface. In the proposed method, the refractive geometry is represented by a geometric mapping from image points to <b>refracted</b> <b>rays,</b> instead of physically modeling it. 3 D points inside the cylindrical surface are estimated by computing intersection points between segments of corresponding <b>refracted</b> <b>rays</b> in multi view. In our experiments, we demonstrate that 3 D trajectories of multiple moving objects inside a transparent cylinder, which is filled with water, are successfully recovered using multiple cameras...|$|R

60|$|Illustration. In {{the twenty-first}} Figure, ABC {{is the first}} Prism, BC its Base, B and C its equal Angles at the Base, each of 45 Degrees, A its {{rectangular}} Vertex, FM a beam of the Sun's Light let into a dark Room through a hole F one third part of an Inch broad, M its Incidence on the Base of the Prism, MG a less <b>refracted</b> <b>Ray,</b> MH a more <b>refracted</b> <b>Ray,</b> MN the beam of Light reflected from the Base, VXY the second Prism by which this beam in passing through it is refracted, Nt the less refracted Light of this beam, and Np the more refracted part thereof. When the first Prism ABC is turned about its Axis according {{to the order of}} the Letters ABC, the Rays MH emerge more and more obliquely out of that Prism, and at length after their most oblique Emergence are reflected towards N, and going on to p do increase the Number of the Rays Np. Afterwards by continuing the Motion of the first Prism, the Rays MG are also reflected to N and increase the number of the Rays Nt. And therefore the Light MN admits into its Composition, first the more refrangible Rays, and then the less refrangible Rays, and yet after this Composition is of the same Nature with the Sun's immediate Light FM, the Reflexion of the specular Base BC causing no Alteration therein.|$|E
60|$|Suppose therefore, that RS [in Fig. 1.] {{represents}} the Surface of stagnating Water, and that C {{is the point}} of Incidence in which any Ray coming in the Air from A in the Line AC is reflected or refracted, and I would know whither this Ray shall go after Reflexion or Refraction: I erect upon the Surface of the Water from the point of Incidence the Perpendicular CP and produce it downwards to Q, and conclude by the first Axiom, that the Ray after Reflexion and Refraction, shall be found somewhere in the Plane of the Angle of Incidence ACP produced. I let fall therefore upon the Perpendicular CP the Sine of Incidence AD; and if the reflected Ray be desired, I produce AD to B so that DB be equal to AD, and draw CB. For this Line CB shall be the reflected Ray; the Angle of Reflexion BCP and its Sine BD being equal to the Angle and Sine of Incidence, as they ought to be by the second Axiom, But if the <b>refracted</b> <b>Ray</b> be desired, I produce AD to H, so that DH may be to AD as the Sine of Refraction to the Sine of Incidence, that is, (if the Light be red) as 3 to 4; and about the Center C and in the Plane ACP with the Radius CA describing a Circle ABE, I draw a parallel to the Perpendicular CPQ, the Line HE cutting the Circumference in E, and joining CE, this Line CE shall be the Line of the <b>refracted</b> <b>Ray.</b> For if EF be let fall perpendicularly on the Line PQ, this Line EF shall be the Sine of Refraction of the Ray CE, the Angle of Refraction being ECQ; and this Sine EF is equal to DH, and consequently in Proportion to the Sine of Incidence AD as 3 to 4.|$|E
60|$|But to proceed, {{the same}} kind of {{obliquity}} of the Pulses and Rays will happen also when the refraction is made out of a more easie into a more difficult mediu; as by the calculations of GQ & CSR which are refracted from the perpendicular. In both which calculations 'tis obvious to observe, that always that part of the Ray towards which the refraction is made has the end of the orbicular pulse precedent to that of the other side. And always, the oftner the refraction is made the same way, Or the greater the single refraction is, the more is this unequal progress. So that having found this odd propriety to be an inseparable concomitant of a <b>refracted</b> <b>Ray,</b> not streightned by a contrary refraction, we will next examine the refractions of the Sun-beams, as they are suffer'd onely to pass through a small passage, obliquely out of a more difficult, into a more easie medium.|$|E

40|$|The ray buffer {{algorithm}} {{presented here}} {{is part of}} an alternative strategy of ray tracing called breadth first ray tracing. Breadth first ray tracing differs from usual pixel-wise rendering in tracing whole generations of rays together. This means that first all rays of view are treated, next the set of reflecting and <b>refracting</b> <b>rays,</b> then the reflecting and <b>refracting</b> <b>rays</b> caused by them, and so on. The calculation of intersections for a generation of rays uses the ray-z-buffer algorithm. The ray-z-buffer algorithm generalizes the well-known depth buffer algorithm. Like the depth buffer algorithm the ray-zbuffer algorithm allows to render scenes with an unbounded number of primitives. An implementation based on nested adaptive quadtrees is presented. Analysis and measuring show the rendering time increasing sublinearly in the resolution of the image, and increasing linearly in the number of primitives.

60|$|Now, {{these being}} the proprieties {{of every single}} <b>refracted</b> <b>Ray</b> of light, it will be easie enough to {{consider}} what must {{be the result of}} very many such Rays collateral: As if we suppose infinite such Rays interjacent between AKSB and ANOB, which arc the terminating: For in this case the Ray AKSB will have its Red triangle intire, as lying next to the dark or quiet medium, but {{the other side of it}} BS will have no Blue, because the medium adjacent to it SBO, is mov'd or enlightned, and consequently that light does destroy the colour. So likewise will the Ray ANOB lose its Red, because the adjacent medium is mov'd or enlightned, but the other side of the Ray that is adjacent to the dark, namely, AHO will preserve its Blue entire, and these Rays must be so far produc'd as till AN and BR cut each other, before there will be any Green produc'd. From these Proprieties well consider'd, may be deduc'd the reasons of all the Phænomena of the prisme, and of the Globules or drops of Water which conduce to the production of the Rainbow.|$|E

50|$|Specifically, a {{radiation}} mode is one for which where β is the imaginary {{part of the}} axial propagation constant, integer l is the azimuthal index of the mode, n(r) is the refractive index at radius r, a is the core radius, and k is the free-space wave number, k = 2π/λ, where λ is the wavelength.

60|$|So {{then the}} Meaning of this Axiom is, that if Rays fall upon any Plane or Spherical Surface or Lens, and before their Incidence flow from or towards any Point Q, they shall after Reflexion or Refraction flow from or towards the Point q {{found by the}} {{foregoing}} Rules. And if the incident Rays flow from or towards several points Q, the reflected or <b>refracted</b> <b>Rays</b> shall flow from or towards so many other Points q found by the same Rules. Whether the reflected and <b>refracted</b> <b>Rays</b> flow from or towards the Point q is easily known by the situation of that Point. For if that Point {{be on the same}} side of the reflecting or refracting Surface or Lens with the Point Q, and the incident Rays flow from the Point Q, the reflected flow towards the Point q and the refracted from it; and if the incident Rays flow towards Q, the reflected flow from q, and the refracted towards it. And the contrary happens when q is on the other side of the Surface.|$|R
