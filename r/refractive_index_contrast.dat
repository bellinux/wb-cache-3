The <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>contrast</b> of an optical fibre, Δ, is typically given by Δ = (n12- n22)/(2n12), where n1 is the maximum refractive index in the core and n2 is the refractive index of the homogeneous cladding. Normal optical fibers have very low refractive index contrast(Δ<<1)hence are weakly guided medium. The weak guiding will cause more of the Electrical field to [...] "leak" [...] and travel through the cladding(as evanescent waves) as compared to the strongly guided waveguides.|$|E

50|$|Static light {{scattering}} assumes that each detected photon {{has only been}} scattered exactly once. Therefore, analysis according to the calculations stated above will only be correct if the sample has been diluted sufficiently to ensure that photons are not scattered multiple times by the sample before being detected. Accurate interpretation becomes exceedingly difficult for systems with non-negligible contributions from multiple scattering. In many commercial instruments where analysis of the scattering signal is automatically performed, the error may never be noticed by the user. Particularly for larger particles and those with high <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>contrast,</b> this limits the application of standard static {{light scattering}} to very low particle concentrations. On the other hand, for soluble macromolecules that exhibit a relatively low <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>contrast</b> versus the solvent, including most polymers and biomolecules in their respective solvents, multiple scattering is rarely a limiting factor even at concentrations that approach the limits of solubility.|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{the number}} of pairs in a DBR {{increases}} the mirror reflectivity and increasing the <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>contrast</b> between the materials in the Bragg pairs increases both the reflectivity and the bandwidth. A common choice of materials for the stack is titanium dioxide (n≈2.5) and silica (n≈1.5). Substituting into the formula above gives a bandwidth of about 200 nm for 630 nm light.|$|E
50|$|Teem Photonics used an ion-exchange {{process to}} produce a channel {{waveguide}} in a rare-earth doped phosphate glass. Resulting waveguides were typically single-mode waveguides, which could be easily integrated with other fiber-optic components. In addition, several different elements could be integrated in one circuit, including gain blocks, couplers, splitters and others. However, due to a relatively low <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>contrast</b> between the core and the cladding in these waveguides, the selection of optical elements that can be produced on such a platform was rather limited and the resulting circuit size tended to be large, i.e. comparable to then available fiber-optic counterparts.|$|E

The bandgap closes completely with a disorder strength as small as under two percent of the lattice constant. This fragility persists even at very high <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>contrasts</b> and is attributed {{to the creation of a}} bandgap at high frequency bands (8 - 9 bands) in inverse-opal crystals.

50|$|Dynamic light {{scattering}} provides {{insight into the}} dynamic properties of soft materials by measuring single scattering events, meaning that each detected photon has been scattered by the sample exactly once. However, the application to many systems of scientific and industrial relevance has been limited due to often-encountered multiple scattering, wherein photons are scattered multiple times by the sample before being detected. Accurate interpretation becomes exceedingly difficult for systems with nonnegligible contributions from multiple scattering. Especially for larger particles and those with high <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>contrast,</b> this limits the technique to very low particle concentrations, and a large variety of systems are, therefore, excluded from investigations with dynamic {{light scattering}}. However, as shown by Schaetzel, {{it is possible to}} suppress multiple scattering in dynamic light scattering experiments via a cross-correlation approach. The general idea is to isolate singly scattered light and suppress undesired contributions from multiple scattering in a dynamic light scattering experiment. Different implementations of cross-correlation light scattering have been developed and applied. Currently, the most widely used scheme is the so-called 3D-dynamic light scattering method. The same method {{can also be used to}} correct static light scattering data for multiple scattering contributions. Alternatively, in the limit of strong multiple scattering, a variant of dynamic light scattering called diffusing-wave spectroscopy can be applied.|$|E
5000|$|Photonic crystal fibers can {{be divided}} into two modes of operation, {{according}} to their mechanism for confinement. Those with a solid core, or a core with a higher average index than the microstructured cladding, can operate on the same index-guiding principle as conventional optical fiber — however, they can have a much higher effective- <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>contrast</b> between core and cladding, and therefore can have much stronger confinement for applications in nonlinear optical devices, polarization-maintaining fibers, (or they can also be made with much lower effective index contrast). Alternatively, one can create a [...] "photonic bandgap" [...] fiber, in which the light is confined by a photonic bandgap created by the microstructured cladding - such a bandgap, properly designed, can confine light in a lower-index core and even a hollow (air) core. Bandgap fibers with hollow cores can potentially circumvent limits imposed by available materials, for example to create fibers that guide light in wavelengths for which transparent materials are not available (because the light is primarily in the air, not in the solid materials). Another potential advantage of a hollow core is that one can dynamically introduce materials into the core, such as a gas that is to be analyzed for the presence of some substance. PCF can also be modified by coating the holes with sol-gels of similar or different index material to enhance its transmittance of light.|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{have argued}} {{for many years}} {{that one of the}} {{conditions}} for omnidirectional reflection in a one-dimensional photonic crystal is a strong <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>contrast</b> between the two constituent dielectric materials. Using numerical simulations and the theory of Anderson localization of light, in this work we demonstrate that an omnidirectional band gap can indeed be created utilizing low <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>contrast</b> materials when they are arranged in a disordered manner. Moreover, the size of the omnidirectional band gap becomes a controllable parameter, which now depends on the number of layers and not only on the <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>contrast</b> of the system, as it is widely accepted. This achievement constitutes a major breakthrough in the field since it allows for the development of cheaper and more efficient technologies. Of particular interest is the case of high index contrast one-dimensional photonic crystal fibers, where the propagation losses are mainly due to increased optical scattering from sidewall roughness at the interfaces of high index contrast materials. By using low index contrast materials these losses can be reduced dramatically, while maintaining the confinement capability of the waveguide.

We analyze two different semiconductor waveguide geometries and find that the factorization works reasonably well within large wavelength windows. This allows us to utilize the pulse propagation equation for the description of a broadband signal evolution. We study the mechanism of modulational instability induced by the dispersion of nonlinearity and find that the power threshold predicted by the simple model with three interacting harmonics is effectively removed when using pulses, while the efficiency of this process grows for shorter pulse durations. Also, we identify the effects of geometrical and material dispersion of nonlinearity on spectral broadening of short pulses in semiconductor waveguides...|$|R
