25|$|The {{arrays of}} {{airfoils}} {{are set in}} rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or rotors, accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as stators or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage. Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial Mach number. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as {{variable inlet guide vanes}} and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one <b>rotating</b> <b>assembly</b> (known as twin spools, for example).|$|E
2500|$|The center hub <b>rotating</b> <b>assembly</b> (CHRA) {{houses the}} shaft {{that connects the}} {{compressor}} impeller and turbine. It also must contain a bearing system to suspend the shaft, allowing it to rotate at very high speed with minimal friction. For instance, in automotive applications the CHRA typically uses a thrust bearing or ball bearing lubricated by a constant supply of pressurized engine oil. The CHRA may also be considered [...] "water-cooled" [...] by having an entry and exit point for engine coolant. Water-cooled models use engine coolant to keep lubricating oil cooler, avoiding possible oil coking (destructive distillation of engine oil) from the extreme heat in the turbine. The development of air-foil bearings removed this risk.|$|E

In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to simulate data from typical BTT tests of <b>rotating</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The simulator is then used in order to provide a qualitative analysis of several phenomena that can be associated with the synchronous vibrations of <b>rotating</b> <b>assemblies,</b> including mistuning, coupling, excitation at multiple Engine Orders and simultaneous synchronous and asynchronous responses.

2500|$|Achieving {{stability}} of an inverted pendulum {{has become a}} common engineering challenge for researchers. There are different variations of the inverted pendulum on a cart ranging from a rod on a cart to a multiple segmented inverted pendulum on a cart. Another variation places the inverted pendulum's rod or segmented rod {{on the end of}} a <b>rotating</b> <b>assembly.</b> In both, (the cart and rotating system) the inverted pendulum can only fall in a plane. The inverted pendulums in these projects can either be required to only maintain balance after an equilibrium position is achieved or be able to achieve equilibrium by itself. Another platform is a two-wheeled balancing inverted pendulum. The two wheeled platform has the ability to spin on the spot offering a great deal of maneuverability. Yet another variation balances on a single point. [...] A spinning top, a unicycle, or an inverted pendulum atop a spherical ball all balance on a single point. As derived above the inverted pendulum can also be achieved by having a vertically oscillating base.|$|E

5000|$|Mechanics {{purchase}} a shortblock as a quicker way to rebuild an engine—avoiding {{the work and}} time of rebuilding and assembling the shortblock components. Companies that provide short blocks may also offer performance improving engine work. Machine shop work can increase performance by boring out the engine to increase cylinder diameter (which increases internal volume), balancing <b>rotating</b> <b>assemblies</b> (such as the crankshaft), installing a higher performance camshaft, etc. Bored-out engines require larger pistons and new piston rings. This kind of work {{can be done by}} amateurs ("shade tree mechanics") or by professional machine shops and engine rebuilders.|$|R
50|$|Because {{few have}} the {{capability}} to actually blueprint, and because of the monetary incentive of claiming one has performed the work, many people have come to believe blueprinting only means that all the specifications are double-checked. Serious efforts at blueprinting result in better-than-factory tolerances, possibly with custom specifications appropriate for the application. Common goals include engine re-manufacturing to achieve the rated power for its manufacturer's design (because not all mass-production engines put out the rated power), and to rebuild the engine to make more power from a given design than otherwise intended (because custom engines can often be redesigned to different specifications). Blueprinted components allow for a more exact balancing of reciprocating parts and <b>rotating</b> <b>assemblies</b> so that less power is lost through excessive engine vibrations and other mechanical inefficiencies.|$|R

50|$|The 3.2L DOHC V6 engine {{received}} {{special attention}} as well. Each NSX-R engine was hand assembled by a skilled technician using techniques normally reserved for racing programs. Components of the <b>rotating</b> <b>assembly</b> (pistons, rods and crank) were precision weighed and matched {{so that all}} components fell within a very small tolerance of weight differential. Then, the entire <b>rotating</b> <b>assembly</b> was balanced {{to a level of}} accuracy ten times that of a typical NSX engine. This balancing and blueprinting process significantly reduced parasitic loss of power due to inertial imbalance, resulting in a more powerful, free-revving powerplant with excellent throttle response. Officially, Honda maintains that the power output of the Second-Gen NSX-R engine is , which is identical to the stock NSX. The automotive press, however, has long speculated that the true output of the engine is higher.|$|E

50|$|The Toyota MZ {{engine family}} is a V6 piston engine series. The MZ series has an {{aluminium}} engine block and aluminium alloy DOHC cylinder heads. The cylinders are lined with cast iron, and is of a closed deck design (no open space between the bores). The engine is a 60 degree V6 design. It uses multiport fuel injection (MFI), four valves per cylinder, a one-piece cast camshaft and a cast aluminium intake manifold. The MZ {{family is a}} lightweight V6 engine of an all-aluminium design, using lighter weight parts than the heavier duty VZ block engines {{in an effort to}} lower production costs, decrease engine weight, and decrease reciprocating weight without sacrificing reliability. Toyota sought to enhance the drivability pattern of the engine (over the 3VZ) at exactly 3000 rpm, since that was the typical engine speed for motors cruising on the highway. The result was less cylinder distortion coupled with the decreased weight of <b>rotating</b> <b>assemblies,</b> smoother operation at that engine speed, and increased engine efficiency.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{drawback}} to the revolving cylinder, {{axial piston engine}} design is that <b>rotating</b> piston <b>assemblies</b> are subjected to centrifugal forces, which can result in significant friction losses.

40|$|The {{components}} of most structural and mechanical systems exhibit considerable variations or uncertainties in their properties {{and the performance}} characteristics of such systems are subject to uncertainties. In {{the case of a}} rotor bearing system, the nonlinear bearing restoring force is usually represented as a third or fourth power of displacement or as a piecewise linear function of displacement. The coefficients of these models are acquired from experiments and approximations, and will vary considerably during the operation of the bearing. Hence it is more reasonable to treat them as uncertain values. Other bearing parameters such as the inertial properties of concentrated disks, distributed mass and damping of the <b>rotating</b> <b>assemblies</b> are also uncertain due to manufacturing and assembly errors and imprecise operating conditions. It is known that the vibration response of a rotor is highly sensitive to small fluctuations or variations in the bearing parameters. Therefore, any realistic analysis and design of rotor-bearing systems must take the uncertainties into account.
