50|$|In 1872, epaulettes were {{abolished}} for {{officers and}} replaced by <b>shoulder</b> <b>knots.</b> As the <b>shoulder</b> <b>knots</b> had no fringe, it was necessary that some change in the insignia on the dress uniform be made in order to distinguish the major from the second lieutenant. It was natural to use the gold leaf which the major had been wearing on the shoulder strap. In the same year, the bars on the shoulder straps of the captains and first lieutenants were changed from gold to silver.|$|R

5000|$|The {{office of}} the Venezuelan {{military}} supreme commander in chief has always been held by the President of Venezuela as per constitutional requirements. However, with the new law sanctioned in 2008, the [...] "Comandante en Jefe" [...] rank {{is not only a}} function attributed to the executive branch but a full military rank given to the president upon taking office. Upon assumption he receives a saber, epaulette, <b>shoulder</b> <b>knot,</b> <b>shoulder</b> board and sleeve insignia and full military uniform to be used in military events while performing the duties as president. The shoulder insignia mirrors Cuban practice but is derived from the German-styled officer rank insignia.|$|R
50|$|Anne McCaffrey uses {{clothing}} insignia {{throughout the}} Pern Chronicles to identify role and rank of different individuals. In {{the stories of}} the Ninth Pass, these ensignia include general colours, such as harper blue, and accessories described as <b>shoulder</b> <b>knots.</b> The colour and pattern of knots denotes geographical affiliation, Craft and rank, such as apprentice, journeyman, or Master. Amongst the sailing members of Pern society, such knots can also indicate the rank of Captain.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the period}} 1919-45, German Army uniforms were {{known for a}} four cord braided [...] "figure-of-eight" [...] {{decoration}} which acted as a shoulder board for senior and general officers. This was called a [...] "shoulder knot" [...] and was in silver with the specialty color piping (for field officers) and silver with red border (for generals). Although it was once seen on US Army uniforms, it remains only in the mess uniform, while a similar form {{was used in the}} British Army and its retained by the Household Cavalry today, boards of a similar type are used by the Republic of Korea Army's general officers. This type is still used in the present-day armies of Venezuela, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Ecuador and Bolivia; all of which formerly wore uniforms closely following the Imperial German model. Only the Chilean Army sports them in these uniforms in its ceremonial units, the Military Academy and the NCO School while the 5th Cavalry Regiment [...] "Aca Caraya" [...] of the Paraguayan Army sports both epaulettes and <b>shoulder</b> <b>knots</b> in its dress uniforms (save for a platoon wearing Chaco War uniforms). Epaulettes of the German pattern (as well as <b>shoulder</b> <b>knots)</b> are used by officers of ceremonial units and schools of the Bolivian Army.|$|R
50|$|In December 1869, the {{governor}} commissioned Paul Foelsche, a Corporal in the SA Mounted Police stationed at Strathalbyn, {{to be the}} first sub-inspector of police at Palmerston. He sailed for Darwin soon afterwards. The police uniform then worn in the Territory was the same as that worn in South Australia. It consisted of a short cut-away blue serge tunic with nine regulation buttons, silver twisted cord <b>shoulder</b> <b>knots,</b> black braid on the sleeves and silver chevrons for non-commissioned officers. The riding breeches were dark blue corkscrew serge with a white stripe.|$|R

50|$|In his tomb, Khabawsokar is {{depicted}} once as a sitting {{man in a}} tight gown, reaching out for an offering table full of bread (or cake). A jamb of a false door depicts him twice, each time looking into converse direction. His pose makes him look like {{stepping out of the}} door. On both of the jambs his real ("great") name and his nickname are spelled. Khabawsokar wears a fine curled wig, a heavy and finely ornamented gold collar and a belt with a golden lion head as a belt buckle. His kilt is made of leopard fur and his <b>shoulder</b> <b>knots</b> are jackal-shaped.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1902 the Regiment wore a dragoon style {{uniform of}} dark blue with red facings, {{which had not}} altered a great deal since its {{establishment}} in 1848. A silver spiked helmet with black plumes was worn by all ranks in full dress. Following the Boer War khaki was introduced for home service but the full dress uniform described above was retained for wear by officers in review order, {{with the addition of}} a gold lace covered shoulder and waist belt, gold cord <b>shoulder</b> <b>knots</b> and gold trouser stripes. Other ranks wore a simpler dark bue uniform with peaked cap, chain shoulder-straps, red collar and trouser stripes for walking out dress.|$|R
5000|$|On the Full Dress Uniforms, Cadet Officers wear rank {{insignia}} {{as on the}} [...] "School Uniform", {{except that}} the Cadet 1st Captain wears braided <b>shoulder</b> <b>knots</b> with a full dress aiguillette in recognition of {{his role as the}} Corps Cadet Regimental Commander. Cadet Sergeants, Corporals and Lance Corporals wear chevrons on the sleeve: red chevrons on grey for the infantry battalions; red chevrons on black for the mounted battalion. All cadet officers' shoulder boards are dark blue save for the artillery unit which from 2012 now wears red shoulder boards after a long absence of their use. The full dress headdress is the Academy Capshield with the VFMAC institutional arms on it, worn on all full dress uniforms since 1980 replacing a similar shako styled cap with the arms. The institutional full dress is gray blue with black pants (for the Academy) and from 2009, all black polo and pants for the College.|$|R

5000|$|During the 18th century corporals might {{indicate}} their ranks with a <b>shoulder</b> <b>knot</b> and, later, an epaulette. Sergeants had clothing that was of slightly better quality, wore a sash, and had lace trim on their hats and uniforms. [...] The chevrons worn by many non-commissioned officers {{are based on}} heraldic devices and their current use for NCOs originates {{from the time of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1802. As today, sergeants wore three chevrons, point downwards, on the upper arm, and corporals wore two, with sergeant-majors and quarter-master-sergeants then having four. Lance corporal, at the time not a rank but an appointment historically known as chosen man and carrying extra pay for privates holding it, were given a single chevron a few years later, and later in the century the lance-sergeant appeared, wearing three chevrons. The infantry rank of colour sergeant was created in 1813 as a reward for senior sergeants with one allowed per company. He was allowed to wear a badge consisting of a regimental colour supported by two crossed swords.|$|R

She is dressed in a tight gown which is knotted together above her left <b>shoulder,</b> the <b>knot</b> is made of a lanyard in shape of the Tijt-knot. The lady also wears a delicate pearl necklace. Shepset-ipet looks to the right and reaches out for some sort of bread or cake on a offering table. The right half of the stela is decorated with the common arrangement of offering foods. The spot where Shepset-ipet's name was encarved shows traces of revisions, thus the stela was possibly once created for another person.|$|R
5000|$|In 1618, a poet from London, John Taylor {{described}} the costume of Scottish aristocrats, lairds, and their followers and servants, dressed for hunting at Braemar.

This included tartan stockings and jerkins, with garters of twisted straw, and a finer plaid mantle round their <b>shoulders.</b> They had <b>knotted</b> handkerchiefs at their necks and wore blue caps.

6000|$|... [p.139] point,—we donned the attire, {{which is}} nothing but two new cotton cloths, each six feet long by {{three and a half}} broad, white, with narrow red stripes and fringes: in fact, the costume called Al-Eddeh, in the baths at Cairo.[FN#17] One of these sheets, {{technically}} termed the Rida, is thrown over the back, and, exposing the arm and <b>shoulder,</b> is <b>knotted</b> at the right side in the style Wishah. The Izar is wrapped round the loins from waist to knee, and, knotted or tucked in at the middle, supports itself. Our heads were bare, and nothing was allowed upon the instep.[FN#18] It is said that some clans of Arabs still preserve this religious but most uncomfortable costume; it is doubtless of ancient date, and to this day, in the regions lying west of the Red Sea, it continues to be the common dress of the people.|$|R
40|$|Saree is a common, {{traditional}} garment of Indian women, {{wrapped around}} the waist tightened by a thick cord and with one end draped over the <b>shoulder.</b> Tight <b>knot</b> in the same place, sweat, soiling and continuous use can cause pigmentation, scaling of the waist and even transform to malignancy. We present here a case of saree cancer successfully managed with multimodality therapy. A 50 -year-old woman was referred to our hospital (India) for itching and non-healing ulcerative lesion on waistline. She was wearing saree continuously for 34 years with knot at the same place. Magnetic resonance images suggested ulcerative growth with lymph node metastasis. She then underwent wide local excision; histopathological examination confirmed it was a squamous cell carcinoma. She therefore received concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She is now (2 years {{after the completion of}} treatment) in remission state. Awareness of saree cancer among Indian is important to avoid malignant lesions at waistline. Multimodality management with surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy is ideal mean for good outcome...|$|R
25|$|Besides {{the fact}} that ragwort is very {{attractive}} to such {{a vast array of}} insects, some of these are very rare indeed. Of the 30 species that specifically feed on ragwort alone, seven are officially deemed Nationally Scarce. A further three species are on the IUCN Red List. In short, ragwort is an exclusive food source for ten rare or threatened insect species, including the Cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae), the Picture Winged Fly (Campiglossa malaris), the Scarce Clouded <b>Knot</b> Horn <b>moth</b> (Homoeosoma nimbella), and the Sussex Emerald moth (Thalera fimbrialis). The Sussex Emerald has been labelled a Priority Species in the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan. A Priority Species is one which is scarce, threatened and declining The remainder of the ten threatened species include three species of Leaf Beetle, another Picture-Winged Fly, and three micro moths. All of these species are Nationally Scarce B, with one Leaf Beetle categorised as Nationally Scarce A.|$|R
50|$|Another {{technique}} {{is to put}} a rope around the torso just above the breasts, and another one just below them, then push the ropes together to squeeze the breasts from the top and bottom.

A rope can also be passed over the shoulders and between the breasts, drawing the rope {{above and below the}} breasts together, then pass back over the <b>shoulders</b> to the <b>knots</b> at the back.

Catching sight of her reflection in a mirror, she glanced at herself with a slight smile of recognition, {{as if she were}} an old friend to herself. Her face was oval and calm, her nose a little arched. Her neck made a beautiful line down to her <b>shoulder.</b> With hair <b>knotted</b> loosely behind, she had something of a warm, maternal look. Thinking this of herself, she arched her eyebrows and her rather heavy eyelids, with a little flicker of a smile, and for a moment her grey eyes looked amused and wicked, a little sardonic, out of her transfigured Madonna face.|$|R

60|$|There {{is a third}} {{cross-road}} {{where the}} track from Boldre runs down to the old fishing village of Pitt's Deep. Down this, as they came abreast of it, there walked two men, the one a pace or two behind the other. The cavaliers could not but pull up their horses to look at them, for a stranger pair were never seen journeying together. The first was a misshapen, squalid man with cruel, cunning eyes and a shock of tangled red hair, bearing in his hands a small unpainted cross, which he held high so that all men might see it. He {{seemed to be in}} the last extremity of fright, with a face the color of clay and his limbs all ashake as one who hath an ague. Behind him, with his toe ever rasping upon the other's heels, there walked a very stern, black-bearded man with a hard eye and a set mouth. He bore over his <b>shoulder</b> a great <b>knotted</b> stick with three jagged nails stuck in the head of it, {{and from time to time}} he whirled it up in the air with a quivering arm, as though he could scarce hold back from dashing his companion's brains out. So in silence they walked under the spread of the branches on the grass-grown path from Boldre.|$|R
