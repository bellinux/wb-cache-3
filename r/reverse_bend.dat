40|$|Purpose: In {{the present}} study, the {{deformation}} {{mechanics of the}} springback phenomenon in the L-bending ofsheet-metal was examined and a new method that could efficiently reduce springback in the L-bending of sheetmetalwas proposed. Design/methodology/approach: Both the finite element analysis and experiments were performed to analyzethe deformation mechanics {{and the effects of}} process parameters on the formation of springback. Findings: The axial stress distribution in the bent sheet obtained by the finite element simulations was classifiedinto three zones: the bending zone under the punch corner (zone I), unbending zone next to the bending zone(zone II), and the stress-free zone (zone III). It is found that the stress distribution in zone I is quite uniformand hence has little influence on the springback. While the stress distribution in zone II results in a positivespringback, whereas the stress distribution in zone III produces a negative springback. The total springbacktherefore depends on the combined effect of those produced by zone II and zone III. A <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> approachthat can efficiently reduce springback was also proposed to reduce the springback in the L-bending process. Thefinite element analysis performed {{in the present study was}} validated by experiments as well. Research limitations/implications: Although the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> approach can reduce springback efficiently, itmay cause uneven surface at the die corner area. Hence, the use of <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> approach must be cautious ifhigh surface quality is required. Practical implications: The proposed <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> approach provides the die design engineer with a novel ideato reduce the springback occurred in the L-bending of sheet metals.

40|$|Flagellar bending was {{analysed}} using {{photographs of}} hyperactivated hamster and mouse spermatozoa. The flagellar waveform consists of several bends; {{the centre of}} each bend was therefore located on the flagellum, and {{the angle of the}} bend measured. The direction of the bend was determined by using the asymmetry of hook-shaped head to assess the asymmetry of flagellar waveform. The bend that occurred {{in the same direction as}} the curve of head was defined as the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> and the bend in the opposite direction as the principal bend. In hamster spermatozoa, flagellar bending was asymmetric to the direction of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> after incubation for 5 min. After incubation for 4 h the asymmetry had increased, as the angles of the reverse bends had increased in all regions of the flagellum but the principal bend had not. In mouse spermatozoa incubated for 5 min, flagellar bending was relatively symmetric. In the hyperactivated mouse spermatozoa incubated for 3 h, the angle of the principal bend increased in the distal region and those of the reverse bends increased in almost all regions of the flagellum. Since the increase in the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> was relatively high, flagellar bending became asymmetric to the direction of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> as in hamster spermatozoa. These increases in asymmetry were also evident in the measure-ment of the total changes in angular direction between the proximal and distal end of flagella in both species. The increase in asymmetry could provide an explanation for the changes in the motility patterns seen in spermatozoa after the onset of hyperactivation. The mechanism of hyperactivation is discussed in relation to the changes in flagellar bending pattern...|$|E
40|$|Asymmetrical bending waves can be {{obtained}} by reactivating demembranated sea urchin spermatozoa at high Ca " concentrations. Moving-film flash photography shows that asymmetrical flagellar bending waves are associated with premature termination of the growth of the bends in one direction (the reverse bends) while the bends in the opposite direction (the principal bends) grow for. one full beat cycle, and with unequal rates of growth of principal and reverse bends. The relative proportions of these two components of asymmetry are highly variable. The increased angle in the principal bend is compensated by a decreased angle in the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend,</b> so that there is no change in mean bend angle; the wavelength and beat frequency are also independent of the degree of asymmetry. This new information is still insufficient to identify a particular mechanism for Ca 21 -induced asymmetry.

While most examples of the K-turn have a similar fold, the crystal structure of the Azoarcus group I intron revealed a novel RNA conformation, a reverse kink turn bent in the direction opposite that of a consensus K-turn. The reverse K-turn is bent toward the major grooves rather than the minor grooves of the flanking helices, yet the sequence differs from the K-turn consensus by only a single nucleotide. Here we demonstrate that the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> direction is not solely defined by internal sequence elements, but is instead affected by structural elements external to the K-turn. It bends toward the major groove {{under the direction of}} a tetraloop–tetraloop receptor. The ability of one sequence to form two distinct structures demonstrates the inherent plasticity of the K-turn sequence.

In this study, multi-stage EMF is introduced to form a panel with stiffened grid ribs. The forming rules of the stiffened panel is revealed via analyzing the distribution and evolution of the simulated stress and strain in the ribs and web, where the grid-rib panels were decomposed as the flat panel and two panels with uni-directional ribs (ribs only in X direction or Y direction). It is shown that the forming depth is mainly attributed to the forces on the web, although electromagnetic force is applied on both the ribs and the web, especially, large force on the ribs. The ribs are subjected to uniaxial stress parallel to their directions, and the web is subjected to plane stress in the deformation region.

40|$|Immotile hamster {{spermatozoa}} {{from the}} caudal epididymis were activated in physiological medium at a temperature range between 22 and 40 °C. With rising temperature, the sperm swim-ming velocity and flagellar beat frequency increased, but the flagellar bend angles and waveforms {{did not change}} dramati-cally. All spermatozoa exhibited a symmetric and progressive movement at this temperature range. Hyperactivation was in-duced by incubating activated spermatozoa in vitro at 370 C for 3. 5 h under 5 % CO 2 in air. When examined at 370 C, sperma-tozoa expressed a hyperactivated motility characterized by asymmetric and circular flagellar beating with large principal and reverse bends. When the temperature was lowered to 330 C, the sperm motility pattern characteristic of hyperactivation be-came less prominent. In particular, the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> originating in the flagellar middle piece did not propagate to the principal piece. However, normal hyperactivated movement was restored as the temperature was raised to 370 C, indicating that in vitro expression of hyperactivated motility of hamster spermatozoa is a temperature-dependent phenomenon. To further investigate temperature effects on the flagellar motor apparatus, sperma-tozoa were demembranated and then reactivated with ATP. In contrast to membrane-intact hyperactivated spermatozoa, de-membranated spermatozoa exhibited a hyperactivation-like mo-tility independent of the temperature range tested (22 - 40 °C). This strongly suggests that temperature regulates initiation and maintenance of hyperactivated motility and that its effect is me-diated by the plasma membrane...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{principle}} possibility of stripping extraction {{in combination with}} reverse bends in isochronous separate sector cyclotrons (and/or FFAGs). If one uses reverse bends between the sectors (instead of drifts) and places stripper foils at the sector exit edges, the stripped beam has a reduced bending radius {{and it should be}} able to leave the cyclotron within the range of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> - even if the beam is stripped at less than full energy. We are especially interested in $H_ 2 ^+$-cyclotrons, which allow to double the charge to mass ratio by stripping. However the principle could be applied to other ions or ionized molecules as well. For the production of proton beams by stripping extraction of an $H_ 2 ^+$-beam, we discuss possible designs for three types of machines: First a low-energy cyclotron for the simultaneous production of several beams at multiple energies - for instance 15 MeV, 30 MeV and 70 MeV - thus allowing to have beam on several isotope production targets. In this case it is desired to have a strong energy dependence of the direction of the extracted beam thus allowing to run multiple target stations simultaneously. Second we consider a fast variable energy proton machine for cancer therapy that should allow extraction (of the complete beam) at all energies in the range of about 70 MeV to about 250 MeV into the same beam line. And third, we consider a high intensity high energy machine, where the main design goals are extraction with low losses, low activation of components and high reliability. The price that has to be paid for these advantages is an increase in size and/or in field strength compared to proton machines with standard extraction at the final energy.

A {{new design}} of the conical rotary- and film {{apparatus}} for carrying out the process of dripping phosphatidic emulsion of vegetable oils, which {{are used in the}} oil industry and other industries that use the evaporation of moisture from the high-heat-labile concentrates.

The conical rotary film apparatus perforated inner cavity of the rotor is divided into a supply and distribution of the original product and vapor removal zone with a barrier that hosts spheroconical insert shapes with <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> the conical portion, the top of which is directed towards the delivery of the original product. In the area of supply and distribution of starting material the perforations of the rotor have a slit shape.

The nozzle for inputting of starting mate-rial having tangentially formed holes on both ends is rotatably mounted in {{the central part of the}} conical body along its axis, one end of which is placed in the interior of the perforated rotor in the feeding zone and the distribution of the starting material, and the other one is placed in the chamber for a starting material, which is connected in series with the heater and the feeding pump for starting material.

This new information is still insufficient to identify a particular mechanism for Ca 21 -induced asymmetry. When a developing bend stops growing before initiation of growth of a new bend in the same direction, a modification of the sliding between tubules in the distal portion of the flagellum is required. This modification can be described as a superposition of synchronous sliding on the metachronous sliding associated with propagating bending waves. Synchronous sliding is particularly evident in highly asymmetrical flagella, but is probably not the cause of asymmetry. The control of metachronous sliding appears to be unaffected by the superposition of synchronous sliding.

40|$|The {{transfer}} line {{that will serve}} to transport 8 GeV protons from the Booster to the new Fermilab Main Injector has been built using permanent magnets. A total of 46 horizontal bend dipoles and 5 vertical bend dipoles were built for this beamline; 67 gradient magnets [1] were also built. The magnets were built using magnetized strontium ferrite bricks. Thermal compensation of these bricks was effected by use of a nickel-iron alloy. The dipole magnets were built with a mean integrated strength of 0. 56954 T-m, and an rms spread of 0. 06 %. The magnets were thermally cycled from 20 °C to 0 °C to condition the ferrite against irreversible thermal losses, and the compensation was measured with a flipcoil. The magnet strength was adjusted by varying the number of bricks installed at the magnet ends. Details of the assembly process and a summary of magnetic measurements are presented here. 1 THE 8 GEV TRANSFER LINE The design of the Fermilab Main Injector (FMI) calls for protons to be extracted from the existing Boster at 8 GeV and transported 756 m for injection into the FMI [1].

The U-bending {{process is}} a common sheet-metal forming process widely {{employed}} to fabricate sheet parts like channels, beams, and frames of various sizes applied in almost all industrial fields. In recent years, the precision requirements are increased on the U-bent parts. To achieve these requirements, in this study, the effects of part geometry on the spring-back/spring-go feature including work piece length, U-channel width, punch and die radii, and work piece thickness, were investigated by using the finite element method (FEM) and laboratory experiments. The FEM simulation results clearly revealed the influence of part geometry on spring-back/spring-go feature via the changes of stress distribution analyses on the bending allowance zone, the bottom of bent part, and the U-leg of bent part. Specifically, the part geometry affected on the bending characteristic on the bending allowance zone, {{as well as it}} affected on the spring-back feature.

Addition of 0. 1 [...] 0. 2 mM free Ca 2 + to these reactivated sperm induces 70 [...] 95 % of them to become quiescent. This quiescence can be reversed by reduction of the free Ca 2 % concentration with EGTA, or by dilution to reduce the MgATP 2 - concentration below 0. 3 mM. The quiescent waveform is characterized by a sharp principal bend of approximately 5. 6 rad in the proximal region of the flagellum, a slight <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> in the midregion that averages approximately 0. 3 rad, and a principal bend of approximately 1. 1 rad in the tip. The quiescent sperm are highly fragile mechanically, and disruption, including microtubule sliding, occurs spontaneously at a slow rate upon standing or immediately upon gentle agitation. Mild digestion by trypsin causes a gradual appearance of normal, symmetrical flagellar beating. Addition of increasing concentrations of vanadate to quiescent sperm causes a graded decrease in the proximal bend angle, with 50 micrometers vanadate reducing it to approximately 2. 6 rad. In the presence of 0. 1 mM free Ca 2 % and 10 micrometers vanadate, a characteristic, crescented stationary bend is induced in the demembranated sperm, without intermediate oscillatory beating, by the addition of either 0. 1 or 1 mM ATP. In the absence of vanadate, these two concentrations of ATP produce asymmetric beating and quiescence, respectively. The results support the hypothesis that quiescence in live sperm is induced by an elevated concentration of intracellular Ca 2 %. In addition, they demonstrate that bending can occur in flagella in which oscillatory beating is inhibited and emphasize the close relationship between asymmetric beating and quiescence...|$|E

After refining to an R of 0. 194, we explored the conformation of the FMN binding site by real space refinement versus maps with Fourier coefficients of the form (2 |Fo|- |Fc|) exp (i[alpha]c). To minimize bias in the fitting, groups of atoms were systematically omitted from the structure factors used in computation of the (2 |Fo - |Fc|) maps. One-electron reduction of oxidized flavodoxin is accompanied by several changes at the FMN binding site: the conformation of residues in the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> formed by Met 56 -Gly 57 -Asp 58 -Glu 59 differs in the crystal structures of the oxidized and semiquinone species; further, backbone atoms in residues 55 and 89 shift by more than 0. 5 A and the indole ring of Trp 90 undergoes a significant displacement. The orientation of the peptide unit connecting Gly 57 and Asp 58 is consistent with the presence of a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Gly 57 and the flavin N(5) in flavodoxin semiquinone. No equivalent bond is found in oxidized flavodoxin. In both the oxidized and semiquinone species of clostridial flavodoxin, the isoalloxazine ring is essentially planar : the bending angles about N(5) [...] -N(10) are ~ 2. 5 [deg] for the semiquinone structure and ~ 0 [deg] in oxidized flavodoxin. The intensity changes resulting from the oxidized agsemiquinone conversion (RI = 0. 33) arise in part from changes in molecular packing. Intermolecular contacts, including neighbors of the prosthetic group, are altered in the repacking. Maps or models of the two oxidation states can be brought into approximate coincidence by a rigid body motion. The required transformation, determined for the isomorphous replacement maps by the method of Cox (1967), is equivalent to a screw motion with a rotation of 1. 18 [deg] and a translation of - 0. 34 A.

The principal and <b>reverse</b> <b>bends</b> thus exhibited different sensitivities to pH, which suggests differences in the mechanisms that produce them. Straight flagella began to move by synchronous sliding all along the flagellum, thus forming principal bends. Flagella that contained a basal bend began to move by primarily metachronous sliding within that bend...|$|R

The obtained results are compared {{with the results of}} experimental studies implemented by Bretherton et al. [2] with the overall objective to identify fatigue strength reduction factors (FSRF) of austenitic weldments for further design application. These studies included a series of strain-controlled tests at 550 °C with different combinations of <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> moment and dwell time Δt. Five levels of <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> moment histories corresponding to defined values of total strain range Δεtot in remote parent material (1 %, 0. 6 %, 0. 4 %, 0. 3 %, 0. 25 %) were used in combination with three variants of creep-fatigue conditions: pure fatigue, 1 hour and 5 hours of dwell period Δt of hold in tension. An overview of previous works devoted to analysis and simulation of these experiments [2] and highlight of the LMM development progress could be found in [3]...|$|R
40|$|The coined-bead {{technique}} is commonly {{applied in the}} V-bending process to eliminate the spring-back feature and to achieve the required bending angle. In the present research, {{which is based on}} a stress distribution analysis, the effects of a coined-bead geometry in the V-bending process on the increased compressive stress in the bending allowance zone and on the increased <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> zone in the leg of the workpiece were observed and characterized. The research also illustrated the variations in spring-back and spring-go characteristics for different coined-bead widths and heights. As the bead width increased, the spring-go decreased, increased, and decreased again for different simulated bead heights and workpiece materials. The research was able to disprove previously suggested theories for coined-beaded V-bending, which suggested that a smaller bead width should be applied to cancel out the spring-back characteristic. In addition, the spring-back characteristic returned when an oversized bead width was applied. Therefore, to achieve the required bending angle, the size of the bead width was optimized both to provide a balance between a favorable stress distribution in the <b>bending</b> zone and <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> zone and to reduce the bending load...|$|R
40|$|A revised {{approach}} {{to the design of}} transmission shafting which considers the flexure fatigue characteristics of the shaft material under combined cyclic bending and static torsion stress is presented. A fatigue failure relation, corroborated by published combined stress test data, is presented which shows an elliptical variation of <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> endurance strength with static torsional stress. From this elliptical failure relations, a design formula for computing the diameter of rotating solid shafts under the most common condition of loading is developed...|$|R

In the presented method, the S-N curve was developed based on energy-related parameter with the assumption of its dependency on the stress amplitude. The tests made on C 45 steel and X 5 CrNi 18 - 10 steel under <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> revealed that the S-N curve obtained by accelerated thermographic method fits inside the 95 % confidence interval for the S-N curve obtained from the full test...|$|R

The results for FFAGs confirm those obtained with lumped-element codes, {{and suggest that}} cyclotron codes {{will prove to be}} important tools for evaluating the measured fields of FFAG magnets. The results for radial-sector cyclotrons show that the use of negative valley fields would allow axial focusing to be maintained, and hence allow intense cw beams to be accelerated, to energies ≈ 10 GeV...|$|R
40|$|Cables {{comprised}} of seven 0. 001 inch diameter Ni-C-Cr-Mo /Ag DFT (Drawn Filled Tube) wires {{were subject to}} fully <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> fatigue using a bellmouth bend fixture with a bellmouth radius of 0. 0625 inches {{and a range of}} ?? 60 ??. The cables were tensioned using weights ranging from 0. 025 lbf to 0. 150 lbf. Three sets of bellmouth fixturing were used, each with a different relative height between the axis of rotation and the position of the bellmouth. Our tests examined two questions. While less cable tensioning during fully <b>reversed</b> <b>bend</b> fatigue generally equates to less damage, a sufficiently small cable tension during fully <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> might <b>reverse</b> the trend and adversely affect fatigue endurance due to a phenomenon in which some of the cable strands undergo compression and consequently flare out. The test results suggest that the trend does not reverse at low tensions. Secondly, we examined whether small changes in the relative height of the bellmouth significantly impact fatigue life. The rotation of the bellmouth produces a small vertical translation of the wire, which in turn produces a vertical translation, and thus acceleration, of the tensioning weight. The inertia of the tensioning weight produces a cyclical stress on the cable. Changes in the relative height of the bellmouth may lead to changes in the amplitude of this cyclical stress. The test data showed no significant connection between the relative height and fatigue life. The test results show that the fatigue life of the cables is highly dependent on the mass of the tensioning weight, with larger weights leading to shorter fatigue life. An analysis of the cumulative stress, using Miner???s Law for cumulative stress and data from the literature for Ni-C-Cr-Mo wire fatigue, revealed that the cyclical stress produced by the weights was a significant, and in some instances leading contributor to fatigue failure. The Von Mises stress was calculated on the inside and outside of the bend combining the bending, inertial, static, and contact stresses...|$|R
