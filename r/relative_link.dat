40|$|This paper {{presents}} two redundancy indices {{for road}} traffic network junctions and also an aggregated network redundancy index. The proposed redundancy indices could be implemented to identify optimal design alternatives during the planning {{stage of the}} network junctions whereas the aggregated network redundancy index could assess the best control and management policies under disruptive events. Furthermore, effective measures of network redundancy are important to policy makers in understanding the current resilience and future planning to mitigate the impacts of greenhouse gases. The proposed junction indices cover the static aspect of redundancy, i. e. alternative paths, and the dynamic feature of redundancy reflected by the availability of spare capacity under different network loading and service level. The proposed redundancy indices {{are based on the}} entropy concept, due to its ability to measure the system configuration in addition to being able to model the inherent uncertainty in road transport network conditions. Various system parameters based on different combinations of link flow, <b>relative</b> <b>link</b> spare capacity and <b>relative</b> <b>link</b> speed were examined. However, the two redundancy indices developed from the combined <b>relative</b> <b>link</b> speed and <b>relative</b> <b>link</b> spare capacity showed strong correlation with junction delay and volume capacity ratio of a synthetic road transport network of Delft city.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we bring}} {{together}} resilience analysis and routing optimization for IP-based intra-domain networks. When link, node, or multiple failures occur, traffic is rerouted {{which increases the}} link load on backup paths and possibly causes congestion. Resilience analysis detects the risk of overload situations a priori based on a large set of most likely failure scenarios. To counteract, the routing can be optimized and configured that such bottlenecks are avoided {{at least for a}} smaller set of failure scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this routing optimization in IP networks. We use resilience analysis with suitable aggregate views on <b>relative</b> <b>link</b> loads. Furthermore, we compare conventional IP rerouting with IP fast reroute (IP-FRR) and show that IP-FRR can also significantly profit from routing optimization. This paper reviews major parts of previous publications and presents a new method to visualize and compare the resilience of different routing schemes. ...|$|E

In this paper, we consider a coded cooperative system under quasi-static Rayleigh fading and find {{conditions on the}} interuser and user-to-destination channel qualities for cooperation to be beneficial. We define the user cooperation gain (Gf) as the gain in frame error rates due to cooperation when a particular channel code is used. We introduce the cooperation decision parameter (CDP) which is only a function of user-to-destination channel qualities and demonstrate that whether cooperation is useful or not (Gf> 1 or Gf < 1) depends only on the cooperation decision parameter, not inter-user link quality. We {{make use of the}} analytical formulation of the CDP to explore how user cooperation gain behaves in high signal to noise ratios and how <b>relative</b> <b>link</b> qualities of user-to-user and user-to-destination channels affect cooperation benefits in this asymptotic range. Furthermore, we investigate how one can choose a partner from candidate nodes such that the user cooperation gain is larger. All of our theoretical results are supported by simulations. I...|$|E

30|$|User-based {{applications}} {{can rely}} on the link between users and data to create a natural form of locality. Unfortunately, this natural locality is not always present, and must instead be injected into some systems to reap the full benefits of a decentralized design. This is apparent for instance {{in the domain of}} DHTs, when comparing Pastry [2] to earlier designs such as Chord [3] or CAN [13]. Contrary to the initial designs of Chord and CAN, Pastry takes into account the geographical proximity of participating nodes when managing its underlying overlay. As a result, Pastry avoids routing messages through geographically distant nodes when connecting geographically close neighbors, yielding much better performance than approaches that ignore the physical locations of nodes. This illustrates how, in a P 2 P DHT, the <b>relative</b> <b>link</b> between a node’s logical and physical locations can have tremendous consequences for the DHT’s overall performance. If both locations are only weakly correlated or worse not correlated at all, messages routed through the overlay might bounce between nodes that lay geographically far from one another, with drastic consequences for latency and network traffic.|$|E
40|$|In the {{presence}} of local network outages, restoration and protection switching mechanisms redirect the traffic over alternative paths {{to mitigate the effect}} of failures. However, some failure combinations still lead to loss of ingress-egress connectivity within a network or to severe congestion due to rerouted traffic. Congestion may also be caused by unexpected traffic shifts due to changed user behavior or due to changes of interdomain routing. This paper presents a framework for the analysis of ingressegress unavailability and link congestion due to (1) failures, (2) changes of user behavior, and (3) changed interdomain routing. It proposes algorithms to find the most probable combinations of (1), (2), and (3) according to some models, and to evaluate the connectivity and the <b>relative</b> <b>link</b> load of the network under these conditions. We have implemented this concept in a software tool and its visualization of the results leads to a comprehensive view of the network’s resilience. It helps to anticipate potential ingressegress disconnection and congestion before failures and overload occur or before planned modifications (new infrastructure, new routing, new customers) take effect. Thus, it detects weak points in a network, predicts the effectiveness of potential upgrades, and thereby supports careful bandwidth overprovisioning...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a composite resilience index for road transport networks. The index employs three characteristics, namely redundancy, vulnerability and mobility, measuring resilience at network junction, link and origin-destination levels, respectively. Various techniques have been adopted to quantify each characteristic and the composite resilience index as summarised below. The redundancy indicator for road transport network junctions is based on the entropy concept, due to its ability to measure the system configuration in addition to being able to model the inherent uncertainty in road transport network conditions. Various system parameters based on different combinations of link flow, <b>relative</b> <b>link</b> spare capacity and <b>relative</b> <b>link</b> speed were examined. The developed redundancy indicator covers the static aspect of redundancy, i. e. alternative paths, and the dynamic feature of redundancy reflected by the availability of spare capacity under different network loading and service level. The vulnerability indicator for road transport network links is developed by combining vulnerability attributes (e. g. link capacity, flow, length, free flow and traffic congestion density) with different weights using a new methodology based on fuzzy logic and exhaustive search optimisation techniques. Furthermore, the network vulnerability indicators are calculated using two different aggregations: an aggregated vulnerability indicator based on physical characteristics and the other based on operational characteristics. The mobility indicator for road transport networks is formulated from two mobility attributes reflecting the physical connectivity and level of service. The combination of the two mobility attributes into a single mobility indicator is achieved by a fuzzy logic approach. Finally, the interdependence of the proposed characteristics is explored and the composite resilience index is estimated from the aggregation of the three characteristics indicators using two different approaches, namely equal weighting and principal component analysis methods. Moreover, the impact of real-time travel information on the proposed resilience characteristics and the composite resilience index has been investigated. The application of the proposed methodology on a synthetic road transport network of Delft city (Netherlands) and other real life case studies shows that the developed indicators for the three characteristics and the composite resilience index responded well to traffic load change and supply variations. The developed composite resilience index will be of use in various ways; first, helping decision makers in understanding the dynamic nature of resilience under different disruptive events, highlighting weaknesses in the network and future planning to mitigate the impact of disruptive events. Furthermore, each developed indicator for the three characteristics considered {{can be used as a}} tool to assess the effectiveness of different management policies or technologies to improve the overall network performance or the daily operation of road transport networks...|$|E

3000|$|The {{clustering}} of {{the networks}} resembles the cartography of the traffic infrastructure for navigation, hence the term ‘map’. In this framework, the modules are identified that tend {{to stay in a}} cluster for a longer time. In a study by Rosvall and Bergstrom [19], this {{can be seen as a}} real scenario because a place could be called a ‘city’ if the traffic remains for a relatively long time. The map equation is constructed on a flow-based infrastructure. A random walker’s lodge in a community can have either shorter or longer description lengths. For a good community structure, a shorter length is favored. The random walker sometimes stays for a longer time at certain regions in a community. In those cases, the description can be condensed. It is better to derive the code length from the stationary distribution of the random walker on the nodes and links rather than measuring the code length of a long walk and dividing by the number of steps.

40|$|Routing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} issues in any communication network. It defines on which path packets are transmitted from the source of a connection to the destination. It allows to control the distribution of flows between different locations in the network and thereby is a means to influence the load distribution or to reach certain constraints imposed by particular applications. As failures in communication networks appear regularly and cannot be completely avoided, routing is required to be resilient against such outages, i. e., routing still has to be able to forward packets on backup paths even if primary paths are not working any more. Throughout the years, various routing technologies have been introduced that are very different in their control structure, in their way of working, and in their ability to handle certain failure cases. Each of the different routing approaches opens up their own specific questions regarding configuration, optimization, and inclusion of resilience issues. This monograph investigates, with the example of three particular routing technologies, some concrete issues regarding the analysis and optimization of resilience. It thereby contributes to a better general, technology-independent understanding of these approaches and of their diverse potential for the use in future network architectures. The first considered routing type, is decentralized intra-domain routing based on administrative IP link costs and the shortest path principle. Typical examples are common today's intra-domain routing protocols OSPF and IS-IS. This type of routing includes automatic restoration abilities in case of failures what makes it in general very robust even in the case of severe network outages including several failed components. Furthermore, special IP-Fast Reroute mechanisms allow for a faster reaction on outages. For routing based on link costs, traffic engineering, e. g. the optimization of the maximum <b>relative</b> <b>link</b> load in the network, can be done indirectly by changing the administrative link costs to adequate values. The second considered routing type, MPLS-based routing, is based on the a priori configuration of primary and backup paths, so-called Label Switched Paths. The routing layout of MPLS paths offers more freedom compared to IP-based routing as it is not restricted by any shortest path constraints but any paths can be setup. However, this in general involves a higher configuration effort. Finally, in the third considered routing type, typically centralized routing using a Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture, simple switches only forward packets according to routing decisions made by centralized controller units. SDN-based routing layouts offer the same freedom as for explicit paths configured using MPLS. In case of a failure, new rules can be setup by the controllers to continue the routing in the reduced topology. However, new resilience issues arise caused by the centralized architecture. If controllers are not reachable anymore, the forwarding rules in the single nodes cannot be adapted anymore. This might render a rerouting in case of connection problems in severe failure scenarios infeasible. Routing stellt eine der zentralen Aufgaben in Kommunikationsnetzen dar. Es bestimmt darüber, auf welchem Weg Verkehr von der Quelle zum Ziel transportiert wird. Durch geschicktes Routing kann dadurch eine Verteilung der Verkehrsflüsse zum Beispiel zur Lastverteilung erreicht werden. Da Fehler in Kommunikationsnetzen nicht vollständig verhindert werden können, muss Routing insbesondere ausfallsicher sein, d. h., im Falle von Fehlern im Netz muss das Routing weiterhin in der Lage sein, Pakete auf alternativen Pfaden zum Ziel zu transportieren. Es existieren verschiedene gängige Routingverfahren und Technologien, die sich hinsichtlich Ihrer Arbeitsweise, Ihrer Kontrollstrukturen und Ihrer Funktionalität in bestimmten Fehlerszenarien unterscheiden. Für diese verschiedenen Ansätze ergeben sich jeweils eigene Fragestellungen hinsichtlich der Konfiguration, der Optimierung und der Berücksichtigung von Ausfallsicherheit. Diese Doktorarbeit behandelt am Beispiel bestimmter Technologien einige konkrete Fragestellungen zur Analyse und Optimierung der Ausfallsicherheit. Sie liefert damit einen Beitrag zum besseren generellen Verständnis verschiedenartiger Routingansätze und deren unterschiedlichen Potentials für den Einsatz in zukünftigen Netzarchitekturen. Zuerst wird dezentrales Routing behandelt, basierend auf administrativen Linkgewichten und dem Prinzip der kürzesten Pfade, wie es beispielsweise in den Protokollen IS-IS und OSPF genutzt wird. Diese Routingverfahren beinhalteten automatische Rekonvergenz-Mechanismen um im Falle von Fehlern auf der verbleibenden Netzstruktur weiterhin einen Transport von Verkehr zu ermöglichen. Spezielle IP-Fast Reroute Mechanismen ermöglichen zudem eine schnelle Reaktion im Falle von Fehlern. Routing basierend auf Linkgewichten lässt sich nur indirekt durch die Wahl geeigneter Gewichte beeinflussen und optimieren. Die zweite in der Doktorarbeit behandelte Routingart ist MPLS-basiertes Routing, bei dem Labels für Pakete verwendet werden und Pakete anhand sogenannter vorkonfigurierter Label Switched Paths weitergeleitet werden. Diese Technologie bietet mehr Freiheiten bei der Wahl des Pfadlayouts, was aber wiederum im Allgemeinen einen erhöhten Konfigurationsaufwand mit sich bringt. Schließlich greift die Doktorarbeit auch das Routing in SDN Netzen auf. Dort erfolgt eine Trennung von Control Plane und Data Plane, so dass einzelne dedizierte Controller die Routingentscheidungen festlegen und ansonsten einfache Switches mit reduzierter Komplexität den Verkehr lediglich entsprechend der festgelegten Regeln weiterleiten. Dies ermöglicht die größte Freiheit bei der Konfiguration des Routing bringt aber wiederum neue Fragestellungen bedingt durch die zentralen Kontrolleinheiten mit sich...|$|E
