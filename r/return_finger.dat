40|$|Patients without {{voluntary}} finger extension early post-stroke {{are suggested}} {{to have a}} poor prognosis for regaining upper limb capacity at 6 months. Despite this poor prognosis, a number of patients do regain upper limb capacity. We aimed to determine the time window for <b>return</b> of voluntary <b>finger</b> extension during motor recovery and identify clinical characteristics of patients who, despite an initially poor prognosis, show upper limb capacity at 6 months post-stroke. Survival {{analysis was used to}} assess the time window for <b>return</b> of voluntary <b>finger</b> extension (Fugl-Meyer Assessment hand sub item finger extension≥ 1). A cut-off of ≥ 10 points on the Action Research Arm Test was used to define return of some upper limb capacity (i. e. ability to pick up a small object). Probabilities for regaining upper limb capacity at 6 months post-stroke were determined with multivariable logistic regression analysis using patient characteristics. 45 of the 100 patients without voluntary finger extension at 8 ± 4 days post-stroke achieved an Action Research Arm Test score of ≥ 10 points at 6 months. The median time for regaining voluntary finger extension for these recoverers was 4 weeks (lower and upper percentile respectively 2 and 8 weeks). The median time to return of VFE was not reached for the whole group (N = 100). Patients who had moderate to good lower limb function (Motricity Index leg≥ 35 points), no visuospatial neglect (single-letter cancellation test asymmetry between the contralesional and ipsilesional sides of < 2 omissions) and sufficient somatosensory function (Erasmus MC modified Nottingham Sensory Assessment≥ 33 points) had a 0. 94 probability of regaining upper limb capacity at 6 months post-stroke. We recommend weekly monitoring of voluntary finger extension within the first 4 weeks post-stroke and preferably up to 8 weeks. Patients with paresis mainly restricted to the upper limb, no visuospatial neglect and sufficient somatosensory function are likely to show at least some return of upper limb capacity at 6 months post-stroke...|$|R

The highly regarded 35mm SLR Kine Exakta, by Ihagee in Dresden, that preceded it by some three years, is extremely complicated by comparison, and although it provides the same functions, is quite differently built. The Praktiflex has a 40mm screw lens mount, while the later Praktica models, after World War II when the factory {{was part of the}} VEB Pentacon, uses the 42mm screw mount. The Praktiflex has one feature inherited from the large format plate SLR cameras that otherwise was unsolved in the 35mm SLR cameras until 1954; the instant return mirror is lifted by the power of the finger depressing the shutter release, and it <b>returns</b> when the <b>finger</b> pressure is released.

40|$|Special issue: Enaction and MusicInternational audienceWe {{explore how}} an 'ergotic gesture-sound situation' {{is a genuine}} way to improve the playability, believability and {{presence}} of virtual musical instruments. An ergotic gesture-sound situation {{is a situation where}} the instrumental gesture and the sound produced are intimately energetically linked. We perform two sets of experiments: the first aims at identifying the respective role of haptic and auditory perceptions in recognition of a virtual object, here a virtual bowed string; the second aims at evaluating the role of haptic and auditory perceptions with respect to action, in the achievement of a difficult musical task. The musical goal consists in maintaining the continuity of sound when changing bow direction. The first experiments are subjective experiments. They show that the feeling of presence of the bowed string is strongly reinforced when sounds and gestural friction are intimately linked, as is the case when the vibrations of the string are <b>returned</b> to the <b>fingers.</b> The second are subjective and objective experiments. They show that achieving the goal is significantly improved by instrumental force feedback. Further, they show that the main property of subjects' performance with the virtual bowed string is fast adaptive dynamic learning due to the physical relation between action plus gesture perception and auditory perception, and that playing and embodiment are notably improved by a strong physical haptic resistance...|$|R

Whilst fleeing, the convicts and their prisoners stumble across both a lost truck which had been transporting thousands of dollars, and Alex Hale (Janet Montgomery), who has {{been lost in the}} woods after Three Finger killed the rest of her friends. Eventually, Three-Toes (Three Finger's son) is killed by Nate and Alex. Three Finger finds Three-Toes's severed head, which makes him furious. He creates a shrine and leaves the head on display in his cabin. The one surviving convict, Brandon, convinces Nate that he was innocent all along, and in turn is allowed to go free. Sometime later, Nate greedily returns to collect the remaining cash from the armored truck. Brandon appears and betrays Nate, shooting him in the back with an arrow. While Brandon is collecting the cash, a cannibal comes up behind him, holding a crude club, and kills him. The identity of the cannibal is unclear. Alex is the only survivor of this film.

Methods A total of 159 ischemic stroke patients were included: 58 patients with a favorable prognosis (> 10 degrees of FE) were randomly allocated to 3 weeks of mCIMT or usual care only; 101 patients with an unfavorable prognosis were allocated to 3 -week EMG-NMS or usual care only. Both interventions started within 14 days poststroke, lasted up until 5 weeks, focused at preservation or return of FE. Results Upper limb capacity was measured with the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), assessed weekly within the first 5 weeks poststroke and at postassessments at 8, 12, and 26 weeks. Clinically relevant differences in ARAT in favor of mCIMT were found after 5, 8, and 12 weeks poststroke (respectively, 6, 7, and 7 points; P <. 05), but not after 26 weeks. We did not find statistically significant differences between mCIMT and usual care on impairment measures, such as the Fugl-Meyer assessment of the arm (FMA-UE). EMG-NMS did not result in significant differences. Conclusions Three weeks of early mCIMT is superior to usual care in terms of regaining upper limb capacity in patients with a favorable prognosis; 3 weeks of EMG-NMS in patients with an unfavorable prognosis is not beneficial. Despite meaningful improvements in upper limb capacity, no evidence was found that the time-dependent neurological improvements early poststroke are significantly influenced by either mCIMT or EMG-NMS...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{a case of}} tamoxifen toxicity superimposed on central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). We review the role of estrogen {{and the effect of}} tamoxifen on ocular tissues. Observations: A 32 -year-old Hispanic female with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast (T 2 N 1 M 0, triple-positive), status post chemotherapy and bilateral mastectomy, presented with complaint of a floater and decreased central vision of the right eye (OD). Symptoms began three weeks after initiating tamoxifen and five months after the last cycle of chemotherapy and dexamethasone. Visual acuity (VA) was 20 / 30 OD at presentation. Clinical examination and multimodal imaging revealed subretinal fluid (SRF) and pigment epithelial detachment (PED) suggestive of CSCR. After one month of monitoring, VA improved to 20 / 20; there was SRF resolution, small PED, and focal ellipsoid zone (EZ) band loss. Two weeks later, after undergoing surgery and starting a topical steroid, she <b>returned</b> with count <b>fingers</b> (CF) VA and large SRF OD. Steroid cessation improved SRF after one month, but VA was unchanged. Tamoxifen was discontinued, and VA improved to 20 / 100 with near-complete resolution of SRF at three weeks, and significant reduction in choroidal thickness at two months. At final follow-up, VA was 20 / 200, and there was focal EZ band loss sub-foveally, minimal SRF, and small PED. Conclusions and Importance: Treatment with tamoxifen may lead to ocular toxicity and can complicate the recovery course of patients affected with CSCR. Variations in levels of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) and treatment with tamoxifen (ER-α partial agonist) may lead to loss of the protective effect of estrogen in the retinal pigment epithelial cells in premenopausal women. Furthermore, tamoxifen toxicity can lead to focal photoreceptor loss. Treatment in these cases should be coordinated together with the oncologist...|$|R
40|$|Friction {{tests were}} carried out to assess the {{friction}} between a human finger and contacting surface, in different conditions. Tests examined the effect of normal force, the area of contact, the effect of triangular and rectangular cross-section ridges {{and the effect of}} moisture. The tests found that when a finger is contacting a nominally flat surface, the friction force increases with normal force, following a two part linear relationship. This is associated with a large initial deformation of the finger, followed by a smaller scale deformation, after a certain load. The introduction of water to the contact results in an initial increase, which is followed by a decrease, in friction. There are two principal mechanisms responsible for this increase; water absorption to the stratum corneum, and capillary adhesion. These mechanisms increase friction by increasing the area of contact, and therefore the amount of adhesion. When the finger is contacting a ridged surface, triangular ridges display a higher friction force than rectangular ridges. This is thought to be due to the larger penetration depth that is possible with triangular ridges. The main mechanisms of friction for the triangular ridges are adhesion and interlocking friction. The main mechanisms of friction for the larger, rectangular ridged surfaces are adhesion, ploughing friction and a reduction in friction force due to an energy <b>return</b> from the <b>finger</b> forming back to its original shape. These tests showed that for a large friction force, surfaces should have high, narrow and widely spaced ridges. This, however, is at the expense of consistent friction across the surface. The understanding gained was then applied to the area of rugby ball design. Tests showed that the existing rugby ball surface designs with the highest friction were ones with pyramid pimples. However, rounded pimpled surfaces performed more consistently across all test conditions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Salad <b>Fingers</b> <b>returns</b> home to find multiple horses in his house, including one that resembles the horse he saw in the forest and which appears to have had a patch stitched onto it in the precise place in which it was torn. Believing his toy horse Horace to be responsible, he searches through his cupboards and drawers to find skins of horses in there and is distressed to find Milford Cubicle as a skeleton. He drives the horses out, imagining them to have eaten him, only to encounter the mysterious pole he had seen earlier outside his house (which had not been visible on his return home), which he scolds. Then he sees, a little way away from him, a group of people gathered around a table, each dressed like, and resembling him but with various facial and behavioural abnormalities, eating brains and bodily organs, possibly those of Milford Cubicle. At this point, he appears to forget that the party was for Hubert, and assumes the seat to be for himself. Nervously, he sits down to join them, though they largely ignore him. Suddenly, the pole lowers itself into the ground to reveal a wrapped up present on the top of it, which he also assumes to be for himself. He opens the present and finds a hat made from what resembles the skin of Milford Cubicle. He says [...] "I shall wear it from here to the grave. What a truly special day."
