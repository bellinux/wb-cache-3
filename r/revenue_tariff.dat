It advocated the abolition of protectionism, especially protective tariffs and other restrictions on trade, arguing that this would create greater prosperity for all. However, many members also advocated use of minimal tariffs for government revenue purposes only.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the protectionist debate, politicians were {{also concerned about the}} high <b>revenue</b> accruing from <b>tariffs.</b> [...] After the Civil War, tariffs remained elevated to raise revenue and cover the high costs of war. However, in the early 1880s, the federal government was running a large surplus. Both parties agreed that the surplus needed to lessen, but disagreed about whether to raise or lower tariffs to accomplish the same goal. The Democrats' hypothesis stated that <b>tariff</b> <b>revenue</b> could be reduced by reducing the tariff rate. Conversely, Republicans believed that by increasing the tariff, imports would be lessened, and total <b>tariff</b> <b>revenue</b> would drop (See Laffer curve). This point, along with the dialogue surrounding protectionism, created what would be known as “The Great Tariff Debate of 1888.” ...|$|R

The authors find that, under standard import price and substitution elasticity assumptions, eliminating tariffs on all imports from the European Union would increase ECOWAS'imports from the European Union by 10. 5 - 11. 5 percent for selected ECOWAS countries, namely Cape Verde, Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal.

The large country-by-country differences in fiscal revenue loss suggest that domestic tax reforms and fiscal transfers within ECOWAS could be important complements to the agreement's implementation.

40|$|The author reviews {{possible}} {{trade and}} exchange rate policies of the former Soviet Union. Alternative exchange rate regimes, including a monetary union are considered. For Russia, a fixed but adjustable regime is most realistic. Frequent adjustment may be desirable, to prevent the use of trade restrictions to achieve balance of payments objectives. The author examines the need for transitional tariffs, including the argument for a temporary uniform tariff that {{is higher than the}} long-run <b>revenue</b> <b>tariff.</b> The temporary uniform tariff is designed to prevent temporary overshooting of the exchange rate. The case for a free trade area is strong because the republics of the former Soviet Union are so highly specialized, but there will be problems if price controls remain and differ among the republics. There could be a free trade area even if there is no monetary union. The author concludes that one approach to trade policy is to have no trade policy - to have completely free trade with convertibility for current account transactions. Some tariffs and export taxes may be justified, at least as second-best policies. If so, the author stresses that four principles be observed: 1) barriers to existing trade between the republics should not be set up; 2) all quantitative control measures should be avoided; 3) tariff and export tax structures should be very simple; and 4) trade policy should be transparent.

40|$|Using two {{recently}} constructed {{measures of}} trade liberalization dates, this research studies {{the impact of}} trade liberalization on imports, exports, and overall trade balance for a large sample of developing countries. We find strong and consistent evidence that trade liberalization leads to higher imports and exports. However, in contrast Santos-Paulino and Thirwall (2004) who find a robustly negative impact of trade liberalization on the overall trade balance, we only find mixed evidence of such a negative impact. In particular, we find little evidence of a statistically significant negative impact using our first measure of liberalization dates which extends Li (2004). Using a second measure of liberalization dates compiled by Wacziarg and Welch (2003), we find some evidence that liberalization worsens the trade balance, but the evidence is not robust across different estimation specifications, and the estimated impact is smaller than that reported by Santos-Paulino and Thirwall (2004).
