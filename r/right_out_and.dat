5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E
500|$|Walker {{released}} his twenty-third single, [...] "Say No More", for Giant in early 2001. It {{was the first}} single release from his sixth studio album of the same name, peaking at number 33 on the country chart; the only other single, the Jerry Kilgore co-write [...] "If You Ever Feel Like Lovin' Me Again", reached number 27. The latter song was promoted by Giant's parent company, Warner Bros. Records Nashville, as Giant had closed in late 2001. Walker co-produced the album with veteran producers Byron Gallimore and Blake Mevis, and session guitarist Brent Mason. The album also included a song that Walker wrote in high school, and a cover of Ritchie Valens's [...] "La Bamba." [...] Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic rated it three stars, with her review saying that [...] "the sensitivity on this album is so expressive that it {{makes you want to}} run <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> hug the one you love." [...] Country Standard Time critic Mike Clark considered it a transition to a more country pop-oriented sound, describing the album as being [...] "full of bad lyrics and overwrought production clichés." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{commander}} of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. George Meade, and his cavalry commander, Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan, quarreled about the Union cavalry's performance {{in the first two}} engagements of the Overland Campaign. Sheridan heatedly asserted that he wanted to [...] "concentrate all of cavalry, move out in force against Stuart's command, and whip it." [...] Meade reported the comments to Grant, who replied [...] "Did Sheridan say that? Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him start <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> do it." [...] Sheridan immediately organized a raid against Confederate supply and railroad lines close to Richmond, which he knew would bring Stuart to battle.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Claire’s open {{disdain for}} her sister, {{she has never}} told Agnes about Tobias’s affair. It is not clear if she does this out of love or out of spite. She keeps the affair a secret, {{almost as if she}} has a hidden weapon that she protects in case she may have to use it one day. When Agnes comes <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> asks Claire to confirm her suspicions about Tobias, Claire’s answer is, “Ya got me, Sis.” Shortly after this exchange, Agnes {{describes}} Claire in this way: “Claire could tell us so much if she cared to [...] [...] [...] Claire, who watches from the sidelines, has seen so very much, has seen us all so clearly [...] [...] [...] You were not named for nothing.” Claire is said to closely resemble Albee’s aunt Jane, an alcoholic and frequent visitor to the Albee home.|$|E
2500|$|Generals Meade and Sheridan had quarreled {{about the}} cavalry's {{performance}} {{throughout the campaign}} and their failures May 7–8 brought Meade's notorious temper to a boil. Sheridan told Meade that he could [...] "whip Stuart" [...] if Meade let him. Meade reported the conversation to Grant, who replied, [...] "Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him start <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> do it." [...] Meade deferred to Grant's judgment and issued orders to Sheridan to [...] "proceed against the enemy's cavalry." [...] Sheridan's entire command of 10,000 cavalrymen departed the following day. They engaged with (and mortally wounded) Stuart at the Battle of Yellow Tavern on May 11, threatened the outskirts of Richmond, refitted near the James River, and {{did not return to}} the army until May 24. Grant and Meade were left without cavalry resources during the critical days of the battle to come.|$|E
2500|$|Generals Meade and Sheridan had quarreled {{about the}} cavalry's {{performance}} {{throughout the campaign}} and this incident with Wilson, compounding the frustration of the uncleared Brock Road, brought Meade's notorious temper to a boil.

Meade reported the conversation to Grant, who replied, [...] "Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him start <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> do it."

2500|$|When Meade quarreled with Sheridan for not {{performing}} his duties of screening and reconnaissance as ordered, Sheridan told Meade {{that he could}} [...] "whip Stuart" [...] if Meade let him. Meade reported the conversation to Grant, who replied, [...] "Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him start <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> do it." [...] Meade deferred to Grant's judgment and issued orders to Sheridan to [...] "proceed against the enemy's cavalry" [...] and from May 9 through May 24, sent him on a raid toward Richmond, directly challenging the Confederate cavalry. The raid was less successful than hoped; although his raid managed to mortally wound Confederate cavalry commander Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart at Yellow Tavern on May 11 and beat Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee at Meadow Bridge on May 12, the raid never seriously threatened Richmond and it left Grant without cavalry intelligence for Spotsylvania and North Anna. Historian Gordon C. Rhea wrote, [...] "By taking his cavalry from Spotsylvania Court House, Sheridan severely handicapped Grant in his battles against Lee. The Union Army was deprived of his eyes and ears during a critical juncture in the campaign. And Sheridan's decision to advance boldly to the Richmond defenses smacked of unnecessary showboating that jeopardized his command." ...|$|E
