40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{entitled}} 'Molecular <b>Logic</b> <b>Gates</b> Bound To Solids' and is separated into five chapters. The first chapter introduces <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> {{and the potential}} applications of molecular <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> Photochemical mechanisms, Photoinduced electron transfer (pET) and Internal charge transfer (lCT), through which many sensors and molecular <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> operate are focused upon. It also reveals how the application of chemical or optical inputs and optical outputs from molecules, with the aid ofthe PET and ICT mechanisms can construct molecular <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> Chapter 2 presents molecular <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> which are prefabricated and covalently bound onto organic and inorganic beads. The YES and PASS 1 operations are displayed both individually and in parallel and are driven by proton inputs. Chapter 3 entails the introduction ofternary logic with the 'off-on-off' <b>logic</b> <b>gate.</b> Its. operation in solution is transcended when covalently attached onto a solid platform and is driven by proton inputs. Chapter 4 involves the discussion of double-input <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> The AND gate which is solid-bound is driven by protori and sodium ion inputs. Chapter 5 demonstrates how selectivityÃ‚Â· of <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> govern their operation. The YES and OR molecular <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> are performed on the organic and inorganic beads through calcium and zinc ions.

40|$|A long-standing goal of {{computer}} technology is to process and store digital information with the same device in order to implement new architectures. One way to accomplish this is to use nanomagnetic `non-volatile' <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> that can perform Boolean operations and then store the output data in the magnetization states of nanomagnets, thereby doubling as both logic and memory. Unfortunately, many proposed nanomagnetic gates do not possess the seven essential characteristics of a Boolean logic gate: concatenability, non-linearity, isolation between input and output, gain, universal logic implementation, scalability and error resilience. More importantly, their energy-delay products and error-rates vastly exceed that of conventional transistor-based <b>logic</b> <b>gates,</b> which is a drawback.
