40|$|Abstract: Parcels without road {{frontage}} {{are produced}} by subdividing larger <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> land before the land planning and Building Act was established. Parcels without road frontage are neglected in real estate investment and urban development causing their deterioration and isolation in the city. Parcels without road frontage can be discovered in dense residential districts which were informally developed. Sometimes, an easement agreement is established for a new construction. However, validity of the easement could be changed pending upon the land ownership. Therefore it makes the development <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> without road frontage unstable and unsustainable. In this paper, through case study <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> without road frontage of Changsin Sungin District in Seoul, parcels without road frontage are categorized to examine their conditions and problems. This analysis allows evaluation of development possibilities <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> without road frontage based on information of land owners, adjacent lot conditions, and physical situations of existing buildings to lead the development <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> without road frontage. By considering such an information, if we induce adequate development <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> without road frontage in Seoul, it would contribute to regeneration <b>of</b> the <b>parcel,</b> the block and the neighborhood, enhancing the value <b>of</b> <b>parcel</b> and driving the sustainable urban transformation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBrain {{parcellation}} into {{a number}} of hemodynamically homogeneous regions (parcels) is a challenging issue in fMRI analyses. This task has been recently integrated in the joint detection-estimation (JDE) resulting in the so-called joint detection-parcellation-estimation (JPDE) model. JPDE automatically estimates the parcels from the fMRI data but requires the desired number <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> to be fixed. This is potentially critical in that the chosen number <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> may influence detection-estimation performance. In this paper, we propose a model selection procedure to automatically fix the number <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> from the data. The selection procedure relies on the calculation of the free energy corresponding to each concurrent model, within the variational expectation maximization framework. Experiments on synthetic and real fMRI data demonstrate the ability of the proposed procedure to select an adequate number <b>of</b> <b>parcels...</b>|$|R

40|$|According to the {{official}} survey and various reports, the productivity of rice {{production per unit area}} is quite different in every farm. This is because various factors of farm management are effecting to the production processes of rice. From viewpoint of our studies, these factors can be classified into two large groups: {{one of them is the}} economic conditions surrounding outside of farm management, the other is the inside conditions of farm management. Therefore, this report will be limited only to the analysis of the latter conditions, especially of the field situation (fragmentation or size <b>of</b> <b>parcels).</b> In this studies we have three big problems in regard to the tillable land fragmention (size <b>of</b> <b>parcels)</b> now that are effecting to the labor productivity. (1) Determination of the adequate size <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> to use the draft cattle, utilization of small tractors and Fordson type tractors more efficiently under the present conditions. (2) Clearing up of the relationship between the labor productivity of rice production and the size <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> farms. (3) Consideration of the relationship between the diffusion of the small tractors and the tillable land fragmentation (size <b>of</b> <b>parcels)</b> <b>of</b> the villages in southern Okayama Prefecture. The data of using the draft cattle and the small tractors of problem (1) were mainly derived from our survey in Niiike Village of Okayama Prefecture, a large part of which was reported already in "Analysis of Mechanization of Japanese Agriculture" 1960, Sobun-sha, Tokyo. In addition to these data, we obtained some useful data of the utilization of the Fordson type tractors from Agricultural Improvement Section of Okayama Prefectural Office. The data of problem (2) were derived from the basic data of The Survey of Rice Production Cost surveyed by Okayama Statistical Office of Agriculture and Forestry Department in 1959. The data of problem (3) were derived from the World Census of Agriculture and Forestry in 1960. Rearranging and analyzing these basic data for our purpose, we shall conclude the result as follows: (1) The adequate size <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> to use the draft cattle, small tractors and Fordson type tractors efficiently the area should be larger than 0. 15 ha. 0. 2 ha. and 0. 3 ha. respectively. Therefore, the consolidation of farms are absolutly necessary in Okayama Prefecture because of the average size <b>of</b> <b>parcel</b> is about 0. 1 ha [...] (2) As the size <b>of</b> <b>parcel</b> increases, the working hour for rice production per unit area decreases. The yields of rice per unit area are slightly up with the increase of the size <b>of</b> <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> farms. Therefore, the labor productivity of rice production is remarkably increased with the expansion <b>of</b> size per <b>parcel.</b> (3) The more the size per parcel increase, the more the rice production per 0. 1 ha. and production cost of rice per koku (150 kg) decrease. (4) We can fine out the good relationship between the diffusion of the small tractors and fragmentation of tillable land (average size <b>of</b> <b>parcels)</b> in the villages in southern Okayama Prefecture...|$|R
