50|$|Koenigsmacker {{overlooks the}} {{crossing}} of the Moselle at Cattenom. During the Lorraine Campaign of World War II, the U.S. 90th Infantry Division crossed the flooded Moselle early on 9 November 1944. Fire from Koenigsmacker destroyed bridging equipment and harassed boat-borne troops, but elements of the 358th Infantry Regiment established a lodgement on the east bank and infiltrated {{the area of the}} fort before daybreak. The initial American assault took the German garrison, manned by the 74th regiment of the 19th Volksgrenadier Division, by surprise, but German resistance quickly became more effective. American combat engineers took over the assault, using explosives to destroy or seal openings and ventilation shafts. The engineers used such a quantity of explosives that they ran out, and had to be replenished by an airdrop. The fort's 100mm guns could not be depressed to deal with the close-in attackers, but kept up fire on nearby U.S. formations. By nightfall the Americans had occupied a portion of the fort's surface. The next morning, Company C of the 358th attacked from the south, encountering a fortified ditch. Companies A and B meanwhile occupied the fort's surface and continued with attacks using demolition charges, while the fort kept up artillery fire on American units trying to pass by the fort. On the 11th much of the fort had been suppressed, but its guns continued to fire. A <b>relief</b> <b>patrol</b> of 145 Germans attempting to relieve the fort was ambushed and captured. On the 12th an assault by G Company of the 358th coincided with a decision by the German garrison to evacuate. Surrounded, the Germans surrendered. More than 300 Germans were captured or casualties, with 111 American casualties.|$|E

It is marketed at several different roles, including VIP/corporate transport, offshore transport, fire fighting, law enforcement, search and rescue, emergency medical service, disaster <b>relief,</b> and maritime <b>patrol.</b> In addition to AgustaWestland's own manufacturing facilities in Italy and the United States, the AW139 {{is produced in}} Russia by HeliVert, {{a joint venture between}} AgustaWestland and Russian Helicopters.|$|R
50|$|The {{division}} {{arrived in}} Italy and concentrated around Mantua, South of Verona {{as part of}} XIV Corps on 11 November, 16 days after the Battle of Caporetto. From here on 19 November the division marched out to the front line, with the 69th and 70th brigades relieving the 70th Italian Division on {{the western part of}} the Montello and the adjoining plain South of the Piave River from 2-4 December. They immediately began to reorganise the defences to the standard defence in depth pattern used in Flanders and began <b>patrols.</b> <b>Relief</b> by the 41st Division began on 13 February 1918, by which time the division had suffered 38 dead and 136 wounded mostly due to artillery and air attack, comparatively small numbers compared to Flanders.|$|R
2500|$|The South African Air Force (SAAF, Suid-Afrikaanse Lugmag (SALM) in Afrikaans) is the {{air force}} of South Africa, with [...] {{headquarters}} in Pretoria. The South African Air Force was established on 1 February 1920. The Air Force has seen service in World War II and the Korean War. [...] From 1966 the SAAF was involved in providing infantry support in a low intensity war ("The Border War") in Angola, South-West Africa (Namibia) and Rhodesia. [...] As the war progressed, the intensity of air operations increased until in the late 1980s, the SAAF were compelled to fly fighter missions against Angolan aircraft {{in order to maintain}} tactical air superiority. [...] On conclusion of the Border War in 1990, aircraft numbers were severely reduced due to economic pressures as well as the cessation of hostilities with neighbouring states. Today the SAAF has a limited air combat capability and has been structured towards regional peace-keeping, disaster <b>relief</b> and maritime <b>patrol</b> operations.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMilitary {{and police}} patrols are an {{important}} component of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster <b>Relief</b> missions. These <b>patrols</b> need to access timely, relevant information about events and conditions along their patrol route, both historical, and ongoing. In the current practice, this information is gathered manually prior to the commencement of the patrol through the use of historical databases, current event repositories, and by conducting a review of records that may be relevant to the area to be patrolled. Being manual, this process is fraught with several problems including high-cost, slow-speed and low-reliability. We are developing HAMPP (Handheld Assistant for Military and Police Patrols) to enhance the effectiveness and security of the patrol units and reduce the cost and time required for patrol planning. HAMPP is designed to assist with gathering detailed information about relevant events along the patrol route and alert the patrol unit when they are in the vicinity of these areas during the patrol. In addition, it performs several other activities which relate to the security of the patrol unit. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present our system architecture for a device-independent mobile software system that enables planning of the patrol route and linking of related information to that route, and as the patrol starts, tracking the unit's current location and providing real-time information and alerts about areas of interest along the route of a patrol. Any deviations from the planned route are flagged and alerts sent to the command post...|$|R
