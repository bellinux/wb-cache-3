40|$|Abstract The thesis {{looks at}} <b>Rushdie</b> <b>s</b> three first major novels (Midnight s Children, Shame and The Satanic Verses) as a loose-knit trilogy and {{examines}} the way Rushdie uses literary techniques belonging to postmodern and postcolonial aesthetics {{in order to}} deconstruct {{the whole idea of}} divine revelation and thereby subverting the authority of any religion which claims a divine origin and a transcendent understanding of the human condition. Although the carnival theme is the most central to the discussion, literary techniques and constructions such as Menippean satire, rhizome, simulacrum, inversion, historiographic metafiction and leitmotif are also examined. The aim is to show how <b>Rushdie</b> <b>s</b> treatment of central themes such as identity, history and religion is consistent throughout the novels, with special attention to the theme of religion. Although all the novels deal with the same central themes, the thesis shows how the themes of identity and religion are intensified in each subsequent novel and that The Satanic Verses is to be considered an amalgamation of the two and the dénouement of the first movement of <b>Rushdie</b> <b>s</b> works. The thesis concludes that the complex literary discourse which is The Satanic Verses has largely been misunderstood by critics who do not appreciate or disregard the conventions of the Western novel, and that when viewed in context with the two preceding works should be regarded as a serious attempt to do battle with and raise debate about the central issues facing modern man {{from the perspective of a}} modern migrant. Having said this, the thesis questions the efficacy of the use of the carnival theme in relation to the subversion of religion and the pragmatics of the suggestions that emerge from the novels of how to consolidate the predicament of the complex postmodern condition...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} {{conjunction}} of postcolonial and feminist elements in Salman <b>Rushdie</b> <b>s</b> Shame. It explores how narration, {{language and the}} logic of the novel in combination with the female characters constitute an overall postcolonial counter-discourse. Specifically, it discusses the female characters role in establishing a postcolonial resistance. It disagrees with a general scepticism of the author s representation of female characters within Rushdie criticism, and aims to show that characterisation and the thematic components of the female characters are of essence to a postcolonial counter-discourse. The thesis draws on general postcolonial theory alongside narrative theory and particularly James Phelan s theory on character...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine the current {{limitations}} for literature {{with respect to}} {{freedom of speech and}} self-censorship. I draw a line from the obscenity trials of James Joyce s Ulysses and D. H. Lawrence s Lady Chatterley s Lover, through the controversies of religion and cultural belonging around Salman <b>Rushdie</b> <b>s</b> The Satanic Verses and Monica Ali s Brick Lane, and up to the more recent court cases of Åsne Seierstad s The Bookseller of Kabul. I demonstrate that there are now essentially two ways in which literature challenges the limits for freedom of expression in the West. The first is literature that is offensive to religion, particularly Islam. I examine how the politics of outrage has led to an increased likelihood that writers will self-censor and avoid religious themes. I then look at the legal limits between freedom of speech and rights of privacy by examining the lawsuit against Seierstad, filed by one of the individuals she portrayed in The Bookseller of Kabul. Although the book is a work of non- fiction, it is written in literary form, and I examine how this begins to erase the border between fiction and non-fiction...|$|E
40|$|Adopting {{the concept}} of {{diaspora}} {{to the experience of}} people of Indian subcontinental origin dispersed in other areas, Nelson uses this paradigm to analyze Indian expatriate writing. In Reworlding, he has commissioned fouteent critical essays that examine such diverse areas of the diaspora as the South Pacific, The Caribbean, Singapore, Britain, North America, and Africa and such representative writers as Salman <b>Rushdie,</b> V. <b>S.</b> Naipaul, Kamala Markandaya, Bharati Mukherjee, and Raja Rao. Underlying this international body of literature is the haunting presence of India and the anguish of personal loss that generate an aesthetics of "reworlding. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the translator’s decisions regarding elements of foreign culture as {{examples from the}} novels Memory of my Melancholy Whores by G. G. Marquez and Fury by <b>S.</b> <b>Rushdie,</b> both in three translations. In the theoretical part the established term Ausgangskultur (source culture) is replaced by Bezugskultur (culture of reference) {{in order to avoid}} suggestion of granted identity between culture and language. It is shown that all translators in general aim at the reader’s conformity but are not consequent at all regarding the strategy of rendering the elements of foreign culture. The technique overrules the strategy; each of the analyzed translations contains transportations of foreign elements, explanations of the latter and cases of their replacing by domestic phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 20 th century, {{particularly}} after the Cold War ended, national borderlines have been redrawn many times in the areas of the Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and a wide range of Asia, and people started crossing national borderlines to immigrate to other countries. As a result, the definition of a modern nation with one ethnicity, one language, and one culture collapsed. Under the policy of multiculturalism, Australia accepts immigrants from all over the world, and Australian literature at present is characterized as being ethnically, culturally, and linguistically hybrid. In this paper I look at Australian writers such as Brian Castro and Nam Le and compare them with other writers who are considered post-colonial writers, such as Salman <b>Rushdie,</b> V. <b>S.</b> Naipaul and Kazuo Ishiguro. I focus on how these writers attempt to present their identities along with their subjectivities. I also compare them with a Japanese writer, Haruki Murakami, whose literary works are widely read throughout the world, crossing cultural, ethnic, and language barriers, even though he writes in Japanese and has a mono-cultural background. I investigate the reason why Murakami’s works are accepted by many contemporary readers worldwide. I finally explore the meaning of national identity and subjectivity in the globalizing world, and clarify the transformation of modern literature...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{background}} {{of two of the}} most important writers of contemporary fiction, J. M. Coetzee and Salman Rushdie, as well as a close analysis of a major work from both authors: Salman <b>Rushdie</b> <b>s</b> Shame (1983) and J. M. Coetzee s Disgrace (1999). I have also tried to investigate the ways in which Rushdie and Coetzee, both writers in exile, have imagined the society in turmoil: in the case of Rushdie, it is the creation of Pakistan and that nation s early tumultuous years, while Coetzee s Disgrace is a critique of the discursive practices (both private and public) of the new South Africa and a lamentation on the post-apartheid state s inability to reconcile the past with the present. Using a close analysis of parts of both Shame and Disgrace, I have tried to focus on the social and political context of these particular historical moments. In Shame, the Rushdie/narrator figure reflects {{on the role of the}} migrant and the right to speak for the postcolonial nation; in Disgrace, the protagonist represents the old South Africa and the presence of confession, redemption, and complicity in white South African identity...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the main {{arguments}} of the Manifeste pour une littérature-monde en français and to emphasize some critical implications that are not only limited to the so-called francophonie, but that define a contemporary way of characterizing supranational spaces. Indeed, this manifesto presents a paradox: it criticizes the francophonie, a transnational space, because of its lack of transnationalism. However, one can understand this paradox by considering the main point of this text that superimposes a global imaginary on the linguistic criterion. According to this juxtaposition, {{the use of a}} language can never be subsumed by a sharply delineated geographical space, because in the era of globalization this kind of space is fluid, liquid – it is permanently redrawn by the mobility of the writers and their imaginary. Through the example of some paradigmatic writers, like K. Ishiguro, A. Mabanckou, A. Neuman or <b>S.</b> <b>Rushdie,</b> we will demonstrate that this liquid transnationalism is particularly relevant for theorizing and modeling the nomadism or the in-betweenness of so many contemporary authors. We will also prove that this liquidity leads to a maximization of the transnationalism since it makes possible the enlargement of every transnational space to the global world...|$|R
40|$|Writers like A. Piperno, M. Houellebecq, P. Roth, J. Ellroy, <b>S.</b> <b>Rushdie,</b> R. Mistry, G. Swift, A. S. Byatt, P. Carey {{are some}} of the most {{important}} narrators of the last thirty years. They all have devoted large parts of their recent production to the narration of whole periods of the history of their respective countries. In the last twenty years, the topic of the rewriting of history has been the almost exclusive prerogative of postcolonial criticism. But today it is not only the English ex-colonies that are trying to rewrite their histories, but also the motherland England itself. What is then the point, for the West, of digging up the past in such an obsessive way? Digging up the past seems for the mass media the only instrument capable of reasserting their specific role against the new digital media. The aim of this book is to attempt to understand whether there is an exclusive specificity of the novel in the rewriting of history and in the choice of historical periods used as settings, and why from the Eighties on literature has taken increasingly to retelling the past. This book is the result of collaboration between a group of academics interested in literatures in English and a group of mediologists interested in the sociology of cultural processes. The collaboration grew first of all out of an awareness that it is no longer possible to study literature, and especially contemporary literature, in anything other than a global horizon and in relation to the multimedial environments that permeate it. Secondly, it grew out of the conviction that, contrary to what a large part of current mediology claims, a medium like that of literature still has an important and irreplaceable social function: for example, it can help today´s society re-order, redefine or even recreate its relationship with collective memory by inventing original and hitherto unthought of points of view...|$|R
