30|$|The {{evaluation}} of the medium properties defined in the staggered-grid system requires appropriate averaging of the medium parameters defined on the neighboring grids. In this code, all medium properties (relaxed medium parameters λ _R and μ _R, density ρ, and attenuation parameters τ ^P and τ ^S) are defined on the same grid as the normal stress components (Fig.  3). Averaging of the density on neighboring grids is necessary when evaluating the velocity, Eq. (1), and averaging the relaxed <b>rigidity</b> <b>modulus</b> is necessary when evaluating the shear stress components and the accompanying memory variables (Eqs.  5, 6). For the averaging, we adopted an arithmetic and a harmonic averaging for the density and the relaxed <b>rigidity</b> <b>modulus,</b> respectively. Notice that no averaging is necessary for λ _R because it is used only for updating the normal stress components.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{coupling}} between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion {{systems is}} known to affect {{the stability of the}} adhesive status of cells, as well as tissue cohesion. In this work, we perform quantitative assays of integrin-cadherin cross talk in controlled and reproducible conditions. This is achieved by plating cells on microprinted fibronectin patterns of different sizes, and simulating the formation of an intercellular contact with a microbead coated with E-cadherin extracellular domains and brought to the cell membrane. Using an optical trap, we measure the average <b>rigidity</b> <b>modulus</b> of the E-cadherin bead-cell contact {{as a function of the}} contact incubation time and of the cell spreading area. For a given incubation time, this <b>rigidity</b> <b>modulus</b> decreases by three orders of magnitude as the cell-matrix contact area, A, increases from 100 to 700 μm 2. In a similar way, the dynamics of formation of the bead-cell contact gets slower as this area increases. This is clear evidence for a strong negative feedback from cell-fibronectin onto cell-cell adhesive contacts, for which we discuss some possible mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|We present {{systematic}} {{investigations of}} buckling in Langmuir monolayers of polyvinyl acetate formed at the air-water interface. On compression the polymer monolayers are {{converted to a}} continuous membrane with a thickness of ~ 2 – 3 nm of well-defined periodicity, lambdab. Above a certain surface concentration the membrane undergoes a morphological transition buckling, leading {{to the formation of}} striped patterns. The periodicity seems to depend on molecular weight as per the predictions of the gravity-bending buckling formalism of Milner et al. for fluidlike films on water. However anomalously low values of bending <b>rigidity</b> and Young's <b>modulus</b> are obtained using this formalism. Hence we have considered an alternative model of buckling-based solidlike films on viscoelastic substrates. The values of bending <b>rigidity</b> and Young's <b>modulus</b> obtained by this method, although lower than expected, are closer to the bulk values. Remarkably, no buckling is found to occur above a certain molecular weight. We have tried to explain the observed molecular-weight dependence in terms of the variation in isothermal compressive modulus of the monolayers with surface concentration as well as provided possible explanations for the obtained low values of mechanical properties similar to that observed for ultrathin polymer films...|$|R

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to bulk modulus, shear modulus measures {{the resistance to}} shape change at a constant volume, {{taking into account the}} crystalline plane and direction of shear. The shear modulus G is defined as ratio of shear stress to shear strain: G = stress/strain = F·L/(A·dx), where F is the applied force, A is the area upon which the force acts, dx is the resulting displacement and L is the initial length. The larger the shear modulus, the greater the ability for a material to resist sharing forces. Therefore, the shear modulus is a measure of <b>rigidity.</b> Shear <b>modulus</b> is related to bulk modulus as 3/G [...] 2B(1 − 2v)(1 + v), where v is the Poisson’s ratio, which is typically ~0.1 in covalent materials.
