5|$|As Representative Mark Larson {{neared the}} end of his term-limited tenure in the Colorado House of Representatives, Roberts began to work with him on {{learning}} the legislative process, in preparation for seeking elected office herself. She instigated a bill, introduced by Larson and eventually signed into law, to <b>require</b> <b>that</b> remains be handled in accordance with the wishes of the deceased. She also lobbied the legislature, unsuccessfully, for the creation of an interim committee to study palliative care.|$|E
5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria <b>require</b> <b>that</b> symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E
5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} <b>require</b> <b>that</b> all persons are treated alike, {{but rather that}} all persons in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which <b>require</b> <b>that</b> some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it. The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E
50|$|Article 7 of the Convention <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> {{employers}} {{take measures}} {{to minimize the}} risk of disease. This includes having good ventilation in all locations of the mine in which miners come in contact with. The Convention also <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> the working environment is monitored for hazards that can induce disease. Finally, article 5 <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> countries publish statistics on occupational disease (included black lung).|$|R
50|$|By {{dividing}} the two {{conditions in the}} definition, one can define left quasi-abelian categories by <b>requiring</b> <b>that</b> cokernels are stable under pullbacks and right quasi-abelian categories by <b>requiring</b> <b>that</b> kernels stable under pushouts.|$|R

5|$|Level {{of effort}} defines {{particular}} goals or objectives the recipient must achieve {{with the assistance}} received, and includes recipient requirements for a specified level of service, specified level of expenditures for designated activities, and federal funds to supplement and not supplant non-federal services.

5|$|Loading and {{unloading}} a bulker is {{time-consuming and}} dangerous. The process is planned by the ship's chief mate under {{the direct and}} continued supervision of ship's captain. International regulations <b>require</b> <b>that</b> the captain and terminal master agree on a detailed plan before operations begin. Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship to capsize or break in half at the pier.|$|E
5|$|Many {{parallel}} programs <b>require</b> <b>that</b> their subtasks act in synchrony. This {{requires the}} use of a barrier. Barriers are typically implemented using a software lock. One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, altogether avoids {{the use of}} locks and barriers. However, this approach is generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.|$|E

5|$|Since 1 April 2006, the International Association of Classification Societies {{has adopted}} the Common Structural Rules. The rules apply to bulkers more than 90meters {{in length and}} <b>require</b> <b>that</b> scantlings' {{calculations}} take into account items such as the effect of corrosion, the harsh conditions often found in the North Atlantic, and dynamic stresses during loading. The rules also establish margins for corrosion, from 0.5 to 0.9mm.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette's has emerged, {{in which}} {{biological}} vulnerability and adverse environmental events {{are seen to}} interact. In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association published the DSM-IV-TR, revising the text of DSM-IV to no longer <b>require</b> <b>that</b> symptoms of tic disorders cause distress or impair functioning, recognizing that clinicians often see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
5|$|Some {{national}} standards <b>require</b> <b>that</b> the cylinder valve includes a bursting disk, a {{pressure relief device}} that will release the gas before the cylinder fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in good condition, on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.|$|E

If G is extra special but does not have exponent p, then the general construction below applied to the symplectic vector space G/Z does not yield a group isomorphic to G.|$|R

5|$|The best {{interests}} of society <b>require</b> <b>that</b> causes of action should not be deferred an unreasonable time. This remark is peculiarly applicable to land titles. Nothing so much retards the growth and prosperity of a country as insecurity of titles to real estate. Labor is paralysed where the enjoyment of its fruits is uncertain; and litigation without limit produces ruinous consequences to individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{church does}} not <b>require</b> <b>that</b> Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, {{physicians}} for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian-Science prayer {{is most effective}} when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led {{to the deaths of}} several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect.|$|E

5|$|The {{matching}} rules {{can be described}} in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and <b>require</b> <b>that</b> adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|The pony is {{typically}} a 2- to 5-litre cylinder. Its capacity determines {{the depth of}} dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection. Ponies may be fixed to the diver's buoyancy compensator (BC) or main cylinder behind the diver's back, or can be clipped to the harness at the diver's side or chest or carried as a sling cylinder. Ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency gas supply but <b>require</b> <b>that</b> the diver is trained to use them.|$|E

Article 11(2) <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> public authorities exist (for instance, the Competition and Markets Authority or the Bundesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit).
