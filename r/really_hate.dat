Because possibly I don't like myself", and later said [...] "I hate acting, <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> it. I kind of fell into it sideways ... I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support". She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.|$|E
500|$|Scandinavian punk was {{propelled}} {{early on}} by tour dates by bands {{such as the}} Clash and the Ramones (both in Stockholm in May 1977), and the Sex Pistols' tour through Denmark, Sweden and Norway in July the same year. The band Briard jump-started Finnish punk with its November 1977 single [...] "I <b>Really</b> <b>Hate</b> Ya"/"I Want Ya Back"; other early Finnish punk acts included Eppu Normaali and singer Pelle Miljoona. The first Swedish punk single was [...] "Vårdad klädsel"/"Förbjudna ljud" [...] released by Kriminella Gitarrer in February 1978, which started an extensive Swedish punk scene featuring act such as Ebba Grön, KSMB, Rude Kids, Besökarna, Liket Lever, Garbochock, Attentat, and many others. Within a couple of years, hundreds of punk singles were released in Sweden.|$|E
500|$|Oakley and Weinstein {{decided to}} include Abe in the episode {{because they had}} an [...] "obsession" [...] with old people. Weinstein said they both [...] "love them and seem to <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> them" [...] at the same time. He also said that they enjoy writing for {{characters}} such as Abe and Mr. Burns because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because he and Oakley get to use dictionaries for looking up [...] "old time slang". Executive producer David Mirkin thought {{it was difficult to}} make Abe funny because he is a [...] "boring and tedious" [...] character. He thinks that even though [...] "Abe's doing all these complaints, what makes him funny is that the things he says are actually funny {{in the context of the}} boring and tedium." [...] Mirkin thought this was a [...] "big challenge, and Bill and Josh pulled it off very well." ...|$|E

500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E

Her parents {{divorced}} when she was young, and she {{claimed to have been}} physically and verbally abused by her stepmother. [...] In the documentary, Not Bad for a Girl (1995), Bjelland revealed: [...] "You know, I <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> to talk about it because she's great now, but in my childhood she was very abusive... like I said, though, it probably did help my creativity a lot. I was always grounded. I hate to talk about it because I feel like she doesn't think that she did it, but she was [...] and it influenced my life quite a great deal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yes, but I don't like it. I {{have to do}} it, but I don't like it at {{all because}} I don't like the kind of voice I have. I <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> {{listening}} to myself! The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording San Giovanni Battista by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. They made me listen to the tape and I cried my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything, to give up singing... Also now even though I don't like my voice, I've become able to accept it and to be detached and objective about it so I can say, [...] "Oh, that was really well sung," [...] or [...] "It was nearly perfect." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Simpsons writer Al Jean {{commented that}} Grampa {{is often the}} focus of pointed jokes about old people. He said {{the reason for that}} is because the staff is trying to {{illustrate}} how society mistreats the elderly, [...] "and some of it is because people over 55 never watch our show". Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former writers on the show, said that they liked to write episodes about Grampa because they are [...] "obsessed" [...] with old people. Weinstein commented that they [...] "both love [...] and seem to <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> them at the same time". He also said that he [...] "enjoys" [...] writing for characters such as Grampa and Mr. Burns because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because he gets to use dictionaries for looking up [...] "old time slang".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to this, members of certain deathcore bands {{do not take}} a liking to being labeled [...] "deathcore".

And if anyone calls us 'deathcore' then I might do something very bad to them." [...] While {{in an interview with}} Justin Longshore from Through the Eyes of the Dead about the deathcore label, he said [...] "You know, I <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> that term. I know we've been labeled as that but I think there's so much more to our music than just a mixture of death metal and hardcore (sic) even though we incorporate those elements in our music.

2500|$|In part, {{the tension}} {{resulted}} from the historical coincidence of the first viable African American presidential candidate and the first viable woman candidate, running {{against each other in}} the same nomination race. One South Carolina pastor lamented that he had been waiting all his life for either [...] "first" [...] to happen and said, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> that they had to run {{at the same time in}} the same election. It just makes what should be a wonderful situation very stressful for folk like me. I never imagined you could have too much of a good thing." [...] After the Clinton-Obama tension on this matter, one Democrat said, [...] "After Iowa, Obama was the post-racial candidate who appealed to all of our better natures.

2500|$|On August 10, the Cardinals and Reds had a nasty brawl at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati.

[...] Jason LaRue suffered a severe concussion after being {{kicked in the}} face by Reds pitcher Johnny Cueto, leading the Cardinals to call up minor-league catcher Steven Hill for his big-league debut. Jeff Suppan {{was placed on the}} DL with groin soreness unrelated to the brawl. The Cardinals swept the Reds in three games, dealing Cincinnati its first series loss since the All-Star Break and retaking sole possession of first place in the NL Central. In the third game, Wainwright held the Reds to two hits over seven shutout innings, dropping his ERA to 1.99. [...] LaRue, still suffering from his concussion, was sent to the DL on the 13th.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the magical}} realist writers, the McOndos wrote [...] "here-and-now!" [...] fiction, about the 21st-century world they inhabit, and which {{surrounds}} them, and the homogenizing cultural-identity messages of pervasive mass communications media; to be Latin in an Anglo culture. Because contemporary Latin America {{is a cultural}} conflation of the 19th and 21st centuries, the McOndos substantive and technical divergence from Magical Realism (style, narrative mode, etc.) voided their predecessor traditions. Alberto Fuguet explains, [...] "I feel [...] the great literary theme of ‘Latin American identity’ (who are we?) must now {{take a back seat}} to the theme of ‘personal identity’ (who am I?)." [...] Whilst rejecting the resultant stereotype [...] "Latin American Literature" [...] derived from Magical Realism, the McOndos nonetheless respect the man; [...] "I’m a really big fan of Márquez, but, what I <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> is the software he created, that other people use [...] [...] [...] they turn [...] into more of an aesthetic [...] instead of an ideology.

After brother Kyle led 53 laps of the event, Kurt dominated the race leading for 102 laps and driving in the top ten. With about 75 laps left in the race Busch again crashed with Ryan Newman. Busch's crew fixed the car before the restart and got back on the track, but finished about 20 laps down. Kyle Busch, who finished in second spot in the race, stood up for Kurt as well as drivers such as David Gilliland, Danica Patrick and Kenseth. With his brother, Kyle spent the post-race ceremonies insulting Ryan Newman for his part in the accident. Kyle said to reporters [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> that Kurt got tore up. He was the class of the race but man just stupidity. Ryan Newman is the biggest stupid idiot out there and is a big ogre. But we are all glad that he is out of a job." [...] It had been previously announced at nearly {{the same time as the}} post-race ceremonies, that Ryan Newman would not be a part of Stewart-Haas Racing in 2014. Newman just smiled when he heard these words and said [...] "They are both a heck of talent and both are good kids off the track but when they are on the track they are both not so bright.
