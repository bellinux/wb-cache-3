40|$|In {{order to}} prove that the {{technique}} is capable of giving reproducible results the complete stress-strain relations for two nearly identical Celanese fibres have been obtained. The fibres differed somewhat in cross-section area. This introduces a difference in <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stressing.</b> A correction for this has been developed and applied. In the plastic region where pronounced shear slip is expected the stress-strain curve is found to be made up of a series of straight line segments, along any given, one of which the strain. hardening is proportional to the elongation. A change in rate of strain introduces errors which the simple Max-well relaxation law cannot account for...|$|E
40|$|In general, clayey soils exhibit {{more or less}} both creep and swelling. In this paper, "creep" means viscous {{compression}} under {{a constant}} load condition in an oedometer test, while "swelling" means viscous expansion under a constant load condition in an oedometer test and is a reverse behaviour to creep for all saturated soils. Clayey soils containing the clay mineral montmorillonite show strong creep and swelling characteristics. Both creep and swelling characteristics have a significant influence on the deformation and failure of geotechnical structures. This paper presents main data from tests on a mixture of bentonite-silica sand in one-dimensional (1 D) straining. Tests include (i) multistaged loading tests with unloading-reloading and enough time for creep and swelling in 1 D straining and (ii) step-changed constant rate of strain (CRSN) compression tests with unloading-reloading in 1 D straining as well. From the test data, the creep, swelling, and strain rate effects are observed and discussed. Based on the test data and a 1 D elastic viscoplastic (1 D EVP) model developed by Yin and Graham (1989, 1994), the authors propose a new 1 D elastic viscoplastic model considering both creep and swelling (called 1 D EVPS). The data from the multistage oedometer tests are used to calibrate the new model. After this, the new model is used to simulate the step-changed CRSN compression tests and make a comparison. In this way, the new model is verified. The new 1 D EVPS is then used to simulate CRSN tests with a single strain rate, relaxation in the creep or swelling region, and constant <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stressing</b> tests. It is found that the new model can simulate well the strain (or stress) rate effects, loops in unloading-reloading, and stress relaxation in the creep region or stress increase in the swelling region, which are all caused by both creep and swelling of the soil.

40|$|Abstract—The goal of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the vis-coelastic behavior of the rabbit medial collateral ligament (MCL) at multiple levels of strain (between 0 % and» 5 %) and their corre-sponding stresses (between 0 and » 55 MPa) for stress relaxation and creep, respectively. We hypothesized that in the rabbit MCL the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> relaxation would be strain dependent and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> creep would be stress dependent. Thirty MCLs from 15 rabbits were tested ex vivo for this study. Results show that within the physiologically relevant region of ligament behavior, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> relaxation is strain dependent in the rabbit MCL, with the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> relaxation decreasing with increasing tissue strain. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> creep is <b>stress</b> dependent in the rabbit MCL, with the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> creep decreasing with increasing stress. These results support our hypothesis, with the greatest nonlinearities in a physiologically relevant region of loading.

40|$|The {{flexural}} strength of sea ice in situ {{was measured by}} a cantilever method. The measurement was carried out every February from 1963. The thickness of ice was 23 ~ 30 cm. The width of the beam was 30 ~ 40 cm. The length was 1. 5 ~ 2 m. The surface temperature of the beam was- 2. 0 ~. - 3. rc, the mean temperature was-O. 8 ~- 2. 5 °C and the chrolinity was 2. 6 ~ 7. 5 %o. Both upward and downward bending forces were applied manually by a wooden lever with various speeds. The force was measured by an electric load-cell and was recorded with an oscil-lograph. The acceleration of the bending at the free end of the beam was also measured with an accelometer and also recorded. The deflection of the beam was obtained by integrating the acceleration. The increasing <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the tensile <b>stress</b> at {{the surface of the}} supporting end of the beam was O. 1 ~ 30 kg/cm 2 ·sec.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we studied}} the {{viscoelastic}} behav-iors of isolated aortic elastin using combined modeling and experimental approaches. Biaxial stress relaxation and creep experiments {{were performed to}} study the time-dependent behavior of elastin. Experimental results reveal that stress relaxation preconditioning is {{necessary in order to}} obtain repeatable stress relaxation responses. Elastin exhibits less stress relaxation than intact or decellularized aorta. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> relaxation <b>of</b> intact and decellularized aorta is line-arly dependent on the initial <b>stress</b> levels. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> relaxation for elastin increases linearly at stress levels below about 60 kPa; however, the rate changes very slightly at higher initial stress levels. Experimental results also show that creep response is negligible for elastin, and the intact or decellularized aorta. A quasi-linear viscoelasticity model was incorporated into a statistical mechanics based eight-chain microstructural model at the fiber level to simulate the orthotropic viscoelastic behavior of elastin. A user material subroutine was developed for finite element analysis. Results demonstrate that this model is suitable to capture both the orthotropic hyperelasticity and viscoelasticity of elastin...|$|R
