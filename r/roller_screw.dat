40|$|International audienceThe {{promises}} of Model Based Design {{have led to}} the development of numerous methodologies and software tools, especially for the specific or detailed design stages, from controller design to finite element analysis. However, the Model Based Design of actuation systems lacks methodologies and expressive simulation models that are suited to preliminary design, where key technical decisions are taken considering various design alternatives and few available design details. In order to fill this gap, the present paper illustrates how scaling laws and acausal modelling can be used as a design tool, exploiting inverse simulation capabilities to evaluate technological alternatives quantitatively from limited design detail information. The application of the modelling approach is shown for two major components of mechanical transmission systems: roller bearings and ball and <b>roller</b> <b>screws.</b> The scaling laws presented are validated with manufacturers' data. To conclude, the suitability of the proposed methodology is illustrated with the preliminary sizing of an electromechanical actuator for an aircraft primary flight control surface (aileron) ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>roller</b> <b>screw</b> is a {{mechanical}} actuator {{similar to a}} ball screw that uses rollers as the load transfer elements between nut and screw instead of balls. The rollers are typically threaded but may also be grooved depending on <b>roller</b> <b>screw</b> type. Providing more bearing points than ball screws within a given volume, roller screws can be more compact for a given load capacity while providing similar efficiency (75%-90%) at low to moderate speeds, and maintain relatively high efficiency at high speeds. Roller screws can surpass ball screws in regard to positioning precision, load rating, rigidity, speed, acceleration, and lifetime.

40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the <b>roller</b> <b>screws</b> (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS parts are <b>screw,</b> thread <b>rollers</b> and female <b>screw</b> which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the male <b>screw,</b> <b>rollers</b> and female <b>screw</b> thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing thread pieces it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread pitch diameters. For the male thread this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with preferred diameter. Such wires are available at the factories of the Russian Federation and are represented in AllUnion State Standard 2475 - 88 for the standard thread (metric, trapeziform and others), and they are not available for the RS pieces special thread. It was proposed for the RS pieces male thread pitch diameter control to use the standard wires, the diameter of which is the next larger to the necessary preferred diameter of the RS piece controlled thread. The article presents the preferred diameters of the wires for the RS thread pieces control with employed pitch of the special thread. The dependencies for sizing up of the RS pieces male <b>screw</b> and <b>roller</b> pitch diameter dimension control is deduced by utilizing the wires of unspecified diameter, including preferred diameter. In view of the RS potential it is required to set up in Russia the production of wires with preferred diameters for the RS pieces male thread control.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in development of machine engineering is to improve load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also relevant to the most promising items so far, i. e. orbital roller drives (ORD), which are the rotational-to-progressive motion converters widely used in vehicles. The previously published article suggested increasing a load capacity (by about 15 %) through reducing a thread turn section angle of the threaded ORD components and change of the radius of roller thread turn section outline. Due to such ORD modification, a number {{of the most}} critical ORD parameters are to be changed thereby demanding further research. Further, the article published suggests a method considering the abovementioned changes to calculate the dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges. Though this method being not complete as the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing in relation to its rated value, required for assembly, is unknown; and to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment, outer diameters of the <b>roller</b> and <b>screw</b> threads are to be known. Hence, these two methods are interconnected. This article presents the numerical calculation method, mathematical support and method to determine the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing and initial contact point of the mating <b>roller</b> and <b>screw</b> thread turns. Due to considerable scope of calculations, the method was turned into the software. Similar calculation methods and techniques were developed to a particular case, where the thread turn section angle of the threaded components was of 90 °, and the roller thread turn section outline was a circular arc centered to the roller axis. Hence the developed numerical calculation method, mathematical support and technique refer to the general case which is to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment and initial contact point of the mating <b>roller</b> and <b>screw</b> thread turns. Taking this into account, the calculations for a particular case were performed as test calculations during the software development. The results obtained matched the calculation results for a particular case published in several papers. Using a developed calculation technique, the calculation method to determine dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges may be completed for a general case considering the arbitrary turn section angle of threaded ORD components and radius of roller thread turn section outline. </p...|$|R

The original gear design {{with a number of}} peculiarities and precision accuracy in manufacturing its essential details, first of all, thread ones allow us to have high operating parameters of RS. Errors of manufacturing special thread of such details greatly affect the load carrying capacity, precision, reliability, and endurance of RS. That is why the challenge is highly accurate metrological control of errors, which have the greatest influence on specified parameters, and processing of measurement results. Major errors include deviations of real pitch of thread from nominal ones and deviations of real thread profiles from nominal ones. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine abovementioned errors, which were measured by high-precision computerized devices, namely: MITUTOYO CV- 2000 contour measurement instrument; Form Talysurf PGI 420 contour measurement instrument. Both have a measurement range of 100 mm and resolution of 0. 2 μm. As far as a rental cost of the contour measurement instrument was rather high and a software of this device did not allow us to obtain all required information on the thread profile errors of interest, a thread profile was measured using a contour measuring device on the sampling length. Measurement results were copied to the USB flash drive, and then conversion of obtained results and calculation of all errors of interest were carried out on ECM by means of specially designed software. For example, when using a contour measurement instrument MITUTOYO CV- 2000, to make measurement of RS screw on the sampling length of 100 mm along one path, the longitudinal and transverse coordinates of 57411 points of thread profile were obtained. Specially developed mathematical support was used as the basis for software. Programs written in Delphi language have been sent to the Federal Institute for Industrial Property of the RF for registration. Calculation results represent information on the left and right side of each turn of measured detail and final parameters for all measured turns.

5000|$|In 2006, Charles C. Cornelius and Shawn P. Lawlor {{received}} a patent for a cage-less recirculating <b>roller</b> <b>screw</b> system. [...] As {{with the traditional}} recirculating <b>roller</b> <b>screw</b> system, rollers disengage from the screw when they come upon an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. The system differs in that the rollers are continually engaged by the nut, and the axial groove of the nut is threaded. Non-helical threads in the axial groove of the nut return the roller to its axial starting position (after completion of an orbit). Non-circular compression rings, or cam rings, at opposite ends of the rollers (roller axles) apply constant pressure between rollers and nut, synchronizing roller rotation and thrusting the rollers into the nut's axial groove. Lacking ring gears and roller cage, cage-less recirculating roller screws can be relatively efficient and, as a result, permit higher dynamic capacities for some screw shaft diameters.|$|E
