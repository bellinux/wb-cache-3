Moms packed their favorite home baked cookies into Tupperware containers and carried them to cookie swap parties with friends and neighbors. <b>Red</b> <b>plastic</b> cutters replaced tin cutters {{during the war years}} when metal was scarce and can be found today at garage sales and flea markets.|$|E
25|$|Each {{model was}} sold in {{stackable}} <b>red</b> <b>plastic</b> garages, with clear removable top and sides. The model would slide out of a double hinged opening door to one end. This was {{in place of the}} usual cardboard box. Some Mini-Dinkys were also blister packaged in a dark grey pack (some with garage and some not) with bright yellow lettering (Mini Dinky 2011).|$|E

25|$|The typical Chairman Mao badges of the Cultural Revolution {{period were}} made from an {{aluminium}} base, either coloured gold or left silver, covered with a <b>red</b> <b>plastic</b> pattern, to produce a red and gold or a red and silver design. Other colours were also used sometimes, such as yellow for a field of sunflowers as a background to Mao. In addition to the typical aluminium and plastic badges, badges were also made in other materials, such as porcelain, bamboo, perspex and plastic, but these made up {{only a tiny fraction}} of the total number of badges produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{third and}} final series focused on a {{different}} character each week but with the overlaps creating a more complex layering of the plot, more akin to a one-off episode of a situation comedy (albeit with intertwined plots) than a traditional sketch show. The end of each episode features a white van swerving to avoid a pedestrian and crashing into a garden wall. Some residents escape unharmed, while others are not so lucky. A <b>red</b> <b>plastic</b> bag is seen being blown by the wind through the town in every episode, indicating that all the stories occur simultaneously. It is the only series {{that does not include}} a laugh track.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, February 23, 1985 {{during a}} game at Bloomington between Purdue and Indiana, just five minutes into the game, a {{scramble}} for a loose ball resulted in a foul call on Indiana's Marty Simmons. Immediately after the resumption of play, a foul was called on Indiana's Daryl Thomas. Knight, irate, insisted {{the first of the}} two calls should have been for a jump ball and ultimately received a technical foul. Purdue's Steve Reid stepped to the free throw line to shoot the resulting free throws, but before he could, Knight grabbed a <b>red</b> <b>plastic</b> chair from Indiana's bench and threw it across the floor toward the basket in front of Reid. Knight was charged with second and third technical fouls and was ejected from the game. He apologized for his actions the next day and was given a one-game suspension and two years probation from the Big Ten. Since the incident, Knight has occasionally joked about throwing the chair by saying that he saw an old lady standing on the opposite sideline and threw her the chair so she could sit down.|$|E
5000|$|From 1943 a {{small red}} {{cardboard}} box was presented usually containing two gold and <b>red</b> coloured <b>plastic</b> pin-backed badges bearing {{the design of}} a sword in a wreath, surmounted by a crown.

500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, kaiso, a form of stage-presented calypso pioneered in Trinidad, was widespread at crop over and other celebrations. [...] The foundation of the National Cultural Foundation in 1984 helped to promote and administer calypso festivals, which attracted tourists, stimulating the calypso industry. As a result, calypso has become a very visible and iconic part of Barbadian culture, and some calypsonians have become internationally renowned, including Mighty Gabby and <b>Red</b> <b>Plastic</b> Bag.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{attaching}} a reflector {{sight to}} a firearm {{has been around}} since its invention in 1900. Soon after World War II models appeared for rifles and shotguns including the Nydar shotgun sight (1945), which used a curved semi-reflective mirror to reflect an ambient lit reticle, and the Giese electric gunsight (1947), which had a battery-powered illuminated reticle. Later types included the Qwik-Point (1970) and the Thompson Insta-Sight. Both were beam-splitter type reflector sights that used ambient light: illuminating a green crosshair in the Insta-Sight, and a <b>red</b> <b>plastic</b> rod [...] "light pipe" [...] that produced a red aiming spot reticle in the Qwik-Point.|$|E
500|$|The {{laughing}} gas {{has been in}} desperately short supply at Holby of late. [...] What they really need is {{for someone to come}} along and prove that heart transplants can be fun. It's a job for comedy cardiac specialist Percy Durant (guest star Ade Edmondson), who we last saw working out in Ghana with consultant Ric. You could easily imagine Percy driving around in a van with a big, <b>red,</b> <b>plastic</b> heart on top of it, or cracking open someone's chest and pulling out a bunch of flowers.

500|$|Before {{the actors}} {{went before the}} cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied {{directly}} to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. Welles was allergic to Max Factor's gum, so Seiderman invented an alternative that also photographed more realistically. The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible <b>red</b> <b>plastic</b> compound; Cotten recalled being instructed to puff out his cheeks during this process. Later, seeing the results in the mirror, Cotten told Seiderman, [...] "I am acting {{the part of a}} nice old gentleman, not a relief map of the Rocky Mountains."

2500|$|The Camry {{was given}} a {{facelift}} in 1994 for the 1995 model year. Minor exterior changes included a revised front fascia with different front turn signals and reshaped headlamps. Additionally, the rear fascia was updated, now with body-coloured plastic between the tail lamps where the model name [...] "Camry" [...] was printed. This was instead of the <b>red</b> <b>plastic</b> on higher trim levels and black plastic on lower trim levels of the 1992 to 1994 models. The tail lamps themselves were also slightly different. Another change, this time mechanical came in 1996; the 2.2-liter engine was detuned slightly to [...] to meet stricter emissions standards. Additionally, in 1996 the cam angle sensor in the distributor was also replaced with a crank angle sensor to achieve a smoother idle.|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the body}} was the cap from a bottle of [...] "Sierra Silver" [...] tequila, {{in the shape of}} a <b>red</b> <b>plastic</b> sombrero, and a {{corresponding}} empty bottle was found on the other side of a small path nearby. Near one foot police found another bottle which was tested for traces of an accelerant. Laura Wilcock, a forensic scientist with specialist expertise in examining suspicious fires, concluded that the body could have been burning for up to seven hours, and very little of it was undamaged by the burning. The palm of the right hand remained relatively undamaged and this was swabbed for DNA evidence. The extensive burning of the body hampered pathologists from ascertaining a cause of death, and Dr. Julia Bell, a forensic pathologist at the University of Glasgow Medical School said that the possibilities for a full post mortem were [...] "limited". Bell said she was unable to completely exclude the possibility that setting the teenager on fire had killed her but believed [...] "the findings [...] not suggestive of this": while the natural instinct of a person on fire would be to move, there was no evidence of this, probably because Nelson was unconscious or dead. Examination of Nelson's respiratory tract did not demonstrate soot in the quantities which would indicate she had still been breathing and scientists had been unable to carry out blood analysis which might have provided further proof.|$|E

When Putin soon sized up the Obama administration's appeasement around the globe—from fake red lines for Syria, to a scramble out of Iraq, to chaos in Libya—he moved into Crimea...As he swallows Eastern Ukraine, he now eyes the Baltic States. He does not quite have a map on his wall of a new czarist Orthodox state the size of the Soviet Union, but he does have a general sense {{that there are a lot}} more former Soviet republics to be had—and he is eager to poke here and there to find out which will be the easiest to grab next." [...] In another 2015 column, Hanson wrote about he sees as Putin's mindset that: [...] "Obama's false step-over, red, and deadlines confirmed Putin's impressions of the continued weak leadership of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry. He probably believes that he can do to Estonia what he has done to Crimea or Ukraine—and without too many more consequences. Putin is not greatly worried that the U.S. will re-energize NATO, rebuild its own nuclear deterrent, work with the Eastern Europeans on missile defense, or start exporting its plentiful natural gas to a Russia-dependent Europe. Right now Putin is digesting Eastern Ukraine and sizing up Obama's responses to others' aggressions. But next year, in the last twelve months of the Obama administration, we should expect him to move on another former Soviet republic, as well as to emphasize new partnerships with China, a few Eastern European or Balkan nations, or an ascendant Iran." ...|$|E
