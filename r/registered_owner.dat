Examiners can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges, and then viable prints can be processed through fingerprint databases for a potential match.|$|E
5|$|On {{checking}} {{records of}} telephone calls {{made to the}} dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone {{it appeared that the}} calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford truck. One call was to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23am {{on the morning of the}} bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their truck in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone's <b>registered</b> <b>owner</b> reported that it had been stolen 17days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered enough evidence to bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.|$|E

25|$|Brimer's {{father-in-law}} was {{a friend}} of Michael J. Meehan (1891–1948), a controversial New York stock speculator who made a small investment in Brimer's operation. When Brimer paid a 25% dividend in 1929, Meehan financed the acquisition of 75% of Good Humor of America for $500,000. Meehan's wife, Elizabeth Higgins Meehan, was the <b>registered</b> <b>owner</b> of the stock along with Mrs. John J. Raskob, the wife of another New York stock speculator.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules for}} {{unregistered}} land remained as before. But under the LRA 2002 Schedule 6, paragraphs 1 to 5, after 10 years the adverse possessor {{is entitled to}} apply to the registrar to become the new <b>registered</b> <b>owner.</b> The registrar then contacts the registered title holder and notifies him of the application. If no proceedings are launched for two years to eject the adverse possessor, only then would the registrar transfer title. Prior to the 2002 Act, a land owner could simply lose title without being aware of it or notified. This was the rule because it indicated the owner had never paid sufficient attention to how the land was in fact being used, and therefore the former owner did not deserve to keep it. Before 2002, time was seen to cure everything. The rule's function was to ensure land was used efficiently.|$|E

25|$|The vehicle {{identification}} number (VIN) plate, a unique serial number used to identify individual motor vehicles, {{had been removed from}} the car's dashboard and the door VIN sticker, but police retrieved the VIN from the bottom of its engine block. The investigators traced the SUV's last <b>registered</b> <b>owner,</b> and the female college student who sold the suspect the Pathfinder. Law enforcement officials recovered the suspect's pre-paid disposable cell phone's number from the cell phone of the seller, and ran it through a number of databases. They determined that the disposable phone had been used for calls to and from a Pakistani telephone number which they knew to be associated with Faisal Shahzad. The phone had also been used to call a fireworks store in rural Pennsylvania. They collected his e-mail address from an email which he sent to the seller’s computer.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} (licensed repair facility) has repaired, {{furnished}} supplies or materials, towed or stored a vehicle {{and has not}} been paid for the services rendered, that person has a lien against the vehicle. The lien arises at the time the <b>registered</b> <b>owner</b> is presented with a written statement of charges for completed work or services. Although if services were performed that were not agreed upon and no written and signed estimate was issued beforehand, a mechanic has no right to keep the title owner from reclaiming the vehicle. If a mechanic asserts a fee that is not reasonably related to the work performed, and refuses to return the vehicle until that price is paid, the owner of the vehicle will be able to recoup a storage fee from the mechanic, as the mechanic is in the wrong for refusing to return the vehicle. In doing so the mechanic would commit the crime of conversion, or embezzlement.|$|E
500|$|Their {{investigation}} {{was led by}} Detective Chief Inspector Gordon Mutch of the Greater Manchester Police (GMP), [...] "astonishingly... the only person ever charged with a criminal offence {{in connection with the}} Manchester bomb". The van's last <b>registered</b> <b>owner</b> told police that he had sold it to a dealer in Peterborough, who had in turn sold the van on to a man calling himself Tom Fox, two weeks before the bombing. After the purchase price was delivered in cash by a taxi driver, the dealer was instructed to take the van to a nearby lorry park, and leave it there with the keys and documents hidden inside.|$|E

Hammer {{was arrested}} on February 21, 2013 in Dublin, California for {{allegedly}} obstructing {{an officer in the}} performance of their duties and resisting an officer (according to [...] "stop and identify" [...] statutes). Hammer claims he was a victim of racial profiling by the police, stating an officer pulled out his gun and randomly asked him: [...] "Are you on parole or probation?" [...] Hammer stated that as he handed over his ID, the officer reached inside the car and tried to pull him out. Police in Dublin, east of Oakland, said Hammer was 'blasting music' in a vehicle with expired registration and he was not the <b>registered</b> <b>owner.</b> [...] "After asking Hammer who the <b>registered</b> <b>owner</b> was, he became very argumentative and refused to answer the officer's questions," [...] police spokesman Herb Walters typed in an e-mail to CNN. Hammer was booked and released from Santa Rita Jail in Dublin. A court date was scheduled, however, all charges were dropped in early March.

40|$|In the post-human rights era the {{question}} has arisen on several occasions {{as to whether the}} automatic and arbitrary termination of the <b>registered</b> <b>owner’s</b> title through the common law and statutory principles governing adverse possession of land is contrary to the Article 1, Protocol 1 of the European Convention. The matter fell to be decided in J. A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd v United Kingdom ([2005] 3 EGLR 1) where the European Court of Human Rights held that the automatic termination of a <b>registered</b> <b>owners</b> title after 12 years possession was indeed a violation of Article 1, Protocol 1. More recently, the decision of the European Court has been overturned by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights where the Grand Chamber has held that a squatters’ right to another persons land are not disproportionate (J. A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd and Another v United Kingdom, The Times, October 1 st 2007). This short article examines the decision of the Grand Chamber...|$|R

2500|$|Facebook {{stated that}} they were the <b>registered</b> <b>owner</b> of the FACEBOOK mark since 2004. Furthermore, they alleged that Power Ventures used the mark in {{connection}} with Power Ventures business. Facebook never authorized or consented to Power Ventures' use of the mark. Facebook also stated that Power Ventures' unauthorized use of the [...] mark was likely to [...] "confuse recipients and lead to the false impression that Facebook is affiliated with, endorses, or sponsors" [...] Power Ventures. Power Ventures countered that Facebook was required to provide concise information in the Complaint with respect to the trademark infringement allegations, including information about each instance of such use. However, since particularized pleading is not required for trademark infringement claims, Facebook's allegations were sufficient to survive Power Ventures' motion to dismiss the trademark infringement claim.|$|E
2500|$|A {{registered}} trademark confers {{a bundle of}} exclusive rights upon the <b>registered</b> <b>owner,</b> {{including the right to}} exclusive use of the mark in relation to the products or services for which it is registered. The law in most jurisdictions also allows the owner of a {{registered trademark}} to prevent unauthorized use of the mark in relation to products or services which are identical or [...] "colourfully" [...] similar to the [...] "registered" [...] products or services, and in certain cases, prevent use in relation to entirely dissimilar products or services. The test is always whether a consumer of the goods or services will be confused as to the identity of the source or origin. An example may be a very large multinational brand such as [...] "Sony" [...] where a non-electronic product such as a pair of sunglasses might be assumed to have come from Sony Corporation of Japan despite not being a class of goods that Sony has rights in.|$|E
