Nevertheless, direct human losses caused by RDDs are low and not attributed to the radiological aspect. RDDs are easily fabricated and components readily obtainable. RDDs are comparatively easy to detect with RPMs due to their high level of radioactivity. RDDs emit gamma radiation as well as sometimes, depending on what isotopes are used, neutrons.|$|R

Focusing on <b>radiological</b> <b>dispersal</b> <b>devices</b> (RDD) will provide increased personnel protection as well as optimize emergency response assets for the general public. An attack involving an RDD has been of particular concern because it is intended to spread contamination over a wide area and cause massive panic within the general population. A rapid method of triage will be necessary to segregate the unexposed and slightly exposed from those needing immediate medical treatment. Because of the aerosol dispersal of the radioactive material, inhalation of the radioactive material may be the primary exposure route. The primary radionuclides likely to be used in a RDD attack are Co- 60, Cs- 137, Ir- 192, Sr- 90 and Am- 241.

There has been a strong demand for producing highly selective, sensitive, responsive, and cost effective sensors. Intensive research activities across the world are in progress for developing new sensing materials and technologies {{with the advent of}} nanotechnology. The risk of nuclear terrorism carried out by terrorist groups should be considered not only in construction and/or use of nuclear devices, but also in possible radioactive contamination of large urban areas.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of fissile or radiological material illegally removed from its site of operation or storage is tremendously {{important in the}} context of the possible threat of nuclear terrorism. The material must be retrieved prior to its potential use in <b>Radiological</b> <b>Dispersal</b> <b>Devices</b> (RDD) or Improvised Nuclear Devices (IND). The process of tracking the material during transport or storage by means of a covert search is preferable to an open search as it does not draw the attention of civilians, thus preventing counter-productive reactions of panic by the general public or even early release by the terrorists. The Fraunhofer-INT has engineered a measurement system with an additional battery powered energy supply which can be integrated in a standard station wagon, featuring built-in gamma and neutron detection techniques as well as portable detection devices. It is therefore well-suited for covert search routines with respect to nuclear or radiological material which is transported across or stored in residential or industrial areas. Realistic case scenarios were investigated where nuclear or radioactive material was concealed on a test area, partly even inside buildings. At first, the rough location of the material was determined by means of the car's built-in detection system from inside the vehicle. Then the search for the exact location was continued on foot, using a portable detector which provides the opportunity to locate and subsequently identify the material in question. This way a thorough search of an area where such material is suspected was conducted. The search strategies as well as the results of these search procedures are presented...|$|R

40|$|Concern over acts of {{terrorism}} has emerged in recent decades and was greatly heightened by the events {{that took place in}} New York City on September 11, 2001. Since then, substantial attention has been devoted to addressing the possible scenarios that may arise from the use of various hazardous materials or dangerous devices for terrorist acts. Some of these efforts are associated with radiological hazards, such as <b>radiological</b> <b>dispersal</b> <b>devices</b> (RDDs) and improvised nuclear devices (INDs). By far, however, most preparedness efforts have focused on responding to the early phases of events, including triage to rescue lives or avoidance of initial exposure by evacuating or sheltering the affected populations, rather than the long-term recovery issues that may last for several years. Such lack of preparedness has raised considerable concern, as exemplified by the issues raised in a report by the General Accountability Office in January 2010. The concerns are based on past nuclear events, such as the 1986 Chernobyl accident in the Former Soviet Union; the natural disaster caused by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005; and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. In all these events, a general lack of preparedness capability for long-term recovery has fully illustrated the need for response that must go far beyond the initial triaging effort. The desired preparedness effort should consider long-term recovery issues that likely will encompass the entire spectrum from public policy, to impact analysis, to technology development, as well as stakeholder involvement in decision making. All these aspects require considerable in-depth development and preparation, much of it far in advance of the events...|$|R

In particular, as a major complication, the traditional RDDs based on radioactive isotopes of cesium and cobalt recently evolved towards more sophisticated devices based on transuranics, [2]. As a matter of fact, transuranic RDDs are not so easily detectable as the traditional ones by means of gamma spectrometry, due to complexity of their photon spectra and low photon emission rates. Since September 2013, ENEA, the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development, was involved in the EDEN (End-user DEmo for cbrNe) Demonstration Project within the European framework [3], whose primary target has been to face the CBRNE risks in EU Member States through research, technologi- cal development of new tools, and related experimental demonstrations. At ENEA Casaccia Research Center, the Nuclear Material Characteri- zation and Radioactive Waste Management Laboratory is proposing the Neutron Active Interrogation system (NAI) as a convenient technical solution to find transuranic-based RDDs hidden inside suspected pack- ages.

It is based on Differential Die-Away time Analysis, an active neutron technique targeted in revealing the presence of fissile material through detection of induced fission neutrons. Several Monte Carlo simulations, carried out by MCNPX code, and the development of ad-hoc design methods, have led to the realization of a first prototype based on a 14 MeV d–t neutron generator coupled with a tailored moderating structure, and an array of helium- 3 neutron detectors. The complete system is characterized by easy transportability, light weight, and real-time response. First results have shown device’s capability to detect gram quantities of fissile materials...|$|R
