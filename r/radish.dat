The slow-going carrots {{serve the}} purpose of {{thinning}} the <b>radishes.</b> And when the <b>radishes</b> are pulled, ready for market, that thins the carrots, which come along later. You can't beat the Chink." ...|$|R
5000|$|Compared {{to regular}} Korean <b>radishes,</b> gegeol <b>radishes</b> {{have a lower}} water content, but more protein, fibre, and minerals(magnesium, potassium, and calcium). It also has a higher content of a sulfur {{compound}} {{that is responsible for}} the sharper taste. For enzyme activities, the protease and myrosinase activities of Gegeol <b>radishes</b> are higher, but the α-amylose activity is lower, compared to regular Korean <b>radishes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} an odour {{described}} variously as resembling garlic, <b>radish,</b> lemon, onion, or skunk, and taste like <b>radish.</b> Although some older sources report P.squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The toxic effect {{may be due}} to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} {{radishes}} can be pressed to extract <b>radish</b> seed oil. Wild <b>radish</b> seeds contain up to 48% oil, and while {{not suitable for}} human consumption, this oil is a potential source of biofuel. The daikon grows well in cool climates and, apart from its industrial use, {{can be used as}} a cover crop, grown to increase soil fertility, to scavenge nutrients, suppress weeds, help alleviate soil compaction, and prevent winter erosion of the soil.|$|E
50|$|Korean <b>radishes,</b> {{like other}} <b>radishes,</b> are annual or {{biennial}} crop grown for the taproots. The rotund-cylindrical roots weigh about 800 g, being approximately 20 cm long with diameter around 7 - 8 cm. The flesh of Korean <b>radishes</b> harvested timely is crisp, peppery and sweet.|$|R
30|$|<b>Radishes</b> were microbiologically {{investigated}} at harvest. TMC and stenotrophomonad {{concentrations were}} not statistically different for all trials. Thus, inoculated trials produced <b>radishes</b> characterized by the same levels of microbial contamination of those obtained from control trials. The levels of TMC were in the range 106 – 107 CFU g− 1 and were superimposable to those reported for <b>radishes</b> grown in hydroponic systems [31].|$|R
50|$|The Night of the <b>Radishes</b> (Noche de Rábanos in Spanish) is {{an annual}} event {{in the city of}} Oaxaca, Mexico {{dedicated}} to the carving of oversized <b>radishes</b> (Raphanus sativus) to create scenes that compete for prizes in various categories. The event has its origins in the colonial period when <b>radishes</b> were introduced by the Spanish. Oaxaca has a long wood carving traditions and farmers began carving <b>radishes</b> into figures as a way to attract customers’ attention during the Christmas market which was held in the main square on December 23. In 1897, the city created the formal competition. As the city has grown, the city has had to dedicate land to the growing of the <b>radishes</b> used for the event, supervising their growth and distribution to competitors. The event has become very popular, attracting over 100 contestants and thousands of visitors. However, since the <b>radishes</b> wilt soon after cutting the works can only be displayed for a number of hours, which has led to very long lines for those wishing to see the works. The event also has display and competitions for works made with corn husks and dried flowers, which are created with the same themes as those with <b>radishes.</b>|$|R

5|$|The bulb of the <b>radish</b> {{is usually}} eaten raw, {{although}} tougher specimens can be steamed. The raw flesh has a crisp texture and a pungent, peppery flavor, caused by glucosinolates and the enzyme myrosinase, which combine when chewed to form allyl isothiocyanates, {{also present in}} mustard, horseradish, and wasabi.|$|E
5|$|The <b>radish</b> (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an {{edible root}} {{vegetable}} of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, {{and length of}} time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of <b>radish</b> is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop. Some radishes are grown for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production. Others are used for sprouting.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{salad is}} {{typically}} made with finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Variations include {{the addition of}} diced red or green bell peppers, grated carrot, finely shredded cabbage or lettuce, sliced <b>radish,</b> fennel, spring onions and chives, chopped parsley, or other herbs and spices such as mint, za'atar and sumac. Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} market trend {{analysis}} of <b>radishes,</b> which are increasing in cultivation, and is conducted in wholesale markets across Japan. There {{are two major}} objectives of the analysis. One {{is to determine the}} contents of shipments from the districts competing with Hokkaido by conducting analysis at wholesale markets. The other is to clarify the characteristics of distributive markets for Hokkaido-produced <b>radishes</b> by classifying wholesale markets using quantity per year and quantity per day. The vegetables and fruits markets information (NAPASS) and the competitive-producing district analysis system, which was developed by Matsuyama, were used as the analysis method and technique respectively. The results are as follows: Hokkaido competes with Aomori from July to October when Hokkaido-produced <b>radishes</b> enter wholesale markets across Japan. In order to clarify the characteristics of the wholesale markets where Hokkaido-produced <b>radishes</b> are delivered, three types were classified by market share (from July through October). Type I (market share 30 %〜 60 %) shows the wholesale markets where Hokkaido-produced <b>radishes</b> compete with ones from other districts. Type II (60 %〜) shows the wholesale markets where Hokkaido-produced <b>radishes</b> register larger quantity per day than type I. Type III (〜 30 %) shows the wholesale markets where Hokkaido-produced <b>radishes</b> register smaller quantity per day than type I. More than half of type III wholesale markets are largely supplied by local districts, therefore increased shipments of Hokkaido-produced <b>radishes</b> can be expected depending on the situation of the local districts. However, Aomori has high market shares in four markets in the Kyushu area which belong to type III, shipment to the Kyushu area requires coordination with Aomori...|$|R
5|$|<b>Radishes</b> can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and <b>radishes</b> seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and <b>radishes</b> also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|R
5|$|Mycena arcangeliana is {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} less common Mycena flavescens, a species found in both hardwood and softwood forests on the floor among leaf or needle litter or grassland. M. flavescens typically has a whiter cap and a smell reminiscent of <b>radish.</b> M. peyerimhoffi, known from Algeria, has a similar cap colour to M. arcangeliana, but has a yellow stem. M. limonia, known from the Netherlands, has a lemon-yellow cap and stem and more gills. Another species similar in appearance is M. metata, which has a sweet taste.|$|E
5|$|Proper post-harvest storage {{aimed at}} {{extending}} and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application. Cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, <b>radish,</b> spinach, potatoes, and tomatoes, the optimum temperature {{depending on the}} type of produce. There are temperature-controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as evaporative cooling. Storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the defeat of Majin Buu, Earth was at peace one again. Goku became a <b>radish</b> farmer, Krillen a father, Gohan married to Videl, and Vegeta {{spent more time with}} his family. After thirty–nine years of slumber, Lord Beerus, the God of Destruction of the universe, had awoken to a prophecy of a warrior {{emerging}} that would rival his power being known as a Super Saiyan God (超 スーパーサイヤ人ゴッド Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo). Beerus along with mentor/servant Whis took course to find Goku and Vegeta to fulfill the prophecy. Goku {{along with the rest of}} the sayians Including Gohan and Videl's soon to be born daughter, united to have Goku achieve the Super Saiyan God form through a ritual revealed by Shenron. Goku with his new power faced the God of Destruction with Earth's destruction at stake. Although Goku defeated, Beerus spares Earth and looks forward to Goku being more powerful.|$|E

5|$|A {{spin-off}} titled Summer Days, {{was released}} on June 23, 2006, retelling the original game during summer vacation and {{from the perspective of}} Setsuna Kiyoura. Unlike its predecessor, however, Summer Days was almost universally panned for its heavily bugged state, loads of patches, and recall. Another spin-off titled Cross Days {{was released on}} March 19, 2010. Set in the same continuity as School Days, Cross Days follows the life of another protagonist, Yuuki Ashikaga, a high school freshman who also finds himself caught between the affection of two girls, Roka Kitsuregawa and Kotonoha Katsura, during his second term at Sakakino Academy. The game also features yaoi scenarios, during which Yuuki cross-dresses as a maid. 0verflow released Shiny Days on February 2, 2012 which establishes a solid link between the Days series and <b>Radish</b> Vacation series. A third spin-off, Island Days, was developed for the Nintendo 3DS and was released in Japan on July 3, 2014. The game, developed by Klon, focuses on Makoto and the girls becoming trapped on a remote island and includes tower defense elements.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, <b>radish</b> and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E
