5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in <b>reverse</b> <b>motion,</b> people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ is spinning his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping pass them, {{moving on to the}} next scene. Usher slides into a room with a large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E

A series of five experiments compared two-stroke apparent motion with ISI reversal using the same stimulus display. The two effects show the same dependence on ISI duration and luminance and are both abolished at low mean luminance.

40|$|Nonlinear {{processing}} {{can be used}} {{to recover}} the motion of contrast modulations of binary noise patterns. A nonlinear stage has also been proposed to explain the perception of forward motion in motion sequences which typically elicit reversed-phi. We examined perceived direction of motion for stimuli in which these <b>reversed</b> <b>motion</b> sequences were used to modulate the contrast of binary noise patterns. A percept of forward motion could be elicted by both luminance-defined and contrast-defined stimuli. The perceived direction of motion seen in the contrast-defined stimuli showed a profound carrier dependency. The replacement of a static carrier by a dynamic carrier can reverse the perceived direction of motion. Forward motion was never seen with dynamic carriers. For luminance- and contrast-defined patterns the <b>reversed</b> <b>motion</b> percept increasingly dominated, with increases in the spatial frequency and temporal frequency of the modulation. Differences in the patterns of responses to the two stimuli over spatial and temporal frequency were abolished by the addition of noise to the luminance-defined stimulus. These data suggest the possibility that a single mechanism may mediate the perception of luminance- and contrast-defined motion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{whether the}} directional {{effect on the}} kappa effect {{can be attributed to}} the directional anisotropy of retinotopical space or to the representation of forces provided by environmental contexts (e. g., gravity) in an observed event. We examined whether different contexts with similar directional changes (straight vs. <b>reversed</b> <b>motion)</b> influence the kappa effect in four experiments. The object’s motion appeared to depict only forces under the natural laws of physics on a slope (Experiment 1) or on a horizontal plane (Experiment 2) in virtual 3 D space. In Experiments 3 and 4, the motion appeared to be subjected to external or self-driving forces additionally influenced by internal forces on a slope (Experiment 3) or a horizontal plane (Experiment 4). The results demonstrated that the directional effect on the kappa effect was observed only in Experiment 1, and not in Experiments 2 and 3, while the kappa effect was preserved. Furthermore, not even the kappa effect was observed in the <b>reversed</b> <b>motion</b> of Experiment 4. The results of the present study suggest that the determining factor of direction in the kappa effect is not a simple anisotropy, but rather the context of observed events...|$|R

[...] Plucking in the opposite direction to tan and tiao are called mo (抹) and gou (勾) respectively.

40|$|AbstractThe {{occurrence}} of perceived <b>reversed</b> <b>motion</b> while observers view a periodic, continuously moving stimulus (the “continuous Wagon Wheel Illusion”) {{has been taken}} as evidence that some aspects of motion perception rely on discrete sampling of visual information. The spatial extent of this sampling is currently under debate. When two separate motion stimuli are viewed simultaneously, the illusion of <b>reversed</b> <b>motion</b> rarely occurs for both objects together: this rules out global sampling of the visual field. The same result holds when the objects are superimposed by transparency: this argues against location-based sampling. Here we show that the sampling is in fact object-based: we use a rotating ring stimulus split in two halves. When the two halves move in opposite directions, appearing to belong to separate objects, perceptual reversals occur in either half at a time, but rarely in both. When the two halves physically move in compatible directions, they generally appear to reverse simultaneously: the illusion keeps the perceptual object united. Rather than the local low-level properties of the motion stimulus (which are comparable in both cases), it is thus the high-level organization of the scene that determines the extent of perceived motion reversals. These results imply that the continuous Wagon Wheel Illusion, and any discrete perceptual sampling that may cause it, is restricted to the object of our attention...|$|R

40|$|Continuously moving objects {{sometimes}} {{appear to}} spontaneously <b>reverse</b> their <b>motion</b> direction. The mechanisms underlying this bistable phenomenon (the "continuous wagon wheel illusion") are heavily debated, but one interpretation suggests that motion information is perceived in discrete episodes {{at a rate}} between 10 and 15 Hz. Here, we asked observers to report the perceived direction of a continuously rotating wheel while 32 -channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. We then separated periods of perceived true from illusory (<b>reversed)</b> <b>motion</b> and compared the EEG power spectrum under these two perceptually distinct yet physically identical conditions. The only reliable difference was observed approximately 13 Hz over centroparietal electrodes, independent of the temporal frequency of the wheel. Thus, {{it is likely to}} reflect internal processes rather than purely stimulus-driven activity. EEG power (13 Hz) decreased before the onset of illusory motion and increased before transitions back to real motion. Using this relationship, it was possible to predict above chance, on a trial-by-trial basis, the direction of the upcoming perceptual transition. These data are compatible with the idea that motion perception occurs in snapshots < 100 ms in duration...|$|R
