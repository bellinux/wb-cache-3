40|$|Straight grain {{boundaries}} which coincide partially with <b>rolling</b> <b>marks</b> were observed {{on the surface}} of annealed high purity aluminum and A 6061 aluminum alloy sheet under polarized light after direct anodic oxidation treatment without electro polishing. Straight traces in high purity aluminum were frequently faceted which suggests that migration of grain boundary perpendicular to rolling direction was retarded on the surface. Retardation of boundary migration was ascribed to pinning effects of oxide particles accumulated in convex part of ridges extending parallel to <b>rolling</b> <b>marks.</b> In high purity aluminum, straight boundaries between cube oriented grains were also observed with faint contrast. Annealing after removing of the surface layer by electro polishing resulted in the development of sharp cube texture with equiaxied grains by grain growth. In A 6061 alloy, preferential nucleation of Mg 2 Si precipitates were observed at both the <b>rolling</b> <b>marks</b> and surface {{grain boundaries}} during cooling after annealing, which is {{explained by the fact that}} in the ridges in <b>rolling</b> <b>marks</b> dislocation density is high even after heat treatment at high temperature and oxide particles are accumulated...|$|R
40|$|One {{problem in}} concentrating {{photovoltaic}} systems without active cooling is {{the formation of}} hot spots on the solar module cells. These hotspots {{are a result of}} uneven concentration of radiation within the solar module cells. The overall effect of concentrated heating is the reduction in the fill-factor of the solar module cell and the subsequent decrease in the overall efficiency of the system. In this paper, we investigate one alternative of improving the performance of a low concentrating photovoltaic system using semi-diffuse rolled reflective elements. Our results indicate that <b>rolling</b> <b>marks</b> on the reflector aligned parallel to the plane of the solar module cell improve the performance of the photovoltaic system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{surface preparation}} process aims to eliminate <b>rolling</b> <b>marks</b> or scratches providing a smoother surface. Eleven solutions for chemical polishing of aluminium alloy AA 6062 T 5 were used aiming {{to get the}} best aesthetic condition without losing corrosion resistance. These solutions were combinations of NaOH, NaCl, Na 2 SO 4, and HNO 3 and different amount of SiO 2 nanoparticles in these solutions. The samples submitted to these solutions were analysed by electrochemical measurements such as: potential monitoring in open circuit and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using NaCl 0. 1 mol L - 1 as electrolyte. The sample subjected to treatment with a mixture of all reagents and with the addition of 1000 ppm SiO 2, followed by cleaning with nitric acid solution showed the highest corrosion resistance.   DOI: [URL]    </p...|$|R
50|$|The site of {{the current}} Taemas Bridge was {{selected}} by the Public Works Department and is located about three kilometres upstream from the former bridge site. This led to a longer road route, but enabled a shorter bridge to be constructed in a location were flood levels {{were expected to be}} lower. After several years of inaction, the Goodradigbee and Yass Councils organised a protest meeting, and the State Government asked Tulloch's Phoenix Ironworks Ltd in Sydney to order steel for the bridge. Steel members show <b>rolling</b> <b>marks</b> of Dorman Long & Co Ld Mbro, so were presumably imported from Middlesbrough, England. Monier Pipe and Reinforced Concrete Works constructed piers and installed the bridge. Once constructed, Gilroy and Robson Ltd gravelled the bridge approaches ready for opening. The bridge was opened in 1931 and cost ₤60,895.|$|R

50|$|Construction {{depends on}} the {{material}} used. When steel or aluminium is used this involves welding of the plates and profiles after <b>rolling,</b> <b>marking,</b> cutting and bending as per the structural design drawings or models, followed by erection and launching. Other joining techniques are used for other materials like fibre reinforced plastic and glass-reinforced plastic.The process of construction is thought-out cautiously while considering all factors like safety, strength of structure, hydrodynamics, and ship arrangement. Each factor considered presents a new option for materials to consider as well as ship orientation. When {{the strength of the}} structure is considered the acts of ship collision are considered {{in the way that the}} ships structure is altered. Therefore, the properties of materials are considered carefully as applied material on the struck ship has elastic properties, the energy absorbed by the ship being struck is then deflected in the opposite direction, so both ships go through the process of rebounding to prevent further damage.|$|R

40|$|The {{grain size}} of {{monolayer}} large area graphene {{is key to}} its performance. Microstructural design for the desired grain size requires a fundamental understanding of graphene nucleation and growth. The two levers {{that can be used}} to control these aspects are the defect density, whose population can be controlled by annealing, and the gas-phase supersaturation for activation of nucleation at the defect sites. We observe that defects on copper surface, namely dislocations, grain boundaries, triple points, and <b>rolling</b> <b>marks,</b> initiate nucleation of graphene. We show that among these defects dislocations are the most potent nucleation sites, as they get activated at lowest supersaturation. As an illustration, we tailor the defect density and supersaturation to change the domain size of graphene from 100 mu m(2). Growth data reported in the literature has been summarized on a supersaturation plot, and a regime for defect-dominated growth has been identified. In this growth regime, we demonstrate the spatial control over nucleation at intentionally introduced defects, paving the way for patterned growth of graphene. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding the role of defects in graphene nucleation and can be used as a guideline for controlled growth of graphene...|$|R
50|$|The {{character}} of the Dorset Heaths contrasts strongly with its neighbouring natural regions. Undulating lowland heath with heather, pines and gorse alternates with exposed, open, large-scale farmland, woodland and scrub. Blocks of conifers form locally prominent landmarks. Apart from the major Poole-Bournemouth-Christchurch conurbation on the coast, much of the area is sparsely populated with scattered settlements and a few small villages and towns. Valleys are flat-bottomed and open with floodplain pastures. There is an outer perimeter of low, <b>rolling</b> hills <b>marking</b> the transition to chalk downland.|$|R

40|$|Near-surface {{deformed}} layers {{developed on}} aluminum alloys significantly influence the corrosion and tribological behavior {{as well as}} reduce the surface quality of the rolled aluminum. The evolution of the near-surface microstructures induced on magnesium containing aluminum alloys during thermomechanical processing has been investigated with the aim generating {{an understanding of the}} influence of individual forming parameters on its evolution and examine the microstructure of the roll coating induced on the mating steel roll through material transfer during rolling. The micro-mechanisms related to the various features of near-surface microstructure developed during tribological conditions of the simulated hot rolling process were identified. Thermomechanical processing experiments were performed with the aid of hot rolling (operating temperature: 550 to 460 °C, 4, 10 and 20 rolling pass schedules) and hot forming (operating temperature: 350 to 545 °C, strain rate: 4 × 10 - 2 s- 1) tribo-simulators. The surface, near-surface features and material transfer induced during the elevated temperature plastic deformation were examined and characterized employing optical interferometry, SEM/EDS, FIB and TEM. Near-surface features characterized on the rolled aluminum alloys included; cracks, fractured intermetallic particles, aluminum nano-particles, oxide decorated grain boundaries, rolled-in oxides, shingles and blisters. These features were related to various individual rolling parameters which included, the work roll roughness, which induced the formation of shingles, <b>rolling</b> <b>marks</b> and were responsible for the redistribution of surface oxide and the enhancements of the depth of the near-surface damage. The enhanced stresses and strains experienced during rolling were related to the formation and propagation of cracks, the nanocrystalline structure of the near-surface layers and aluminum nano-particles. The mechanism of the evolution of the near-surface microstructure were determined to include grain boundary sliding which induced the cracks at the surface and subsurface of the alloy, magnesium diffusion to free surfaces, crack propagation from shear stresses and the shear strains inducing the nanocrystalline grain structure, the formation of shingles by the shear deformation of micro-wedges induced by the work roll grooves, and the deformation of this oxide covered micro-wedges inducing the rolled-in oxides. Magnesium diffusion to free surfaces was identified as inducing crack healing due to the formation of MgO within cracks and was responsible for the oxide decorated grain boundaries. An examination of the roll coating revealed a complex layered microstructure that was induced through tribo-chemical and mechanical entrapment mechanisms. The microstructure of the roll coating suggested that the work roll material and the rolled aluminum alloy were essential in determining its composition and structure. Subsequent hot forming processes revealed the rich oxide-layer of the near-surface microstructure was beneficial for reducing the coefficient of friction during tribological contact with the steel die. Damage to the microstructure include cracks induced from grain boundary sliding of near-surface grains and the formation of oxide fibres within cracks of the near-surface deformed layers...|$|R

40|$|Leukocytes {{rolling on}} selectins extrude thin {{membrane}} tethers that might stabilize <b>rolling</b> velocities despite <b>marked</b> alterations in wall shear stress. To test this hypothesis, we used {{differential interference contrast}} videomicroscopy to visualize formation and breakage of membrane tethers as neutrophils rolled on P-selectin under flow. Neutrophils rapidly increased tether number as wall shear stress rose and decreased tether number as wall shear stress declined. Membrane tethers invariably accompanied slower, more uniform rolling steps that translated into lower mean rolling velocities and variances in velocity. Unexpectedly, neutrophils, but not fixed cells or microspheres bearing selectin ligands, rolled progressively more slowly and uniformly over time. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that neutrophils developed larger, more complex tether structures as they rolled for longer periods. These data provide evidence that neutrophils stabilize selectin-mediated rolling by rapidly adjusting tether number in response to changes in wall shear stress. Gradual remodeling of tether architecture may further reduce rolling velocities, facilitating integrin-dependent deceleration and arrest on inflamed vascular surfaces...|$|R
30|$|The {{computed}} maximum inundation depth was 6  m at {{the shore}} and decreased inland. The maximum flow velocity was 9  m/s {{at the shore}} and this, too, decreased inland. Here, we estimated the maximum flow velocity by averaging the flow velocity from the inundated surface to the bottom.The flow velocity (5.0  m/s) at the distance of 36  m is only larger than the flow velocity (3.1  m/s) necessary to cause boulders at that location to move by rolling (Figure  7 E).The boulder at the distance of 36  m was <b>marked,</b> which suggests <b>rolling</b> transportation by the waves of the typhoon. The boulder also held some grass {{that appeared to be}} growing downwards (Figure  7 B), suggesting that the boulder had recently been moved by <b>rolling.</b> Such <b>marks</b> were not found on the other boulders. If the boulders were to move by sliding, a flow velocity of 1.8 to 3.5  m/s would be required. As the computed flow velocities were over 3 to 4  m/s at the positions of the boulders (distances within 60  m) (Figure  7 E), it would be expected that almost all boulders would start to move if boulders were transported by sliding. On the other hand, the boulders would not move within the distance range of 40 to 80  m, but would move at the distance of 36  m, if the mode of transport were rolling (Figure  7 E). Moreover, if the boulders were to move by saltation, a flow velocity of 5.7 to 9.9  m/s would be required. This flow velocity is larger than the computed flow velocity at the positions of the boulders. Thus, we assume that the boulders moved by rolling. Thus, the calculation could well reproduce the runup of actual storm wave, and the numerical simulation using the CADMAS-SURF is useful for the reproduction of storm waves.|$|R
