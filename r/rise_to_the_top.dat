5|$|Their {{early career}} {{attracted}} much publicity, with each divisional promotion regarded {{by the media}} {{as part of an}} inevitable <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> ranks. Takahanada's progress was rapid and he set numerous age-related records, including the youngest ever makushita division tournament champion (16years 9months), youngest ever promoted to the second highest jūryō division (17years 3months), and the youngest ever promoted to the top makuuchi division (17years 8months).|$|E

His success in One-day cricket was underlined by his <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the ICC ODI batting rankings in February 2004. However, {{he was unable}} to maintain this form on the 2004 tours of Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and the Champions Trophy in England, accumulating 253 runs at 28.11 in 11 innings.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E

The match ended in a double disqualification and Lesnar retained the title. Lesnar faced The Undertaker again at No Mercy, this time in a Hell in a Cell match. Leading up to the match, in the storyline, Lesnar broke The Undertaker's hand with a propane tank. Despite Heyman begging McMahon not to let The Undertaker use his cast as a weapon, the request was denied and the match went on as planned. At No Mercy on October 20, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to retain the title. After his Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker, Lesnar successfully retained the WWE Championship in a handicap match with Heyman against Edge at Rebellion on October 26.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 {{athletics}} season saw Gay <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of {{the rankings}} {{for the first}} time and become a genuine contender in the 100m. He became the 2006 US Outdoor Champion in unfortunate circumstances: Gay originally finished second in 10.07s with a strong headwind, but Justin Gatlin's first-place finish was later rescinded for use of a banned substance. Gay significantly improved upon his previous 200m personal best by over two-tenths of a second at the IAAF Grand Prix in Lausanne. However, his time of 19.70s was not enough to beat newcomer Xavier Carter who ran the second fastest time ever with 19.63s. Improvements in the 100m followed, as he won the Rethymno track meet and set another personal best with 9.88s. Gay scored another sub-10 second 100m at the Stockholm Grand Prix, finishing second to Asafa Powell with a 9.97s, and beating Michael Johnson's British all-comers 200m record with a 19.84s win in London. Gay continued to improve at the 100m, revising his personal best to 9.84s at the Zürich Golden League meet, but it was not enough to beat Powell, who equaled his own world record of 9.77s.|$|E

5|$|The 2008–09 {{campaign}} was Leicester's first season outside {{the top two}} levels of English football, but they hit this nadir only seven years before becoming the 2015–16 Premier League champions, the fastest seven-year <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the English football league system apart from Ipswich Town in 1962. Following relegation to the third tier the previous season, Leicester returned to the Championship at the first attempt in 2008–09, finishing as champions of League One after a 2–0 win at Southend United, with two matches in hand. The 2009–10 season saw Leicester's revival under manager Nigel Pearson continue, as the club finished fifth and reached the Championship play-offs in their first season {{back in the second}} tier. Though coming from 2–0 down on aggregate, away to Cardiff City, to briefly lead 3–2, they eventually lost to a penalty shoot-out in the play-off semi-final. At the end of the season, Pearson left Leicester to become the manager of Hull City, claiming he felt the club seemed reluctant to keep him, and that Paulo Sousa had been the club's guest at both play-off games, hinting at a possible replacement. On 7 July 2010, Sousa was confirmed as Pearson's replacement.|$|E

25|$|Baruto won the jūryō {{division}} March 2006 honbasho tournament with {{a perfect}} 15–0 result. This was only the fourth time ever that a jūryō wrestler has won the championship with such a record. He {{was the first to}} achieve this since Kitanofuji, who ultimately reached the top yokozuna rank, in 1963. As a result of this performance he was promoted to makuuchi, the highest division, {{for the first time in}} his career in May 2006. It is likely that Baruto could have achieved a more rapid <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> division, were it not for him suffering from appendicitis in November 2005, the resulting absence from the tournament sending him back down to the third-highest makushita division temporarily. Despite this, his <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> division in two years is equal to the second-fastest ever.|$|E
