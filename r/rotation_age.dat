40|$|Aim of study: To {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to defining <b>rotation</b> <b>ages</b> on the basis of productive and technological aspects and to present an example of application of the methodology to natural Pinus sylvestris stands in relation to silvicultural treatment (light or heavy thinning) and site index. Area of study: Central Spain. Material and methods: We assumed that the price per m 3 of logwood suitable for veneer is four times higher than logwood not apt for veneer. Considering the yield distribution for different technological and commercial classes, a model of diameter distributions and yield tables, the variation in an average price index for different age classes, site indexes and silvicultural treatments was calculated. The age at which the price index rises by less than 3 %, the proportion of trees with d. b. h. higher than 40 cm, and other aspects such as the possible presence of fungal decay in old-growth stands were also taken into account to establish three criteria for defining <b>rotation</b> <b>ages.</b> Main results: The proposed methodology generates a wide range of <b>rotation</b> <b>ages</b> between 100 and 140 years for lightly thinned stands, and between 90 and 140 years for heavily thinned stands, depending on the site index. Research highlights: The proposed approach is based on technological and productive criteria, with the limitations imposed by sanitary risks. The methodology can be applied to generate <b>rotation</b> <b>ages</b> in relation to different site indexes and silvicultural treatments, provided that the timber market prices and the yield distribution for different technological and commercial classes are known, and that a model of diameter distributions and yield tables are available...|$|R

The economic analysis was performed by comparing Present Net Worth (PNW) of the optimal harvest schedules at several <b>rotation</b> <b>ages</b> for different alternatives of forest management and simulating different market situations. A whole-stand growth and yield model for Pinus hartwegii was developed using the model developed by Clutter (1963).

Different criteria were tested to fit real data to the Weibull probability density function. A modified approach which uses different parameter estimators to fit Weibull parameters to stand characteristics was performed. The approach yielded excellent fits. A Dynamic programming algorithm was incorporated to the growth and yield model to compute optimal harvest schedules. The algorithm is mostly based on the Valsta (1986) algorithm.

The {{increased}} proportion of corewood that results when <b>rotation</b> <b>ages</b> of pine plantations are shortened has become a wood quality factor of growing concern worldwide. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop empirically based models for predicting the flexural properties of the wood produced from relatively young P. patula trees. Models were based on the properties of standing trees, and their effectiveness was evaluated at board, tree, and compartment levels. Sample material was obtained from 170 P. patula trees, 16 – 20 years old, established in 17 compartments on the Mpumalanga escarpment of South Africa. Multiple regression models were developed, which managed to explain 68, 60, and 95 % of the variation in the dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOE) on individual boards, trees, and compartments levels, respectively. At compartment level, 80 % of the variation in the 5 th percentile MOR value could be explained by the model. Sensitivity analyses showed that site index at base age of 10 years, acoustic time of flight, wood density, and ring width were influential variables in the MOE models. The models indicated that tree slenderness during early growth seems to play a major role in determining the dynamic MOE and MOR of lumber. This is in agreement with Euler’s buckling theory and the bending stress theory. The results from this study indicated that the MOEdyn and MOR of lumber can be accurately predicted on especially a compartment level.

The forest yield model of Kuliesis, pine assortment tables, observed timber prices, and costs of silvicultural treatments constitute sufficient information for optimizing silvicultural regimes in pine stands, using economic criteria, namely, forest rent, net present value, and soil expectation value. The dynamic programming approach enables simultaneous optimisation of intermediate and final felling throughout the rotation. Results obtained confirm that <b>rotation</b> <b>ages</b> differ according to site productivity. Optimal rotations range from 80 years in most productive stands to over 130 on the poorest sites, when the forest rent criterion is selected.

If a marketable tree is infected, it should be salvaged before disease progression significantly influences its value. Infected trees in public areas should be checked and removed if red ring rot disease has rendered them potentially dangerous (trees weakened due to heart rot are more likely to fall). Where timber management is the focus, infected trees should be removed. A reduction in <b>rotation</b> <b>age</b> should be considered if decay is frequent to minimize losses.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of stellar ages directly impacts {{the characterization of}} a planetary system as it puts strong constraints on {{the moment when the}} system was born. Unfortunately, the determination of precise stellar ages is a very difficult task. Different methods can be used to do so (based on isochrones or chemical element abundances) but they usually provide large uncertainties. During its evolution a star goes through processes leading to loss of angular momentum but also changes in its magnetic activity. Building <b>rotation,</b> magnetic, <b>age</b> relations would be an asset to infer stellar ages model independently. Several attempts to build empirical relations between <b>rotation</b> and <b>age</b> (namely gyrochronology) were made with a focus on cluster stars where the age determination is easier and for young stars on the main sequence. For field stars, we can now take advantage of high-precision photometric observations where we can perform asteroseismic analyses to improve the accuracy of stellar ages. Furthermore, the variability in the light curves allow us to put strong constraints on the stellar rotation and magnetic activity. By combining these precise measurements, we are on the way of understanding and improving relations between magnetic activity, <b>rotation,</b> and <b>age,</b> in particular at different stages of stellar evolution.

The samples were taken from 76 trees in early October when the mean aerial temperature exceeded 0 °C and 23 trees in late October/early November when the mean aerial temperature was below 0 °C, to serve as the pre-freeze-up and post-freeze-up groups, respectively. The wounds were sampled and cultured. The number and ratio of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi on one-week-old wounds varied between pre- and post- freeze-up wounds, wound locations, and media. However, random samples of the different classes of microbes isolated from the 2 spruce species did not differ significantly, indicating no relationship between tree species and microbe. Wounds were more common on stems (94) than on roots (64) or butts (33). Wounds on roots averaged 2 and 3 times the area of those on stems and butts, respectively. More bacteria than fungi were isolated from the pre-freeze-up wounds than from the post-freeze-up wounds, while fungi were more plentiful than bacteria on the post freeze-up wounds.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{objectives}} {{for the use}} of the Oregon State University college forest include providing both facilities for research and teaching, and providing funding through timber harvest. The older age-classes of the forest are valuable for attaining both objectives. The opportunities and costs of removing acreage in the older age classes from the timber harvest base were examined. Harvest schedules were developed using a model II linear programming formulation with the OSU Forestry Model. The harvest schedules used the current management policies of the forest managers and different levels of set-asides with a non-declining even flow of volume constraining the harvest level. The current <b>rotation</b> <b>age</b> of 90 years was found to be constraining the harvest level in the first four decades, therefore a set of harvest scheduling runs using a 60 year <b>rotation</b> <b>age</b> were done. Using the existing management policies and a <b>rotation</b> <b>age</b> of 90 years, the managers of the college forest can set-aside the oldest 686 acres of the forest without reducing the current harvest level. The cost of the set-sides (calculated as the difference between present net values of 100 year harvest schedules with and without the acreage removed) was between 5500 and 4500 per acre depending on the amount of acreage removed. The change in <b>rotation</b> <b>age</b> produced only slight changes in the cost of set-asides.
