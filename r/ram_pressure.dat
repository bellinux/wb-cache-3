40|$|We {{develop a}} model for the wind {{properties}} of cool main-sequence stars, which comprises their wind <b>ram</b> <b>pressures,</b> mass fluxes, and terminal wind velocities. The wind properties are determined through a polytropic magnetised wind model, assuming power laws for the dependence of the thermal and magnetic wind parameters on the stellar rotation rate. We use empirical data to constrain theoretical wind scenarios, which are characterised by different rates of increase of the wind temperature, wind density, and magnetic field strength. Scenarios based on moderate rates of increase yield wind <b>ram</b> <b>pressures</b> in agreement with most empirical constraints, but cannot account for some moderately rotating targets, whose high apparent mass loss rates are inconsistent with observed coronal X-ray and magnetic properties. For fast magnetic rotators, the magneto-centrifugal driving of the outflow can produce terminal wind velocities far in excess of the surface escape velocity. Disregarding this aspect in the analyses of wind <b>ram</b> <b>pressures</b> leads to overestimations of stellar mass loss rates. The predicted mass loss rates of cool main-sequence stars do not exceed about ten times the solar value. Our results are in contrast with previous investigations, which found a strong increase of the stellar mass loss rates with the coronal X-ray flux. Owing to the weaker dependence, we expect the impact of stellar winds on planetary atmospheres to be less severe and the detectability of magnetospheric radio emission to be lower then previously suggested. Considering the rotational evolution of a one solar-mass star, the mass loss rates and the wind <b>ram</b> <b>pressures</b> are highest during the pre-main sequence phase.

40|$|Recent {{models of}} {{molecular}} cloud formation and evolution suggest that such clouds are dynamic and generally exhibit gravitational collapse. We present a simple analytic model of global collapse onto a filament and compare this with our numerical simulations of the flow-driven {{formation of an}} isolated molecular cloud to illustrate the supersonic motions and infall <b>ram</b> <b>pressures</b> expected in models of gravity-driven cloud evolution. We apply our results to observations of the Pipe Nebula, an especially suitable object for our purposes as its low star formation activity implies insignifcant perturbations from stellar feedback. We show that our collapsing cloud model can explain {{the magnitude of the}} velocity dispersions seen in the $^{ 13 }$CO filamentary structure by Onishi et al. and the <b>ram</b> <b>pressures</b> required by Lada et al. to confine the lower-mass cores in the Pipe nebula. We further conjecture that higher-resolution simulations will show small velocity dispersions in the densest core gas, as observed, but which are infall motions and not supporting turbulence.

It is usually argued that gravitational confinement causes the high pressures, and that the clouds are (magneto) hydrostatic objects supported by a balance between magnetic and turbulent pressures and gravity. However, magnetic pressures appear too weak, and MHD turbulent support not only requires driving, but also results in continuing gravitational collapse, as has now been demonstrated in simulations reaching 512 3 zones. Models of supernova-driven, magnetized turbulence readily form transient, high-pressure, dense regions that may form molecular clouds. They are contained not by self-gravity, but by turbulent <b>ram</b> <b>pressures</b> from the larger flow. Apparent virialization may actually be a geometrical effect. Turbulent clouds are unlikely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, instead either collapsing or expanding, although they may appear well-fit by projected equilibrium Bonnor-Ebert spheres.
