50|$|Emulsions with {{different}} structures {{were made for}} other applications, such as direct positive emulsions. Direct positive emulsion has fog centers built into {{the core of the}} emulsion, which is bleached by photoholes generated upon exposure. This type of emulsion produces a positive image upon development in a conventional developer, without <b>reversal</b> <b>processing.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{distinguished}} from Time <b>Reversal</b> Signal <b>Processing</b> {{by the fact}} that phase conjugation uses an holographic or parametric pumping whereas time reversal records and re-emits the signal using transducers.|$|R
50|$|Time <b>reversal</b> signal <b>processing</b> is {{a process}} in which this {{property}} is used to reverse a received signal; this signal is then re-emitted and a temporal compression occurs, resulting in a reverse of the initial excitation waveform being played at the initial source.|$|R
50|$|An {{attractive}} {{aspect of}} time <b>reversal</b> signal <b>processing</b> {{is the fact}} that it makes use of multipath propagation. Many wireless communication systems must compensate and correct for multipath effects. Time reversal techniques use multipath to their advantage by using the energy from all paths.|$|R
50|$|A {{developer}} solution converts {{silver halide}} crystals to metallic silver grains, but it acts only on those having latent image centers. (A solution that converts all silver halide crystals to metallic silver grains is called fogging developer {{and such a}} solution {{is used in the}} second developer of <b>reversal</b> <b>processing.)</b> This conversion is due to electrochemical reduction, wherein the latent image centers act as a catalyst.|$|E
5000|$|Black-and-white {{reversal}} film exists but is very uncommon. Conventional black-and-white negative film can be reversal-processed to produce black-and-white slides, as by dr5 Chrome. Although kits of chemicals for black-and-white <b>reversal</b> <b>processing</b> {{may no longer}} be available to amateur darkroom enthusiasts, an acid bleaching solution, the only unusual component which is essential, is easily prepared from scratch. Black-and-white transparencies may also be produced by printing negatives onto special positive print film, still available from some specialty photographic supply dealers.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{practical and}} commercially successful color photography reversal process was the Lumière Autochrome, introduced in 1907. This was an additive method, using a panchromatic emulsion coated on a thin glass plate previously {{coated with a}} layer of dyed potato starch grains. Autochrome plates were discontinued in the 1930s, after the introduction of Lumière Filmcolor in sheet film and Lumicolor in roll film sizes. Also using the additive principle and <b>reversal</b> <b>processing</b> were the Agfa color screen plates and films and Dufaycolor film, all of which were discontinued by 1961.|$|E
5000|$|Photographers {{that create}} {{photographic}} art by [...] "contact printing"; i.e. Platinum, AZO, {{need to create}} interpositives to create large negatives. The final art work {{is the size of}} the contact negative produced. Interpositives are also the best means of archiving or copying old image libraries. <b>Reversal</b> B&W <b>processing</b> can also be achieved by various kits and published recipes.|$|R
50|$|Time <b>Reversal</b> Signal <b>Processing</b> is a {{technique}} for focusing waves. A Time Reversal Mirror (TRM) is a device that can focus waves using the time reversal method. TRMs are also known as time reversal mirror arrays, as they are usually arrays of transducers, {{but they do not}} have to be arrays. TRM are known and used for decades in the optical domain, and are also used in the ultrasonic domain.|$|R
50|$|The {{beauty of}} time <b>reversal</b> signal <b>processing</b> {{is that one}} need not know any details of the channel. The step of sending a wave through the channel {{effectively}} measures it, and the retransmission step uses this data to focus the wave. Thus one doesn't have to solve the wave equation to optimize the system, one only needs {{to know that the}} medium is reciprocal. Time reversal is therefore suited to applications with inhomogeneous media.|$|R
50|$|It is {{incorrect}} {{to call an}} image a negative solely because it is on a transparent material. Transparent prints {{can be made by}} printing a negative onto special positive film, as is done to make traditional motion picture film prints for use in theaters. Some films used in cameras are designed to be developed by <b>reversal</b> <b>processing,</b> which produces the final positive, instead of a negative, on the original film. Positives on film or glass are known as transparencies or diapositives, and if mounted in small frames designed for use in a slide projector or magnifying viewer they are commonly called slides.|$|E
50|$|Many {{photographic}} processes create negative images: {{the chemicals}} involved react {{when exposed to}} light, so that during development they produce deposits of microscopic dark silver particles or colored dyes {{in proportion to the}} amount of exposure. However, when a negative image is created from a negative image (just like multiplying two negative numbers in mathematics) a positive image results. This makes most chemical-based photography a two-step process, which uses negative film and ordinary processing. Special films and development processes have been devised so that positive images can be created directly on the film; these are called positive, or slide, or (perhaps confusingly) reversal films and <b>reversal</b> <b>processing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Kodak {{formerly}} {{offered a}} kit ("Direct Positive Film Developing Outfit") for <b>reversal</b> <b>processing</b> of its now-discontinued Panatomic X film, which doubled the effective film speed from 32 to 64. The bleaching bath used potassium dichromate and sodium bisulfate; the redeveloper was a fogging developer, and so unstable that its shelf-life after mixing {{was only slightly}} longer than {{the amount of time}} needed to process a single roll. This was replaced with a [...] "T-Max Direct Positive Film Developing Outfit," [...] which uses potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid in the bleach. In this kit, the fogging redeveloper is stable, but the bleach is not, with a shelf-life, once mixed, of no more than two weeks.|$|E

50|$|In <b>reversal</b> <b>processing,</b> the {{material}} is fogged before the second developer. This is often done by exposure to light, but sometimes chemical fogging is used. One common {{way to do this}} is to use a mildly strong reducing agent (much stronger than developing agents) to create fog centres consisting of a metallic silver cluster, which can be viewed as a chemically induced analogue of latent image. Stannous chloride, dimethyl amine borane, and hydrazine derivatives are used. These compounds are not very stable in contact with air, as you expect from their nature being a reducing agent. Another possible way, though less common, is to create fog centres consisting of large specks of silver sulfide. Sodium sufide, alkaline solution of thiourea, and other compounds having labile sulfur element can be used.|$|E
5000|$|The first commercially {{successful}} color process, the Lumière Autochrome, {{invented by}} the French Lumière brothers, reached {{the market in}} 1907. It {{was based on an}} irregular screen plate filter made of dyed grains of potato starch which were too small to be individually visible. The light-sensitive emulsion was coated directly onto the screen, eliminating problems due to imperfect contact between the screen and image. <b>Reversal</b> <b>processing</b> was used to convert the negative image which was initially produced into a positive image, so no printing or screen registration was required. The shortcomings of the Autochrome process were the expense (one plate cost about as much as a dozen black-and-white plates of the same size), the relatively long exposure times which made hand-held [...] "snapshots" [...] and photographs of moving subjects impractical, and the density of the finished image due to the presence of the light-absorbing color screen.|$|E
50|$|The first {{widely used}} method of color {{photography}} was the Autochrome plate, a process inventors and brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière {{began working on}} in the 1890s and commercially introduced in 1907. It was based on one of Louis Ducos du Hauron's ideas: instead of taking three separate photographs through color filters, take one through a mosaic of tiny color filters overlaid on the emulsion and view the results through an identical mosaic. If the individual filter elements were small enough, the three primary colors of red, blue, and green would blend together {{in the eye and}} produce the same additive color synthesis as the filtered projection of three separate photographs. Autochrome plates had an integral mosaic filter layer with roughly five million previously dyed potato grains per square inch added to the surface. Then {{through the use of a}} rolling press, five tons of pressure were used to flatten the grains, enabling every one of them to capture and absorb color and their microscopic size allowing the illusion that the colors are merged together. The final step was adding a coat of the light capturing substance silver bromide after which a color image could be imprinted and developed. In order to see it, <b>reversal</b> <b>processing</b> was used to develop each plate into a transparent positive that could be viewed directly or projected with an ordinary projector. One of the drawbacks of the technology is an exposure time of at least a second was required during the day in bright light and the worse the light is, the time required quickly goes up. An indoor portrait required a few minutes with the subject not being able to move or else the picture would come out blurry. This was because the grains absorbed the color fairly slowly and that a filter of a yellowish-orange color was added to the plate to keep the photograph from coming out excessively blue. Although necessary, the filter had the effect of reducing the amount of light that was absorbed. Another drawback was that the film could only be enlarged so much until the many dots that make up the image become apparent.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{technique}} is demonstrated {{to optimize the}} ability of time re-versal to both spatially and temporally focus, or compress, elastic wave energy. This method allows for optimization of time reversal focusing {{for any number of}} channels by calculating the required time reversed signal to be rebroadcast from the time reversal mirror element using only the original recorded scattered signal from that element. The speed, simplicity and robust nature of this pro-cess for any number of time reversal mirror elements, including only a single channel, provide the ability to enhance applications currently using time re-versal for tasks such as communications, nondestructive evaluation, lithotripsy and imaging, among others. It is also demonstrated theoretically and numer-ically that good temporal focusing implies that the radius in the spherically symmetric part of the spatial focus is small.

40|$|The {{extremely}} long underwater channel {{delay spread}} causes severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) for underwater acoustic communications. Passive time <b>reversal</b> <b>processing</b> (PTRP) can effectively reduce the channel time dispersion {{in a simple}} way via convolving the received packet with a time reversed probe signal. However the probe signal itself may introduce extra noise and interference (self-correlation of the probe signal). In this paper, we propose a virtual time <b>reversal</b> <b>processing</b> (VTRP) for single input single output (SISO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. It convolves the received packet with the reversed estimated channel, instead of the probe signal to reduce the interference. Two sparse channel estimation methods, matching pursuit (MP), and basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN), are adopted to estimate the channel impulse response (CIR). We compare the performance of VTRP with the PTRP and without any time <b>reversal</b> <b>processing</b> through MATLAB simulations and the pool experiments. The results reveal that VTRP has outstanding performance over time-invariant channels...|$|E

There are two simulation approaches to analyze for source location in a perfectly matched layer boundary. We have shown the energy spectrum for propagation of acoustics wave in a room to focus by using array of transducers and source. In these plots we first transmit the signals from the array of transducers to the source and then the signals can be retransmitted back from the source to the array of transducers by using time reverse algorithm. The reverse signals can be focused the location of source based on the proposed method and the localization pointer.

Inthisway, boththegeometry of the deterministic multipath components (MPCs) and the interfering diffuse multipath {{are taken into}} account. Computational results show {{the influence of the}} room geometry on the bound and the impact of the diffusemultipath. Time <b>reversal</b> (TR) <b>processing</b> on the uplink channel is analyzed using the deterministic MPCs to overcome the degenerate nature of the backscatter channel. The CRLB shows the potential gain obtained from TR processing as well as its strong dependence on the geometry. Such TR processing has been proposed for TX waveform adaptation in the perception-action cycle of a cognitive radar. The results of this paper illustrate that it can indeed influence beneficially the measurement noise of the received signal, yielding control over the localization system...|$|R

40|$|SummaryReplication stress {{activates}} the Mec 1 ATR and Rad 53 kinases. Rad 53 phosphorylates nuclear pores {{to counteract}} gene gating, thus preventing aberrant transitions at forks approaching transcribed genes. Here, {{we show that}} Rrm 3 and Pif 1, DNA helicases assisting fork progression across pausing sites, are detrimental in rad 53 mutants experiencing replication stress. Rrm 3 and Pif 1 ablations rescue cell lethality, chromosome fragmentation, replisome-fork dissociation, fork <b>reversal,</b> and <b>processing</b> in rad 53 cells. Through phosphorylation, Rad 53 regulates Rrm 3 and Pif 1; phospho-mimicking rrm 3 mutants ameliorate rad 53 phenotypes following replication stress without affecting replication across pausing elements under normal conditions. Hence, the Mec 1 -Rad 53 axis protects fork stability by regulating nuclear pores and DNA helicases. We propose that following replication stress, forks stall in an asymmetric conformation by inhibiting Rrm 3 and Pif 1, thus impeding lagging strand extension and preventing fork reversal; conversely, under unperturbed conditions, the peculiar conformation of forks encountering pausing sites would depend on active Rrm 3 and Pif 1...|$|R
