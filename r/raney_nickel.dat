40|$|The {{leaching}} of Al from intermetallic {{samples of}} Nickel Aluminium alloys to form <b>Raney</b> type <b>nickel</b> catalysts {{is widely used}} in the hydrogenation industry, however, little is known of the leaching process itself. In this study, the leaching of Al was measured in realtime, in situ, using the high flux powder neutron diffractometer, D 20, at the Institut Laue Langevin. Despite the liberation of hydrogen and effervescent nature of the reaction {{the transformation of the}} dry powder phases into Raney type Ni was determined. Samples produced by gas atomisation were found to leach faster than those produced using the cast and crushed technique. Regardless of processing route of the precursor powder, the formation of spongy Ni occurs almost immediately, while Ni 2 Al 3 and NiAl 3 continue to transform over longer periods of time. Small angle scattering and broadening of the diffraction peaks is an evidence for the formation of the smaller Ni particles. Understanding the kinetics of the leaching process will allow industry to refine production of catalysts for optimum manufacturing time while knowledge of leaching dynamics of powders produced by different manufacturing techniques will allow further tailoring of catalytic material...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe direct {{liquefaction}} of a biomass {{composed of}} a mixture of wastes (straw, wood and grass) was studied using <b>Nickel</b> <b>Raney</b> as catalyst and tetralin as a solvent. Tetralin allows to solubilize green waste from 330 °C at relatively low hydrogen pressure, and avoids the recondensation of the intermediate products. The green waste deoxygenation results mainly from a decarboxylation reaction. The addition of Raney Ni in the feed, increases the gas yield due to methane formation, without diminishing the yield in solvolysis oil. The catalyst hydrogenolyses the small molecules present in the light fraction. Moreover, it improves {{the quality of the}} oil by increasing the hydrogen transfer between the solvent and the solvolysis oil. As a consequence, the oxygen content decreases and the yield of oil soluble in hexane strongly increases. The catalyst allows to obtain straight long chain alkanes (C 13 -C 26), which result from the hydrogenation of the extractives compounds of the green waste...|$|R

25|$|Pyridine {{supports}} {{a series of}} radical reactions, which is used in its dimerization to bipyridines. Radical dimerization of pyridine with elemental sodium or <b>Raney</b> <b>nickel</b> selectively yields 4,4′-bipyridine, or 2,2′-bipyridine, which are important precursor reagents in the chemical industry. One of the name reactions involving free radicals is the Minisci reaction. It can produce 2-tert-butylpyridine upon reacting pyridine with pivalic acid, silver nitrate and ammonium in sulfuric acid with a yield of 97%.|$|E
25|$|The final {{efforts were}} {{directed}} at placing methyl groups at position 5 and 15. With position 10 sufficiently shielded reaction with chloromethyl benzyl ether produced the di(chloromethyl) adduct which was further converted to the dithiophenyl compound 63 using thiophenol, isolation of which required thin layer chromatography. Desulfurisation took place with <b>Raney</b> <b>nickel</b> and the reduction reaction also opened the lactone ring to the carboxylic acid which was converted to the ester 64 by reaction with diazomethane. At this stage {{the number of}} isomers in the mixture was reduced by HPLC to just two with the racemic propionic acid ester group at C13 (ring C) remaining in 65. Reaction with sulfuric acid converted the cyano group to the amide group in 66, again destroying stereochemistry at C13. The correct isomer 67 (minor yield) was isolated again by HPLC.|$|E

2500|$|With rare exceptions, H2 is unreactive toward organic {{compounds}} {{in the absence}} of metal catalysts. The unsaturated substrate is chemisorbed onto the catalyst, with most sites covered by the substrate. In heterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen forms surface hydrides (M-H) from which hydrogens can be transferred to the chemisorbed substrate. Platinum, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium form highly active catalysts, which operate at lower temperatures and lower pressures of H2. Non-precious metal catalysts, especially those based on nickel (such as <b>Raney</b> <b>nickel</b> and Urushibara nickel) have also been developed as economical alternatives, but they are often slower or require higher temperatures. The trade-off is activity (speed of reaction) vs. cost of the catalyst and cost of the apparatus required for use of high pressures.
