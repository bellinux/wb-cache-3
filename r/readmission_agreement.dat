40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the effectiveness of Norway's <b>readmission</b> <b>agreements</b> with Iraq and Ethiopia. Through the use of <b>readmission</b> <b>agreements,</b> Norway aims to reduce irregular presence by increasing the number of both voluntary and forced returns, as well as discourage future irregular migration by sending a “clear signal” to individuals without protection needs that they will be returned when their asylum applications are rejected. The effectiveness of these agreements thus lies in {{the extent to which they}} fulfill these objectives. While Norway's agreements with Iraq and Ethiopia have been explicitly highlighted as effective by Norwegian authorities, this article argues that <b>readmission</b> <b>agreements</b> may be expected to limit, but not to eliminate, return problems. <b>Readmission</b> <b>agreements,</b> however streamlined, will have different effects on different groups.

First, as part of a preventative strategic policy, Norway seeks to conclude <b>readmission</b> <b>agreements</b> with countries with which EU <b>readmission</b> <b>agreements</b> (EURA) exist. Second, EU visa facilitation agreements that are paired with EURAs form an indirect link between EU and Norwegian <b>readmission</b> <b>agreements.</b> Third, Norway uses the EURA-format as a basis for negotiations even with countries where no EURA exists.

40|$|In the European Union asylum and {{migration}} policy, the expressions “exclusion” and “externalization” are often used and encountered because the EU transfers the responsibility of migration control to non-EU states through <b>readmission</b> <b>agreements.</b> The EU {{does not have the}} capacity to receive all migrants, refugees and asylum seekers that seek protection in Europe, hence the agreements are constituted between the EU and other countries outside the EU on the basis of returning nationals and third country nationals who have been denied asylum.

30|$|Considering {{the depth}} of {{political}} and economic relations as well as the status of candidacy, maintenance of visa requirements for Turkish citizens has been unjust and unsustainable (Aktar 2016). In the mid- 2000 s, the EU was willing to negotiate visa liberalization in return for a <b>readmission</b> <b>agreement.</b> However, the Turkish side was reluctant as the officials feared that Turkey would become a buffer zone and a dumping ground for irregular migrants if they signed the <b>readmission</b> <b>agreement</b> (Bürgin 2012, 2013). Moreover, the officials thought that the EU’s approach to Turkey was paradoxical—visa facilitation was considered as a tool for third countries and/or ENP members but not for future member states (Kirişçi 2008, p. 20). For all these reasons, the negotiations over visa facilitation in return for <b>readmission</b> <b>agreement</b> were interrupted in 2006. However, in January 2011, the European Commission announced that it reached an agreement with the Turkish government on the readmission of irregular migrants who had entered EU irregularly via Turkey.
