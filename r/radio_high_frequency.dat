40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{an independent}} factor for mortality and morbidity. One of the most debilitating consequences of the disease is the accompanying risk of stroke Unipolar temperature-guided (<b>radio)</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> ablation is performed during cardiac arrest, concomitant to other heart surgery procedures by patients with chronic AF. Saline ice slush and an isolation mat are placed in the transverse sinus. Using unipolar RF-energy from the Osypka HAT 300, linear lesions were created in the left atrium (LA) following the Berlin modification lesion set. A probe registers the temperature during the procedure. The LA appendage is occluded and by patients with very large LA a reduction plastic is performed. All patients who became an ablation procedure, between 01. April 2000 and 31. March 2005, were retrospectively examined. After complete follow up for all patients (mean 41. 5 +/- 14. 4 months), 72 % of the patients are in sinus rhythm or show a biatrial contraction with sequential pacemaker. Factors which positively affect the result are {{the presence of a}} Mitral valve stenosis and paroxysmal AF before the operation. The result is affected negatively by the presence of Hyperthyreosis. Patients with long existing VHF and patients, who received ablation through a transeptal approach show worse success rates. No influence on the success rates have the diameter of the left atrium, coronary heart disease, Aortic valve disease, Tricuspid valve insufficiency, Diabetes mellitus, pulmonary hypertension, age and sex. Patients with normal or reduced LV-EF and patients with high, middle or low risk profile (according to EuroSCORE) profit equally from the procedure. Serious complications related with the procedure did not occur and can be avoided without large expenditure. The direct view of the surgeon and the safety measures used are a sufficient prophylaxis {{for the protection of the}} neighbouring mediastinal structures. We registered a very high incidence of postoperative AF of approx. 70 %. Atrial fibrillation is mostly registered on the first and second post operative day. However AF, which arises on the operation day, is connected with a worse prognosis. The incidence of postoperative atrial flutter is about 3. 5 %. Up to the third postoperative month the postoperative atrial arrhythmias were terminated in 98 % of the patients, who were successfully treated. The ablation duration was approximately five minutes. The HAT 300 shows safety deficits with the tendency to Overshooting. A temperature of 65 ° C seems to be just as effective, as higher temperatures. The handling of the long and stare instrument is difficult...|$|E

5000|$|Terman {{characterizes the}} TRF's {{disadvantages}} as [...] "poor selectivity and low sensitivity {{in proportion to}} the number of tubes employed. They are accordingly practically obsolete." [...] Selectivity requires narrow bandwidth, but the bandwidth of a filter with a given Q factor increases with frequency. So to achieve a narrow bandwidth at a <b>high</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> required high-Q filters or many filter sections. Achieving constant sensitivity and bandwidth across an entire broadcast band was rarely achieved. In contrast, a superheterodyne receiver translates the incoming <b>high</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> to a lower intermediate frequency which does not change. The problem of achieving constant sensitivity and bandwidth over a range of frequencies arises only in one circuit (the first stage) and is therefore considerably simplified.|$|R

5000|$|Specific details vary {{between the}} {{different}} national services, but many personal radio services operate in the VHF or UHF part of the radio spectrum, using frequency modulation and a maximum power {{of only a few}} watts. Operation is on predetermined channels. Unlike commercial business, marine, aviation, or emergency services radio, all users in an area share access to the available channels, requiring cooperation for effective communications. Unlike amateur radio, experimentation with different types of apparatus, and modes of modulation is not permitted, and equipment must be factory-built and approved. Many of these services require non-removable antennas or place restrictions on antenna size, height or gain. The high-VHF band (137-174 MHz) and UHF bands (325, 350, 400-480, 900 MHz) are the most popular aside from the 25-28 MHz [...] "HF CB" [...] bands.
