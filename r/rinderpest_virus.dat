25|$|The {{depopulated}} {{and apparently}} primevally wild Africa seen in wildlife documentary films {{was formed in}} the 19th century by disease, a combination of rinderpest and the tsetse fly. In 1887, the <b>rinderpest</b> <b>virus</b> was accidentally imported in livestock brought by an Italian expeditionary force to Eritrea. It spread rapidly, reaching Ethiopia by 1888, the Atlantic coast by 1892, and South Africa by 1897. Rinderpest, a cattle plague from central Asia, killed over 90% of the cattle of the pastoral peoples such as the Masai of east Africa. With no native immunity, most of the population – some 5.5 million cattle – died in southern Africa. Pastoralists were left with no animals, their source of income; farmers were deprived of their working animals for ploughing and irrigation. The pandemic coincided with a period of drought, causing widespread famine. The starving human populations died of smallpox, cholera, typhoid and diseases imported from Europe. It is estimated that {{two thirds of the}} Masai died in 1891.|$|E

40|$|Peste des petits {{ruminants}} (PPR), is {{an acute}} contagious disease {{caused by a}} Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. it affects mainly sheep and goats and occasionally wild small ruminants. Based {{on the fact that}} PPR has been reported on a few occasions in camels, cattle and buffaloes, those animal species are considered to be susceptible although their potential role in the circulation of PPR virus (PPRV) has not been formally established. PPR occurs in Africa except Southern Africa, in the Arabian Peninsula, throughout most of the Near East and Middle East, and in Central and South-East Asia. The clinical disease resembles rinderpest in cattle. it is usually acute and characterised by pyrexia, serous ocular and nasal discharges, erosive lesions on different mucous membranes particularly in the mouth, diarrhoea and pneumonia. At necropsy, erosions may be noted in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The lungs may show interstitial bronchopneumonia and often secondary bacterial pneumonia. PPR can also occur in subclinical form. The disease must be differentiated from rinderpest, bluetongue, foot and mouth disease and other exanthemous conditions. Identification of the agent: The collection of specimens at the correct time is important to achieve diagnosis by virus isolation and they should be obtained in the acute phase of the disease when clinical signs are still apparent. The specimens from live animals can be swabs of conjunctival discharges, nasal secretions, buccal and rectal mucosae, and anticoagulant-treated blood. Rapid diagnosis is done by immunocapture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EL/SA), counter immunoe/ectrophoresis and agar gel immunodiffusion. Polymerase chain reaction may also be used. Serological tests: The serological tests that are routinely used are the virus neutralisation and the competitive EL/SA. Requirements for vaccines: In the past, control of PPR was ensured through vaccination with the rinderpest tissue culture vaccine because of the existence of a strong antigenic relationship between PPR and <b>rinderpest</b> <b>viruses.</b> The use of this heterologous vaccine has been abandoned in favour of the live attenuated PPR virus vaccine, which is now widely commercially available.

40|$|Sequence {{analysis}} was performed on viral RNA isolated from bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that died during two chronologically and geographically separate epizootics in North America. Both dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) and porpoise morbil-livirus (PMV) were detected in bottlenose dolphins that died during the 1987 U. S. Atlantic coast epizootic. Our results indicate not only that these viruses are not species specific, but also that both viruses were present in North America before outbreaks in the Mediterranean and Irish Seas. Samples taken along the Atlantic coast showed a statistically significant trend with DMV {{in the north and}} an increasing incidence of PMV in samples isolated farther south. In the 1993 Gulf of Mexico epizootic, only PMV was detected in bottlenose dolphins that died. Thus, DMV and PMV are implicated as the causes of the earliest known aquatic mammal morbilliviral outbreak, the U. S. Atlantic coast epidemic; PMV is implicated in the Gulf of Mexico epidemic. The presence of two pathogenic morbilliviruses that may circulate together or separately complicates the epidemiology of cetacean morbilliviral diseases. The only morbilliviruses known before 1989 were human measles virus, canine distemper <b>virus,</b> <b>rinderpest,</b> and peste-des-petits-ruminants <b>virus</b> (1). Recently, newly characterized morbilliviruses {{have been shown to be}} epizootic-associated pathogens in pinnipeds and cetaceans. Phocine distemper virus (2) was associated with a massive epizootic of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in northwestern Europe (3) in 1988. During the harbor seal phocine distemper virus outbreak, PMV was isolated from harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) that died along the Irish coast (4). DMV (5), was isolated during an epizootic of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) in the Mediterranean Sea (6, 7) in 1990 - 92. Between June of 1987 and May of 1988, a morbillivirus epizootic caused a tenfold increase in bottlenose dolphin stranding along the U. S. Atlantic coast from New Jersey to Florida (8, 9). More than half of the in-shore population of bottlenose dolphins in this area may have died. Morbillivirus-related strandings of bottlenose dolphins along the Gulf of Mexico coasts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas were also observed from October 1993 through Apri...|$|R
40|$|As {{currently}} performed, risk {{analyses of}} {{chemicals in the}} environment account only for direct effects: cancers, birth defects, premature births, etc. But chemicals like dioxin, PCBs, and pesticides may have even greater indirect affects on emerging infectious diseases.

Weakened bird populations may harbor an elevated burden of viruses (e. g., Eastern Equine, Western Equine, and St. Louis Encephalitides); and, with reduced numbers of inland fish (consumers of insect larvae), mosquito carriers may flourish (see box on next page).

50|$|Bliss {{spent much}} of his time in China {{focusing}} on the immunization of cattle against rinderpest. <b>Rinderpest</b> is a <b>virus</b> of the Morbillivirus subgroup of the Paramyxovirus group, which also contains measles, influenza and polio. Bliss's battle against rinderpest began with his desire for milk, which he considered essential for good health. However, the Chinese did not raise cattle for dairy, but rather for plowing. Therefore, far less milk than was needed was available. When there was a rinderpest outbreak, this milk supply was depleted. Bliss raised his own cattle and goats in China and experimented with rinderpest prevention. He found that serums for immunization were available in Shanghai, but realized that the serum used for this was unattainable and unaffordable for farmers in regions like Shaowu. Bliss sought to find another method of immunization that was within the means of Shaowu. He built off of the discovery of Robert Koch, who found that if the bile from a rinderpest gall bladder were diluted with an equal amount of pure glycerin, it would lose its virulence and would be safe to inject after 10 days. This would provide immunity lasting several months. Bliss then deducted that if a cow was injected with a small quantity of rinderpest blood ten days after being injected with the bile, it would have immunity. He tested this and found he was correct. Bliss also discovered that the calves of immune cows had a temporary immunity that decreased as they aged. He found that if they were injected {{with a small amount of}} rinderpest blood within their first month of life, they would have immunity.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Modeling and {{analyzing}} the combined effects {{of disease and}} population dynamics is important in understanding the effects of mechanisms such as pathogen transmission and direct competition between host species on the distribution and abundance of different species in an ecological community. Mathematical analysis of such models in a spatially explicit environment gives additional important insight into these systems. Motivated by our participation in the IGERT Ecosystem Informatics program, we explore the interactions between and among disease, competition, and spatial heterogeneity from a mathematical modeling perspective. In particular, we formulate a model in which two species compete directly via Lotka-Volterra competition and share a directly transmitted pathogen via both mass action (density-dependent) and frequency-dependent incidence. We determine conditions under which the pathogen is endemic as well as conditions for long-term coexistence of the two species and the pathogen. As the interior equilibria are intractable, we examine a special case for which full stability analysis is possible. We show that in this case, mass action and frequency incidence behave qualitatively the same. We prove existence, uniqueness, and stability for the full model with frequency incidence under the assumption of no death due to disease using theory of asymptotically autonomous equations. Using persistence theory, we show that for the full model with mass action, if all boundary equilibria are unstable, then both species and the pathogen persist uniformly strongly. We extend the multi-host competition-disease model to include multiple patches in order to model Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus in native grasslands. Our results suggest that connectivity can interact with arrival time and host infection tolerance to determine {{the success or failure}} of an invasion. Lastly, we simulate the spread of the multi-host <b>virus</b> <b>rinderpest</b> in livestock across the United States, finding that the outcome varies greatly with the starting location of the epidemic...|$|R
