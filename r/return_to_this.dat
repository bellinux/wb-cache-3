5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a concrete wall, and this station does not have any crew quarters. Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a center track forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains arrive on the southern (railroad northbound) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} track. They then use the diamond crossover there to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> station on the northern (railroad southbound) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the track configuration, trains may reverse into the yard from the southern track, and trains from the yard may start service on the northern track.|$|E
5|$|Regarding A Song of Ice and Fire as his magnum opus, Martin {{is certain}} never to write {{anything}} {{on this scale}} again and would only <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> fictional universe {{in the context of}} stand-alone novels. He prefers to write stories about characters from other Ice and Fire periods of history such as his Tales of Dunk and Egg project, instead of continuing the series directly. A possible future side project is a prequel set during Aegon's conquest of Westeros. Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery. However, he will see if his audience follows him after publishing his next project.|$|E
5|$|At a {{young age}} he {{witnessed}} the Kraków revolution of 1846 and the 1848 siege of Kraków by the Austrians, the two events which ended {{the existence of the}} Free City of Kraków. His two older brothers served in these battles, under General Józef Bem; one died and the other was forced into exile. Matejko attended St. Ann's High School, but he dropped out in 1851 because of poor grades. From his earliest days Matejko showed artistic talent, but had great difficulty with other academic areas. He never mastered a foreign language. Despite that, and because of his exceptional skill, he studied at the School of Fine Arts in Kraków from 1852 to 1858. His teachers included Wojciech Korneli Stattler and Władysław Łuszczkiewicz. He selected historical painting as his specialization, and finished his first major work, Tsars Shuyski before Zygmunt III (Carowie Szujscy przed Zygmuntem III), in 1853 (he would <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> topic in a year before his death, in 1892). During this time, he began exhibiting historical paintings at the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts (starting with 1855). His seminal project for his graduation in 1858 was Sigismund I the Old ennobles the professors of the Jagiellonian University (Zygmunt I nadaje szlachectwo profesorom Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego).|$|E

25|$|In 1665 Huygens made {{a curious}} {{observation}} about pendulum clocks. Two clocks {{had been placed}} on his mantlepiece, and he noted that they had acquired an opposing motion.

Regardless of how the two clocks were started, he found that they would eventually <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> state, thus making the first recorded observation of a coupled oscillator.|$|E

Recording of the album began in 1998, following the release of his fourth album, Animal Rights (1996), which deviated from Moby's electronica style; his goal for Play was to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> style of music. Originally intended to be his final record, the recording of the album took place at Moby's home studio in Manhattan, New York.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{economic}} prosperity between 1992 and 2004, many Football League clubs did run into financial problems during this time, although {{none of them were}} forced out of business. These include Oxford United, Luton Town, Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, Bradford City and Leicester City. Some of these clubs were faced with financial problems {{as a result of the}} lost revenue resulting from Premier League relegation and a failure to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> level, as well as the collapse of ITV Digital in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Syncretism is a {{relatively}} common religious practice in Indonesia. The major religion of Balinese Hinduism and Javanese Islamic syncretism (kejawen) are examples of syncretism in Indonesia. In Indonesia, syncretism {{is characterized by a}} strong respect toward ancestors. Sasak followers of Wetu Telu believe after death the soul can still <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> world. Therefore, deceased ancestors can continue to exert a major influence upon the lives of their living descendants. This is why ancestral souls must be invited to ceremonies; if treated properly, they may aid the living and facilitate their undertakings.|$|E

25|$|The chapel of Santa Ana {{is located}} in the north of the town. Its facade is very sober and {{contains}} a medallion of the saint, which was placed there in 1973. Inside, the saint is represented along the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus. This is the only chapel which does not have a canon vault but rather a gothic style one. Each year, pilgrims to Chalma leave from and <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> chapel. The neighborhood around it, called Barrio Norte or Barrio Santa Ana was the traditional exit to Mexico City. The chapel of Santa Ana is the scene of the commemoration of the Virgen de los Dolores (Virgin of the Sorrows) on the sixth Friday of Lent and the Procession of the Holy Burial (Santo Entierro) during Holy Week.|$|E
25|$|Intertidal {{organisms are}} also {{especially}} prone to desiccation {{during periods of}} emersion. Again, mobile organisms avoid desiccation {{in the same way}} as they avoid extreme temperatures: by hunkering down in mild and moist refuges. Many intertidal organisms, including Littorina snails, prevent water loss by having waterproof outer surfaces, pulling completely into their shells, and sealing shut their shell opening. Limpets (Patella) do not use such a sealing plate but occupy a home-scar to which they seal the lower edge of their flattened conical shell using a grinding action. They <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> home-scar after each grazing excursion, typically just before emersion. On soft rocks, these scars are quite obvious. Still other organisms, such as the algae Ulva and Porphyra, are able to rehydrate and recover after periods of severe desiccation.|$|E
