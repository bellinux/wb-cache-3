25|$|The first Grand Prix was a Catalina hardtop coupe trimmed to {{standards}} {{similar to the}} larger top-line Bonneville, with a distinctive grille and taillights. The bucket seats were upholstered in Morrokide vinyl, while nylon loop-blend carpeting covered the floor and lower door panels. The center console-mounted transmission shifter included a storage compartment and a tachometer. The <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> included a center fold-down armrest and a speaker grille {{that could be made}} functional with the extra-cost Bi-Phonic rear speaker. Included were a padded instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lights, and other features.|$|E

50|$|The car had {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seats,</b> which were covered, as standard, in Vynide. Leather was an option {{on the home}} market and cloth for {{exported}} models. A heater and (unusual for the time) electric windscreen washers were factory fitted, although a radio remained an option.|$|R
2500|$|A final Chevrolet Caprice PPV update {{was made}} for the 2017 model year, {{including}} a limited-slip differential for the V6 model, vinyl <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> with seat-back security panel, 18" [...] full size spare wheel and the deletion of two exterior paint colour options. Like the Holden Caprice WN and exports to the Middle East, the Caprice PPV will be discontinued when production in Australia ends.|$|E
2500|$|The CH 300 is an {{enlarged}} three-seat derivative of the Zenair Zenith CH 200, designed by Chris Heintz {{in the mid}} 1970s as the Tri-Zénith. Like the CH 200, it is a low-winged monoplane of all-metal construction with a fixed nosewheel undercarriage, but is larger and more powerful, and is fitted with a <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> capable of accommodating a third adult or two children, and is fitted with a forward sliding canopy. [...] It {{is designed to be}} powered by an engine giving between 125 and 180hp (93 and 134kW).|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} light buses were vans carrying nine passengers. The buses {{had a black}} and white chequered stripe and were colloquially referred to as zebra cars (...) [...] The chequered stripe is the pattern still used by Lee On NT Taxi Co 利安的士公司 on its fleet of taxi. This design later gave way to the red-striped vans (colloquially, [...] "red bus" [...] or [...] "14 seater"). Seating increased over the years from 9 to 14, then to 16 and, finally, to 19. The destination signage at the top front of minibuses did not appear until 1977 and the <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> disappeared altogether with the prevalence of air-conditioning equipment installation.|$|E
50|$|The base version comes {{equipped}} with 16-inch steel wheels, height-adjustable front <b>seats,</b> variable folding <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seats,</b> locking glove box, cargo platform lighting, antenna integrated within wing mirrors, manual window regulators, manual door locking and manual wing mirror adjustment.The front bumper, wing mirrors and door handles come in black.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} features {{two front}} bucket seats and a <b>rear</b> flat-folding <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> that can adjust to prioritize passenger or cargo volume.|$|R
50|$|The ST {{served as}} the base model of the Dakota. It {{included}} features such as an A/M-F/M stereo (later with cassette player) and a four-speaker sound system, vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces, front (or front and <b>rear)</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seats,</b> styled steel fifteen-inch (later sixteen-inch) wheels, and vinyl flooring. It also included, and was only available with, the 3.9L (later 3.7L) V6 engine. The ST was also not offered as a four-door Quad Cab model.|$|R
2500|$|The second-generation (2001-2003) Oldsmobile Aurora {{was very}} well {{equipped}} from the factory, as was expected of a luxury vehicle. Standard features on the Aurora were as follows: keyless entry, a security alarm, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with power adjustments for the driver's seat, an AM-FM stereo with radio data system (RDS) and cassette and single-disc CD players, a six-speaker sound system, leather door panel inserts, wood interior trim, automatic climate control, OnStar in-vehicle telematics system (later introduction), steering wheel-mounted climate and radio controls, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, power trunk release from the keyless entry remote, a multi-function driver's information center mounted above the factory radio and climate controls, a <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> with fold-down center armrest, luxury-styled alloy wheels, a spare tire and wheel, automatic front head and fog lamps, a 3.5L V6 engine, a 4-speed automatic transmission, front-wheel-drive (FWD), front and side SRS airbags.|$|E
2500|$|The Doppelraab first flew on 5 August 1951. As well as {{the early}} cockpit and undercarriage, the V-0 first {{prototype}} had unusual airbrakes, formed by rotating the wing strut fairings through 90°. [...] This system, introduced to expedite rigging, was found unsatisfactory and was abandoned in favour of spoilers. [...] The second prototype, the V-1, initially had a two-wheel undercarriage, later altered by {{the replacement of the}} front wheel by an extended noseskid (V-1a). The V-2 and V-3 introduced the <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat.</b> [...] The V-3 acted as the prototype for the first production version, the Doppelraab III, though only a few of them were built. [...] The most numerous variant was the Doppelraab IV. Though detail improvements were introduced in the Doppelraab V, no major changes came before the final versions VI and VII. [...] These had wings of 640mm (25.2in) greater span and correspondingly increased wing area. [...] The empty weight of the version VI was increased by only 7kg (15.4b) but by flying with a higher wing loading this model could provide a 25kg (55lb) increase in useful load.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to its radical exterior design, the interior {{design of the}} Ford Aerostar adopted many industry-standard features. For example, the seven-passenger Aerostar was configured with the 2-2-3 seating layout popularized in both Chrysler and General Motors minivans. Borrowing features from full-size conversion vans, XLT-trim versions were available with second-row bucket seats; another option allowed both <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> to fold down to make a bed; both rows of rear seats were removable.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the first}} order of 20 J-type chassis were delivered, BAT bought a further three new chassis from Thornycroft for the Reading Branch. These had military-specification bonnets and may have come from a {{cancelled}} WD order. The first two arrived with [...] "lorrybus" [...] bodies — truck bodies adapted with steps at the <b>rear,</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> and a canvas hood. This austerity specification allowed the pair to be completed quickly and enter service in July and August 1919.|$|R

50|$|Launched in India {{in early}} 2009, the Xylo started off well {{with an initial}} flurry of sales. However, since then sales have slowly declined, and it is widely {{believed}} that sales have not lived up to Mahindra's expectations. The Xylo was loosely based on the Mahindra Scorpio's ladder frame chassis. This chassis was modified to take account of the Xylo's longer wheelbase and higher refinement requirements. The Xylo was launched with a number of seating configurations, including two up front, and two <b>benches</b> <b>seats,</b> or two up front, middle row captain <b>seats</b> and a <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The front <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> {{typically}} allowed {{three people}} to sit abreast, or six passengers in most four-door sedans {{with this type}} of arrangement. For example, [...] "although advertised as an economical 'compact' car, the 1952 Willys Aero could comfortably sit three abreast on its front and <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seats,</b> and deliver excellent fuel economy." [...] Nash Motors introduced the unique [...] "airliner" [...] reclining front <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> that would be transformed into a bed. American Motors promoted its exclusive adjustable <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> on the 1959 Ramblers and Ambassadors featuring several restful positions, including a [...] "comfortable nap couch for children and older adults." [...] In 1972, the Jeep Commando's center console for the automatic transmission was replaced with a steering column mounted shifter, [...] "making the much-requested <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> an option." [...] The [...] " [...] innovative but unusual [...] " [...] 1975 AMC Pacer introduced numerous designs that included the [...] "cab forward" [...] and [...] "room for three upfront on the bench seat." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Gypsy was {{exported}} to countries like Chile and Kenya. Within Europe, {{it is most}} often found in Malta and Hungary. In contrast to Suzuki Jimny, the Gypsy is available either with four bucket <b>seats</b> or <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> and a sizable trunk. Currently, the Gypsy is available as a [...] "soft top", [...] "hard top" [...] and as an [...] "ambulance car". In India, it is widely used {{by the police and}} military forces. In fact, the MG413W model is now the mainstay of the Indian Army. In civilian use, the Gypsy is a popular choice as a low-cost SUV and is a common sight at rally and autocross events.|$|R

5000|$|Sport: which {{featured}} [...] "sport" [...] graphics and, beginning in 1991, a 4.0 L 242 CID inline-6-cylinder engine. An AM/FM stereo with two speakers and a <b>rear</b> removable <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> came standard. A cassette player, rear speaker sound bar, cloth high-back bucket seats, {{and air conditioning}} were optional.|$|R
5000|$|Expedition's 6-speed 6R75 {{automatic}} {{was replaced}} by an improved version, the 6-speed 6R80 automatic. 6R80 features more robust internals, new software logic and a tow/haul mode (replaces the overdrive lock-out) that utilizes new uphill/downhill gradient shift logic for improved performance while towing or hauling heavy loads. The 6-speed automatic can compensate for altitude, grade/slope and present load conditions. The system also reduces the transmission's tendency to [...] "hunt" [...] for the right gear(s) and provides engine braking when descending hills. The nine-passenger front <b>bench</b> <b>seating</b> option has been discontinued for the 2009 model year, leaving only the eight-passenger seating option left with two front bucket <b>seats</b> and two <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seats.</b> and the chrome [...] "Expedition" [...] name plate badges {{have been removed from}} the left and right front doors. The chrome [...] "Expedition" [...] name plate badge on the rear liftgate remains.|$|R
50|$|The 2014 and 2015 models {{had a major}} revamp of {{interior}} comfort. The passenger seat is higher, the sound system has been upgraded, the <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> are higher and the console is re-positioned for the person riding in the center. The manual transmission models were also upgraded to a six-speed transmission instead of the previous generation's five-speed transmission. Engines during these year models do have an issue with oil consumption, along with numerous other automotive manufactures at the time. Subaru has a lawsuit due to it; some experience over 1.5 quarts of oil consumed between change intervals with low-level dash lights coming on. Some speculation on this {{is the use of}} different style piston rings on the engine style change and synthetic oil.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the front}} {{passenger}} can turn 360 degrees and the <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> can be tipped 90 degrees to face forwards or backwards. A sunroof and refrigerator were included.|$|E

5000|$|The {{interior}} of the Kangoo Trekka was spartan, and the <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> could be folded forward to provide a [...] loading area, to which sliding side doors provided better access.|$|E
5000|$|Laredo: Chrome grille, bumpers, and trim, {{hard top}} and hard full doors, tinted windows, faux leather interior, body color fender flares and alloy wheels.

50|$|The Supercruiser {{features}} a strut-braced high wing, a three-seat 36 in wide enclosed cockpit, fixed {{conventional landing gear}} and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft seats the pilot in front and two passengers in the <b>rear</b> on a <b>bench</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At Ford, {{development}} of a minivan {{began in the early}} 1970s as a companion model to the Econoline full-size van. As the company was readying the third-generation Econoline for a 1975 introduction, company product planners sought to develop the concept of a [...] "garageable van" [...] that could easily fit through a standard 7-foot-tall garage door opening. Dubbed Carousel, the vehicle was given a lower roofline and a rear body surrounded by glass (similar to the Chevrolet Nomad). Sharing its chassis with the standard-wheelbase van, the Carousel prototype was powered by a 460 cuin L V8 and an automatic transmission. In a key indication of its target market, the Carousel wore a rear tailgate with a drop-down rear window with simulated exterior woodgrain trim. Inside, it was fitted with two <b>rear</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> with interior trim similar to the Ford Country Squire and Mercury Colony Park.|$|R
