The polar stratospheric clouds in Antarctica are only formed when there are very low temperatures, as low as −80°C, and early spring conditions.

40|$|<b>Reactive</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> are {{an often}} {{overlooked}} group of compounds {{that may have}} played a catalyst role in tropospheric ozone formation in the Houston area. In the Houston area an ozone episode occurred in August of 1993, when an alkane-rich hydrocarbon plume passed over anthropogenic sources of molecular chlorine (Cl 2). Although the troposphere contains over 200 reactive chlorine gases, eight of them have been reported to constitute a majority of the tropospheric chlorine burden. To investigate the importance of chlorine compounds in the atmospheric chemistry of ozone non-attainment areas in Texas, the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC) is conducting a series of inventories and atmospheric modeling studies for reactive chlorine emissions. As a component of these TNRCC studies, Eastern Research Group (ERG) developed an inventory methodology for reactive chlorine emissions from mobile and area sources, and conducted an emission inventory for Southeastern Texas to demonstrate the methodology. Some of the sources that were inventoried by ERG included swimming pools, commercial cooling towers, laundry bleach, sea salt aerosols and crustal dust chlorine.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that extensive formation of organically bound chlorine occurs both in soil and in decaying plant material. Previous studies suggest that enzymatic formation of reactive chlorine outside cells is a major source. However, the ecological role of microbial-induced extracellular chlorination processes remains unclear. In the present paper, we assess whether or not the literature supports the hypothesis that extracellular chlorination is involved in direct antagonism against competitors for the same resources. Our review shows that {{it is by no means}} rare that biotic processes create conditions that render biocidal concentrations of <b>reactive</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds,</b> which suggest that extracellular production of reactive chlorine may have an important role in antagonistic microbial interactions. To test the validity, we searched the UniprotPK database for microorganisms that are known to produce haloperoxidases. It appeared that many of the identified haloperoxidases from terrestrial environments are originating from organisms that are associated with living plants or decomposing plant material. The results of the in silico screening were supported by various field and laboratory studies on natural chlorination. Hence, the ability to produce reactive chlorine seems to be especially common in environments that are known for antibiotic-mediated competition for resources (interference competition). Yet, the ability to produce haloperoxidases is also recorded, for example, for plant endosymbionts and parasites, and there is little or no empirical evidence that suggests that these organisms are antagonistic. ...|$|E
40|$|The winter 2009 / 2010 was {{characterized}} by a strong Arctic vortex with extremely cold mid-winter temperatures in the lower stratosphere associated with an intense activation of <b>reactive</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> (ClO x) from reservoir species. Stratospheric limb emission spectra were recorded during a flight of the balloon version of the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS-B) from Kiruna (Sweden) on 24 January 2010 inside the Arctic vortex. Several fast limb sequences of spectra (in time steps of about 10 min) were measured from nighttime photochemical equilibrium to local noon allowing the retrieval of chlorine- and nitrogen-containing species which change rapidly their concentration around the terminator between night and day. Mixing ratios of species like ClO, NO 2, and N 2 O 5 show significant changes around sunrise, which are temporally delayed due to polar stratospheric clouds reducing the direct radiative flux from the sun. ClO variations were derived {{for the first time}} from MIPAS-B spectra. Daytime ClO values of up to 1. 6 ppbv are visible in a broad chlorine activated layer below 26 km correlated with low values (below 0. 1 ppbv) of the chlorine reservoir species ClONO 2. Observations are compared and discussed with calculations performed with the 3 -dimensional Chemistry Climate Model EMAC (ECHAM 5 /MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). Mixing ratios of the species ClO, NO 2, and N 2 O 5 are well reproduced by the model during night and noon. However, the onset of ClO production and NO 2 loss around the terminator in the model is not consistent with the measurements. The MIPAS-B observations along with Tropospheric Ultraviolet-Visible (TUV) radiation model calculations suggest that polar stratospheric clouds lead to a delayed start followed by a faster increase of the photodissoziation of ClOOCl and NO 2 near the morning terminator since stratospheric clouds alter the direct and the diffuse flux of solar radiation. These effects are not considered in the EMAC model simulations which assume a cloudless atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|On 11 $^{th}$ February, 1997, the TRIPLE balloon was {{launched}} in Kiruna, Northern Sweden. It ascended into the lower stratosphere, reached a maximum altitude of 24. 1 km and landed in Northern Finland after a 2. 5 -hour flight. Thanks to advantageous meteorological conditions the balloon passed through the edge region of the polar vortex. Moreover, the data of the TRIPLE flight show that on that day a wave event occurred. The edge region of the polar vortex is of interest because {{the phenomenon of the}} polar vortex is closely related to the springtime ozone loss, also known as the ozone hole. Under certain circumstances, the air inside the vortex is forced to remain under polar night conditions for a period of months. Due to the low temperatures <b>reactive</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> are formed. After the return of sunlight in springtime especially the ClO radical acts as a catalyst of massive ozone depletion. The stability of the polar vortex and the action of the vortex edge as a transport barrier are decisive factors for the extent of ozone depletion. On the gondola of the TRIPLE balloon several instruments were mounted for the measurement of various molecules, among them the ClO/BrO instrument of Research Centre Jülich, an ozone sounding device from the University of Wyoming and the BONBON cryosampler from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main. Consequently it was possible to simultaneously observe the wave event and its consequences for the chemistry in the air masses in question. The measured ClO profile thus acted as an indicator of the lowest temperature experienced by the respective air parcel during the event. As the most probable simultaneous explanation for the observed ClO, temperature and pressure profiles a wave standing perpendicular to the earth’s surface is suggested. Chemistry and transport calculations by means of the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) support this assumption. A theoretical examination shows that such an event can cause horizontal mixing processes. Indeed, the ozone profile measured on the TRIPLE gondola provides indications of an intrusion of ozone-rich air masses originating from the outer vortex edge area or even from outside the polar vortex. This assumption was verified by the tracer-tracer method utilizing the N 2 O profile of the BONBON cryosampler. Besides these theoretical examinations and considerations, this work also contains a practical part. The working principle of the ClO/BrO instrument, the Chemical Conversion and Resonance Fluorescence (CCRF) method, is explained. The calibration of the instrument and difficulties in measuring BrO by the CCRF method are discussed. Moreover, studies are presented relating {{to the development of the}} HALOX aircraft instrument, a modified version of the balloon instrument which has been operated since the end of 2001 on board the Russian high-altitude research aircraft "Geophysica"...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reviews the}} {{various aspects of}} <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> in the stratosphere, both their roles as {{reactants}} and as tracers of dynamical processes. In the stratosphere, <b>reactive</b> <b>chlorine</b> is released from chlorofluorocarbons and other chlorine-containing organic source gases. To a large extent <b>reactive</b> <b>chlorine</b> is then sequestered in reservoir species ClONO 2 and HCl. Re-activation of chlorine happens predominantly in polar winter vortices by heterogeneous reaction in combination with sunlight. Catalytic cycles involving Cl, ClO, BrO, Cl 2 O 2, ClO 2, and others like NO, NO 2, OH, and HO 2 remove odd oxygen (ozone and atomic oxygen) from the atmosphere. Under an ozone hole condition, the ClO dimer cycle is particularly important, while in mid-latitudes the short-lived reservoir HOC 1 has some importance. Solar proton events can also affect stratospheric chlorine chemistry, but whether solar protons effectively activate or deactivate chlorine was shown to depend on illumination conditions. The lifetime of chlorofluorocarbons {{has an impact on}} the availability of ozone destructing substances in the stratosphere and depends on the Brewer-Dobson circulation which controls at which altitudes and how long an air parcel is exposed to photochemistry. In turn, the chlorine-containing source gases can be used as tracers to constrain the age of stratospheric air and thus to diagnose the Brewer-Dobson circulation. The use of complementary measurement systems was essential to extend our knowledge on chlorine-containing compounds in the stratosphere. ClO is best measured by remote sensing in its rotational bands in the far infrared and microwave region. For HOC 1 the far infrared bands are ideal, but some substantial information was also gained with microwave and mid-infrared measurements. ClONO 2 is only measured in the thermal infrared, while HCl has a measurable signal in the microwave, far infrared and mid-infrared regions. The mid-infrared HCl lines, however, are situated at wavelengths where blackbody emission at terrestrial temperatures is so low that infrared measurements of HCl are possible only in solar absorption geometry, but not in thermal emission. Chlorine source gases are most accurately measured by air sampling techniques, while global coverage can only be achieved by satellite-borne thermal infrared measurements. In epistemological terms, research on stratospheric chemistry and particularly the role of <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> used various scientific concepts from deductive reasoning, falsificationism, abductive reasoning and so-called “puzzle-solving within normal science”.

However, much less is known of mechanisms of defense against halogens such as <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> Although chlorine-based oxidants may oxidize {{a number of}} cellular components, sulfhydrl groups are particularly reactive. We have, therefore, assessed the importance of intracellular glutathione in protection of Escherichia coli cells against hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, and chloramines. Employing a glutathione-deficient E. coli strain (JTG 10) and an otherwise isogenic glutathione-sufficient E. coli strain (AB 1157), we find that glutathione-deficient organisms are approximately twice as sensitive to killing by both hydrogen peroxide and <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> However, the mode of protection by glutathione in these two cases appears to differ: exogenous glutathione added to glutathione-deficient E. coli in amounts equal to those which would be present in a similar suspension of the wild-type bacteria fully restored resistance of glutathione-deficient bacteria to chlorine-based oxidants but did not change resistance to hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, in protection against <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds,</b> oxidized glutathione is almost as effective as reduced glutathione, implying that the tripeptide and/or oxidized thiol undergo further reactions with <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> Indeed, in vitro, 1 mol of reduced glutathione will react with approximately 3. 5 to 4. 0 mol of hypochlorous acid.

In contrast, the air processed in the cyclonic event spreads more slowly.

The profile data are averaged within twelve, 20 °-wide latitude bins from 55 ° S to 55 ° N and at eleven altitudes from 27. 5 to 52. 5 km. The separate, 14 -yr data time series are analyzed using multiple linear regression (MLR) models that include seasonal, interannual, 11 -yr sinusoid, and linear trend terms. Proxies are not used for the interannual, solar uv-flux, or <b>reactive</b> <b>chlorine</b> terms. Instead, the present analysis focuses on the periodic 11 -yr terms to see whether they are in-phase with that of a direct, uv-flux forcing or are dominated by some other decadal-scale influence. It is shown that they are in-phase over most of the latitude/altitude domain and that they have max minus min variations between 25 ° S and 25 ° N that peak near 4 % between 30 and 40 km. Model simulations of the direct effects of uv-flux forcings agree with this finding. Ozone in the middle stratosphere of the northern subtropics is perturbed during 1991 – 1992, following the eruption of Pinatubo. There are also pronounced decadal-scale variations in the ozone of the upper stratosphere for the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, presumably due to dynamical forcings. The 11 -yr ozone responses of the Southern Hemisphere are relatively free of those extra influences. The associated linear trend terms from the analyses are negative (− 2 to − 4 %/decade) for this 14 -yr time period and are nearly constant across latitude in the upper stratosphere.
