40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} an innovative information and decision support tool (ToolSHeD(TM)) developed to help construction designers to integrate the management of OHS risk into the design process. The underlying structure of the prototype web-based system and the process of knowledge acquisition and modelling are described. Design/methodology/approach - The ToolSHeD(TM) research and development project involved the capture of expert reasoning regarding design impacts upon occupational health and safety (OHS) risk. This knowledge was structured using an innovative method well-suited to modelling knowledge in the context of uncertainty and discretionary decision-making. Example "argument trees" are presented, representing the reasoning used by a panel of experts to assess the risk of falling from height during <b>roof</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>work.</b> The advantage of using this method for modelling OHS knowledge, compared to the use of simplistic rules, is discussed. Findings - The ToolSHeD™ prototype development and testing reveals that argument trees can represent design safety risk knowledge effectively. Practical implications - The translation of argument trees into a web-based decision support tool is described and the potential impact of this tool in providing construction designers (architects and engineers) with easy and inexpensive access to expert OHS knowledge is discussed. Originality/value - The paper describes a new computer application, currently undergoing testing in the Australian building and construction industry. Its originality lies in the fact that ToolSHeD(TM) deploys argument trees to represent expert OHS reasoning, overcoming inherent limitations in rule-based expert systems...|$|E

40|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>maintenance</b> is {{an issue}} that has ongoing ramifications for {{property}} owners, all over the world. Determining accurately what maintenance should be taken is difficult, with often-conflicting evidence further complicating the task. A system has been developed for use by <b>Roof</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Experts. The expert can input information about the condition of the roof then a Fuzzy Neural Network makes an assessment, returning probable <b>roof</b> <b>maintenance</b> options. This is a non-trivial problem from the realworld domain. Often, many combinations of possible maintenance can occur and, as individual parameters change, so does the prime (or most important) option. A fuzzy neural network system was developed for assessment, running on a handheld device that could be taken into the field by a <b>roof</b> <b>maintenance</b> expert...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to propose an approach that assists facility managers in obtaining the needed information to establish a proactive <b>roof</b> <b>maintenance</b> plan. Two main methodologies are used in this research. The first approach, Historical Maintenance Data Analysis (HMDA), investigates and pinpoints the root cause of roof leaks by thoroughly collecting and analyzing <b>roof</b> <b>maintenance</b> records. HMDA hypothesizes that a mathematical model can be developed to reveal relationships between potential roof leak causes and leak incidences. The second approach, Roof Service Life Prediction (RSLP), investigates the applicability of the Factor Method in <b>roof</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The use of RSLP for leak predictions is based on the assumption that the first-time leak has a linear relationship with the estimated service life (ESL) of the roof. This research demonstrates that <b>roof</b> <b>maintenance</b> records can be used to predict and identify major factors that are likely causes of roof leaks in a mathematical causal model. Roof leaks are not totally random events and can be predicted. In this study, three parameters (Age, Workmanship, and Roof Repair) have a significant impact on the roof leaks probability within the first three years of a roof life. A unit change of workmanship and roofs age increases the odds of a roof leak. On the other hand, changes in roof repair decrease the odds of a roof leak. The Factor Method performed in the RSLP confirms the existence of a relationship between the ESL and the first-time leak. The correlations discovered are positive and significant to highly significant. The extents of correlation are found to be low to medium. The finding also illustrates a relatively simple and useful factor method technique that can be applied to the <b>roof</b> <b>maintenance</b> decision-making process. The estimated service life of a roof provides a reasonable estimation of a maintenance-free period. When ESL information is used in conjunction with knowledge obtained from HMDA, the new synthesis of knowledge will expand the facility maintenance professionals ability to develop and schedule a proactive <b>roof</b> <b>maintenance</b> plan.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic decision-making approach for <b>roofing</b> <b>maintenance</b> management that combines a stochastic Markovian performance prediction {{model with a}} multi-objective optimization method to determine the optimal allocation of funds and prioritization of <b>roofs</b> for <b>maintenance,</b> repair and replacement. A product model of the roof system is used to provide the data framework for collecting and processing data. The prioritization of the roofs {{is based on the}} simultaneous satisfaction of several conflicting objectives, including minimization of maintenance and repair costs, maximization of the network condition rating, and minimization of risk of failure. The <b>roofing</b> <b>maintenance</b> management problem is formulated as a stochastic multiobjective optimization problem, where several conflicting objectives are simultaneously satisfied. Compromise programming is used to determine the optimal ranking of the deteriorated roofs in terms of their priority for repair and replacement, by achieving a satisfactory trade-off between the competing or conflicting objectives...|$|R

40|$|With {{a growing}} number of aged {{buildings}} which need to undergo <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> in Hong Kong, disputes concerning building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> has become increasingly common in recent years. There have been contentions that bid-rigging activities involved during the tendering process of these projects. Bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> is a social problem as all buildings will become aged and required to carry out building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> It is illegal and harmful to the society as the affected group of people would be extensively covering all types of occupants in terms of cost and living environment. In the event that bid-rigging arises during tendering process of the building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works,</b> flat owners not only have to pay additional amount of money out of the exorbitant building maintenance cost, but they have to bear the risk of works which cannot be properly done. In addition, it implies various parties have participated in the tendering process enabling the building consultants or building contractors to win the maintenance contract fraudulently. Such incidents also reflected that there may be grey areas in legislation which enhances the emergence of bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> Although there are various kinds of supporting schemes from the government and related organizations to assist building owners to carry out <b>maintenance</b> <b>works,</b> the effectiveness of the schemes remain unknown regarding the increasing disputes arise from building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> and bid-rigging. The study would have a deeper understanding for the causes and effects of bid-rigging in relation to building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> in terms of building condition, assistance and policies provided by the government and relevant organizations to assist building owners in Hong Kong. These include technical and financial assistance on building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works,</b> education for prevention and detection of infraction in collusive behavior, and legislation and prosecution on alleged crimes. In the final part, recommendations would be made to avoid bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> The goals of the study is to identify the cause of the problem of bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> in Hong Kong and make possible suggestions to prevent the bid-rigging in building <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
