FRP Advisory claims care homes were the only UK industry that suffered rising insolvencies over the time period. There is pressure on care homes because councils have contributed less while costs, notably staff overheads rose. Martin Green of Care England said, “My view is that if you ask me who is to blame, it is the government. The government should be delivering a very clear vision for what social care is, they should be giving clear expectations to citizens about what they should expect from the system and what they should expect to pay for. None of that is happening.” Chris Stevens of FRP said, “The fall in sterling against the euro will exacerbate pre-existing pressure on staffing costs in a sector reliant on overseas workers to fill frontline staff vacancies, and where margins have come under increasing pressure from the rise in the minimum wage, pension costs and cuts in local authority funding. The care home sector is beleaguered due to all local authorities facing overall double-digit budget cuts for this current financial year under way and beyond.” ...|$|E

This research is based on the fieldwork of an ethnographic project of residents’ lived experiences in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> facilities. Using ethnographic materials, the author explores the text-act relation in <b>care</b> <b>activities</b> within a theoretical framework of Institutional Ethnography. This work aims to reveal what orients staff in daily care delivery and what makes the local text meaningful. Findings from this study demonstrate, when the residents’ preferences and personal needs were made into the local ‘task-sheets’, the person-centred care ideal could be made real in the smooth flow of <b>care</b> <b>activities.</b> To implement evidence-based policy in local setting, the working of the local text and its meaning to daily care delivery need to be understood. Instead of spending a disproportional amount of staff-time on care plans which are not meaningful in the local, more resources need to be allocated to the development of person-centred and integrated local text.

40|$|Care for {{children}} in residential settings is popularly characterised as the last resort {{for children}} who have had multiple failed placements and often high levels of need, requiring therapeutic help. It is often assumed that children will leave <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> for independent living. Using administrative data for a six-year period (2008 – 2014) for children “looked after” in Wales, univariate and bivariate {{analyses were conducted to}} provide a characteristic profile of the <b>residential</b> child <b>care</b> population. Of those placed in a residential setting, the vast majority of children were voluntarily placed and the most common reason for leaving <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> was going home.

40|$|Purpose: While {{state policy}} and market factors {{are known to}} have contributed to the {{increased}} supply of <b>residential</b> <b>care,</b> little is known about efforts to accommodate demand from lower-income consumers. This study describes participation and expenditure trends for <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> services funded by Medicaid waivers and examines variation across programs. Design and Methods: We collected annually reported Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Form 372 data from state officials for each waiver that provides <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> services for the period 1995 to 2002. Descriptive statistics examined waiver program participation and expenditures while adjusting for population changes and inflation. Results: Between 1995 and 2002, national Medicaid waiver-funded <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> participants increased by almost threefold to 120, 000 and expenditures more than quadrupled to $ 2. 3 billion. However, Medicaid waiver program participation and spending varied considerably by state, by target population, and by level of care. Implications: This study highlights three important policy concerns: (a) Medicaid-supported residents remain underrepresented in <b>residential</b> <b>care,</b> (b) large interstate variation persists in Medicaid <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> service provision, and (c) state policy choices favor Medicaid spending on <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> for persons with mental retardation or developmental disabilities...|$|R
40|$|<b>Residential</b> <b>care</b> {{has had a}} poor reputation. There are {{concerns}} about the abuse of children in care, and evidence of poor outcomes and poor practice. In this context, <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> is often compared {{in a negative way}} to family placements. On the other hand, <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> can also provide a positive experience for some children and young people. <b>Residential</b> <b>care</b> has increasingly been contrasted with family placements, and yet children and young people describe their positive experiences in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> as like being in a family, and refer to care staff using kin terms, such as ‘dad’ or ‘sister’. With the growing diversity of families in Western society, there have been significant developments in sociological theories of families and these highlight the importance of family practices and displaying family. New kinship studies in anthropology have raised questions {{about the nature of the}} family. Research on children’s conceptualisation of family has begun to identify features of ‘family-like’ relationships.

40|$|Since 2012, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (the Royal Commission) has {{uncovered}} evidence of significant rates {{of child sexual}} abuse within Australian <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> facilities. Although much of this evidence is historical and relates to residential facilities that were run quite differently to the ways that <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> is provided in contemporary times, child sexual abuse remains a risk for many young people in care. In addition to child sexual abuse perpetrated by adults within <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> settings, greater attention has recently focused on problematic sexual behaviour amongst young people, and the exploitation of young people by adults outside the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> setting (Hallett, 2015; Timmerman & Schreuder, 2014). In 2014, the Royal Commission commissioned the Institute of Child Protection Studies at the Australian Catholic University, with partners from Griffith University and Queensland University of Technology, to develop an understanding of how children perceive safety and consider it within institutional contexts. Specifically, this study explores the following research questions: 1. What does safety to mean to children and young people in the context of <b>residential</b> <b>care?</b> a. How do children and young people perceive safety within <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> and what do they need to feel and be safe? b.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{examined}} the predictive factors of preference for <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> in cognitively intact and impaired elders and their family caregivers. It was hypothesized that disagreement in preference for <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> between the elders and their caregivers was greater in the cognitively impaired. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted during June 2007 to March 2008 in Hong Kong, and 707 community-dwelling elders aged 65 and above and 705 family caregivers were interviewed. Cognitively impaired elders were over-sampled to give reliable estimates for that sub-group. A structural questionnaire was used {{to collect data on}} preference for <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> and potential factors. Logistic regression was used to identify the predictors. Results: More cognitively impaired elder-caregiver dyads (37. 4 %) had disagreement in preference for <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> than cognitively intact elder-caregiver dyads (20. 5 %) (p<. 001). From the elders' perspective, less preference for <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> was associated with cognitive impairment, whereas greater preference was associated with depression (for cognitively intact elders), more usage of community service and functional impairment. From the caregivers' perspective, greater preference for <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> was associated with greater caregiver burden, or care-recipients having cognitive or functional impairment, or more usage of community services. Conclusions: Cognitively intact elders were more likely to indicate preference for <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> than cognitively impaired elders. Elders, both cognitively intact and impaired, were less likely than their caregivers to indicate preference for <b>residential</b> <b>care.</b> Disagreement in preference for <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> between the elders and their caregivers was larger for the cognitively impaired group than the cognitively intact group.

40|$|Abstract Background This study aims to {{describe}} the development, testing and optimization of a new standard instrument, the Consumer Quality Index (CQ-index ®) Long-term Care, for measuring client experiences with long-term care in the Netherlands. Methods Three versions of the CQ-index questionnaires and protocols for study sampling and data collection were developed, designed for interviews with residents of nursing or <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> homes and postal surveys among representatives of psychogeriatric residents and homecare clients. From July to November 2006 a pilot study was conducted among 2, 697 clients of 68 nursing or <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> homes, 2, 164 representatives of clients in 57 psychogeriatric care institutions, and 1, 462 clients of 19 homecare organizations. We performed psychometric analyses and descriptive analyses, and evaluated the pilot study. Results The pilot study showed the feasibility and usability of the instruments, supported the multidimensionality of the questionnaires and showed first findings on client experiences and possibilities for quality improvement. Nine scales applied to all care settings: shared decision making, attitude and courtesy, information, body care, competence and safety of <b>care,</b> <b>activities,</b> autonomy, mental well-being, and availability of personnel. The pilot resulted in three optimized questionnaires and recommendations for nationwide implementation. Conclusions The CQ-index ® Long-term Care provides a good basis to investigate the quality of nursing homes, <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> homes and homecare from the clients' perspective.

This qualitative research examined the experiences of twelve older people, living in an East Midlands City, who had moved into <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> in the late 1990 s. The semi-structured interviews with older people, examining the impact of life histories, were preceded by interviews with twenty-nine practitioners working {{across a range of}} health and social care settings. Practitioners were interviewed in order to hear their perspectives on relocation to <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> and to contrast their broad experiences and ideas with older people's. The older people had been living in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> for different lengths of time, some weeks and some months. They were located in private, housing association and local authority <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> homes. Other methods included an examination of demographic data and reflective analysis through a research diary. The research is placed within historical contexts, undertaken five years after the introduction of the 1990 NHS and Community Care Act. This research highlights older people's experiences in the journey from their own private home to <b>residential</b> <b>care.</b> It discusses how older people experienced <b>residential</b> <b>care,</b> compares the perspectives of older people and practitioners, evaluates the influence of the life course and various social actors and identifies successful movers.

40|$|Background: As the {{population}} is ageing rapidly in Beijing, the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> sector is in a fast expansion process {{with the support of}} the municipal government. Understanding spatial accessibility to <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> resources by older people supports the need for rational allocation of care resources in future planning. Methods: Based on population data and data on <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> resources, this study uses two Geographic Information System (GIS) based methods - shortest path analysis and a two-step floating catchment area (2 SFCA) method to analyse spatial accessibility to <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> resources. Results: Spatial accessibility varies as the methods and considered factors change. When only time distance is considered, <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> resources are more accessible in the central city than in suburban and exurban areas. If care resources are considered in addition to time distance, spatial accessibility is relatively poor in the central city compared to the northeast to southeast side of the suburban and exurban areas.

40|$|During {{the last}} years the numbers of unaccompanied {{children}} seeking asylum in Sweden have increased rapidly. Most of these children are placed in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> homes. Although influence is a right for the children, many studies show that their influence lacks at <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> homes. Previous studies have also shown that social workers {{were aware of the}} importance of children’s influence but the problem was that they didn’t have any methods to make it work in practice. Further there are other studies that present methods in working with children’s influence. Client- focused work and actively listening to the children are two methods among others that studies has shown are important when working with influence. At the same time it has shown that the conditions at <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> homes are not satisfying for working with children’s influence. We therefore wanted to study the accommodation- staffs’ experiences of children’s influence at <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> homes. 8 accommodation- staffs’ were interviewed in various <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> homes in a county in southern Sweden.

40|$|The role of <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> for {{children}} has developed very differently internationally, {{but in all}} cultural contexts {{there are questions about}} the extent to which it can help young people recover from high risk backgrounds. In the UK, <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> has come to be seen as the placement of last resort, yet new government guidance on permanence has suggested that <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> can provide security and a sense of belonging. Narrative analysis of interviews with 20 care leavers identified their different pathways from birth families through <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> to early adulthood. Some experienced a transformation from a negative sense of self as victims or ‘bad children’ to survivors, while others continued to struggle. Key to successful turning points were four interacting factors, all associated with resilience; connection, agency, activity and coherence. These narratives revealed the importance of nurturing relationships and a sense of ‘family’, but also the role of support after leaving <b>residential</b> <b>care,</b> when transitions workers helped them to move on but stay connected.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} praise in caregiving of nursing home residents with dementia in Sweden. The data consist of video-recordings of staff–resident interaction in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> settings where caregivers assist residents with personal hygiene. High-grade assessments accomplishing praise or a compliment such as ‘jättebra’ (‘great’) are routinely used online, simultaneously withthe <b>care</b> <b>activity,</b> by the caregiver when the residents are requested to undertake manual tasks ontheir own, such as tooth brushing, washing, dressing, and getting out of bed. It is shown that the primary function of the assessments is to encourage someone to do something, which is discussedas an institutionally related problem. These results contrast with prior research on domiciliary care in Sweden and Denmark, which show that high-grade assessment terms formulated so as toaccomplish praise or a compliment are reserved for situations where the home helper’s institutional role as the senior citizen’s helping hand is downplayed. It is argued that a more sensitive use of assessments and a higher awareness of the social norms concerning epistemic primacy may be a step toward implementing person-centeredness in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> for older people.
