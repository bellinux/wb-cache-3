30|$|Protection misoperations {{in power}} systems are a top {{reliability}} concern {{according to a}} recent state of <b>reliability</b> <b>report</b> of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) [1]. Protection misoperations fall into two broad categories: failures to trip and false trips, where trip means the removal of a piece of supposedly faulty equipment from the system by opening some circuit breakers. Equipment faults considered in this paper are three-phase short to ground faults in transmission lines. The principles established, however, are applicable to other types of transmission line faults and faults in other types of equipment. A typical protection system is designed to be dependable (to trip whenever it should) at the expense of security (not to trip whenever it should not) [2]. False trips occur much more often than failures to trip in a stressed system [1]. False trips are sometimes referred to as hidden failures. A hidden failure is a permanent defect causing the incorrect removal of a circuit element as a direct consequence of another triggering event [3]. A system can become stressed when it is subject to an equipment fault, a switch, a change in load/generation power, or a severe event of nature.|$|E
40|$|Background As {{dementia}} progresses in {{the course}} of life, one's functions may be reduced regarding to fulfill the activities of daily living. One of the most important factor to diagnose and determine the severity of dementia is to assess activities of daily living. Objectives one {{the most important factor in}} determining the severity of dementia in the area of activities of daily living is disability assessment for dementia (DAD) scale, which is not available in Persian and there is no validity and <b>reliability</b> <b>report</b> for it in Iranian community. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a Persian version of the valid and reliable DAD scale to assess functional disability in patients with dementia of Alzheimer type within the scope of everyday living activities. Patients and Methods After the permission from the developer of the original scale, we translated the English version to Persian according to the international quality of life assessment (IQOLA) approach. To review the clarity and the necessity of the items translated, content validity index (CVI) and content validity ratio (CVR) methods were applied. Also, to assess the reliability of the scale, test-retest and inter-rater reliability techniques were used. The internal consistency of the items was also measured using the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Results Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was very good for the scale (Cronbach’s α = 0. 78) and the inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability were excellent (intraclass correlation/ICC = 0. 99, ICC = 0. 99). The clarity and necessity of the translated items based on the scores of CVI and CVR were also acceptable. Conclusions The Persian version of DAD, during the study, had a very good validity and reliability and can serve as a useful scale in clinical assessment of functional disability in patients with Alzheimer’s in the area of activities of daily living...|$|E

40|$|Project (M. S., Civil Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Sacramento River Winter-run Chinook Salmon (salmon) {{populations are}} declining {{and have been}} {{classified}} as an endangered species since 1994. Populations are sensitive to water temperatures and flow, {{both of which have}} changed due to hydraulic operations, and may continue to change in response to climate change. The {{purpose of this study is}} to estimate changes in salmon populations in response to a hypothetical climate change scenario using computer models. For two hypothetical climate scenarios, flow data for California's water system have been simulated and made publicly available as part of Department of Water Resource???s 2011 State Water Project Delivery <b>Reliability</b> <b>Report.</b> The climate scenarios are: (1) historical climate conditions, and (2) medium-to-high emissions and air temperature changes (a 2050 level of development, A 2 greenhouse gas level of emissions). For this study, DWR???s flow data, based on 80 years of historical hydrology, and the associated temperatures projected by the ECHAM- 5 climate model were used to simulate water temperatures, salmon mortality rates, and salmon production in the upper Sacramento River between Keswick Dam and Red Bluff Dam. The models used in this study [...] the Sacramento River Water Quality Model (SRWQM) and the Salmonid Population Model (SALMOD) [...] are the same models used by the U. S. Department of Interior Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). SRWQM results show that climate change causes a 3 ??F increase in maximum water temperatures. SALMOD results show water temperature changes affect the salmon population significantly more than flow. In typical years, calculated salmon mortalities were not changed significantly by climate change (CC). In contrast, when conditions were unfavorable, salmon mortalities were substantially higher under the CC scenario and these unfavorable conditions happened with greater frequency.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in deep submicron (DSM) technology have imposed an adverse {{impact on the}} long-term lifetime reliability of semiconductor devices. According to the <b>reliability</b> <b>report</b> from International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), smaller feature sizes and higher power densities make DSM devices more susceptible to wear-out failures. As a consequence, permanent faults {{are more likely to}} occur in DSM devices at runtime. To ensure system reliability and availability, fault tolerant techniques must be applied to overcome these runtime permanent faults. For systems requiring non-stop computation, a full duplication of system hardware components is usually required, which incurs a high overhead in hardware cost. For systems that allow a short period of downtime, however, low cost software techniques that take advantage of the inherent hardware redundancy of computing devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors, can potentially be applied as an intermediate fault recovery step. These techniques can reconfigure the computation of a faulty device to maintain the system operation until the faulty device can be replaced. ^ To maintain correct computation on a faulty device, operations originally assigned to faulty resources must be moved to fault-free device resources. This process requires two phases: a testing phase to locate faults and a recovery phase to eliminate the usage of faulty resources in the computation. In this dissertation, we present software techniques that address specific testing and recovery challenges for FPGAs and VLIW processors. ^ For FPGAs, we focus on testing and recovering path delay faults. Path delay faults occur when the maximum delay of at least one critical path exceeds the maximum allowable system delay due to a permanent fault. To locate paths with delay faults, a built-in self-test (BIST) approach is presented to evaluate all combinations of signal transitions along critical paths. To recover from path delay faults, a timing-driven incremental router is used to reroute paths affected by the faults. To facilitate fast fault recovery, information from the initial design route is used to guide the reroute process. Since many embedded systems have a limited amount of local computational resources, a network-based recovery system has been developed. A computationally superior server performs the FPGA fault recovery and sends the results back to the affected client, completing the recovery process. Experiments on the recovery system have shown that the incremental router provides a speedup of up to 12 x compared with a commercial incremental flow. ^ For VLIW processors, we focus on recovering from permanent faults in registers. To maintain VLIW functionality after detecting faulty registers, programs must be recompiled to assign variables to fault-free registers. One issue with recompilation is possible performance loss due to increased register requirements. To address this problem, a register pressure control technique is presented to reduce register requirements. To demonstrate its advantages, the technique has been integrated into an academic VLIW compiler. Experimental results have shown that the technique improves performance by 14 % compared with an academic VLIW flow. ...|$|E
40|$|This Master's thesis covers {{almost all}} aspects of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM). All {{objectives}} in Chapter 1 are met. The thesis is mainly comprised of three parts. First part introduces the world of CBM to readers. This part presents data acquisition, data processing and databases, which are the foundation to CBM. Then it highlights models which are divided into physics based models, data-driven models and hybrid models, for diagnostic and prognostic use. Three promising diagnostic and prognostic models are specified, i. e., Markov model, Artificial neural networks and the time-dependent proportional hazard model. Afterwards, CBM main steps are presented in figure 2. 2. This figure is made based on a large quantity of literature review and can function as an index when readers are querying CBM data, diagnostic and prognostic models and steps. It can also give readers a whole picture of CBM. Next, introductions of Prognostic and Health Management (PHM), CBM industry applications and CBM {{state of the art}} are followed. Specific challenges, phenomena and questions are summarized. Second part presents a Matlab toolbox made by the writer. This toolbox estimates components' Remaining Useful Life (RUL) with a standard deviation, the probability to survive till the next maintenance time and Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) based on numerous simulations. The stochastic processes behind are the (continuous time) Markov model, the Brownian motion process and the Gamma process. Users can choose among them in the toolbox. Specially, MTTF and the steady-state-probability can be achieved by using the Markov model. This toolbox is used often in the next part when data is analyzed. The writer makes the graphic interface of this toolbox easy for people to use. All instructions are given. All code is also attached, from the whole toolbox code to a tiny simulation step with detailed explanations. This toolbox makes it possible for the people with little knowledge in statistics and maintenance to make their own maintenance plans. This toolbox can be download on-line. The third part of this Master's thesis uses 7 statistic models and 3 stochastic processes to model the degradation process of the elastomeric annular body from the annular preventer of a BOP system. To make these models, many relevant papers and books are studied. In this Master's thesis, these models are not just "theories" or "formulas". Instead, for each model, the writer gives a vivid example by analyzing the data with all Matlab code and detailed explanations following. The writer believe by doing this readers can have a deeper understanding of each model. They may use one of these models for their own data in the future. To make it easier for readers to follow, the difficulty of these models is increasing one after one. The complex model can give a more precise estimation of the lifetime with more influence factors being taken into consideration. As to the structure of the third part, firstly, much literature about BOP is read. A brief description about BOP systems is followed. Virtual failure data is simulated based on a trustful BOP <b>reliability</b> <b>report.</b> The exponential model is firstly used to give a preliminary understanding of the data. Afterwards, the Weibull model, the log-logistic model and the log-normal model are used. All these models use Maximum likelihood Estimation (MLE). Minitab is the analyzing software used here. Then, the Brownian motion process is introduced to model the degradation process. Next, the covariates are introduced (e. g., the temperature). The Weibull regression model is elaborated followed by Proportional hazard model (Cox regression model) and Arrhenius model. These three are very promising models used in CBM. Brownian motion is used again to model the degradation. However, this time, the covariates are taken into account. It leads to the change of the path of the Brownian motion process each time when covariates are changing. It is more complex but more realistic. This is the final step to model the degradation in a component level. To model the degradation in a system level, two extra models are included. That is the Markov model and the Brownian motion process for a koon system with covariates. They are shown in the same chapter. Finally, relevant maintenance plans are made based on the result of "RUL" and "the probability to survive till the next maintenance interval...|$|E

This is noteworthy given the numerous deficiencies of coefficient alpha documented in the psychometric literature.

To facilitate the shift from alpha to omega we also present a brief guide to the calculation of point and interval estimates of omega using a free, open source software environment...|$|R
30|$|If {{relevance}} is emphasized, {{the signal}} is {{reported in the}} period in which it is produced. With emphasis on <b>reliability,</b> <b>reporting</b> is delayed by one period at the benefit of reducing the noise inherent in the signal. Reporting, however, is a necessary condition for contractability in our setting. Moreover, we build {{on the fact that the}} farther in the distant future a measure is reported, the less useful it becomes for contracting. We reflect this idea in our model by restricting contractability to measures reported throughout the two-period horizon of our game. As a result, late reporting prevents the second-period accounting signal from being directly available for contracting. To allow for motivation of the second-period effort at all, we assume that some, possibly distorted, non-accounting signal is present to be used as a performance measure.|$|R

When not all system abstraction layers (technology, circuit, microarchitecture, software) are factored in such an estimation model, the delivered <b>reliability</b> <b>reports</b> must be excessively pessimistic and thus lead to unacceptably expensive, over-designed systems. We propose a scalable, cross-layer methodology and supporting suite of tools for accurate but fast estimations of computing systems reliability. The backbone of the methodology is a component-based Bayesian model, which effectively calculates system reliability based on the masking probabilities of individual hardware and software components considering their complex interactions. Our detailed experimental evaluation for different technologies, microarchitectures, and benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed model delivers very accurate reliability estimations (FIT rates) compared to statistically significant but slow fault injection campaigns at the microarchitecture level...|$|R
