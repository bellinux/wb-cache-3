5|$|Because {{there are}} no other large cities in the Republic of Macedonia, and because of {{political}} and economical centralisation, a large number of Macedonians living outside of Skopje work in the capital city. The dynamism of the city also encourages <b>rural</b> <b>exodus,</b> not only from Macedonia, but also from Kosovo, Albania and Southern Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a <b>rural</b> <b>exodus</b> of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.|$|E
25|$|Rapid {{expansion}} {{following the}} pattern of <b>rural</b> <b>exodus</b> has resulted in considerable rebuilding in the city centre and mushrooming of suburban development elsewhere. Norzin Lam, the recently upgraded main thoroughfare, is lined with shops, restaurants, retail arcades and public buildings.|$|E
50|$|This {{demographic}} {{structure is}} {{a direct consequence of}} the <b>rural</b> population <b>exodus</b> who took place {{in the second half of}} the 20th century and who concerned the whole interior regions in Spain. In fact, in 1930 the population of Peracense managed to reach 455 inhabitants, its historical maximum, losing since then almost 80% of its total workforce.|$|R
50|$|Although {{migrants}} {{came from}} all segments of society, several groups {{were more likely to}} migrate than others. Like other examples of rural flight, the young were more likely than the old to migrate to the cities. Young women under 20 were the most likely segment of the population to leave <b>rural</b> life. This <b>exodus</b> of young women further exacerbated the demographic transitions occurring in rural communities as the rate of natural increase dropped precipitously {{over the course of the}} 20th century. Lastly, the skilled and educated were also likely to migrate to urban areas.|$|R
40|$|The North Fluminense Region has {{undergone}} significant transformation in recent decades. Currently, the oil-producing region is also {{host of the}} biggest portindustry enterprise in Latin America: the Industrial Complex of Açu Superport, still under construction, and located in the southern portion {{of the city of}} São João da Barra, who has been suffering with the transformation of their rural are in industrial expansion area, which has generated environmental conflicts such as expropriation of small producers, disruption of family agriculture, ecosystem impacts on the sandbank and about fishing. Another venture observed here and also designed as industrial port is the Port Complex of Suape, located 40 km from Recife, Pernambuco. Conceived in order to not only meet the demand of the region, but being able to generate new demands, Suape has been consolidated as a key economic development of the state.  In this sense, the present work aims to make a comparative analysis between the (potential and existing) effects of the construction of the Port of Açu and the changes occurring in the catchment area of the Port of Suape, as the expropriation of traditional populations, the <b>exodus</b> <b>rural,</b> the population growth and social tension related to the control of natural resources. </em...|$|R
25|$|Moreover, the Vili, {{as opposed}} to the Yombe people, are less {{attached}} to the land because of their commercial vocation and their positioning as intermediaries between the populations of the hinterland and the European traffickers. All these migratory flows will provoke an important <b>rural</b> <b>exodus,</b> accentuating the ageing and gender imbalance. The continuous depopulation of Bwali, the capital of the former Kingdom of Loango is illustrated.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1880s {{agriculture}} employed {{more people than}} industry and trade combined. However, Germany was fast becoming an industrialized state with increased <b>rural</b> <b>exodus</b> to the cities. After Bismarck resigned in 1890 and Leo von Caprivi became chancellor, the demands of industry were much more compelling, and the free trade treaties with Russia and Austria as well as legislation favorable to industry {{was seen as a}} threat to agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The {{reforestation}} of uncultivated lands, {{imposed by}} the government in 1935, reduced the available pastures, and contributed to a <b>rural</b> <b>exodus</b> that continued after the 1950s. Yet it was still common practice for the residents of mountain communities to spend part of the year in two locations, primarily near Castro Laboreiro. From about Easter to about Christmas, residents would live in homes over 1,000m above sea level, known as branda (from the Portuguese brando, meaning ‘mild’ or ‘gentle’). In the remaining part of the year, these inhabitants would occupy homes in the river valley, known as inverneira (from the Portuguese inverno, meaning ‘winter’).|$|E
40|$|Humans are {{responsible}} for most forest fires in Europe, but anthropogenic factors behind these events are still poorly understood. We tried to identify the driving factors of human-caused fire occurrence in Spain by applying two different statistical approaches. Firstly, assuming stationary processes for the whole country, we created models based on multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression to find factors associated with fire density and fire presence, respectively. Secondly, we used geographically weighted regression (GWR) to better understand and explore the local and regional variations of those factors behind human-caused fire occurrence. The number of human-caused fires occurring within a 25 -yr period (1983 – 2007) was computed {{for each of the}} 7638 Spanish mainland municipalities, creating a binary variable (fire/no fire) to develop logistic models, and a continuous variable (fire density) to build standard linear regression models. A total of 383 657 fires were registered in the study dataset. The binary logistic model, which estimates the probability of having/not having a fire, successfully classified 76. 4 % of the total observations, while the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model explained 53 % of the variation of the fire density patterns (adjusted R 2 = 0. 53). Both approaches confirmed, in addition to forest and climatic variables, the importance of variables related with agrarian activities, land abandonment, <b>rural</b> population <b>exodus</b> and developmental processes as underlying factors of fire occurrence. For the GWR approach, the explanatory power of the GW linear model for fire density using an adaptive bandwidth increased from 53 % to 67 %, while for the GW logistic model the correctly classified observations improved only slightly, from 76. 4 % to 78. 4 %, but significantly according to the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), from 3451. 19 to 3321. 19. The results from GWR indicated a significant spatial variation in the local parameter estimates for all the variables and an important reduction of the autocorrelation in the residuals of the GW linear model. Despite the fitting improvement of local models, GW regression, more than an alternative to "global" or traditional regression modelling, seems to be a valuable complement to explore the non-stationary relationships between the response variable and the explanatory variables. The synergy of global and local modelling provides insights into fire management and policy and helps further our understanding of the fire problem over large areas {{while at the same time}} recognizing its local character...|$|R

25|$|Of 6,649 {{people at}} the {{beginning}} of the census of the people in 1793, the commune reached a demographic peak in 1861 with 17,180 inhabitants, prior to be severely affected by the War of 1870 by losing nearly 1,000 of its children. Then began a slow decline accentuated by the World War I, no longer accommodating more than 10,132 inhabitants in 1946. The second half of the 20th century - with the absorption of Saint-Nicolas-près-Granville in 1962, the <b>rural</b> <b>exodus</b> and the construction of many estates on the outskirts - allowed the commune to win residents again to achieve 13,022 inhabitants in 2006. That same year, only 0.5% of the Granville population was foreign, with the presence small Portuguese, Spanish and Moroccan communities each representing 0.1% of the population, far from the regional average of 8.8%, and 16.9% of households consisted of single-parent families, ten points under this same regional average.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} the 19th century {{before the arrival of}} {{phylloxera}} was a golden age of wine. The industrial revolution enriched a bourgeoisie clientele for the best wines and the <b>rural</b> <b>exodus</b> to the factories created a large market for mass-produced wines. A prominent example for white wines was the viticulture in Germany. The feeling of freedom infused into the German winemakers under French occupation during the First Empire prevented the aristocracy and the clergy from recovering all the vineyards from which they were dispossessed. The practice of late harvest was widespread and the more or less sweet wines gained balance against their always lively acidity. In 1872 the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute was created and it was the source of a great amount of interbreeding giving new varieties – the best known of these is the Müller-Thurgau. During the same period, Switzerland adopted, along the shores of Lake Geneva, vineyards predominantly producing white wine.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} New State's rule, the city had a {{population}} boom, driven by economic development and industrial progress. During the 1950s and especially the 1960s, there was a large-scale <b>rural</b> <b>exodus</b> from the provinces to the capital. Surrounding areas were filled with peasants uprooted from farms and dwelling in squalid neighbourhoods. The largest and best known of these was the Brandoa. From the 1960s onward, government policy {{was influenced by the}} technocratic faction in the regime which advocated modernisation projects including expansion of the educational system and industrialisation, leading to a fast-growing national economy with increases in general standards of living and quality of life in the city. Although it is generally agreed that the republic accomplished several notable social and economic achievements, including major improvements in public health and education levels in the period between the end of the Second World War and the 1974 revolution, the New State was finally deposed by the Carnation Revolution (Revolução dos Cravos), launched in Lisbon with a military coup on 25 April 1974. The movement was joined by a popular campaign of civil resistance, leading to the fall of the Estado Novo, the restoration of democracy, and the withdrawal of Portugal from its African colonies and East Timor. The strain of waging the Portuguese Colonial War had overextended and weakened the Portuguese dictatorship, leading to the overthrow of Caetano's regime. Younger military officers, disillusioned by a far-off and taxing war, began to side with the pro-independence resistance against Portugal and eventually led the military coup in Lisbon, ending a dictatorship that had been in power since 1933.|$|E

500|$|Skopje {{began to}} recover from decades of decline after 1850. At that time, the city {{experienced}} a slow but steady demographic growth, mainly due to the <b>rural</b> <b>exodus</b> of Slav Macedonians. It was also fuelled by the exodus of Muslims from Serbia and Bulgaria, which were gaining autonomy and independence from the Empire at that time. During the Tanzimat reforms, nationalism arose in the Empire and in 1870 a new Bulgarian Church was established and its separate diocese was created, based on ethnic identity, rather than religious principles. The Slavic population of the bishopric of Skopje voted in 1874 overwhelmingly, by 91% in favour of joining the Exarchate and {{became part of the}} Bulgarian Millet. Economic growth was permitted by the construction of the Skopje-Salonica railway in 1873. The train station was built south of the Vardar and this contributed to the relocation of economic activities {{on this side of the}} river, which had never been urbanised before. Because of the <b>rural</b> <b>exodus,</b> the share of Christians in the city population arose. Some of the newcomers became part of the local elite and helped to spread nationalist ideas Skopje was one of the five main centres of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization when it organised the 1903 Ilinden uprising. Its revolutionary network in Skopje region was not well-developed and the lack of weapons was a serious problem. At the outbreak of the uprising the rebel forces derailed a military train. On 3 and 5 August respectively, they attacked a Turkish unit guarding the bridge on the Vardar river and gave a battle in the [...] "St. Jovan" [...] monastery. In the next few days the band was pursued by numerous Bashibozuks and moved to Bulgaria.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Spanish miracle" [...] fed {{itself on}} the <b>rural</b> <b>exodus</b> which created {{a new class of}} {{industrial}} workers. The economic boom led to an increase in rapid, largely unplanned building {{on the periphery of the}} cities of the Costa del Sol to accommodate the new workers arriving from the countryside. Some cities preserved their historic centres, but most were altered by often haphazard commercial and residential developments. The same fate befell long stretches of scenic coastline as mass tourism exploded.|$|E

Also, between the two world wars, the truffle groves planted in the 19th century stopped being productive. (The average life cycle of a truffle-producing tree is 30 years.) Consequently, after 1945, the production of truffles plummeted, and the prices have risen dramatically. In 1900, truffles were used by most people, and on many occasions.

2500|$|Brazilian {{affluent}} suburbs {{are generally}} denser, more vertical and mixed in use inner suburbs. They concentrate infrastructure, investment and {{attention from the}} municipal seat and the best offer of mass transit.

These, in comparison with the inner suburbs, often prove to be remote, violent food deserts with inadequate sewer structure coverage, saturated mass transit, more precarious running water, electricity and communication services, and lack of urban planning and landscaping, while also not necessarily qualifying as actual [...] or slums. They often are former agricultural land or wild areas settled through squatting, and grew in amount particularly due to mass <b>rural</b> <b>exodus</b> during the years of the military dictatorship. This is particularly true to São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasília, which grew with migration from more distant and empoverished parts of the country and dealt with overpopulation as a result.|$|E
2500|$|The first non-Portuguese {{people to}} settle Rio Grande do Sul were German {{immigrants}}.

From 1824 to 1914, 50,000 Germans arrived in Rio Grande do Sul. Most of these colonists had rural communities in the countryside of the State as their first destination. The large <b>rural</b> <b>exodus</b> in Brazil in the early 20th century brought many German-descendants to Porto Alegre and, nowadays, they compose {{a large percentage of the}} population. The second largest group of immigrants who arrived in Porto Alegre were the Italians. They started immigrating to Brazil in 1875, mainly from the Northern Italian Veneto region. As the Germans, Italians were also first sent to rural communities, mainly in the Serra Gaúcha region. After some decades, many of them started to migrate to other parts of Rio Grande do Sul, including Porto Alegre. [...] Minority communities of immigrants, such as Central Europeans from Poland and Eastern Europeans from Ukraine and Jews; Arabs from Palestine, Lebanon and Syria; Asians from Japan; as well as Spaniards arriving after the Civil War also made Porto Alegre their home.

60|$|No, I didn't {{like those}} young countrymen, and I'm no {{believer in the}} English {{countryside}} under the Bladesover system as {{a breeding ground for}} honourable men. One hears a frightful lot of nonsense about the <b>Rural</b> <b>Exodus</b> and the degeneration wrought by town life upon our population. To my mind, the English townsman, even in the slums, is infinitely better spiritually, more courageous, more imaginative and cleaner, than his agricultural cousin. I've seen them both when they didn't think they were being observed, and I know. There was something about my Wimblehurst companions that disgusted me. It's hard to define. Heaven knows that at that cockney boarding-school at Goudhurst we were coarse enough; the Wimblehurst youngsters had neither words nor courage for the sort of thing we used to do--for our bad language, for example; but, on the other hand, they displayed a sort of sluggish, real lewdness, lewdness is the word--a baseness of attitude. Whatever we exiled urbans did at Goudhurst was touched with something, however coarse, of romantic imagination. We had read the Boys of England, and told each other stories. In the English countryside there are no books at all, no songs, no drama, no valiant sin even; all these things have never come or they were taken away and hidden generations ago, and the imagination aborts and bestialises. That, I think, is where the real difference against the English rural man lies. It is because I know this that I do not share in the common repinings because our countryside is being depopulated, because our population is passing through the furnace of the towns. They starve, they suffer, no doubt, but they come out of it hardened, they come out of it with souls.|$|E
