40|$|Geological mapping, the {{classification}} of bedrock into distinct identifiable units, has traditionally been conducted {{at the discretion of}} the field geologist on the basis of human-observable properties such as those of mineralogical composition and texture. In recent years technological developments have allowed the collection and analysis of ever more advanced quantitative geoscientific datasets. We are now approaching a point where migration of traditional mapping procedures to the digital domain is a feasible reality, with such benefits as consistency, transferability and transparency. One issue that we encounter is that the most geologically informative measurements, such as those of chemical composition, tend to have their sampling density limited by their high cost. Meanwhile, <b>remote</b> <b>sensed</b> data will tend towards extremely high sampling density, but may lack stand-alone geological significance. Nonparametric regression techniques have the potential to negate this issue by modelling the most geologically informative measurements as complex interactions of multiple <b>remote</b> <b>sensed</b> covariates. In this poster we present the use of random forest regression to model soil geochemistry in south west England using <b>remote</b> <b>sensed</b> data, and demonstrate how clustering of the predicted high resolution soil geochemistry is able to differentiate geological units – a process that can be trained to match pre-existing rock classifications. We find that random forest regression based on <b>remote</b> <b>sensed</b> data is capable of predicting element concentrations in soils with superior accuracy to that of ordinary kriging of sparsely sampled point data. Crucially the random forest predictions incorporate the high resolution structure of the <b>remote</b> <b>sensed</b> covariates. This allows geological units, in this case defined purely {{on the basis of the}} geochemical composition of their soils, to be mapped with sharp boundaries limited only by the resolution of the <b>remote</b> <b>sensed</b> covariates. It seems likely that such techniques could take centre stage in the future of geological mapping: improving not only on the consistency of classified maps based on human observations, but also allowing the continuous mapping of any geologically constrained variables, such as radon potential, to the best resolution and accuracy that our covariate datasets can support. ...|$|R

This paper describes our recent efforts towards using texture to automate the annotation of <b>remote</b> <b>sensed</b> imagery. Two applications are described that use the homogeneous texture descriptor recently standardized by MPEG- 7. In the first, higher-level access to <b>remote</b> <b>sensed</b> imagery is enabled by using the texture descriptor to model geospatial objects. In particular, the common textures, or texture motifs, are characterized as Gaussian mixtures in the high-dimensional feature space. In the second application, the texture descriptor is used to label regions in a large collection of aerial videography in a perceptually meaningful way. Gaussian mixtures are used to model the distribution of feature vectors for a variety of semantic classes. Frame level similarity retrieval based on semantic layout and semantic histogram is enabled by modeling the spatial arrangement of the labeled regions as a Markov random field. 1...|$|R

5|$|There is {{no obvious}} visual {{evidence}} of the linear features usually associated with farm fields in the land surrounding Chetro Ketl, but in 1929 aerial black-and-white images by Charles Lindbergh revealed {{what appeared to be}} a rectangular plot. In the early 1970s the National Park Service (NPS) developed a <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> program to further investigate the area using color video imagery. When enhanced and viewed in black-and-white, the video revealed a well-defined grid pattern within a larger rectangular section of land near Chetro Ketl. The NPS employed two types of ground level <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> devices to search for magnetic and soil anomalies in the alluvium of the canyon floor. A soil density study proved inconclusive, but a magnetometer identified a rectangular feature , roughly the same size as those seen in Lindbergh's aerial photographs. The NPS researchers proposed that water had deposited iron-bearing clays in the plots, with the center showing the strongest magnetic evidence. Subsequent comparisons with older data reinforced their conclusion. They determined that had the plots been under heavy alluvium they would not have been detected.|$|E

30|$|However, the {{analyses}} above are mostly based on field data, which need to parameterize, calibrate and validate NPP estimation models (Zheng et al. 2003). The field observing data have three main disadvantages: (1) the experiment sites are selected subjectively {{and the field}} data are quite unbalanced, data collected in developed areas are more intense and accurate than that in developing areas or less-developed areas; (2) up-scaling the field data to global estimation models brings about more uncertainties, especially under the premises of different conditions for various models (Law et al. 2006; Xiao et al. 2011); (3) data sharing is a critical issue that hinders many researchers from analyzing more complex circumstances. To avoid such shortages, more and more researches start to apply <b>remote</b> <b>sensed</b> products in analyzing NPP impact factors (Potter et al. 2003; Nayak et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2005).
