40|$|Objectives: To assess, using {{standardised}} patients (SPs), how <b>rheumatologists</b> diagnose psoriatic arthritis, {{whether the}} diagnostic efficiency {{is influenced by}} specific characteristics of the <b>rheumatologists,</b> and to study the relationship with costs. Methods: Twenty three <b>rheumatologists</b> were each visited by one of two SPs (one male, one female) presenting as a patient with psoriatic arthritis.

We compare the judgments of the panel of <b>rheumatologists</b> with the judgments of 2 musculoskeletal radiologists. Two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists evaluated independently the same hand and foot radiographs as assessed by the panel of <b>rheumatologists.</b> Progression was defined as important if the radiologist would state it as substantial progression in their report. Two readers, different from the radiologists and <b>rheumatologists,</b> independently obtained the Sharp/van der Heijde scores. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to quantify the minimally important progression defined by the radiologists expressed in Sharp/van der Heijde change-scores. The change-score with the highest accuracy represented the minimally important progression and was compared with the MCID defined by the panel of <b>rheumatologists</b> for 4 different settings (early versus advanced RA and mild versus high disease activity). The minimally important progression defined by the radiologists was estimated at 6. 5 Sharp/van der Heijde units.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Depression is {{a common}} and {{important}} comorbidity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The study aim was to describe rates of depressive symptoms and their associations with RA disease activity using measures reported from patients and <b>rheumatologists.</b> METHODS: The Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America (CORRONA) registry is an observational cohort with data on more than 33, 000 RA patients. Using depression symptom measures reported separately by patients and <b>rheumatologists,</b> lifetime prevalence, 12 -month prevalence, and annualised incidence rates (IR) were estimated. Additionally, cross-sectional associations between RA disease {{and a history of}} depressive symptoms were examined. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence estimates of 26. 5 % and 12. 9 % were reported by patients and <b>rheumatologists,</b> respectively. The 12 -month prevalence rates reported by CORRONA patients and <b>rheumatologists</b> were 11. 7 % and 1. 0 %, respectively. The annualised IR from the self-reported depressive symptom measure was approximately 7. 8 per 100 patient-years, compared to 0. 4 per 100 patient-years reported by their <b>rheumatologists.</b> Increased disease activity at study entry was associated with a higher probability of reporting a history of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: RA patients have a high likelihood of experiencing symptoms of depression, while treating <b>rheumatologists</b> under-report them and disease estimates based on their reports were much lower when compared to healthy individuals. Thus, estimates of prevalence and the impact of these symptoms need to be interpreted based on the source of the diagnosis.

Most patients with rheumatic diseases are not cared for by <b>rheumatologists,</b> and the situation will probably worsen if future manpower estimates are correct. In 1980, the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) concluded that there would be 3, 000 <b>rheumatologists</b> in the US by 1990 (2). This proved to be quite accurate, as there are now 3, 200 adult <b>rheumatologists</b> in practice and in academia (3).

We aimed to describe how monitoring tools are used and perceived by clinicians in the UK, to ascertain treatments used for JLS and to provide a de-scription of transition arrangements to adult care. Methods. An e-survey of UK paediatric <b>rheumatologists</b> and dermatologists managing children and young people (CYP) with JLS was distributed using the national organisations representing these clinician groups. We asked respondents for their views and experience using 15 JLS monitoring tools, about transition services and about treatments used. Results.

Three hundred and nine <b>rheumatologists</b> (78. 2 %) responded to the survey. For acute gout attacks, combination therapy (NSAIDs or steroid + colchicine) was often used, even in monoarticular involvement, and colchicine was commonly started as monotherapy after 36 hours or more from onset of attack. During an acute attack, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) was withdrawn by approximately a third of <b>rheumatologists.</b> Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis (98 % colchicine) was initiated when ULT was started in most cases (92. 4 %), but its duration was varied.

However, it is infrequently applied in Dutch clinical practice. Based on qualitative research on opinions of physicians and patients towards COBRA therapy, our study describes the development and pilot testing of an implementation package to facilitate prescription and use of COBRA therapy in early RA. METHODS: The implementation package was developed to address specific barriers towards prescription of COBRA therapy and comprised informational handouts (an information booklet and leaflet for patients), preprinted prescription orders, and background information on COBRA therapy for the <b>rheumatologists.</b> Twenty-two <b>rheumatologists</b> agreed to participate, including the arthritis nurse where available. <b>Rheumatologists,</b> nurses, and patients were asked to record their experience. All Dutch arthritis nurses were invited to an educational session on COBRA therapy. RESULTS: Sixteen <b>rheumatologists</b> accompanied by 10 arthritis nurses used the material to prescribe COBRA therapy to a total of 27 patients. <b>Rheumatologists</b> and nurses both gave high marks to the supplied materials. Eighty-eight percent of <b>rheumatologists</b> reported that the material sped up the prescription process, and 65 % indicated they would prescribe COBRA therapy more frequently if these materials were available routinely. Patients expressed great satisfaction with the information handouts, rating it 2. 8 (standard deviation 0. 5) on a scale of - 3 (very negative) to + 3 (very positive). Most patients (89 %) planned to keep the information booklet as a reference and 70 % used it as a tool to remember the correct intake of medication. The attitude and perceived capability of nurses towards the guidance of patients with RA receiving COBRA therapy was improved through a brief educational intervention. CONCLUSION: <b>Rheumatologists,</b> patients, and arthritis nurses all highly appreciated the implementation package and indicated that its availability would increase uptake of COBRA therapy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} outcome {{expectations}} of RA patients, <b>rheumatologists,</b> and physiotherapists regarding high intensity exercise programmes compared with conventional exercise programmes. METHODS: An exercise outcome expectations questionnaire {{was administered to}} 807 RA patients, 153 <b>rheumatologists,</b> and 624 physiotherapists. The questionnaire consisted of four statements regarding positive and negative outcomes of high intensity exercise programmes and four similar statements for conventional exercise programmes. A total expectation score for both conventional and high intensity exercise was calculated, ranging from - 2 (very negative expectation) to 2 (very positive expectation). RESULTS: The questionnaire was returned by 662 RA patients (82 %), 132 <b>rheumatologists</b> (86 %), and 467 physiotherapists (75 %). The mean (95 % confidence interval) scores for high intensity exercise programmes were 0. 30 (0. 25 to 0. 34), 0. 68 (0. 62 to 0. 74), and - 0. 06 (- 0. 15 to 0. 02), and for conventional exercise programmes were 0. 99 (0. 96 to 1. 02), 1. 13 (1. 09 to 1. 17), and 1. 27 (1. 21 to 1. 34) for RA patients, <b>rheumatologists,</b> and physiotherapists, respectively.

40|$|Objective. The COBRA therapy (combination {{therapy in}} early {{rheumatoid}} arthritis) {{has proven to}} be an effective treatment for early RA, but is rarely prescribed. A survey showed reluctance of Dutch reumatologists to apply COBRA therapy in early RA. The present qualitative study was carried out to further explore the reservation of Dutch <b>rheumatologists</b> towards prescribing COBRA therapy and include patients’ view on (components of) COBRA therapy. Methods. Two focus group discussions were undertaken for <b>rheumatologists</b> (n 1 = 8, n 2 = 7) and two for patients (n 1 = 4, n 2 = 8). In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 <b>rheumatologists</b> and 1 patient. These were taped and transcribed. Two independent researchers identified themes and these were discussed with three other researchers. Results. <b>Rheumatologists</b> were positive concerning effectiveness of COBRA therapy, but highly concerned about their patients’ possible negative reaction to the large amount of pills to be prescribed. In addition, <b>rheumatologists</b> perceived lack of time explaining and prescribing COBRA therapy and felt uncomfortable prescribing high doses of prednisolone. Patients were positive about an aggressive combination therapy such as COBRA, and they had no qualms taking many pills if this could improve their prognosis. Patients associated prednisolone with negative side-effects, but were also aware of the benefits and the need of prednisolone in rough times. A decrease in the amount of pills after intensive treatment was highly appreciated. Conclusion. <b>Rheumatologists</b> and patients differed in opinion about the use of COBRA therapy. <b>Rheumatologists</b> were particularly concerned about their patients’ reaction towards them prescribing such an aggressive and complex therapy, whereas patients, while aware of the side-effects, were most interested in suppressing illness symptoms and reducing future damage regardless of the amount of pills.
