5|$|The ride {{features}} more than 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features {{the voices of the}} regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer.

In homage to the Back to the Future ride that it has replaced, The Simpsons Ride's queue video features a brief animated cameo from Doc Brown who is voiced by Christopher Lloyd.|$|E

Though everyone in the peloton had the same time at the finish, Bole, Gerrans, and Voeckler finished {{just ahead of the}} main field, in that order to round out the podium. Voeckler also turned in the team's best <b>ride</b> <b>at</b> the Tour de la Somme, finishing ninth in the field sprint.

The Cat also stars in the 1982 television film The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat and the 2010 animated television series The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That! A <b>ride</b> <b>at</b> Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure park in Orlando, Florida, is based around The Cat in the Hat.|$|E

5|$|Snow White's Scary Adventures is {{a popular}} theme park <b>ride</b> <b>at</b> Disneyland (an opening day {{attraction}} dating from 1955), Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris.

5|$|Sophia and Ann Gardiner Peacock's father, Anthony Taylor Peacock of South Kyme, was {{a wealthy}} banker and his father, Anthony Peacock, was a land-owner, {{who had worked}} closely with Benjamin Handley as a sponsor of the Sleaford Navigation and {{commissioner}} of enclosures in the 1790s. Among the younger Peacock's other daughters was Louisa, who married Rev. Francis William Rhodes in 1844. Louisa and Francis Rhodes's nine children included Cecil Rhodes and Frank Rhodes; they spent their childhood summers with their aunt Sophia at the Manor House in Sleaford and in the Channel Islands. Frank and Cecil learnt to <b>ride</b> <b>at</b> the Manor and it was during these visits to Sleaford that Cecil began his long friendship with Robert Yerburgh, a son of the town's vicar. On Sophia Peacock's death in 1892, Frank Rhodes inherited the Manor House. He was still living there in 1897.|$|E
5|$|Taaramäe took fourth overall at Paris–Nice in March, {{winning the}} youth {{classification}} with this performance, which was easily the strongest for an Estonian rider in the event's history. Taaramäe {{turned in a}} similar strong <b>ride</b> <b>at</b> the two-day, three-stage Critérium International, finishing on the event's final podium in third place, and securing the youth classification. At the concurrent Volta a Catalunya, Dumoulin took two stage wins. The first was in stage 5, on an uphill false flat finish which Dumoulin felt suited him well. The second was more unexpected, {{in that it was}} a dead flat run in to the finish on wide roads, a more traditional field sprint. Dumoulin was delighted to win twice in front of some of the sport's biggest stars, and stated that his next goal would be a major spring classic, perhaps the Amstel Gold Race. Dumoulin, however, was not a factor at the Amstel, finishing 104th, over eight minutes behind the winner.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} an {{excellent}} later {{half of the season}} in single-day races, attaining top-ten placings in all but one such race that they entered.

In August, Nizzolo continued his strong neo-pro season with a fifth place <b>ride</b> <b>at</b> the GP Ouest-France, finishing second-best from the peloton behind three attacking riders who took each podium place just ahead of them.|$|E
