40|$|The sex {{pheromone}} of the <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> midge {{has been}} identified and synthesised by East Malling Research (EMR) and Natural Resources Institute (NRI) and {{has proved to be}} highly attractive and useful for pest monitoring. East Malling Research coordinated a collaborative ring test of standard <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> midge sex pheromone traps in 2006. The aims were to investigate the seasonal temporal pattern of the midge flight in different raspberry production regions of Europe and the relationship between the magnitude of catches and the numbers of eggs and larvae which developed subsequently in artificial splits in the primocane of untreated raspberry plantations. The standard <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> midge sex pheromone trap used for the ring test consisted of a white delta trap containing a 20 x 20 cm sticky base and with a rubber septum lure impregnated with 10 μg of the <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> midge sex pheromone racemate. Pairs of traps, separated by > 20 m, were deployed in the centre of raspberry plantations at a height of 0. 5 m in Italy, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway and the UK. The traps proved effective and easy to use for monitoring the flight of adult male <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> midge. There were very large variations (30 fold) between plantations in total numbers of midges caught over the season indicating plantations which are at comparatively low and high risk from the pest. Three generations of adult flight were apparent in Norway, Russia and Sweden and four generations in the central European countries with possibly 5 generations in Italy, though later generations were often difficult to distinguish. In the northern countries, the 1 st generation first and peak flight occurred on Julian days 150 and 165, respectively, whereas in Italy the 1 st generation first and peak flight occurred approximately on Julian days 110 and 130 respectively. The 1 st generation flights occurred much earlier in polytunnel protected crops than in open field crops. Data obtained on the occurrence of larvae were variable in quality but a linear relationship between the peak numbers of males captured in the pheromone traps per week for a given generation (M) and the peak numbers of eggs and larvae per cm in artificial splits in the primocanes for that generation subsequently (L) was apparent (L = 0. 025 M; R 2 = 0. 61). A nominal threshold of 30 midges per trap per week had beenproposed but the linear relationship derived indicates that this threshold, which would result in 0. 75 eggs + larvae/cm, is too high. In reality, the degree of larval infestation that occurs and the resultant severity of crop damage will depend on the numbers of natural splits in the crop. The ring test is being continued in several countries in 2007...|$|R
40|$|In vitro and in vivo {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to estimate {{the efficacy of the}} two microbial formulations based on Bacillus subtilis Cohn. and Pseudomonas fluorescens Mig. on the fungus Didymella applanata (Niessl.) Sacc., the causal agent of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) spur blight. In vitro, both bacteria reduced the growth of D. applanata. In inoculation experiments with <b>raspberry</b> <b>canes</b> in two cultivars with different susceptibility to D. applanata, these antagonistic bacteria suppressed fungal development by reducing the lesions area and the number of D. applanata fruiting bodies. Field trials of two biological formulations under natural conditions showed a significant suppression of the disease. B. subtilis and P. fluorescens included in the formulations revealed antagonistic activity towards D. applanata that depended on the red raspberry cultivar and weather conditions. In all cases, B. subtilis showed better results than P. fluorescens in biocontrol of the raspberry spur blight. This study demonstrated {{for the first time the}} ability of the biocontrol agents B. subtilis and P. fluorescens to suppress red <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> spur blight, a serious worldwide disease...|$|R

40|$|Gall midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) are {{important}} pests of many horticultural crops. They {{are difficult to}} control by conventional means as the larvae develop in galls surrounded by plant tissue. Gravid females need to locate suitable host plant material on which to lay their eggs and there is good evidence that host-produced odour cues are involved. Gall midge pheromones are now available commercially; these attract males to allow monitoring in the field. However there are currently no lures available to attract females. This work aims to develop lures, {{for up to three}} gall midge species, which attract gravid females and can be used to monitor females in the field. Three species of gall midges were investigated: the <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> midge, Resseliella theobaldi (Barnes), the blackcurrant leaf midge, Dasineura tetensi (Rübsaamen), and the apple leaf midge, Dasineura mali (Kiefer). Field studies showed gravid <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> midge females are attracted to split canes for oviposition. Chemicals were identified using solid phase microextraction (SPME) which were present only or in much larger quantities after canes split. A lure based on these chemicals was tested in the field with different trap types but no significant attraction was seen to the lures of either male or female <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> midges. Blackcurrant leaf midge females lay their eggs on blackcurrant shoots. A suite of volatiles was identified using SPME which were produced by blackcurrant shoots. Bioassay work was carried out in a four-way olfactometer and a wind tunnel to assess female attraction to shoot material but no attraction was seen in either experiment. Solutions containing natural volatile extracts were obtained using entrainment onto Porapak resin. The effect of these chemicals on female blackcurrant leaf midge antennae was assessed using electroantennography (EAG) but there were not enough responses to conclude that any compound was EAG-active. Apple leaf midges lay their eggs on apple leaf shoots. A suite of chemicals was identified which are produced by apple shoots. EAG runs were carried out on female midges with both natural and synthetic solutions but numbers of responses were low and {{it was not possible to}} conclude that any of the compounds were definitively EAG active...|$|R

We crossed the tangle of fern and bracken, bramble and wild <b>raspberry</b> <b>canes</b> that spread in the open space before the house, and we went down the grassy slope to the edge of Nethermere.

40|$|During the 2004 growing season, five {{raspberry}} cultivars {{were evaluated}} {{in terms of}} their susceptibility to the <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> midge (Resseliella theobaldi Barnes). The trial was carried out at Berkenye, Nógrád County, Hungary. The cultivars evaluated were ‘Rubaca’ from Germany, ‘Fertődi Zamatos’ from Hungary, ‘Tulameen’ from Canada, and ‘Autumn Bliss’ and ‘Golden Bliss’ from the United Kingdom. Every other week, twenty-five split primocanes of each cultivar were randomly collected for laboratory examination. Data recorded for each cultivar included the mean number of larvae, the mean split length, and the mean extent of bark peeling per primocane. Pearson’s linear correlation coefficients were calculated for the correlations between the annual mean number of larvae per primocane on the one hand, and the annual cumulative mean split length per primocane and annual mean extent of bark peeling per primocane on the other hand. There was a weak correlation between annual mean number of larvae and annual cumulative mean split length, and a stronger correlation between annual mean number of larvae and annual mean extent of bark peeling. Annual mean number of larvae per primocane and annual mean extent of bark peeling per primocane were both highest in ‘Rubaca’, which means that the number of larvae per cane largely depends on the extent of stem peeling, although longitudinal splitting may also play a role. Therefore, cultivars with hardly any bark peeling and few and small longitudinal splits can be presumed to be less susceptible to infestation by the <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> midge. Using these criteria, the least susceptible of the five cultivars evaluated would be ‘Tulameen’ and ‘Fertődi Zamatos’. Further research is needed to confirm this conclusion and to gather data on other factors which affect cultivar choice for new plantations, including winter hardiness, and susceptibility to cane diseases...|$|R

40|$|A phenotypic-genotypic {{characterization}} {{of more than}} 250 Rubus accessions was achieved in Northern Italy (Trentino) over multiple years, both for varietal comparison and {{for the improvement of}} the breeding programme. The key traits investigated were related to morphological, flowering and horticultural aspects. Tolerance to the main pests and diseases, such as two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) and Resseliella theobaldi (<b>Raspberry</b> <b>Cane</b> Midge – RCM), and diversity profiles were also assessed. Genetic diversity among the accessions evaluated was confirmed by a significant variability for several components involved in fruit quality, post-harvest performance, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. Phenotyping of raspberry allowed us also to select interesting primocane advanced selections, and to define parental lines of great importance to the FEM breeding program, both for fresh and processing markets use. Genotyping was subsequently integrated with phenotypic information through the use of Single Nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers for highthroughput screening for a dual benefit: in order to drive more efficiently the targeted traits and to guarantee cultivar protectio...|$|R

60|$|But {{there were}} other objects of delight and {{interest}} claiming his instant attention: there were quaint twisted candlesticks {{in the shape of}} snakes, and a teapot fashioned like a china duck, out of whose open beak the tea was supposed to come. How dull and shapeless the nursery teapot seemed in comparison! And there was a carved sandal-wood box packed tight with aromatic cotton-wool, and between the layers of cotton-wool were little brass figures, hump-necked bulls, and peacocks and goblins, delightful to see and to handle. Less promising in appearance was a large square book with plain black covers; Nicholas peeped into it, and, behold, it was full of coloured pictures of birds. And such birds! In the garden, and in the lanes when he went for a walk, Nicholas came across a few birds, of which the largest were an occasional magpie or wood-pigeon; here were herons and bustards, kites, toucans, tiger-bitterns, brush turkeys, ibises, golden pheasants, a whole portrait gallery of undreamed-of creatures. And as he was admiring the colouring of the mandarin duck and assigning a life-history to it, the voice of his aunt in shrill vociferation of his name came from the gooseberry garden without.

40|$|Evidence for {{pollinator}} declines has led {{to concern}} that inadequate pollination services may limit crop yields. The global trade in commercial bumble bee (Bombus spp.) colonies provides pollination services for both glasshouse and open-field crops. For example, in the United Kingdom, commercial colonies of nonnative subspecies of the bumble bee Bombus terrestris L. imported from mainland Europe are widely used for the pollination of raspberries, Rubus idaeus L. The {{extent to which these}} commercial colonies supplement the services provided by wild pollinators has not been formally quantified and the impact of commercial bumble bees on native bees visiting the crop is unknown. Here, the impacts of allowing commercially available bumble bee colonies to forage on <b>raspberry</b> <b>canes</b> are assessed in terms of the yield of marketable fruit produced and the pollinator communities found foraging on raspberry flowers. No differences were found in the abundance, diversity, or composition of social bee species observed visiting raspberry flowers when commercial bumble bees were deployed compared with when they were absent. However, weight of marketable raspberries produced increased when commercial bees were present, indicating that wild pollinator services alone are inadequate for attaining maximum yields. The findings of the study suggests that proportional yield increases associated with deployment of commercial colonies may be small, but that nevertheless, investment in commercial colonies for raspberry pollination could produce very significant increases in net profit for the grower. Given potential environmental risks associated with the importation of nonnative bumble bees, the development of alternative solutions to the pollination deficit in raspberry crops in the United Kingdom may be beneficial. © 2011 Entomological Society of America...|$|R
40|$|The <b>raspberry</b> <b>cane</b> midge, Resseliella theobaldi, is a {{widespread}} pest of cultivated red raspberry in Europe. Pheromone-baited traps could provide a much-needed, accurate means to monitor the pest. Volatiles collected separately from virgin female and male midges were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) to reveal four female-specific components. In analyses by GC coupled to electroantennographic (EAG) recording from the antennae of a male midge, {{at least three of}} these components elicited responses. Based on its GC retention indices and mass spectrum, we propose that the major component is 2 -acetoxy- 5 -undecanone and confirm this by synthesis of the racemic compound in seven steps and 63 % yield from 4 -pentenoic acid. The three minor components were each present at approximately 30 % of the major component and were identified as 2 -undecanone, (S) - 2 -acetoxyundecane, and (S) - 2 -undecanol by comparison of GC retention times and mass spectra with those of synthetic standards. GC analyses of the female-produced volatiles on an enantioselective column showed that only one enantiomer of 2 -acetoxy- 5 -undecanone was present, and this was found to be the S-enantiomer by hydrolytic kinetic resolution of an epoxide intermediate in the synthesis and also by enantioselective hydrolysis of the racemic acetate with a lipase enzyme. The two enantiomers were also separated by high-performance liquid chromatography on an enantioselective column for field tests. In two field trapping tests, (S) - 2 -acetoxy- 5 -undecanone was highly attractive to male R. theobaldi; the R-enantiomer was not attractive. The racemic compound was just as attractive as the S-enantiomer, and addition of the three minor components in racemic form at two different loads did not affect catches. The pheromone could be dispensed from both rubber septa and polyethylene vials for at least 1 month under field conditions, but the former was preferred as it gave more uniform release. 2 -Acetoxy- 5 -undecanone belongs to a new group of pheromone structures in the Cecidomyiidae, most others being mono- or diesters...|$|R
