25|$|Six artillerists were {{adequate}} {{to serve a}} cannon, but to achieve maximum rates of fire larger crews were needed. The Canon de 12 Gribeauval was manned by a crew of 15 and drawn by 6 horses. Eight {{of the men were}} specialists. Single cannons were often commanded by a non-commissioned officer while two or more pieces were directed by an officer. The most experienced gunner stood behind and to the left, aiming and firing the cannon. A second gunner stood {{to the left of the}} cannon and loaded the cartridge and shot. The third gunner stood to the right with a <b>rammer,</b> mopping out the barrel after firing and ramming home a new round. Additional crewmen brought fresh ammunition to load, kept matches burning and the touch hole clear, repositioned the gun after firing, observed the fall of shot, drove the ammunition wagon (caisson) and held the horses. A trained 12-pounder crew could fire one round per minute. A team of six horses pulled the 12-pounder and a team of four hauled each caisson.|$|E
500|$|The Mk 12 Gun Assembly (pictured) was a semi-automatic, power rammed, {{vertical}} sliding-wedge {{breech block}} type gun. Since this gun assembly fired semi-fixed ammunition, (pictured) each round {{was delivered to}} the guns in two pieces. Each gun, in this twin mount, had its own projectile hoist and powder case hoist from the upper handling room. The electric-hydraulic projectile hoist would deliver a projectile next to the projectile man with the nose down and waist high. The electric-hydraulic powder case hoist poked the case through a powder scuttle in the gun room's deck just next to the powder man's feet. [...] At the load command, the powder man would slip a primer protector {{off the end of}} the powder case, extract the case from the scuttle, and lift it into the gun's <b>rammer</b> tray. Meanwhile, the projectile man would pull a projectile out of the hoist, and place it in the <b>rammer</b> tray in front of the powder case. Then, as he turned to get the next projectile out of the hoist, the projectile man would pull down on the <b>rammer</b> lever. This caused the power <b>rammer</b> to ram the projectile and powder case into the chamber. As the powder case cleared the top of the breechblock, the block would rise to seal the chamber. The gun was ready to fire. The case combination primer in the base of the powder case could be fired either electrically or by percussion. Electrical firing was the preferred method because the firing circuit could be energized by firing keys down in the plotting room when firing salvos at surface targets, or up in the director when firing at air targets. Percussion firing could be executed by the Pointer (man controlling elevation) by pushing a foot treadle. When the gun fired, the recoil's rearward motion returned the <b>rammer</b> lever to the up position, and the <b>rammer</b> would drive back {{to the rear of the}} <b>rammer</b> tray. During counter-recoil, the breechblock was automatically lowered and the spent powder case was ejected from the chamber. When the gun returned to battery, a blast of compressed air was sent down the bore to clean it out. The gun was ready to be reloaded.|$|E

The No.3, the loader, inserted the bag of powder and then the projectile. The No.2 then used a <b>rammer,</b> or the sponge reversed, to drive it in. At the same time, the No.4 ("ventsman") pressed his thumb on the vent hole to prevent a draught that might fan a flame.

On October 17, 1991, Frank Kelso, the new Navy Chief of Naval Operations, announced that the Navy could not determine who or what had caused the tragedy. Kelso apologized to Hartwig's family and closed the Navy's investigation. [...] An independent review of the Navy's investigation by Sandia National Laboratories concluded that the explosion had probably been caused by an overram of the powder bags into the center gun's breech, possibly because of a malfunction in the <b>rammer</b> mechanism or because the gun crew was inadequately trained.

500|$|Born in 1926, Harper Lee {{grew up in}} the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, {{where she}} became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer [...] Truman Capote. She {{attended}} Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944–45), and then studied law at the University of Alabama (1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine <b>Rammer</b> Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time. In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at J. B. Lippincott, who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing. Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year.|$|E

500|$|The pusher-type {{ammunition}} hoists ran up a {{fixed shaft}} {{in the center}} of the mount. The shells and their powder charges were transferred to a tipping drum that was rotated to match the bearing angle of the guns and then loaded. This system was adapted from that used for the fixed [...] ammunition used in the s. Unfortunately it was not well suited for separate-loading ammunition. Each gun had its own separate shell and powder hoist, for a total of four hoists. The tipping drum had four matching separate trays to move the ammunition to the gun. Each shell was power-rammed, but the propellant charges had to be hand-rammed. Theoretically the guns could be loaded at any angle, but the power <b>rammer</b> was so weak that it could not ram shells at angles above 10°. This problem, coupled with the [...] "poor quality of manufacture of the guns, the unsatisfactory profile of the breech, resulted in a firing cycle of only 3-4 rounds per minute during the early trials with jams and failures frequent", rather than the planned 10 rounds per minute. A further problem was that there only two loaders assigned to the gun crew; they tired quickly during prolonged firing.|$|E
500|$|The rammerman's {{position}} was of special concern, as ramming {{was considered the}} most dangerous part of loading the gun. The ram was used to first thrust the projectile and then the powder bags into the gun's breech. The ram speed used for the projectile was much faster ( [...] per second) than that used for the lighter powder bags ( [...] per second), {{but there was no}} safety device on the ram piston to prevent the rammerman from accidentally pushing the powder bags at the faster speed. Overramming the powder bags into the gun could subject the highly flammable powder to excessive friction and compression, with a resulting increased danger of premature combustion. Also, if the bags were pushed too far into the gun, a gap between the last bag and the primer might prevent the powder from igniting when the gun was fired, causing a misfire. None of Iowas rammermen had any training or experience in ramming nonstandard five-bag loads into the guns. Complicating the task, as the rammerman was shoving the powder bags, he was also supposed to simultaneously operate a lever to shut the powder hoist door and lower the powder hoist car. Iowa crewmen later stated that Turret Two's center gun <b>rammer</b> would sometimes [...] "take off" [...] uncontrollably on its own at high speed. Furthermore, Backherms had never operated the ram before during a live fire shoot.|$|E
500|$|The {{accident}} {{contributed to}} the Royal Navy changing to breech-loading guns, which could be more conveniently worked from inside the turrets. The fragments of the destroyed gun were re-assembled and displayed {{to the public at}} the Woolwich Arsenal. The committee of inquiry decided that the gun had been double-loaded, but this view was widely questioned, including by Sir William Palliser, designer of the Palliser shell used by these guns. Palliser's view instead was that the shot had been obstructed by a portion of the millboard disc rammed above the shell. Hydraulic power-ramming was thought to be implicated in the double loading as the telescopic hydraulic <b>rammer</b> had not made the double loading obvious, as a manual ramrod would have done. One piece of evidence supporting the double loading theory was the presence of an additional stud torn from a Palliser shell, found amongst the wreckage within the turret.

2500|$|The 10" [...] {{guns were}} {{initially}} to be mounted in open barbettes [...] (the C & R proposal blueprint shows them as such). During Maines extended construction, {{the development of}} rapid-fire intermediate-caliber guns, which could fire high-explosive shells, became a serious threat and the navy redesigned Maine with enclosed turrets. Because of the corresponding weight increase, the turrets were mounted one deck lower than planned originally. Even with this modification, the main guns were high enough to fire unobstructed for 180° {{on one side and}} 64° on the other side. They could also be loaded at any angle of train; initially the main guns of Texas, by comparison, with external <b>rammers,</b> could be loaded only when trained on the centerline or directly abeam, a common feature in battleships built before 1890. However, by 1897, Texas turrets had been modified with internal <b>rammers</b> to permit much faster reloading.|$|R
500|$|After the British Army {{failed to}} capture Westende, the {{mounting}} was optimised {{for use on}} a monitor. It was very simple, consisting of two large girders connected together at each end with the gun and its carriage between them. The mount could only traverse 10° inside its fixed, ½-inch (12.7mm) gun shield and was aimed over the starboard side of the monitor. It was loaded at a fixed angle of 10°, but it could only fire between 22° and 45° to equalize the stresses on the carriage and the ship. It was provided with hydraulically powered cranes, loading tray, <b>rammer</b> and breech mechanism to minimize the crew's workload, but the ammunition parties had to use muscle power. The shells were stowed below deck {{and had to be}} moved by overhead rail to the hatch in the deck behind the gun to be lifted up and loaded. The cordite propellant charges were kept in eighteen steam-heated storage tanks mounted on the forecastle deck abaft the funnel and moved to the gun on a bogie mounted on rails, two one-sixth charges at a time, which reduced the rate of fire to about one round about every 3–4 minutes. The monitors had to be extensively modified to handle the gun. Numerous additional structural supports had to be added underneath the gun to support its weight of the sides had to be plated in to accommodate the additional crewmen and the interior rearranged for the 18–inch shells and the loading arrangements.|$|E
