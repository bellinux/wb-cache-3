40|$|Abstract: <b>Raw</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> from East Rand Water Care Association (ERWAT) {{had high}} {{phosphorus}} (P) content, approximately 15. 2 % (w/w) P 2 O 5. This indicates a potential resource of the limiting nutrient P. The {{effect of the}} acid type, acid concentration, time and solid/liquid ratio on extraction was investigated. Methods of solution purification were also explored namely adsorption and ion exchange. Magnesium oxide and ammonium hydroxide were used as sources of magnesium and nitrogen, respectively, as well as pH regulators to precipitate P as struvite. XRF results showed that 82 % P was recovered from <b>raw</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> after 2 hours leaching using 1 M sulphuric acid and purification using ion exchange. Kinetic studies showed that the leaching of phosphorus follows the Dickinson model. Most graphs show a linear fit up to 100 mins, thereafter the slope changes suggesting a two-step process with different rate parameters. Thus a trend line fitting all the points may not be ideal. A rate of reaction of about 2 × 10 - 5 s- 1 was obtained for the first 100 mins. The rate limiting step is controlled by diffusion. Adsorption of phosphorus using ion exchange provided a better solution for the recovery of this natural resource, which eventually could meet the ever-increasing requirement for phosphorus. The overall {{results indicated that the}} <b>raw</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> can be treated with acid to efficiently recover phosphorus and thus can be considered a potentially renewable source of phosphorus. Phosphorus solubility in 2 % critic acid was almost 96 %.

The coarsest sludge had to be reslurried at 2 pct solids before adding it to the concentrate in order to obtain pellets without visible sludge clumps.

Given the increasing pressure against the continued use of non-renewable sources of feedstock, there is an exciting opportunity to develop alternative materials to act as rubber fillers for environmental and economic reasons. This {{research has focused on}} the development of novel carbonaceous rubber fillers produced through the pyrolysis of coconut shell and <b>raw</b> sewage <b>sludge.</b> The basic properties of feedstock were evaluated to assess the efficacy of final filler performance; a Response Surface Methodology was applied to model the relationship between pyrolysis conditions and the key physical and chemical properties of the char filler and to optimise the pyrolysis process. Feedstock were pyrolysed using a laboratory-scale furnace using various temperatures, heating rates, holding times and atmospheres. A comparison was made between char fillers and commercial carbon blacks to establish the optimum production conditions. The selected char fillers were mixed with styrene-butadiene rubber and the rubber products were evaluated for their technological performance. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the rubber-char filler interaction and the performance of the sustainable fillers was developed. By-products (oil and gas) were also studied as a wider sustainability study embedded within the research. The coconut shell and <b>raw</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> have significant potential for use as a sustainable feedstock for carbon black replacement in rubber manufacture. These fillers were found to have equivalent surface area (2. 9 – 318. 2 m 2 /g) to a semi-reinforcing filler and provide 52 – 59 ° hardness, 482 – 962...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{municipal}} and industrial wastewater treatment activities have been confronted with a dramatically increasing flow of sewage sludge. To improve treatment efficiency, process and material parameters are needed but engineers are dealing with vast quantities of fundamentally poorly understood and unpredictable material Thus, accurate prediction of critically important, but analytically elusive process parameters is unattainable and {{is a matter of}} grave concern. Because engineers need reliable flow properties to simulate the process, this work is an attempt to approach sludge rheological behaviour with well-known materials which have similar characteristics. Sludge liquid-like behaviour is already well documented so, we have focused mainly on the solid-like behaviour of both <b>raw</b> and digested <b>sludge</b> by performing oscillatory measurements in the linear and non-linear regimes. We have shown that the viscoelastic behaviour of sludge presents strong similarities with soft-glassy materials but differences can be observed between <b>raw</b> and digested <b>sludge.</b> Finally, we confirm that colloidal glasses and emulsions may be used to model the rheological behaviour of raw and anaerobic digested sludge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A new {{coagulant}} of polymerized-organic-Al-Zn-Fe (POAZF) {{was prepared}} using a galvanized aluminum slag and polyacrylamide (PAM) as <b>raw</b> materials. <b>Sludge</b> reduction of POAZF was probed {{compared to that}} of poly-Al-Zn-Fe (PAZF) and poly-aluminum-chloride (PAC). The results showed that the settling speed of flocs of POAZF was much greater than that both PAZF and PAC. The volume reduction ratio of wet sludge (VRRWS) of POAZF was fitted in polynomial mode to predict VRRWS. The fitting precision of VRRWS achieved by POAZF between the test data and fitting data at both higher dosage and lower or medium dosage within the settling time of 15 min was high, which is significant for sludge production and VRRWS in the actual wastewater treatment processes.
