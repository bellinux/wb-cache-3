40|$|How {{resilient}} is my organization? Have our processes made us more <b>resilient?</b> <b>Members</b> of the CERT Resilient Enterprise Management (REM) {{team are}} conducting research {{to address these}} and other related questions. The team 2 ̆ 7 s first report, Measuring Operational Resilience Using the CERT Resilience Management Model, defined high-level objectives for managing an operational resilience management (ORM) system, demonstrated how to derive meaningful measures from those objectives, and presented a template for defining resilience measures, along with example measures. In this report, REM team members suggest a set of top ten strategic measures for managing operational resilience. These measures derive from high-level objectives of the ORM system defined in the CERT Resilience Management Model, Version 1. 1 (CERT-RMM). The report also provides measures {{for each of the}} 26 process areas of CERT-RMM, as well as a set of global measures that apply to all process areas. This report thus serves as an addendum to CERT-RMM Version 1. 1. Since CERT-RMM practices map to bodies of knowledge and codes of practice such as ITIL, COBIT, ISO 2700 x, BS 25999, and PCI DSS, the measures may be useful for measuring security, business continuity, and IT operations management processes, either as part of adoption of CERT-RMM or independent of it...|$|R

This annulus {{acts as a}} beam on which are mounted bearing pads. The resilience of the beam mount causes the pads to accept the load and, with proper design, responds to a rotating thrust-transmitting collar by creating a gas film between the pads and the thrust collar. The bearing may be arranged for load equalization thereby avoiding the necessity of gimbal mounts or the like for the bearing. It may also be arranged to respond to rotation in one or both directions...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes to}} use {{high-strength}} corrosion-resistant maraging steels, which were developed for aircraft industry instead of carbon steel with coating to improve operation {{properties of the}} forcemeasuring <b>resilient</b> <b>member</b> in electronic strain-gauge balance. It examines the possibility to apply the martensitic-aging steels of Fe-Cr-Ni-Mo-Ti (ЭП 678) and Fe-Cr-Ni-Mo-Cu-Nb (ЭП 817) alloying systems. It was shown, that a traditional heat strain-hardening treatment including hardening and overageing of this steels provides combination of durability viscosity and corrosion- resistance, {{but at the same}} time it increases nonelastic effects and lowers the limit of elasticity because of reversing austenite formation. In this connection, it was proposed to use hardening with double aging i. e. main and low-temperature aging with no austenite formation as heat strainhardening treatment of steels for force-measuring <b>resilient</b> <b>member.</b> The goal of this work was to study the influence of double aging on the structure and properties of ЭП 678 (06 Х 14 Н 6 Д 2 МБТ) and ЭП 817 (03 Х 111 Н 10 М 2 Т) steels. The modes of double aging for ЭП 817 steel were conformed to 4500 С + 400 0 С and 475 0 С+ 400 0 С, for ЭП 678 steel – 530 0 С + 500 0 С. The structure and properties of hardened steels after main and double aging were compared. Metallographic analysis of samples after electrolytic etching was conducted with Leitz Metallovert microscope while the CamScan 4 DV raster electronic microscope was used for Microroentgen-spectral analysis. The quantity of austenite was controlled with computerized setting DRON- 4, the hardness was measured with ТК- 2 М instrument, corrosion-resistance was estimated with polarized curves, which were taken using a П- 5848 potentiostat. The conducted research has shown, that double aging causes the additional hardening of steels due to disintegration of martensite and formation of dispersed Cu – corpuscles in ЭП 817 steel and of Ni 3 Ti in ЭП 678 steel. At the same time, it was established that additional disintegration of martensite influences on the corrosive properties of steels in a variety of ways. The experiments have proved that double aging deteriorates the corrosion-resistance of ЭП 678 steel, leads to the sharp increase of corrosion current on cathode and anode polarization curves due to formation of nonuniform structure. According to experimentally obtained data, the corrosion-resistance of ЭП 817 steel after double aging, on the contrary, was improved i. e. the corrosion current was essentially reduced and there was no phase of disastrous dissolution on polarization curves. It was proved that there are two reasons for enhancement of corrosion-resistance, namely a surface "refinement" owing to a cathode formation of Cu – corpuscles with respect to the chrome-nickel matrix and their more uniform allocation, thus facilitating to formation of uniform protective passive skin on the surface. Thus, the results of conducted research have shown that the double aging due to additional disintegration of martensite is an effective way to hardening of maraging steels, which are used for making the force-measuring <b>resilient</b> <b>member.</b> It was established, that the effect of double aging on corrosion properties is determined with the nature of strain-hardening stages: the corrosion-resistance is improved if the formation stage is the cathode in respect to matrix. Conversively, the corrosion-resistance is worsened because of increased extent of structure heterogeneity. Obtained data can be used with a complex approach to the choice of the material and modes of heat strain-hardening treatment of maraging steels for force-measuring <b>resilient</b> <b>member</b> to provide the required values of elasticity and corrosion-resistance limit. It was proved, that maraging ЭП 817 steel has an advantage over ЭП 678 steel in corrosion-resistance and may be recommended for making a forcemeasuring <b>resilient</b> <b>member.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{mounting}} assembly for mounting a composite pressure vessel to a vehicle includes a saddle having a curved surface extending between two pillars for receiving the vessel. The saddle also has flanged portions {{which can be}} bolted to the vehicle. Each of the pillars has hole in which is mounted the shaft portion of an attachment member. A <b>resilient</b> <b>member</b> is disposed between each of the shaft portions and the holes and loaded by a tightening nut. External to the holes, each of the attachment members has a head portion to which a steel band is attached. The steel band circumscribes the vessel and translates the load on the springs into a clamping force on the vessel. As the vessel expands and contracts, the resilient members expand and contract so that the clamping force applied by the band to the vessel remains constant...|$|E
40|$|Three {{standard}} psychometric {{tests were}} administered to parents who volunteered their children for a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a new asthma drug and to a control group of parents whose children were eligible for the trial but had declined the invitation. The trial took place at a children's hospital in Australia. The subjects comprised 68 parents who had volunteered their children and 42 who had not, a participation rate of 94 per cent and 70 per cent, respectively. The responses of these parents to the Gordon Survey of Interpersonal Values Questionnaire, the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and the Cattell Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire were analysed by computer. There was a marked difference between the psychological profiles {{of the two groups}} of parents. Volunteering parents put more value on benevolence while non-volunteering parents were more concerned with power and prestige. The self-esteem of volunteering parents was much lower than that of non-volunteering parents. Finally, volunteering parents were more introverted, exhibited greater anxiety and low supergo, while non-volunteering parents appeared to have greater social confidence and emotional stability. Since an individual's values, self-esteem and personality may be important antecedents of behaviour, these findings suggest that parents who volunteer their children for clinical research are not only socially disadvantaged and emotionally vulnerable, but may also be psychologically predisposed to volunteering. Furthermore, these findings provide evidence for the existence of a psychosocial 'filter' effect of the informed consent procedure, which may be discouraging the better educated, more privileged and psychologically <b>resilient</b> <b>members</b> of society from participation as research subjects...|$|R

Of special interest were the implications for personal, social and professional relationships, which taken together, is likely to lead to increased loneliness, anxiety and depression even for the most <b>resilient</b> crew <b>member</b> (Bor and Levitt, 2003; Partridge and Goodman, 2006). A model was developed to help understand the complex ways in which cabin crew members' experience of psychological disruptions were contingent on their abilities to adapt the demands of their personal lives according to work requirements. Moreover, cabin crew appeared to actively manage and moderate {{the extent to which the}} combined effects of psycho-social interruptions and sleep deprivation affected their cognitive, emotional, and physical wellbeing. It is anticipated that the model will help crew members to cope with work-life dichotomies as well as encouraging counselling psychologists to become more involved in various aspects within the provision of stress reducing interventions in the workplace. Implications for future research, crew rostering, and counselling psychology practice and training needs are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|A {{solar sail}} concept has been {{developed}} from a common spiral fold pattern in order to enable a simultaneous mast and sail deployment. This novel concept utilizes the stored strain energy {{in a series of}} elastic spar members to enforce proper folding kinematics rather than relying on bulky mechanical joints. The critical inner and outer spar networks are secured to four elastically extendible masts anchored to a central drum. Deployment of the solar sail system is actuated by rotating the central drum around which the masts, spars, and film are wrapped. Tensioned radial cords deterministically unfold the membrane film under the authority of the <b>resilient,</b> spring-like spar <b>members.</b> Proper elastic behavior of the spars is an important facet to this design, and thus a significant effort was dedicated their development. This compact ground demonstration concept includes about 7. 5 m 2 of reflective membrane film for useful propulsion. Features of this robust, lightweight membrane structure may prove valuable to reducing mass and increasing deployment reliability of other planar subsystems such as sun shades, solar arrays, radiators, or antenna arrays...|$|R
40|$|Problem: Siblings of {{children}} with chronic illness have unique experiences that can affect their school functioning, such that they may miss ongoing periods of school, experience difficulties with schoolwork or experience changes in their peer and teacher interactions. This review {{provides an overview of}} these siblings' school experiences. Eligibility criteria: Six databases (Medline, PsychINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, Embase and The Cochrane Library) were systematically searched for studies examining the school experiences and peer relationships of siblings {{of children}} with chronic illness, as well as school-based interventions for these siblings. Studies were included if they were published in or after 2000 and were published in English. Sample: We identified 2137 articles upon initial search. From these, we identified 28 eligible studies examining the school experiences of >  1470 siblings {{of children with}} chronic illness. Results: Three key themes were identified throughout the reviewed articles. The literature described 1) the psychological impact on siblings at school; 2) decreases in school attendance and academic functioning, and; 3) changes or perceived differences in peer and teacher interactions. Siblings value teacher and peer support, and this support may contribute to better sibling school functioning. Conclusions: Many siblings are socially <b>resilient,</b> yet overlooked, <b>members</b> of the family who may present with psychological, academic and peer related difficulties at school following diagnosis of a brother or sister with chronic illness. Implications: Future research is needed to further delineate the sibling school experience to better facilitate the development of targeted sibling support interventions within the school environment. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Master thesis {{development}} management- University of Agder, 2015 The {{connections between}} natural hazards, natural disasters and human vulnerabilities have become common features of disaster risk reduction (DRR) programmes since {{the adoption of}} The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005 – 2015. A series of international initiatives have begun to prioritize social vulnerability and community managed disaster risk reduction (CMDRR) {{in order to enhance}} the capacity of disaster-affected communities to recover from a disaster with little or no external assistance. This thesis explores whether, and to what extent, CARE can strengthen the capacity of Haitians to promote resilient communities through Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction (CMDRR) programmes, and to see if such programmes can generate sustainable development. The thesis investigates what the underlying vulnerabilities are, through the Pressure and Release (PAR) model, whilst also taking into account the particular historical and political context in Haiti. Vulnerability is evaluated in the three levels: root causes, dynamic pressure and unsafe conditions on the social side. The component on the natural side is the 2010 earthquake itself. The CMDRR process are analysed by applying Cordaid’s (2009) four components of DRR: 1) risk assessment and analysis; 2) DRR measures: developing contingency and development plans; 3) self-organization; and 4) participatory monitoring, evaluation and learning system. I also address the relationship between International nongovernmental organization (INGOs) and the community members in general, and the relationship between CARE and the community members in particular. The research draws on qualitative data, mainly from in-depth interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs) and participant observation of the CMDRR process. My findings suggest that people can possess characteristics that make them both vulnerable and resilient. The CMDRR process made the community <b>members</b> <b>resilient</b> {{in the sense that it}} had increased their awareness and knowledge capacity in regards to natural disasters, disaster-resilient construction and climate change. The women in La Grenada also felt empowered after the CMDRR process, and used their knowledge to educate the wider community. The CMDRR workshops had strengthened community ties, both within the community and with neighbouring communities. Despite human progress, the opportunities brought through the CMDRR process is not able to contribute to the long-term prosperity. Consistent with the PAR model and the numerous vulnerabilities identified, my findings suggests that resilience building is about good governance: it is primarily and fundamentally political, with its success depending on citizen power, genuine participation and a good relationship between the INGOs, the Haitian population and the government. As such, building resilient communities involves something more from simply dealing with preparedness measures through CMDRR interventions...|$|R
