40|$|For the Weser and Elbe {{catchments}} {{methods for}} {{the calculation of}} grid-based runoff on a 0. 5 x 0. 5 grid were extended and verified. Only the area-weighted runoff balancing (method 1) enables to calculate the grid-based runoff exclusively from gauge-based runoff data, although it {{is only applicable to}} areas with a high gauging station density. Data acquisition and assimilation, as well as the digitization of gauge-bases catchment limits are highly time-consuming. This method, therefore, may only be used for selected regions for which it may serve as a reference data set for the evaluation {{of the quality of the}} other methods, too. The disaggregation of runoff by the use of statistical relationships between runoff and catchment characteristics (method 2) needs, at least at topographically more intensively structured relief, the inclusion of long-term mean areal distribution of precipitation depth. By this procedure, empirical relationships between runoff and precipitation as well as further catchment characteristics can be established. The relationships are regionally differentiated. The influence of evapotranspiration on runoff is not explicitly taken into consideration within the computational scheme. Therefore, this method was not further investigated within the project. With respect to a possible continent-wide applicability, the water balance model of Thornthwaite-Mather was extended. The model WABIMON enables the calculation of long-term mean grid based runoff using the existing global hydrometeorological and physiographic data sets. Combined with the monthly means of runoff at selected <b>reference</b> <b>gauges,</b> the time-dependent grid-based runoff can be calculated. Improvements in future projects have to be done in the model components of the water balance model, especially the parametrization of runoff coefficient, and in the selection criteria of the <b>reference</b> <b>gauges.</b> For this task, the runoff data of the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) and the precipitation data of the Global precipitation and Climtology Centre (GPCC) of Europe are foreseen for evaluation.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} snowfall {{is important in}} various fields of study such as climate variability, transportation, and water resources. A major concern is that snowfall measurements are difficult and can result in significant errors. For example, collection efficiency of most gauge–shield configurations generally decreases with increasing wind speed. In addition, much scatter is observed for a given wind speed, which {{is thought to be}} caused by the type of snowflake. Furthermore, the collection efficiency depends strongly on the reference used to correct the data, which is often the Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR) recommended by the World Meteorological Organization. The goal {{of this study is to}} assess the impact of weather conditions on the collection efficiency of the DFIR. Note that the DFIR is defined as a manual gauge placed in a double fence. In this study, however, only the double fence is being investigated while still being called DFIR. To address this issue, a detailed analysis of the flow field in the vicinity of the DFIR is conducted using computational fluid dynamics. Particle trajectories are obtained to compute the collection efficiency associated with different precipitation types for varying wind speed. The results show that the precipitation reaching the center of the DFIR can exceed 100 % of the actual precipitation, and it depends on the snowflake type, wind speed, and direction. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the sources of uncertainty associated with the use of the DFIR as a <b>reference</b> <b>gauge</b> to measure snowfall...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{methodology}} to extract short-scale statistical {{characteristics of the}} sea surface topography by means of stereo image reconstruction. The possibilities and limitations of the technique are discussed and tested on a data set acquired from an oceanographic platform at the Black Sea. The analysis shows that reconstruction of the topography based on stereo method is {{an efficient way to}} derive non-trivial statistical properties of surface short- and intermediate-waves (say from 1 centimer to 1 meter). Most technical issues pertaining to this type of datasets (limited range of scales, lacunarity of data or irregular sampling) can be partially overcome by appropriate processing of the available points. The proposed technique also allows one to avoid linear interpolation which dramatically corrupts properties of retrieved surfaces. The processing technique imposes that the field of elevation be polynomially detrended, which has the effect of filtering out the large scales. Hence the statistical analysis can only address the small-scale components of the sea surface. The precise cut-off wavelength, which is approximatively half the patch size, can be obtained by applying a high-pass frequency filter on the <b>reference</b> <b>gauge</b> time records. The results obtained for the one- and two-points statistics of small-scale elevations are shown consistent, at least in order of magnitude, with the corresponding gauge measurements as well as other experimental measurements available in the literature. The calculation of the structure functions provides a powerful tool to investigate spectral and statistical properties of the field of elevations. Experimental parametrization of the third-order structure function, the so-called skewness function, {{is one of the most}} important and original outcomes of this study. This function is of primary importance in analytical scattering models from the sea surface and was up to now unavailable in field conditions. Due to the lack of precise reference measurements for the small-scale wave field, we could not quantify exactly the accuracy of the retrieval technique. However, it appeared clearly that the obtained accuracy is good enough for the estimation of second-order statistical quantities (such as the correlation function), acceptable for third-order quantities (such as the skwewness function) and insufficient for fourth-order quantities (such as kurtosis). Therefore, the stereo technique in the present stage should not be thought as a self-contained universal tool to characterize the surface statistics. Instead, it should be used in conjunction with other well calibrated but sparse reference measurement (such as wave gauges) for cross-validation and calibration. It then completes the statistical analysis in as much as it provides a snapshot of the three-dimensional field and allows for the evaluation of higher-order spatial statistics...|$|E

The experiment included (1) an unshielded Chinese standard precipitation gauge (CSPG UN; orifice diameter = 20 cm, height = 70 cm), (2) a single Alter shield around a CSPG (CSPG SA), (3) a CSPG in a pit (CSPG PIT) and (4) a Double-Fence International Reference (DFIR) with a Tretyakov-shielded CSPG (CSPG DFIR). The catch ratio (CR) used the CSPG DFIR {{as a reference}} (CR = CSPG X /CSPG DFIR, %; X denotes UN, SA or PIT). The {{results show that the}} CSPG SA, CSPG PIT and CSPG DIFR caught 0. 9, 4. 5 and 3. 4 % more rainfall; 7. 7, 15. 6 and 14. 2 % more mixed precipitation (snow with rain, rain with snow); 11. 1, 16. 0 and 20. 6 % more snowfall and 2. 0, 6. 0 and 5. 3 % more precipitation (of all types), respectively, than the CSPG UN from September 2012 to April 2015. The CSPG PIT and CSPG DFIR caught 3. 6 and 2. 5 % more rainfall; 7. 3 and 6. 0 % more mixed precipitation; 4. 4 and 8. 5 % more snowfall; and 3. 9 and 3. 2 % more total precipitation, respectively, than the CSPG SA. However, the CSPG DFIR caught 1. 0 % less rainfall; 1. 2 % less mixed precipitation; 3. 9 % more snowfall and 0. 6 % less total precipitation than the CSPG PIT. From most to least precipitation measured, the instruments ranked as follows: for rain and mixed precipitation, CSPG PIT > CSPG DFIR > CSPG SA > CSPG UN; for snowfall, CSPG DFIR > CSPG PIT > CSPG SA > CSPG UN. The CR vs. 10 m wind speed for the period of precipitation indicated that with increasing wind speed from 0 to 8. 0 m s − 1, the CR UN/DFIR and CR SA/DFIR for rainfall decreased slightly. For mixed precipitation, the wind speed showed no significant effect on CR UN/DFIR and CR SA/DFIR below 3. 5 m s − 1. For snowfall, the CR UN/DFIR and CR SA/DFIR vs. wind speed showed that CR decreased with increasing wind speed. The precipitation measured by the shielded gauges increased linearly relative to that of the unshielded gauges. However, the increase in the ratio of the linear correlation should depend on specific environmental conditions. A comparison of the wind-induced bias indicates that the CSPG PIT {{could be used as a}} <b>reference</b> <b>gauge</b> for rain, mixed and snow precipitation events at the experimental site. As both the PIT and DFIR effectively prevented wind from influencing the catch of the precipitation gauge, the CR PIT/DFIR had no relationship with wind speed. Cubic polynomials and exponential functions were used to quantify the relationship between catch ratio and wind speed. For snow, for both event and daily scales, the CR UN/DFIR and CR SA/DFIR were significantly related to wind speed; while for rain and mixed precipitation, only the event scale showed a significant relationship...|$|E

The relative contributions of the two tributaries were determined using a triple tracer approach (delta(18) O, deltaD, Cl-).

The increasing dissolved manganese content in the dissolved phase is explained by a reductive dissolution of manganese oxides due to massive inputs of phenolic-rich OM from the Rio Negro.

The experimental setup included a collocated pair of tipping-bucket rain gauges, OTT Parsivel (P 1) and P 2 disdrometers, and Joss-Waldvogel (JW) disdrometers. Excellent agreement between the two collocated rain gauges enabled their use as a relative reference for event rain totals. A comparison of event total showed that the P 2 had a 6 %absolute bias with respect to the <b>reference</b> <b>gauges,</b> considerably lower than the P 1 and JW disdrometers. Good agreement was also evident between the JW and P 2 in hourly raindrop spectra for drop diameters between 0. 5 and 4 mm. The P 2 drop concentrations mostly increased toward small sizes, and the peak concentrations were mostly observed in the first three measurable size bins. The P 1, on the other hand, underestimated small drops and overestimated the large drops, particularly in heavy rain rates. From the analysis performed, it appears that the P 2 is an improvement over the P 1 model for both drop size and rainfall measurements. P 2 mean fall velocities follow accepted terminal fall speed relationships at drop sizes less than 1 mm. As a caveat, the P 2 had approximately 1 ms 21 slower mean fall speed with respect to the terminal fall speed near 1 mm, and the difference between the mean measured and terminal fall speeds reduced with increasing drop size.
