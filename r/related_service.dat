25|$|A closely <b>related</b> <b>service</b> is the Video Program System (VPS), {{introduced}} in Germany in 1985. Like teletext, this signal is also broadcast in the vertical blanking interval. It consists only of 32 bits of data, primarily {{the date and}} time for which the broadcast of the currently running TV programme was originally scheduled. Video recorders can use this information (instead of a simple timer) in order to automatically record a scheduled programme, even if the broadcast time changes after the user programmes the VCR. VPS also provides a PAUSE code; broadcasters {{can use it to}} mark interruptions and pause the recorders, however advertisement-financed broadcasters tend not to use it during their ad breaks.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{requirement}} {{is that the}} revenues derived from the property-related fee or charge must not exceed the funds required to provide the property <b>related</b> <b>service.</b> [...] This is an aggregate cost requirement applicable to the combined cost from all parcels while the cost of service requirement contains a similar requirement at the parcel level. [...] Use of the term “required” in the constitutional language is intended to preclude local agencies from levying property-related fees or charges for costs that are excessive, unreasonable or unnecessary. [...] If voters believe a property-related fee or charge is excessive, unreasonable or unnecessary, exercise of the local initiative power under Proposition 218 to reduce or repeal the levy is also an available option.|$|E
2500|$|The medical {{director}} {{plays a key}} role in the professional development of paramedics as well. [...] In almost all cases, the {{medical director}} will have, at a minimum, input into the curriculum of paramedic training at a local level. [...] In actual practice, in a great many cases they will also teach some portions of the program, supervise clinical rotations of paramedics, and in some cases, even precept their initial field practice, prior to formal certification or licensing. [...] In almost all cases, the medical director will be charged with the creation of all protocols and standing orders, and with any research that goes into their creation. [...] The medical director will also, assisted by others, be responsible for the creation and development of the Standards of Practice for their EMS system. Throughout the paramedic's career, the medical director will provide the mechanism for medical quality control, conducting chart audits and reviewing medically <b>related</b> <b>service</b> complaints, and may often have the ability to de-certify individual paramedics for cause. Medical directors will also act as advocates for their paramedics, advising elected officials and building support within the medical community for expanded scopes of practice when appropriate. Finally, medical directors will act as expert advisors to those in the EMS system administration and government administration, with respect to policies and legislation required by the EMS system, and in guiding its future direction. [...] In this model, the paramedic is very much seen as an 'extender' of the emergency physician's reach. [...] It is rare to see physicians in the field, unless they are precepting new paramedics or performing quality assurance activities, or are residents in emergency medicine training programs, gaining required field experience or conducting research. Medical directors and ED physicians will occasionally go into the field for large incidents, such as multi victim accidents and disasters to assume on site medical command.|$|E
