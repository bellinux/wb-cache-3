5|$|Based on Kinsey's scale where 0 <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> {{person with}} an {{exclusively}} heterosexual response and 6 <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> person with an exclusively homosexual one, and numbers in between represent a gradient of responses with both sexes, 6% {{of those interviewed}} ranked as a 6: exclusively homosexual.

However, the Kinsey Report remarked that the ranking described a period in a person's life, and that a person's orientation may change. Among the criticisms the Kinsey Report received, a particular one addressed the Institute for Sex Research's tendency to use statistical sampling, which facilitated an over-representation of same-sex relationships by other researchers who did not adhere to Kinsey's qualifications of data.|$|E
