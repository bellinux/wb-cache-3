Anderson did not live to publish his findings, although his assistant William Ellis described the bird in 1782. The genus Malurus was later described by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816, giving the bird its current scientific name.|$|E

25|$|The Vietnamese had {{submitted}} unwillingly, {{and were}} reluctant vassals. The Vietnamese emperor repeatedly ignored demands {{to attend the}} Yuan court and offer his personal submission to the Great Khan. Nevertheless, according {{to the history of}} the Yuan dynasty, the Trần court sent tribute every three years and received a darughachi. By 1266, however, a standoff developed, as the Emperor Thánh Tông sought a loose tributary relationship, while Kublai demanded full submission. Trần Thánh Tông sent an official letter requiring Kublai to take his darughachi back. Because of civil war in the Mongol Empire, and the Yuan conquest of Song China, armed conflict was delayed. Instead, Kublai <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace treaty signed by the Mongols and Đại Việt.|$|E

25|$|Interest in and {{the study}} of Amazon dark earths was {{advanced}} with the work of Wim Sombroek. Sombroek's interest in soil fertility came from his childhood. He was born in the Netherlands and lived through the Dutch famine of 1944. His family subsided on a small plot of land that had been maintained and improved for generations. Sombroek's father, in turn, improved the land by sowing it with the ash and cinders from their home. Sombroek came across Terra preta in the 1950s and it <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil from his childhood, inspiring him to study it further. Soil biologist from the University of Kansas William W. Woods is also a major figure in Terra preta research. Woods has made several key discoveries and his comprehensive bibliography on the subject doubles in size every decade.|$|E
25|$|Allegations of {{cheating}} reignited at the French Grand Prix, when, starting from {{third on the}} grid Schumacher overtook both of the Williams drivers, Damon Hill and Nigel Mansell, leading into the first corner of the race. This raised suspicions, once again, that Benetton were using traction control. There were also incidents involving other teams, notably Ferrari and McLaren. While commentating on the race for Eurosport with John Watson and Allard Kalff, Williams driver David Coulthard, who was replaced by Mansell for the race, stated that Schumacher's start <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> type of starts from the 1993 season when traction control was legal. Hill was on pole position for the British Grand Prix after qualifying fastest. During the parade lap {{on the way to}} the starting grid, Schumacher, starting second, illegally overtook Hill. As a result of his illegal maneuver, Schumacher was given a five-second penalty at 14:27 local time, 27minutes after the original incident. Schumacher never came into the pit lane to serve the penalty when originally given the penalty, and on lap21, Schumacher was given the black flag. Schumacher stayed out on the circuit while Benetton team boss Briatore, along with Benetton technical director Tom Walkinshaw went to discuss it with Race Director Roland Bruynseraede, arguing that they had not been properly informed of the punishment given. Schumacher eventually served the time penalty on lap27, finishing the race in second position behind Hill.|$|E
25|$|After the {{surrender}} of the city, the Church of the Holy Sephulcre was ordered to be closed for three days by Saladin while he considered {{what to do with}} it. Some of his advisers told him to destroy the Church in order to end all Christian interest in Jerusalem. Most of his advisers however told him to let the Church remain there saying that Christian pilgrimages would continue anyway because of the sanctity of the place and also <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caliph Umar who allowed the Church to remain in Christian hands after conquering the city. Saladin rejected the destruction of the church saying that he had no intention to discourage the Christian pilgrimages to the site and it was reopened after three days on his orders. The Frankish pilgrims were allowed to enter the church upon paying a fee. To solidify Muslim claims to Jerusalem, many holy sites, including the shrine later known as Al-Aqsa Mosque, were ritually purified with rose water. Christian furnishings were removed from the mosque and it was fitted with oriental carpets. Its walls were illuminated with candelabras and text from the Quran. The Orthodox Christians and Jacobites were allowed to remain and to worship as they chose. The Copts who were barred from entering Jerusalem by the Crusader kingdom of Jerusalem as they were considered heretics and atheists, were allowed to enter the city without paying any fees by Saladin as he considered them his subjects. The Coptic places of worship that were earlier taken over by the Crusaders were returned to the Coptic priests. The Copts were also allowed to visit The Church of the Holy Sephulcre and other Christian sites. The Abyssinian Christians were allowed to visit the holy places of Jerusalem without paying any fees.|$|E
