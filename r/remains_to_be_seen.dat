5|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} debate {{as to the}} star's actual distance from Earth. The debate revolves around the different methodologies to measure distanceparallax being the most central, but photometric and spectroscopic observations yielding valuable insights as well. Before the Hipparcos mission, the estimated distance for the Pleiades star cluster was around 135 parsecs or 440 light years. However, when the Hipparcos Catalogue was published in 1997, the new parallax measurement indicated a much closer distance of about 119 ± 1.0 pc (388 ± 3.2 ly), triggering substantial controversy among astronomers. If the Hipparcos estimate were accurate, some astronomers contend, then stars in the cluster {{would have to be}} fainter than Sun-like starsa notion that would challenge some of the fundamental precepts of stellar structure. Interferometric measurements taken in 2004 by the Hubble Telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors and corroborated by studies from Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory showed the original estimate of 135 pc or 440 ly to be the correct figure. However a recent study published in 2009 has argued otherwise, publishing a new parallax measurement of 8.32 mas with a very tight error factor of 0.13 mas yielding a distance of 120.2 ± 1.9 pc or 392.0 ± 6.0 ly. Which distance estimate future astrometric calculations will corroborate <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> although the upcoming Gaia mission with its expected launch in late 2012 could well prove to be the ultimate arbiter in this debate.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CCSVI {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a cause for MS. According to this theory, strictures of the IJV are among the described causes for CCSVI. Little is known about their influence on the hemodynamics of the CVBO. We used positional MR imaging to describe the influence of positional changes on the CVBO. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Fonar Upright MR imaging system, we performed venous time-of-flight angiography of the cervical region in the supine and sitting positions in 15 healthy volunteers. The image quality was rated; the positional findings and interindividual variances in the CVBO were analyzed. RESULTS: A venous time-of-flight angiography of the cervical spine was feasible with good image quality. Strictures of 1 or both IJVs were found in 8 of 15 healthy volunteers in the supine position; however, none were visible in upright position. The IJV was not the main outflow route in the erect position. No relevant venous reflux was observed. CONCLUSIONS: IJV strictures are a common finding in healthy volunteers in the supine position. They seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of no relevance in the erect position. This finding questions the validity of this criterion for the diagnosis of CCSVI. Reflux into the venous system was not visualized, and it <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>see...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} the {{simplest}} modern cosmological theory, standard Cold Dark Matter (sCDM), almost fits all available data has encouraged the search for variants of CDM that can do better. Cold + Hot Dark Matter (CHDM) is the best theory of cosmic structure formation that I have considered if the cosmological matter density is near critical (i. e., Ω 0 ≈ 1) and if the expansion rate is not too large (i. e. h ≡ H 0 /(100 km s − 1 Mpc − 1) < ∼ 0. 6). But I think it will <b>be</b> helpful <b>to</b> discuss CHDM together with its chief competitor among CDM variants, low-Ω 0 CDM with a cosmological constant (ΛCDM). While the predictions of COBE-normalized CHDM and ΛCDM both agree reasonably well with the available data on scales of ∼ 10 to 100 h − 1 Mpc, each has potential virtues and defects. ΛCDM with Ω 0 ∼ 0. 3 has the possible virtue of allowing a higher expansion rate H 0 for a given cosmic age t 0, but the defect of predicting too much fluctuation power on small scales. CHDM has less power on small scales, and its predictions appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in good agreement with data on the galaxy distribution, although it <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>see...</b>|$|R

40|$|International Journal of Transport Economics, October 1990. Refereed Journal ArticleSince the 1973 / 74 {{oil price}} increases, Saudi Arabia has {{embarked}} a major program of infrastructure expansion. The {{purpose of this}} program <b>is</b> <b>to</b> alleviate the many bottlenecks hindering increases in the country's non-oil productive sectors. The {{purpose of this paper}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> examine the effectiveness of the country's infrastructure program. In particular has the Saudi Arabian government's investment program been successful in reducing inflationary pressures and hence in creating an environment conducive to sustained expansion of the non- -oil private sector economy? On the other hand, has the government's massive investment in infrastructure simply created an additional inflationary source of aggregate demand for the kingdom's scarce domestic resources? The main findings of the study are that the country's infrastructure led growth has been successful in achieving its main aim: the reduction in structural sources of inflationary pressures in the non-oil sectors. In this respect, the government's strategy began paying fairly respectable growth rates, even during periods of slack oil revenues. It still <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>see</b> however if past infrastructure investments will <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> sustain the growth momentum built up in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s...|$|R

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{studies in the}} hamster pancreatic cancer model have indicated that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas derive not only from ductal/ductular cells but also from islets. To verify the presence of carcinogen-responsive cells within islets, we tested {{the effect of the}} pancreatic carcinogen N-nitrosobis(2 -oxopropyl) amine (BOP) on recently established continuous hamster pancreatic islet culture. Isolated pure pancreatic islets of hamsters were treated in vitro with BOP at a concentration of 0. 25 mM three times a week for 19 weeks. Each treatment week was designed as a stage. The growth of these cells, designated KL 5 B, was compared with untreated cultured islets, designated KL 5 N. As in our previous study, between 14 and 21 days of culture, exocrine and intermediary cells developed within both KL 5 N and KL 5 B islets, which were then replaced by undifferentiated cells. No differences were found in the growth patterns of KL 5 N and KL 5 B until stage 4, when KL 5 B cells showed accelerated cell growth and cell pleomorphism, which increased gradually at later stages of treatment. Anchorage-independent and in vivo growth did not appear until stage 19. Mutation of c-Ki-ras at codon 12 (GGT→GAT) was detected in KL 5 B cells but not in KL 5 N cells. In vivo KL 5 B cells formed anaplastic invasive cancer with areas of glandular formation, overexpressed TGF-α and EGFR, expressed cytokeratin, vimentin, laminin and α- 1 antitrypsin and reacted strongly with L-phytohemagglutinin and tomato lectin.
