500|$|Bears are {{mentioned}} in the Bible; the Second Book of Kings relates {{the story of the}} prophet Elisha calling on them to eat the youths who taunted him. [...] Legends of saints taming bears are common in the Alpine zone. In the arms of the bishopric of Freising, the bear is the dangerous totem animal tamed by St. Corbinian and made to carry his civilised baggage over the mountains. Bears similarly feature in the legends of St. Romedius, Saint Gall and Saint Columbanus. This recurrent motif was used by the Church {{as a symbol of the}} victory of Christianity over paganism. In the Norse settlements of northern England during the 10th century, a type of [...] "hogback" [...] grave cover of a long narrow block of stone, with a shaped apex like the <b>roof</b> <b>beam</b> of a long house, is carved with a muzzled, thus Christianised, bear clasping each gable end, as in the church at Brompton, North Yorkshire and across the British Isles.|$|E
500|$|Traditional peasants' houses {{throughout}} Imerina {{featured a}} thick central pillar (andry) {{that supported the}} <b>roof</b> <b>beam</b> and a smaller upright beam at each corner extending into the ground to stabilize the structure. [...] Unlike most coastal houses, Highland homes have never been raised on stilts but have always sat flush to the ground. [...] To {{the south of the}} central pillar, in the area designated for sleeping and cooking, wooden or bamboo planks were occasionally installed for flooring, or woven mats were laid on the packed earth floor, which extended north past the pillar. Traditionally, the bed of the head of the family was in the southeast corner of the house. [...] The northern area was distinguished by the hearth, delineated by three oblong stones set vertically into the ground. Houses and tombs were aligned on a north-south axis with the entrance on the west face. [...] The north portion of the house was reserved for males and guests, while the south was for women, children and those of inferior rank. The northeast corner was sacred, reserved for prayer and offerings of tribute to the ancestors.|$|E
500|$|The Zafimaniry {{inhabit the}} heavily forested, rainy and {{temperate}} {{region of the}} Highlands {{to the east of}} Ambositra. [...] Their homes are rectangular and large (15' long, 12' wide and 18' high) with a peaked roof, overhanging eaves, and wooden windows and doors. [...] Many of the same standards found in the aristocratic architectural traditions of Imerina are present in the Zafimaniry structures, including the central wooden pillar supporting the <b>roof</b> <b>beam,</b> exclusive use of a tongue and groove joining technique and the orientation of building features such as windows, doors and the interior layout. Zafimaniry houses are often elaborately decorated with carved, symmetrical, abstract patterns that are rich in complex spiritual and mythological symbolism. [...] The architecture of the houses found in this region are considered to be representative of the architectural style that predominated throughout the Highlands prior to deforestation, and as such, they represent the last vestiges of a historic tradition and a significant element of Malagasy cultural heritage. [...] For this reason, the woodcrafting knowledge of the Zafimaniry was added in 2003 to the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.|$|E

500|$|The south wall of {{the nave}} shows {{the line of the}} {{original}} roof before it was raised, and contains faint remains of paintings dating from the 19thcentury, which consist of scriptural inscriptions. In the nave is a Jacobean pulpit, designed by Thomas Finch and made in 1601, which was once part of a three-decker pulpit. It was damaged in 1683 by a falling <b>roof</b> <b>beam</b> and was reduced in the 1855 restoration. Hanging on the {{wall of the}} nave are a number of Tudor boards which were taken from the ceiling of the south transept in 1964; one of these is dated 1577. In the south aisle is a small painting of The Widow's Mite by Jules Bouvier. A second pulpit, made of stone and dating from the late-14thcentury, is attached to the northeast pier of the crossing. This is designed to appear like a large chalice, and is decorated with panel tracery. The wooden crossing vault was designed by Scott. The roof of the north transept is also wooden, but of Tudor design. In the north wall of the transept is an aumbry and in the northeast corner is an oven with a chimney, which was used for baking Communion wafers. The transept contains an oak chest dated 1676 and a bench dated 1737. [...] In the east wall of north transept are a piscina and another aumbry.|$|E

Diarmait then asks his druids to find the manner of his death, and they foretell that he will die a {{threefold}} death, by slaughter, drowning and burning, and that the signs of his death will be a shirt grown from a single seed of flax, a mantle made of wool from a single sheep, ale brewed from one seed of corn, and bacon from a sow which has never farrowed. [...] On a circuit of Ireland, Diarmait comes to the hall of Banbán at Ráith Bec, and there the fate {{of which he was}} warned comes to pass. The <b>roof</b> <b>beam</b> of Tara has been recovered from the sea by Banbán and set in his hall, the shirt and mantle and ale and bacon are duly produced for Diarmait. Diarmait goes to leave Banbán's hall, but Áed Dub, waiting at the door, strikes him down and sets fire to the hall. Diarmait crawls into an ale vat to escape the flames and is duly killed by the falling <b>roof</b> <b>beam.</b> Thus, all the prophecies are fulfilled.|$|E
