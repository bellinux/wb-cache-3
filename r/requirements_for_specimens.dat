We report our initial experiences with trans-abdominal trans-anal resections (TATAR) with TME, performed using a single-port laparoscopic surgeries (SPLS) approach for low rectal cancers. MethodsBetween June 2009 and April 2011, 22 low rectal cancer patients underwent SPLS TATAR with TME. SPLS was performed transumbilically or through predetermined stoma sites. Conventional laparoscopic instruments were used, and the intracorporeal procedures and range of operation did not differ. After a full laparoscopic TME to the pelvic floor muscles, the specimen was pulled through the anus. CAA was completed with transanal hand sewn sutures. Patient and tumor characteristics and operative, pathologic, and postoperative outcomes were studied. ResultsSPLS TATAR with TME was successful in all patients. No additional incisions for trocars or conversions to open surgery were performed. The median incision length, operative time, and postoperative length of stay were 2. 0  cm (range: 1. 5 – 2. 5), 260  min (range: 190 – 380), and 6 days (range: 4 – 16), respectively. The median number of harvested lymph nodes was 22 (range: 9 – 42). The median distal margin from the tumor was 2. 0  cm (range: 0. 3 – 4. 0). No intraoperative complications were noted. ConclusionsSPLS TATAR with TME was safe and feasible. In addition to cosmetic advantages, oncologic <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>specimens,</b> including adequate margins and sufficient lymph node harvesting could be fulfilled entirely. However, the technique and oncologic safety warrant further evaluation and prospective randomized studies...|$|E

40|$|Introduction:The two {{essential}} <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> pathologic <b>specimens</b> {{in the era}} of personalized therapies for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) {{are accurate}} subtyping as adenocarcinoma (ADC) versus squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and suitability for EGFR and KRAS molecular testing. The aim {{of this study was to}} comprehensively review the performance of cytologic <b>specimens</b> <b>for</b> the above two goals in a high-volume clinical practice. Methods:Subtyping of primary lung carcinomas by preoperative cytology was correlated with subsequent resection diagnoses during a 1 -year period (n = 192). The contribution of various clinicopathologic parameters to subtyping accuracy and utilization of immunohistochemistry (IHC) for NSCLC subtyping were analyzed. In addition, the performance of cytologic <b>specimens</b> submitted <b>for</b> EGFR/KRAS molecular testing during a 1 -year period (n = 128) was reviewed. Results:Of the 192 preoperative cytology diagnoses, tumor subtype was definitive versus favored versus unclassified in 169 (88 %) versus 15 (8 %) versus 8 (4 %) cases, respectively. Overall accuracy of cytologic tumor subtyping (concordance with histology) was 93 % and accuracy of definitive diagnoses 96 %. For a group of patients with ADC and SqCC (n = 165), the rate of unclassified cytologic diagnoses was 3 % and overall accuracy 96 %. IHC was used for subtyping of 9 % of those cases, yielding 100 % accuracy. The strongest predictors of difficulty in subtyping of ADC and SqCC were poor differentiation (p = 0. 0004), low specimen cellularity (p = 0. 019), and squamous histology (p = 0. 003). Of 128 cytologic <b>specimens</b> submitted <b>for</b> molecular testing, 126 (98 %) were suitable for analysis, revealing EGFR and KRAS mutations in 31 (25 %) and 25 (20 %) cases, respectively. Conclusions:Cytologic subtyping of NSCLC is feasible and accurate, particularly when morphologic assessment is combined with IHC. Furthermore, routine cytologic specimens can be successfully used for EGFR/KRAS mutation analysis.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Civil engineering. Fiber inclusion to improve the properties of compacted soil is becoming increasingly common in geotechnical engineering projects. However, the technique requires extensive testing on soil and fiber samples before it can be implemented. Although research performed over the last few decades has evaluated certain fiber-reinforced soil properties and formations, the development of constitutive models for fiber-reinforced soil has lagged. This dissertation aims to minimize testing <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> fiber-reinforced <b>specimens</b> and thereby to encourage the implementation of fiber-reinforced soils in engineering. Extensive testing on unreinforced and reinforced silty and Ottawa sand specimens was performed to develop and to validate a constitutive model for predicting the stress strain-volume-pore pressure response of fiber-reinforced soils. Results showed that the effective friction angle and cohesion intercept increased significantly in consolidated undrained CU) and consolidated-drained (CD) triaxial compression tests for both fiber-reinforced silty sand and Ottawa sand. The shear strength parameters of fiber-reinforced silty sand and Ottawa sand are strain dependent so more shear strain was needed to mobilize fiber resistance <b>for</b> <b>specimens</b> consolidated at higher effective stresses. Moreover, the laboratory results suggested that fiber-reinforcement provides both a deviatoric (q[function]) and a hydrostatic (p[function]) contribution to the stresses in the specimens. However, the hydrostatic contribution of fibers varied according to different soil types and loading conditions. The proposed constitutive model to predict the mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced soils is based on superposition of the response of unreinforced soil and the response due to fibers. Key assumptions in the model include: (1) fibers are uniformly distributed in the specimens. (2) [integral] mob accounts for the reductions in fiber strain due to relative slip between the fibers and the soil, and varies with effective consolidation stress, soil types, and loading conditions, (3) yielding is considered, (4) shear distortion ([for all] is equal to triaxial shear strain ([for all]q), (5) the total axial strain in the fibers ([for all] t) is equal to 0. 25 times axial strain plus 1. 68 times volumetric strain from tests on unreinforced specimens,and (6) the initial p[function] 0 and q[function] 0 are used to account for the compaction, extrusion, and consolidation process. The model was found to be capable of reproducing the deviatoric stress well for all reinforced silty sand and Ottawa sand. The predicted pore pressure and volumetric strain were all in a close agreement with the observed behavior up to large strains for both soils. However, the predicted volumetric strain behavior shows some tendency to over-predict the dilatancy of the reinforced silty sand specimens consolidated less than 20 -psi (140 -[kappa]Pa). The predictions in fiber deviatoric and hydrostatic stresses in CU tests matched reasonably well and followed the same trends as the measured behavior, except <b>for</b> <b>specimens</b> consolidated at higher effective stresses. In CD tests, the deviatoric and hydrostatic stresses matched reasonably well and mimicked the measured behavior, but tended to deviate slightly from the observed response at large strains...|$|R

40|$|When {{geographical}} distance poses as a barrier, telepathology {{is designed}} to offer pathologists the opportunity to replicate their normal activities by using an alternative means of practice. The rapid progression in technology has greatly influenced the appeal of telepathology and its use in multiple domains. To that point, telepathology systems help to afford teleconsultation services for remote locations, improve the workload distribution in clinical environments, measure quality assurance, and also enhance educational programs. While telepathology is an attractive method to many potential users, the resource <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> digitizing microscopic <b>specimens</b> have hindered widespread adoption. The use of image compression is extremely critical to help advance the pervasiveness of digital images in pathology. For this research, we characterize two different methods that we use to assess compression of pathology images. Our first method {{is characterized by the}} fact that image quality is human-based and completely subjective in terms of interpretation. Our second method is characterized by the fact that image analysis is introduced by using machine-based interpretation to provide objective results. Additionally, the objective outcomes from the image analysis may also be used to help confirm tumor classification. With these two methods in mind, the purpose of this dissertation is to quantify the effects of image compression on data interpretation as seen by human experts and a computerized algorithm for use in telepathology.

40|$|Fracture {{analysis}} of a standard construction steel platform deck, which {{had been exposed to}} a liquid nitrogen spill, showed that the brittle fracture started at a flaw in the weld as a consequence of low-temperature embrittlement and thermal stresses experienced by the material. In the present study, the permanent effect of a cryogenic spill on the fracture properties of carbon steels has been investigated. Charpy V-notch impact testing was carried out at 0 °C using specimens, from the platform deck material. The average impact energy appeared to be below <b>requirements</b> only <b>for</b> transverse <b>specimens.</b> No pre-existing damage was found when examining the fracture surfaces and cross sections in the scanning electron microscope. Specimens of the platform deck material and a DOMEX S 355 MCD carbon steel were tensile tested immersed in liquid nitrogen.

A cryogenic spill was simulated by applying a constant tensile force to the <b>specimens</b> <b>for</b> 10 min, at - 196 C. Subsequent tensile tests at room temperature showed no significant influence on the stress-strain curve of the specimens. A small amount of microcracks were found after holding a DOMEX S 355 MCD specimen at a constant force below the yield point. In a platform deck material tensile tested to fracture in liquid nitrogen, cracks associated with elongated MnS inclusions were found through the whole test region. These cracks probably formed {{as a result of the}} inclusions having a higher thermal contraction rate than the steel, causing decohesion at the inclusion-matrix interface on cooling. Simultaneous deformation may have caused formation of cracks. Both the microcracks and sulphide related damage may give permanently reduced impact energy after a cryogenic exposure...|$|R
