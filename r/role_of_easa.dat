40|$|AbstractErythroascorbic acid (eAsA) is a five-carbon analog of ascorbic acid, {{and it is}} {{synthesized}} from d-arabinose by d-arabinose dehydrogenase (ARA) and d-arabinono-γ-lactone oxidase. We {{found an}} NAD+-specific ARA activity which is operative under submillimolar level of d-arabinose in the extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The hypothetical protein encoded by YMR 041 c showed a significant homology to a l-galactose dehydrogenase which plays in plant ascorbic acid biosynthesis, and we named it as Ara 2 p. Recombinant Ara 2 p showed NAD+-specific ARA activity with Km= 0. 78 mM to d-arabinose, which is 200 -fold lower than that for the conventional NADP+-specific ARA, Ara 1 p. Gene disruptant of ARA 2 lost entire NAD+-specific ARA activity and the conspicuous increase in intracellular eAsA by exogenous d-arabinose feeding, while the double knockout mutant of ARA 1 and ARA 2 still retained measurable amount <b>of</b> <b>eAsA.</b> It demonstrates that Ara 2 p, not Ara 1 p, mainly contributes to the production <b>of</b> <b>eAsA</b> from d-arabinose in S. cerevisiae...|$|R

40|$|Ergot {{fungi in}} the genus Claviceps and several related fungal {{groups in the}} family Clavicipitaceae produce toxic ergot alkaloids. These fungi produce a variety of ergot alkaloids, {{including}} clavines as well as lysergic acid derivatives. Ergot alkaloids are also produced by the distantly related, opportunistic human pathogen As-pergillus fumigatus. However, this fungus produces festuclavine and fumigaclavines A, B, and C, which collec-tively differ from clavines of clavicipitaceous fungi in saturation of the last assembled of four rings in the ergoline ring structure. The two lineages are hypothesized to share early steps of the ergot alkaloid pathway before diverging at some point after the synthesis of the tricyclic intermediate chanoclavine-I. Disruption <b>of</b> <b>easA,</b> a gene predicted to encode a flavin-dependent oxidoreductase of the old yellow enzyme class, in A. fumigatus led to accumulation of chanoclavine-I and chanoclavine-I–aldehyde. Complementation of the A. fumigatus easA mutant with a wild-type allele from the same fungus restored the wild-type profile of ergot alkaloids. These data demonstrate that the product <b>of</b> A. fumigatus <b>easA</b> is required for incorporation of chanoclavine-I–aldehyde into more-complex ergot alkaloids, presumably by reducing the double bond conju-gated to the aldehyde group, thus facilitating ring closure. Augmentation of the A. fumigatus easA mutant with a homologue <b>of</b> <b>easA</b> from Claviceps purpurea resulted in accumulation of ergot alkaloids typical of clavicipi-taceous fungi (agroclavine, setoclavine, and its diastereoisomer isosetoclavine). These data indicate tha...|$|R
500|$|The {{objective}} of regulation is to [...] "promote {{high standards of}} safety {{in all aspects of}} aviation", and this is the main area of interaction between the CAA and the GA sector. Efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of airworthiness, pilot qualification, the rules for the movement of aircraft, and equipment to be carried. The CAA was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the UK in 1972. In 1991 it started working within the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) framework to implement agreed common standards, known as the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), throughout the European Union (EU). In 2003 this was taken a step further when the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was established as the central EU regulator, taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities. The CAA acts as an agency <b>of</b> <b>EASA</b> on these issues, retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to EASA. Proposed developments seek to establish EASA as the single authority throughout the EU, taking over from individual member states the power to regulate all aviation other than that specifically excluded from the scope <b>of</b> <b>EASA.</b>|$|R

5|$|Within this {{framework}} certain sectors of GA are governed on a devolved basis. In all cases the CAA/EASA retains responsibility for safety regulation, but representative bodies, particularly of sectors {{that are not}} included in the scope <b>of</b> <b>EASA,</b> are granted greater oversight of their activities. The majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by the British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA), although a significant number are regulated by the Light Aircraft Association (LAA), formerly known as the Popular Flying Association. The LAA is the primary regulator for amateur built aircraft, as well as vintage and classic aircraft. Parachuting is governed by the British Parachute Association, although the aircraft used in this activity are generally CAA-regulated. Balloon and airship flying is overseen by the British Balloon and Airship Club. The UK-specific National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) is administered by the National Pilots Licensing Group Ltd., supported by the LAA, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association UK, the British Gliding Association, and the British Microlight Aircraft Association. Separate from these devolved groups, gliding in the UK is self-regulated. The British Gliding Association was until recently responsible for glider airworthiness, now formally regulated as a result <b>of</b> <b>EASA</b> legislation, and still retains control of pilot certification. Hang gliding and paragliding activities (i.e. foot-launched gliders) are governed by the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association.|$|R
