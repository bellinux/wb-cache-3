The <b>resistive</b> <b>paste</b> is first screen-printed onto {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) substrate, and then coated with expandable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a composite based on an elastomeric matrix and expandable microspheres, resulting into one-shot thermal actuators allowing pumping and sealing in microfluidic devices. The <b>resistive</b> <b>paste</b> must therefore have controlled properties, such as rheology, resistivity and temperature stability.

40|$|International audienceLow-frequency noise {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} used to examine noise properties of Pb/Cd-free RuO 2 - and CaRuO 3 -based thick films screen printed on alumina substrates. Experiments were performed in temperature range 77 - 300 K and frequency range 0. 5 - 5000 Hz with multiterminal devices. The measured noise has been recognized as resistance noise that consists of background 1 /f noise and components generated by several thermally activated noise sources of different activation energies. The total noise has been composed of the contributions generated in resistive layer and in resistive/conductive layers interface. These noise sources are non-uniformly distributed in the resistor volume. Noise intensity of new resistive layers has been described by noise parameter, C bulk. Pb/Cd-free layers occurred to be noisier than their Pb-containing counterparts, however the remove of Pb and Cd from resistive composition is hardly responsible for the increase of the noise. In case of RuO 2 layers noise increases most likely due to larger grain size of RuO 2 powder used to prepare <b>resistive</b> <b>pastes.</b> The information about the quality of resistive-to-conductive layers interface occurred to be stored in the values of noise parameter C int. Pb/Cd-free RuO 2 -based <b>resistive</b> <b>pastes</b> form well-behaved interfaces with various Ag-based conductive pastes. On the contrary, CaRuO 3 -based paste forms bad contacts with AgPd terminations because density of TANSs increases in the interface area...|$|R

40|$|Fresh water {{deficiency}} {{caused by}} climate change calls for employing novel measures {{to ensure safety}} of drinking water supply. Wireless sensor networks {{can be used for}} monitoring hydrological conditions across wide area, allowing flow forecasting and early detection of pollutants. While there are no fundamental technological obstacles to implementation of large area sensor networks, their feasibility is constrained by unit cost of sensing nodes. This paper describes a low-cost pH sensor, intended for use in fresh water monitoring. The sensor was fabricated in a standard thick film process, and an off-the-shelf <b>resistive</b> <b>paste</b> was used as a sensing material. For the fabrication of sensor, RuO 2 <b>resistive</b> <b>paste</b> was screen printed on the alumina substrate with silver conducting layer. Test solutions with pH ranging from 2 to 10 were prepared from HCl or KOH solutions. The potential difference between reference and sensing electrode (electromotive force emf of an electrochemical cell) should be proportional to the pH of a solution according to the Nernst equation. The fabricated sensor exhibits Nernstian response to pH. Influence of storage conditions on sensing performance was also investigated...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} in {{the present}} work the fabrication of polymer-based micro-fluidic and micro-mechanical devices using sacrificial, resistive/conductive pastes, through a screen-printing process. An organic sacrificial paste is first screen-printed onto a substrate, the future opening in the structure existing where the paste lies (channels, cavities …). Then, a <b>resistive</b> <b>paste</b> based on thermosetting polymer resin and graphite is deposited onto the previous layer. Finally, the sacrificial paste is removed at 150  °C by sublimation through the composite, leaving therefore the desired pattern. For such applications, the key is naturally the formulation of the pastes. On a previous work, we already proposed a potential formulation for the organic sacrificial paste, based on polyols Serra et al. (2009). In the present paper, we {{will focus on the}} formulation of the cover paste, which must be adapted rheologically for the screen-printing process, but also chemically due to strong potential interactions between the sacrificial layer and the over-layer. Finally, micro-devices such as simple fluidic channels and suspended structures were produced and shown to be operational, demonstrating the high potential of our process...|$|E

The Sb and Sn powder (1 : 1 by weight) is taken in two quartz tubes separately, vacuum sealed at 10 – 5 Torr and heated in a resistive furnace. at 430 ℃ and 630 ℃ respectively. The conventional glass [1] is modified by using different dopants like tungsten oxide, cobalt oxide, lithium oxide, titanium dioxide, venadium pentoxide, chromium oxide, nickel oxide and manganese dioxide. The <b>resistive</b> <b>pastes</b> are formulated with both powders, 5 % glass and conventional organic binder. The firing temperature is optimized for eight glasses.

40|$|Ruthenium oxide (RuO 2) is {{commonly}} used in <b>resistive</b> <b>pastes</b> for screen printing. The electrochemical properties of a screen-printing planar RuO 2 electrode have hardly been studied. In this communication, planar electrochemical sensors with a RuO 2 working electrode, an AglAgCl reference electrode and a RuO 2 counter electrode are fabricated by screen printing. The electro-oxidation of ascorbic acid, uric acid, and hydrogen peroxide on these RuO 2 electrodes is investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry. Compared to uric acid and hydrogen peroxide, ascorbic acid can be easily oxidized at the low operating potential (< 150 mV versus AglAgCl). The amperometric measurement of ascorbic acid at 100 mV on a RuO 2 electrode shows fast response and good linearity in the 0 - 4 mM range. Meanwhile, the electrochemical interference from uric acid and hydrogen peroxide at this potential is very small. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Presently {{clearing}} electrodes {{are being}} {{considered as a}} possible cure of e-cloud driven problems in existing and future colliders. 'Invisible' electrodes, made of a thin highly <b>resistive</b> layer <b>pasted</b> on a dielectric plate, have been proposed as one of design solutions for the e-cloud clearing. For the first time such electrodes were successfully used in the electron-positron accumulator (EPA) of LEP. Similar electrodes had been using {{for a long time}} for ion clearing purposes in the DAFNE electron ring. Theoretical considerations and experimental measurements at DAFNE have revealed a substantial contribution of the ion clearing electrodes (ICE) to the machine broad-band impedance giving rise to several harmful effects degrading the collider performance. In this paper we discuss the impact of the electrodes on DAFNE beam dynamics, show the results of ICE wake field and impedance calculations and compare them with available experimental data. We also describe the procedure of ICE removal from the wiggler sections of the electron ring that has resulted in remarkable improvements in terms of beam dynamics and geometric luminosity.

40|$|Particle-based {{films are}} today an {{important}} part of various designs and they are implemented in structures as conductive parts, i. e., conductive paste printing in the manufacture of Li-ion batteries, solar cells or <b>resistive</b> <b>paste</b> printing in IC. Recently, particle based films were also implemented in the 3 D printing technique, and are particularly important for use in aircraft, wind power, and the automotive industry when incorporated onto the surface of composite structures for protection against damages caused by a lightning strike. A crucial issue for the lightning protection area is to realize films with high homogeneity of electrical resistance where an in-situ noninvasive method has to be elaborated for quality monitoring to avoid undesirable financial and time costs. In this work the drying process of particle based films was investigated by high-frequency eddy current (HFEC) spectroscopy in order to work out an automated in-situ quality monitoring method with a focus on the electrical resistance of the films. Different types of particle based films deposited on dielectric and carbon fiber reinforced plastic substrates were investigated in the present study and results show that the HFEC method offers a good opportunity to monitor the overall drying process of particle based films. Based on that, an algorithm was developed, allowing prediction of the final electrical resistance of the particle based films throughout the drying process, and was successfully implemented in a prototype system based on the EddyCus® HFEC device platform presented in this work. This prototype is the first solution for a portable system allowing HFEC measurement on huge and uneven surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Superconducting strands can be {{characterized}} by their Minimum Quench Energy (MQE), i. e. the minimum heat pulse needed to trigger a quench in operation conditions (field, temperature, current), {{in the limit of}} a (temporally and spatially) d-shaped disturbance. The sub-mm/µs range of perturbation space has only recently been achieved using the electrical graphite-paste heater technique [1]. The present work has put this technique into practice for the strands of the LHC main magnets, which are designed to operate at 1. 9 K in peak fields of up to 9 T [1]. No way has been found yet to calibrate MQE measurements. To make relative statements on the MQE of different samples possible, the reproducibility of the measurements was emphasized. First heater prototypes did not come up to this stipulation. Finally the tip-heater configuration was found to meet the requirements. It generates a heat pulse in a thin <b>resistive</b> graphite <b>paste</b> deposit on top of a small tip that is pressed against the sample with a clamp. The clamp guarantees a maximum of exposure of the sample to the surrounding cryogen. The most striking aspect of repeated measurements on a reference sample is that in open bath conditions the MQE as a function of transport current in subcooled helium can reach hundred times the corresponding value in adiabatic conditions (i. e. with the sample potted in a low conductivity medium). This extraordinary cooling performance of superfluid helium, predicted by many (e. g. [2]) has rarely been shown in superconductor stability experiments...|$|R

The applicability of the sensors in measurement of pH of water was confirmed...|$|R
