40|$|Measures of risk {{appear in}} two categories: <b>Risk</b> <b>capital</b> <b>measures</b> serve to {{determine}} the necessary amount of risk capital {{in order to avoid}} ruin if the outcomes of an economic activity are uncertain and their negative values may be interpreted as acceptability measures (safety measures). Pure risk measures (risk deviation measures) are natural generalizations of the standard deviation. While pure risk measures are typically convex, acceptability measures are typically concave. In both cases, the convexity (concavity) implies under mild conditions the existence of subgradients (supergradients). The present paper investigates the relation between the subgradient (supergradient) representation and the properties of the corresponding risk measures. In particular, we show how monotonicity properties are reflected by the subgradient representation. Once the subgradient (supergradient) representation has been established, it is extremely easy to derive these monotonicity properties. We give a list of Examples...|$|E

50|$|In summary, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that the representation of risk and uncertainty in accounting systems is limited in scope and technique as well as dispersed over different systems. As of now, no specialised comprehensive accounting system for the purpose of representing risk organisation wide in comparable terms has evolved. Such a system should allow for the representation of risk in accounting terms connected to the goals of the organisation such as liquidity and profitability on different organisational levels such as the organisation as a whole, business units and projects. Central to this is the configuration of adequate risk measures to capture the risk situation and measures for the capability of the organisation to bear risks (e. g. <b>risk</b> <b>capital).</b> These <b>measures</b> should also take into account behavioural and cognitive aspects of judgement and decision making under risk and uncertainty.|$|R

Other salient points in this plan included the recognition that in addition to undercapitalisation in some areas, the industry also suffered in places from being sub-scale and thus inefficient, posing a threat to the industry's international competitiveness, particularly as competition may increase following the relaxation of trade and commerce restrictions among members of ASEAN, commencing in 2015. The Plan recommended in addition to consolidation that the industry seek the more active involvement of multinational insurance groups able to provide the necessary capital as well as expertise to ensure the Thai insurance industry remains internationally benchmarked.|$|R

Design/methodology/approach : We proposed two kinds of allocation methods: one is marginal risk contribution based on iso-entropic coherent risk measure(IE), the other one is to combine the minimal excess allocation(EBA) principle and IE into <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. The iso-entropic coherent risk measure has many advantages over others; it is continuous and more powerful in distinguishing risks, consistent with higher-order stochastic dominances than other risk measures. And EBA is consistent with the amount of risk, which means fairness for <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation.

40|$|Using {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} model with endogenous growth, I show that <b>risk</b> to human <b>capital</b> leads to a “Value ” premium in equity returns. In particular, firms with relatively more firm-specific human capital or more positive covariance between asset growth and returns on human capital are less valuable (and hence have greater Book-to-Market Equity) and yield greater expected equity returns since human capital is more tied {{to the fate of}} said firms. Thus, I reproduce some of the results of Fama and French (1996) and show that in the model their HmL factor is a proxy for human <b>capital</b> <b>risk</b> as <b>measured</b> by macroeconomic and financial variables such as the covariance between human capital growth, or labor income growth, with the growth rate of firm assets. The model implies relatively lower investment-to-asset ratio and lower average asset growth for Value firms as observed in data and as argued in Zhang (2005). Furthermore, the model yields counter-cyclical Value premium and relative Book-to-Market Equity, greater long-run risk exposure for Value firms, and failure of the CAPM. Hence, it replicates several results from the related literature. ⇤I would like to thank my advisers, John Cochrane, Stavros Panageas, and Harald Uhlig for their continuous help and encouragement.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation problems. For <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation problems, {{the aim is}} {{to allocate}} the <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> of a firm to its divisions. <b>Risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation is of central importance in risk-based performance measurement. We consider a case in which the aggregate <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> is determined via a coherent risk measure. The academic literature advocates an allocation rule that, in game-theoretic terms, is equivalent to using the Aumann-Shapley value as solution concept. This value is however not well-defined in case a differentiability condition is not satisfied. As an alternative, we introduce an allocation rule inspired by the Shapley value in a fuzzy setting. We take a grid on a fuzzy participation set, define paths on this grid and construct an allocation rule based on a path. Then, we define a rule as the limit of the average over these allocations, when the grid size converges to zero. We introduce this rule for a broad class of coherent risk measures. We show that if the Aumann-Shapley value is well-defined, the allocation rule coincides with it. If the Aumann-Shapley value is not defined, which is due to non-differentiability problems, the allocation rule specifies an explicit allocation. It corresponds with the Mertens value, which is originally characterized in an axiomatic way (Mertens, 1988), whereas we provide an asymptotic argument. ...|$|R
