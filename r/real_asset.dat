It is shown that, if the liquidation value of <b>real</b> <b>assets</b> is below full market value, a stable cyclical equilibrium can emerge in consumption and capital around the unstable steady state. We also provide conditions for the existence of cycles of higher order, chaos and sunspot equilibria. © 2011 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|Introduction In the past, {{institutions}} {{seeking to}} insulate {{themselves from the}} ravages of inflation have included real estate in their portfolio as a risk management diversification strategy. The events of the late eighties and early nineties have shown that this strategy was not without its drawbacks. In particular, real estate is difficult to value, has inadequate liquidity, and is not traded on a regulated exchange. What institutional investors really need {{is a way to}} achieve the positive aspects of real estate without suffering its drawbacks. <b>Real</b> <b>assets</b> combine the best attributes of real estate and exchange traded products. <b>Real</b> <b>assets</b> [...] - represented as exchange-traded futures [...] - appreciate during inflationary periods; financial assets lose value during these times. It therefore seems necessary to include <b>real</b> <b>assets</b> in any prudent investment program and risk managed diversification strategy. However, simply diversifying a portfolio with <b>real</b> <b>assets</b> does not completel...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} {{crisis and the}} rescue measures taken by governments and central banks increased investors' interest in liquidity and in <b>real</b> <b>assets</b> supposed to offer a hedge against inflation. Against this background, we investigate empirically four <b>real</b> <b>assets</b> (<b>real</b> estate, commodities, infrastructure, and shipping) for which there are investment instruments available which trade in liquid markets. Our empirical study using data from 1999 to 2009 yields several results: First, in most cases, the addition of <b>real</b> <b>assets</b> improved portfolio performance (measured with Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Omega ratio, and Modified Sharpe ratio) in comparison with a base portfolio consisting only of standard stocks and bonds. Among the four <b>real</b> <b>assets,</b> infrastructure and shipping clearly outperformed commodities and real estate. Second, the time frame chosen for the analysis matters very much. This {{is bad news for}} investors because {{there is no such thing}} as the single 'true' time frame for this purpose. Due to our analytical approach, we regard our conclusions, in spite of their general time dependence, as rather solid. Third, despite great conceptual differences, our four performance measures lead to the same conclusions. This result is interesting for investors beyond our specific setting because the selection of a specific performance measure from the vast supply of such measures does not seem to matter much.
