5|$|Asian {{subspecies}} {{are sometimes}} referred to as the maral, but this name applies primarily to the Caspian <b>red</b> <b>deer</b> (Cervus elaphus maral), a subspecies of <b>red</b> <b>deer.</b> There is a subspecies of elk in Mongolia called the Altai wapiti (Cervus canadensis sibiricus), also known as the Altai maral.|$|E
5|$|Recent DNA {{studies suggest}} that there are no more than three or four {{subspecies}} of elk. All American forms seem to belong to one subspecies (Cervus canadensis canadensis). Even the Siberian elk (Cervus canadensis sibiricus) are more or less identical to the American forms and therefore may belong to this subspecies, too. However the Manchurian wapiti (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus) is clearly distinct from the Siberian forms, but not distinguishable from the Alashan wapiti. The Chinese forms MacNeill's deer, Kansu <b>red</b> <b>deer,</b> and Tibetan <b>red</b> <b>deer</b> belong also to the wapitis and were not distinguishable from each other by mitochondrial DNA studies. These Chinese subspecies are sometimes treated as a distinct species, namely the Central Asian <b>red</b> <b>deer</b> (Cervus wallichi), which also includes the Kashmir stag.|$|E

After the Saturday matinée in each city, a panel discussion was held with both the audience and anyone else who wanted to attend, the purpose being to raise awareness about human trafficking in Canada and elsewhere.

5|$|Until recently, <b>red</b> <b>deer</b> and elk were {{considered}} to be one species, Cervus elaphus. However, mitochondrial DNA studies, conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from <b>red</b> <b>deer</b> and elk subspecies as well as other species of the Cervus deer family, strongly indicate that elk, or wapiti, should be a distinct species, namely Cervus canadensis. The previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the C. elaphus species designation; DNA evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to Thorold's deer and even sika deer than they are to the <b>red</b> <b>deer.</b> Though elk and <b>red</b> <b>deer</b> can produce fertile offspring in captivity, geographic isolation between the species in the wild and differences in mating behaviors indicate that reproduction between them outside a controlled environment would be unlikely. However, the two species have freely inter-bred in New Zealand's Fiordland National Park, where the cross-bred animals have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of deer to New Zealand {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European <b>red</b> <b>deer,</b> with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous <b>red</b> <b>deer</b> to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species, as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk. The long-term impact will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them. As in Chile and Argentina, the IUCN has declared that <b>red</b> <b>deer</b> and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the {{reproductive}} biology {{is critical for}} the development of management strategies of the species both in captivity and in the wild, and to address conservation concerns regarding the sustainable use of a species. The present report characterizes some aspects of {{the reproductive}} biology of the wild <b>red</b> brocket <b>deer</b> inhabiting the Northeastern Peruvian Amazon region, based on the anatomical and histological examination of the female reproductive organs of 89 wild adult females in different reproductive states. The <b>red</b> brocket <b>deer</b> female presented ovarian follicular waves involving the synchronous growth of a cohort of an average 25 follicles but only one follicle generally survived and continued development, reaching maturity at 4 mm. Mean ovulation rate was 1. 14 and litter size was 1 fetus. Females presented a low rate of reproductive wastage of 14. 3 % of embryos. Among the 89 adult females studied, 41 (46. 1 %) were pregnant and 48 (53. 9 %) were nonpregnant females. In the Northeastern Peruvian Amazon, conceptions occurred year-round in the <b>red</b> brocket <b>deer</b> but there were peaks in the rate of conception. Estimated yearly reproductive production was 0. 76 - 0. 82 young per adult female. Most pregnant females in advanced stage of pregnancy had at least one active CL, suggesting the persistence of CL throughout gestation...|$|R
