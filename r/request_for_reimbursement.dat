GAO concludes that the District lacked the authority to use the $ 18 million in Section 157 funding for the fiscal year 2000 workforce reduction. District officials told GAO that they believed that they had the Financial Authority's approval to use 157 funding and, consequently, spent $ 14. 3 million during fiscal year 2000 on workforce reduction activities. However, the District could not document that the Financial Authority had certified compliance with the requirements of Section 157 to authorize the use of the funds. The Financial Authority maintains that it did not approve the use of the funds by the District and had denied in writing the District's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> for severance payments. The District accounted for the workforce reduction costs during fiscal year 2000 as if it had access to the Section 157 funding. The District concluded that, had the Section 157 funding been unavailable, one agency would have ended fiscal year 2000 with an operating deficit and two agencies would have experienced increases in their existing operating deficits. As a result, the District may have potential Anti-Deficiency Act violations. ...|$|E

Het Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de Gezondheidszorg (KCE) bestudeerde ruggenmergstimulatie en pijnpompen (IADP), twee types van neuromodulatie voor het bestrijden van ernstige chronische pijn. Het wetenschappelijke bewijs van hun werkzaamheid is beperkt, en zoals bij elke invasieve ingreep zijn er risicos. Daarom worden deze ingrepen best uitgevoerd als geen enkele andere therapie nog helpt. Opvallend is ook het hoge aantal neuromodulatie ingrepen in België, vergeleken met de buurlanden.

40|$|Poli-RISPOSTA {{mobile app}} is an Android {{application}} developed {{to support the}} data gathering step of the Poli-RISPOSTA procedure performed after a flood event. Its aim is to digitalize the current paper based approach used by the Italian Civil Protection. The proposed system aims to provide a consistent approach for collecting and storing data {{and to develop a}} long-term application solution by providing an environment for analyzing, managing, accessing and reusing information, objects and data. Despite the simplicity of the elements that cause floods, floods constitute a high risk to both rural and urban settlements. As more and more surface gets covered by urban settlement, grounds get less permeable resulting in more water unable to drip to the aquifer and submerging the surface. The main factor to push a growing risk of floods is the growing value of assets built on the lands. The reconstruction process that follow such a tragic event need to be planned and tailored on an analysis of the damages to infrastructures and proprieties. Collecting data after floods is necessary not only to verify the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursements</b> or budget allocations but also to gather knowledge about what factors and artifacts of settlements constitute risk in floods. While specific expertise is needed to assess damages to complex infrastructures, inspection of residential properties can be more repetitive and need a systematic methodology to address the multitude of sites to be inspected and amount of data to be gathered, organized and analysed...|$|R

The letter justified the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> full <b>reimbursement</b> by saying [...] "the regulatory decisions of EPA appear to have generated these costs" [...] {{and that it would be}} [...] "inherently unfair" [...] for taxpayers and WASA customers to pay those costs. In 2005, President Bush proposed cutting the EPA's budget by almost a half-billion dollars, mostly from clean-water programs.

30|$|Another {{key factor}} that was {{highlighted}} {{in this study}} was the variability in which hospitals are currently performing their QA process. As hospitals are moving forward with more widespread use of EUS, many hospitals are already, or are soon planning, to <b>request</b> <b>reimbursement</b> <b>for</b> ultrasounds performed in the ED. Each US that is performed, used to make clinical decisions and are subsequently submitted <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> require appropriate documentation regarding the indication for the examinations, written interpretation of the examinations, description of the organs or structures studied, who performed the examinations, and documentation of the scope of the study [13]. For patient safety purposes, it is, therefore, imperative that all of these studies be reviewed for QA on a timely basis. Having an EUS fellowship is likely conducive to having additional staff to review all of these ultrasounds and to ensure that the QA process is more streamlined.|$|R

These included the low number of new medicines seen as innovative alongside increasing <b>requested</b> prices <b>for</b> their <b>reimbursement,</b> especially <b>for</b> oncology, orphan diseases, diabetes and HCV. Proposed models center on the three pillars of pre-, peri- and post-launch including critical drug evaluation, as well as multi-criteria models for valuing medicines for orphan diseases alongside potentially capping pharmaceutical expenditure. In conclusion, the proposed models involving all key stakeholder groups are critical for the sustainability of healthcare systems or enhancing universal access.

30|$|The use of {{emergency}} ultrasonography (EUS) has gained much popularity, {{since it was}} first introduced in the 1980 s {{and is now a}} mainstay of diagnostic decision-making in the emergency department [1]. In 2011, the Accreditation Council for General Medical Education (ACGME) Residency Review Committee (RRC) adopted an outcomes-based approach to residency accreditation in the United States. As part of this endeavor, EUS was deemed as one of the essential components in Patient Care, which is one of six core competencies for emergency medicine residency training. Since adoption of this mandate, every emergency medicine (EM) residency program must teach and assess ultrasound competency as part of its education [2]. As a result of this directive, improvements in US technology and research into new potential applications for US, the use of EUS has increased in the emergency department (ED). This expanded use is now highlighting the substantial issue of individual hospitals in credentialing its emergency medicine attending physicians in EUS in the United States.
