25|$|Generally speaking, {{the body}} suspends {{homeostasis}} during paradoxical sleep. Heart rate, cardiac pressure, cardiac output, arterial pressure, and breathing rate quickly become irregular {{when the body}} moves into REM sleep. In general, respiratory reflexes such as response to hypoxia diminish. Overall, the brain exerts less control over breathing; electrical stimulation of respiration-linked brain areas does not influence the lungs, as it does during non-REM sleep and in waking.

25|$|Transsaccadic {{memory is}} the neural process that allows humans to {{perceive}} their surroundings as a seamless, unified image despite rapid changes in fixation points. The human eyes move rapidly and repeatedly, {{focusing on a}} single point for only {{a short period of}} time before moving to the next point. These <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> are called saccades. If a video camera were to perform such high speed changes in focal points, the image on screen would be a blurry, nauseating mess. Despite this rapidly changing input to the visual system, the normal experience is of a stable visual world; an example of perceptual constancy. Transsaccadic memory is a system that contributes to this stability.|$|E

40|$|The {{sleep of}} 30 {{children}} with disorders {{of growth and}} development was studied because of the known association between sleep and the secretion of hormones. Thirty three normal children were studied for comparison. The sleep of two consecutive nights was monitored at home using a small portable electroencephalogram and electro-oculogram recorder. Within the normal group {{there were no significant}} differences between sexes nor between the first and second nights of recording. There was a significant decrease in total sleep time with increasing age due to reduction in the amounts of <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep and stage IV sleep. There was no change in <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> latency or overall <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> activity between the three age groups. Children with genetic short stature and those with poor growth as a result of poor eating habits had an increased percentage of <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep. A significant decrease in the percentage of stage IV sleep, increased amount of <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep (especially active <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep), and decreased <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> cycling time was found in five children with severe psychosocial deprivation.

Preventing <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep after monocular deprivation reduced ocular dominance plasticity and inhibited activation of a kinase critical for this plasticity (extracellular signal–regulated kinase). Chronic single-neuron recording in freely behaving cats further revealed that cortical activity during <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep resembled activity present during monocular deprivation.

25|$|The midband covers {{only about}} 5°–10° {{of the visual}} field at any given instant, but, like most crustaceans, mantis shrimps' eyes are mounted on stalks. In mantis shrimps the {{movement}} of the stalked eye is unusually free, and can be driven in all possible axes of movement—up to at least 70°—by eight eyecup muscles divided into six functional groups. By using these muscles to scan the surroundings with the midband, they can add information about forms, shapes, and landscape which cannot be detected by the upper and lower hemisphere of the eye. They can also track moving objects using large, <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> where the two eyes move independently. By combining different techniques, including movements in the same direction, the midband can cover a very wide range of the visual field.|$|E

2500|$|In animals, the {{appearance}} of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (PGO waves) is related {{to that of the}} bioelectric outputs of <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> These waves are most clearly seen during the transition from non-REM to REM sleep. Although these phasic waves are observed in many portions of the animal brain, they are most noticeable in the pons, lateral geniculate bodies, and the occipital cortex. Peigneux et al., 2006, reported that the lateral geniculate nucleus and occipital cortex display higher levels of activity during REM sleep than during wakefulness. This would add to the theory that activation in these areas is similar to PGO wave activation in animals. Pontine waves are commonly seen in animals as a mechanism to help facilitate learning and memory consolidation. [...] An improvement on task performance was seen to be a result of increased P waves between REM sleep sessions. In a study using post learning REM sleep deprivation the effects of stimulating the P wave generator (located in the pontine tegmentum) of a rat were observed. Two groups of rats underwent an avoidance learning task and then allowed a sleep period while another group of rats were deprived sleep. When comparing the two groups the sleep deprived rats showed a significant deficit in learning from having not undergone REM sleep. In another rat group, the P wave generator was stimulated using a carbachol injection and the rats then underwent a sleep deprivation stage. When these rats were again tested on their learning it was shown that activation of the P wave generator during sleep deprivation resulted in normal learning being achieved. This would point {{to the fact that the}} activation of P waves, even without REM sleep, was enough to enhance the memory processes that would not normally have happened.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIdiopathic <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep {{behaviour}} disorder {{is characterized by}} nocturnal violence, increased muscle tone during <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep {{and the lack of}} any other neurological disease. However, idiopathic <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep {{behaviour disorder}} can precede parkinsonism and dementia by several years. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging and neuromelanin-sensitive sequences, we previously found that the signal intensity was reduced in the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus area of patients with Parkinson’s disease and <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep behaviour disorder. Here, we studied the integrity of the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex with neuromelanin-sensitive imaging in 21 patients with idiopathic <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep behaviour disorder and compared the results with those from 21 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent a clinical examination, motor, cognitive, autonomous, psychological, olfactory and colour vision tests, and <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep characterization using video-polysomnography and 3 T magnetic resonance imaging. The patients more frequently had preclinical markers of alpha-synucleinopathies, including constipation, olfactory deficits, orthostatic hypotension, and subtle motor impairment. Using neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, reduced signal intensity was identified in the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex of the patients with idiopathic <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep behaviour. The mean sensitivity of the visual analyses of the signal performed by neuroradiologists who were blind to the clinical diagnoses was 82. 5 %, and the specificity was 81 % for the identification of idiopathic <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep behaviour. The results confirm that this complex is affected in idiopathic <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep behaviour (to the same degree as it is affected in Parkinson’s disease).

These <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> occur in approximately 30 ms and each fixation lasts for approximately 300 ms.

A similar phenomenon occurs during eye-blinks whereby both automatic and intentional blinking disrupts the information stored in iconic memory.|$|E
