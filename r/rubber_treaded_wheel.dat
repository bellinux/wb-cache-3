5|$|Nokian Tyres {{produces}} 23,000 tyres per day at {{a factory}} in Nokia, Finland, and 200,000 tyres a year under the Bridgestone brand name. The original factory was built in 1904, the current one in 1945; it has expanded several times since then. Nokian Tyres has 27 assembly lines at its Finnish plant. The plant uses radio frequency devices to monitor the inventory of materials used to manufacture tyres, such as the 100-metre long strips of <b>rubber</b> <b>tread.</b> Shortages of <b>rubber</b> <b>tread</b> can halt production and so keeping an adequate supply of materials increases efficiency. Despite trade journals discussing this technique, Nokian declines to confirm its production methods.|$|R

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of railway wheels to {{wear and}} rolling contact fatigue damage {{is influenced by}} the properties of the wheel material (microstructure and hardness). These properties are influenced by the steel composition, wheel manufacturing process, and by the stresses experienced during operation.

Analyt-ical models of the PVDF-based sensing system are presented to cap-ture the wheel/ground contact information and friction character-istics.

40|$|<b>Tread</b> braked railway <b>wheels</b> are {{subjected}} to complex loading due to combined rolling contact stresses and thermally induced stresses. The main objective {{of the present study}} is to find the limits for tread braking with respect to temperature impact on rolling contact fatigue (RCF) of the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> A <b>wheel</b> with an S-shaped web is studied for some different stop braking loads. Using 3 D FE simulations, the effects of simultaneous thermal loading from braking and mechanical loading, with traversing wheel-rail rolling contact, are studied. In order to account for the elevated temperatures, the simulations utilise a temperature-dependent elastoplastic material model. The mechanical loads account for frictional rolling contact stress distributions induced by braking, using a novel method that is based on elastoplastic contact simulations. Partial slip is considered and interfacial shear stresses are introduced in the wheel-rail contact area. Evolution of damage {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> is studied for various brake loading cases. In order to assess limits for the tread braking, the calculated damage is compared to previously developed critical damage levels which were based on full-scale brake rig testing. Results are presented for a parametric study with thermomechanical loading based on different load cases. The influence from operational parameters such as axle loads, initial speeds, decelerations and block material is studied. The results show that the temperature has a strong influence on the rolling contact fatigue of the <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> and, hence, also on the thermal capacity of the wheels. The study gives preliminary limits for revenue traffic, described as combinations of tread temperatures and wheel-rail rolling contact loading, which should be respected to avoid thermal cracking of the <b>wheel</b> <b>treads...</b>|$|R

Results from controlled brake rig tests of repeated stop braking cycles for a railway wheel in rolling {{contact with a}} so-called railwheel are presented.

Results from thermal imaging reveal a frictionally excited thermoelastic instability phenomenon called "banding" where the contact between brake block and wheel occurs only over a fraction of the block width.
