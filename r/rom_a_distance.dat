50|$|Workbench {{itself has}} always been a disk-based component, though much of the {{underlying}} functionality is stored in the Amiga's Kickstart firmware, usually stored in <b>ROM.</b> <b>As</b> a consequence, it is necessary to boot from a system disk to launch Workbench. This setup streamlines the process of launching games (which typically do not require Workbench) and ensures that memory is not used unnecessarily by the OS in memory-limited systems.|$|R

40|$|Repetition is an {{important}} phenomenon {{in a variety of}} domains, such as music, computer programs and architectural drawings. A generative model for these domains should account for the possibility of repetition. We present repeated observation models (<b>ROMs),</b> <b>a</b> framework for modeling sequences that explicitly allows for repetition. In <b>a</b> <b>ROM,</b> <b>an</b> element is either generated by copying a previous element, or by using a base model. We show how to build ROMs using  -grams and hidden Markov models as the base model. We also describe <b>an</b> extension of <b>ROMs</b> in which entire subsequences are repeated together. Results from a music modeling domain show that ROMs can lead to dramatic improvement in predictive ability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} compact {{implementation}} of Scheme for microcontrollers {{that includes a}} real-time garbage collector. The compiler runs on a normal workstation and produces byte-code from the source program. A smart linker links the byte-code with the runtime module. We demonstrate that with this system it is clearly possible to run realistic Scheme programs on a microcontroller with as little as 3 to 4 KB of RAM. Programs that access the whole Scheme library require only 13 KB of <b>ROM.</b> <b>As</b> a byproduct of this research, we designed a novel space-efficient real-time GC algorithm...|$|R
