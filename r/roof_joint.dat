Optimum heating temperature for the A 357 billet was between 580 and 585 ˚C corresponding to the semi-solid temperatures showing 20 - 30 % of liquid fraction.

From 1846, he was also head of the Academic Secretariat, under Director Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, and was responsible for correspondence, matriculations and programs. During these years, he became an advocate of Rundbogenstil, a type of Romanesque Revival architecture and designed a home for Schadow on what is now Schadowstraße.

40|$|Laser brazing is a joining {{technology}} which is typically employed {{in areas with}} particularly high quality requirements, e. g. to create zero gap <b>roof</b> <b>joints</b> in automotive production. These seams have to be leak proof and are situated {{in an area of}} the car body which is in direct view of the customer. Hence, seam defects and imperfections are inacceptable and require extensive rework whenever they occur. Resulting high rework costs can be avoided by investigating the causes of these imperfections in order to prevent their formation. One type of imperfection which may occur during the laser brazing of galvanised steel are dark deposits on the seam surface. This paper examines the mechanisms leading to the formation of this type of imperfection. Results on the properties of surface deposits are presented along with conclusions regarding the systematic reasons behind their formation. Finally, strategies for preventing the occurrence of surface deposits are recommended...|$|R

The RISE body structure disperses energy loads during side and rear crashes and controls distortion, enhancing occupant protection and also protecting the fuel system during a rear impact. The highly rigid structure makes extensive use of high-tension steel. It features straight [...] "front side members" [...] with an octagonal [...] "cross-section" [...] and a three-leg support structure, as well as increased application of both high-strength (590Mpa) and ultra-high strength (980MPa) steel. Compared to the previous-generation Lancer, torsional rigidity has been increased by 56 percent, and bending rigidity is up by 50 percent. The side pillars, <b>roof</b> <b>joints</b> and cross-car structure increase collision protection.

40|$|A {{close look}} at the Loyalhanna Limestone of southwestern Pennsylvania reveals a complex {{structural}} environment. Most exposures of the Loyalhanna occur along Chestnut Ridge and LaurelHill within the Allegheny Mountain Section of the Appalachian Plateaus Province. Because the Loyalhanna is rated as a super-pavement aggregate by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and because of its proximity to the population centers of southwestern Pennsylvania, the Loyalhanna has been extensively mined along these prominent anticlinal structures. Geologic and engineering analyses were performed using gas well and core logs, outcrop examinations, underground observations, and mine maps. Strata exposures from both outcrops and quarries were used to construct geologic maps, stereo net, and rose diagram projections so that the Loyalhanna 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s structural environment could be understood better. Many of these structural conditions cause ground control problems at local quarries. These problems ranged from small-to-moderate sized rock falls associated with <b>roof</b> <b>jointing</b> to pillar failures associated with dipping discontinuities. Stresses ranged from tensional on structural domes where weathering dominates, to high levels of compression within structural saddles. A greater understanding of these characteristics is a prerequisite to develop engineering controls, such as improved mine layouts, pillar sizes, etc., that lessen miner exposure to these hazards...|$|R

40|$|Carbon dioxide {{concentrations}} in Ballynamintra Cave, S.

Elevated {{concentrations in}} <b>roof</b> fissures, <b>joints,</b> and adjacent to walls suggest that these locations shelter CO 2 gas from advection and permit local accumulation. CO 2 enrichment was noted over a sediment accumulation, suggesting that microbial oxidation of organic compounds in the sediment provided an additional CO 2 source distinct from the soil zone above the cave. Advection driven by external barometric pressure variations caused ventilation, which is the principal CO 2 sink. The data presented here underscore the need for high resolution data to adequately characterize cave air PCO 2 variability...|$|R

40|$|The few open roofs {{mentioned}} in literature seem to represent an exception {{rather than the}} rule: most Scottish timber roofs are hidden behind timber or plaster ceilings and characterised by a much simpler common rafter form. From the eighteenth century onwards they presented hipped and trussed arrangements as well as other more complex solutions developed to meet the requirements of evolving architecture. This paper attempts to shed some light on the design and construction techniques of eighteenth century Scottish timber roofs with the preliminary results obtained from the creation of a relational database of 1250 buildings (including structures, professionals, dates), related mapping, survey of 29 roofs across Scotland and a more detailed study of those at Tweeddale House in Edinburgh, and Glasgow Trades Hall. Both buildings have roofs from the period in which the Adam brothers worked on them as architects. The original sixteenth century Tweeddale House was remodeled by the Adams in 1752 - 3 and almost forty years later Robert Adam designed the Glasgow Trades Hall (1791 / 4), although the building was completed after his death with a modified design. Archival research combined with surveys has allowed to make an initial appraisal of the design and construction processes involved in the two projects. Many questions arise concerning the specific involvement of architects and wrights in the successive transformations of the roofs and an attempt to identify local and foreign influences has been carried out by analyzing the typology of <b>roofs</b> and <b>joints...</b>|$|R

Recognising and recording oriented indicators on hazard plans can assist in forewarning where channels may be anticipated. The experience at the Ashton Coal Mine shows how recording these features provide a means of predicting channel trends. Drainage pattern interpretation of the sandstone channels was possible due to excellent exposure of coarse grain channel sediment, levee, and overbank facies deposition. Comparison of the plotted drainage trends with paleodrainage direction indicated by oriented plant debris demonstrates direct correlation, using paleodrainage indicators {{in the absence of an}} exposure of the channel base can be used to predict the trend of the channel at a specific location...|$|R
