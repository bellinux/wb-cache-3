25|$|Sculpture is {{the branch}} of the visual arts that {{operates}} in three dimensions. It {{is one of the}} plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>material)</b> and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast.|$|E
25|$|Flamingos make a {{different}} type of mound nest. Using their beaks to pull material towards them, they fashion a cone-shaped pile of mud between 15–46cm (6–18in) tall, with a small depression in the top to house their single egg. The height of the nest varies with the substrate upon which it is built; those on clay sites are taller on average than those on dry or sandy sites. The height of the nest and the circular, often water-filled trench which surrounds it (the result of the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> for the nest) help to protect the egg from fluctuating water levels and excessive heat at ground level. In East Africa, for example, temperatures {{at the top of the}} nest mound average some 20°C (40°F) cooler than those of the surrounding ground.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013, Lawrence Lessig brought {{suit against}} Liberation Music PTY Ltd., after Liberation issued a {{takedown}} notice {{of one of}} Lessig's lectures on YouTube which had used the song [...] "Lisztomania" [...] by the band Phoenix, whom Liberation Music represents. Lessig sought damages under section 512(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which holds parties liable for misrepresentations of infringement or <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>material.</b> Lessig was represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Jones Day. In February 2014, the case ended with a settlement in which Liberation Music admitted wrongdoing in issuing the takedown notice, issued an apology, and paid a confidential sum in compensation.|$|E

2500|$|Slotted rotors have shallow {{channels}} machined {{into the}} disc {{to aid in}} removing dust and gas. Slotting is the preferred method in most racing environments to remove gas and water and to deglaze brake pads. Some discs are both drilled and slotted. Slotted discs are generally not used on standard vehicles because they quickly wear down brake pads; however, this <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> is beneficial to race vehicles since it keeps the pads soft and avoids vitrification of their surfaces. On the road, drilled or slotted discs still {{have a positive effect}} in wet conditions because the holes or slots prevent a film of water building up between the disc and the pads.|$|E
2500|$|Processes during {{earthwork}} include excavation, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> to spoil, filling, compacting, {{construction and}} trimming. If rock or other unsuitable material is discovered it is removed, moisture content is managed {{and replaced with}} standard fill compacted to meet the design requirements (generally 90-95% relative compaction). [...] Blasting is not frequently used to excavate the roadbed as the intact rock structure forms an ideal road base. When a depression must be filled {{to come up to}} the road grade the native bed is compacted after the topsoil has been removed. The fill is made by the [...] "compacted layer method" [...] where a layer of fill is spread then compacted to specifications, under saturated conditions. The process is repeated until the desired grade is reached. (pp. 68–69 [...] ).|$|E
