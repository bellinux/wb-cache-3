40|$|Objective: Firefighters {{must use}} {{protective}} clothing to avoid physical, chemical and environmental damages in their <b>works.</b> Firefighting <b>clothing</b> should cause the minimal physiological, mental and organic {{limitations on the}} body, beside their protective features. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the firefighting protective <b>clothing</b> and usual <b>work</b> <b>clothing,</b> in terms of their effects on heat strain during physical activity. Methodology: This is a cross-over study, in which 30 young male were recruited according to inclusion criteria. After choosing the participants, the physical activity was done once by wearing Firefighting protective clothing and again by wearing usual <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> by random, based on Bruce exercise protocol. Before and after the physical activity, parameters such as Heart rate and Core temperature were measured. The Physiological Strain Index (PSI) was calculated by setting core temperature and heart rate according to Moran’s equation. Results: The results show that the Physiological Strain Index (PSI) was 6. 15 ± 1. 12 in participants with firefighting protective clothing, while this number was 3. 64 ± 0. 81 for usual <b>work</b> <b>clothing.</b> This difference is statistically significant (p< 0. 001). These two sets of clothes are different in their effects on Parameters such as Heart Rate, Core temperature and PSI. The obtained values for usual <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> are better than firefighting protective clothing. Conclusions: Firefighting protective clothing causes higher level of heat stress and lower tolerance time, because the Physiological Strain Index (PSI) and Core temperature for these clothing was observed higher than the usual <b>work</b> <b>clothing.</b> Heat stress resulted in elevated core temperature which reduce tolerance of firefighters and in severe cases cause risk of heat stress...|$|R

As a consequence, female blue-collar workers often {{have no choice but}} to wear <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> and PPE designed for male workers. Goldenhar and Sweeney 1996 indicated that improperly-fitting clothing and PPE are significant concerns of women workers in the construction field because they increase the likelihood of experiencing occupational injuries.|$|R

30|$|Considering {{the need}} for gender equity in the workforce, this {{research}} explores social construction of gender; how that construction relates to work; and, subsequently, how gender construction influences the design and marketing of <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> and personal protective equipment (PPE) for women working in blue-collar occupations. To explore the phenomenon, a content analysis of products and advertising images in seven websites selling blue-collar work clothes and PPE was used. Collected data suggests <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> and PPE designed for women is limited in terms of size, design, and number of products available. It was also found that there exists a cultural discomfort with portraying women as competent blue-collar professionals in the advertisement of <b>work</b> <b>clothing.</b> The research provides a discussion of guiding ideas for improvement {{in the design and}} marketing of products for women workers in blue-collar occupations. Findings suggest design and marketing images could be improved to better reflect and appeal to women purchasing and using these products.|$|R

30|$|This {{shows that}} women in blue-collar occupations {{struggle}} not only with finding <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> that fits but also with being able to identify and be identified as “female” in their <b>work</b> <b>clothing.</b> Levy stated that “all commercial objects have a symbolic character, and making a purchase involves an assessment—implicit or explicit—of this symbolism, {{to decide whether or}} not it fits” (Levy 1959, p. 117). Taking into account these issues, it is worthwhile to explore what kinds of clothing and PPE are available for women blue-collar workers and the ways that marketing images of women in these clothes and PPE are constructed as advertising images that can influence an individual’s self-image.|$|R
30|$|Clothing serves various {{communicative}} functions. Especially, one’s {{identity is}} often communicated through clothing (Kaiser 1985). In addition to communicating self, clothing {{has a significant}} impact on the enhancement of self. When used positively, clothing contributes to feelings of self-acceptance (Gibbins 1969). In addition, Kwon (1994) found that positive feelings toward one’s clothing were positively related to self-perceived emotion, sociability, and work competency. Wagner, Kim, and Gordon (2013) also explored significant connections between satisfaction with <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> and PPE, self-efficacy, and overall satisfaction of trade work. Therefore, it would be significant to promote one’s perceptions about <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> to improve one’s overall satisfaction in the workplace.|$|R

Through this process, people are encouraged to adopt and develop certain traits that are often referred to as masculine or feminine. In this regard, the researcher classified the <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> and PPE in blue-collar occupations as a social object and a symbol that attains meaning through social interaction. Based on the findings, the researcher drew empirical implications from a theoretical discussion of the findings, as follows.|$|R

The different cotton garments differed significantly in their permeability, and the upper part of the body was the anatomical region showing the greatest values of the penetration factors. These results confirm the necessity of using PPE properly to minimise dermal exposure to pesticides...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 With {{the arrival}} of European {{settlers}} to Western Oregon nearly 150 years ago came new methods of forest management. Early settlers' forest practices consisted of little more than harvesting what seemed an endless supply of timber. Forestry in the 20 th century eventually incorporated such management concerns as re-forestation, biodiversity, wildlife sciences, recreation, and cultural resources. While forest practices in the Pacific Northwest changed dramatically during the 20 th century, clothing worn by those most commonly associated with the field, the "logger," remained relatively unchanged. While much information has been published regarding the often over-romanticized life of the logger, information regarding the day to day-life and associative material culture remains almost nonexistent. As the 20 th century economy in the Pacific Northwest became less dependent on the wood products industry, the culture {{and way of life}} for those whose lives centered around this once thriving industry began to disappear. My interest in this subject developed out of my personal experience working in the woods throughout the Pacific Northwest for seven years, as a forest fire fighter and park ranger for the Bureau of Land Management, and as an archaeologist for the U. S. Forest Service and Oregon State University Research Forests. In this study, I gathered collective memories from 18 individuals who logged throughout Western Oregon between 1920 and 1970. Informants were asked a series of questions pertaining to their logging careers and the clothing they wore. Often termed "old-timers," these informants served as the primary resource of information about <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> worn by loggers in Western Oregon between 1920 and 1970. Published information describing the history of logging in the Pacific Northwest, photographs provided by informants showing them at work, the examination of catalogues from manufacturers of men's <b>work</b> <b>clothing,</b> and interviews with representatives of <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> companies served as secondary resources. Published materials detailing <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> worn by loggers is relatively nonexistent. Consequently, persons with first hand knowledge wearing logging <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> are in many instances the only sources of information. Photographs furnished by subjects, showing them wearing their <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> were collected as supportive material. While interviewing subjects for this project, additional questions beyond the scope of the project were asked. Subjects were asked related questions about other types of clothing they wore during their careers. Other areas of logging history and culture explored during interviews consisted of information about changes they observed in the technology of logging hand tools and machinery, land management and associative forest practices, and first hand experiences observing fellow workers severely injured or killed while working in the woods. With the passing of each "old-time" logger, a living connection between the present and the past, and the stories in between, are gone forever. This project helps to present a written record of some of these connections...|$|R

50|$|The {{common theme}} among all Amish {{clothing}} is plainness; clothing should not {{call attention to}} the wearer by cut, color, or any other feature. Hook-and-eye closures or straight pins are used as fasteners on dress clothing rather than buttons, zippers, or velcro. Snaps are used on everyday clothes, and plain buttons for work shirts and trousers. The historic restriction on buttons is attributed to tradition and their potential for ostentation. In all things, the aesthetic value is plainness. Some groups tend to limit color to black (trousers, dresses) and white (shirts), while others allow muted colors. Dark blue denim <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> is common within some groups as well.
