40|$|ABSTRACT Compared to {{conventional}} bonds and total financial assets, {{the share of}} Islamic bonds is very small. However, since 2002 the issuance of this instrument has increased rapidly and {{it is expected to}} keep increasing in the future. The purpose of the dissertation is to discuss on Ijarah sukuk pricing, and on {{a review of the literature}} concerning Shariah and financial issues related to the instrument, as a basis to construct a financial model to price it. To build the formula for the Ijarah sukuk, three types of model are used: the model for leasing as illustrated by Schallheim (1994), McConnell and Schallheim (1983) and Myers, Dill and Bautista (1976); the formal mortgage system as illustrated by Ebrahim and Ahmed (2008), and the cost of capital in a non-interest economy by Mirakhor (1996). From the analysis of the above pricing model and also from review of Shariah and financial issues related to the instrument, it is concluded that the pricing of Ijarah sukuk is an analogy of conventional bond price with some adjustments such as the presence of SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) fee, Legal and Shariah boards' fee, and operating expenses. This dissertation illustrates four types of formula based on the conditions in the contract, such as the Ijarah sukuk with (1) <b>repurchase</b> <b>transaction</b> held with certainty and with a predetermined price (2) <b>repurchase</b> <b>transaction</b> with certainty and the asset price follows geometric Brownian motion (gBm), (3) <b>repurchase</b> <b>transaction</b> with call option and with predetermined price, (4) <b>repurchase</b> <b>transaction</b> with call option and the asset price follows geometric Brownian motion (gBm) ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of taxes and risk on firm's repurchasing {{decision}} and the subsequent market reaction to their announcement. I extend the repurchase literature by examining the tax and risk motivations for firms repurchasing their stock and increasing their borrowing, while controlling for the alternative explanations for repurchases. In a stock repurchase, a firm can quickly change the ratio of debt to equity in its capital structure, and, when combined with the positive change in debt, a setting where the firm is altering the balance of its capital structure in two similar directions is revealed. If there are both significant benefits and costs to debt financing, as suggested by trade-off theory, then firms should make financing choices {{that are related to}} these factors. The results revealed that firms increasing their borrowing as part of the <b>repurchase</b> <b>transaction</b> are significantly more under-leveraged, realize greater tax benefits, and have lower default risk than firms that are decreasing their borrowing. These findings are consistent across univariate analysis and multivariate logistic analyses that control for free-cash-flow and signaling explanations. Also, I show that the tax benefits for firms increasing their debt are positively related to the announcement period abnormal returns. Collectively, these results suggest that debt-financed repurchases are being used, in part, to re-balance firms' capital structures, and that the resulting tax benefits have a positive influence on firm value...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Share repurchases {{were allowed}} in South Africa as from 1 July 1999. The concept of repurchasing shares is {{therefore}} relatively new in this country, compared {{to many other}} countries (e. g. the United States of America and the United Kingdom), where it is an established practice. Considerable {{research in the field}} already exists, providing empirical evidence on the extent of share repurchase activities and current theoretical thinking on the motivations for share repurchases and the determinants affecting the choice of payout methods. In South Africa there are indications, as this study demonstrates, that research on payout methods and payout reform has become a matter of urgency. Share repurchase activity by JSE-listed companies is not comprehensively recorded by South African financial data sources. Prior research on South African share repurchases is limited, mainly owing to the fact that a comprehensive share repurchase database is not available. This study sets out to document the extent of share repurchases by companies in selected JSE-listed sectors (for reporting periods including 1 July 1999 to the 2009 year-ends of the companies) and to test whether empirical evidence and current theoretical thinking also applied in South Africa. The results of these tests were used to develop a model to ascertain what the significant determinants were when a JSE-listed company had to decide between repurchasing shares and paying special dividends. This study found that the South African regulatory environment pertaining to share repurchases differed from the regulatory environments of other countries. The main differences related to the share repurchase announcement structure (namely the JSE Listings Requirements that open market share repurchases need to be announced via SENS only once a 3 % limit has been reached) and that subsidiaries are allowed to repurchase shares in the holding company (and have a tax benefit when compared to share repurchases made by the holding company itself). These differences affected the results of this study. On compiling a database on share repurchases by companies in selected JSE-listed sectors, {{it was found that the}} share repurchase announcements (made via SENS) could not be used as the main source to compile comprehensive share repurchase data (mainly owing to the 3 % rule on open market share repurchases). Annual report disclosures were therefore scrutinised to obtain share repurchase data for this study. These disclosures were found to be applied inconsistently by companies (mainly because subsidiaries were allowed to repurchase shares in the holding company; International Financial Reporting Standards and the JSE Listings Requirements did not adequately cater for the differing South African regulatory environment in their disclosure stipulations; and compliance to the disclosure requirements were not adequately monitored). Consequently, an extensive process of verification was applied in order to compile a comprehensive and reliable share repurchase database for this study. When testing whether empirical evidence and current theoretical thinking on share repurchases also applied in South Africa, it was found that the unique South African regulatory environment led to certain aspects of the South African share repurchase experience not mirroring the global precedent. The main differences between the South African and global share repurchase evidence which emerged from the present study are that the open market share repurchase type is not the outright favoured repurchase type (as is the case globally); that subsidiaries repurchasing shares in the holding company are the favoured South African share repurchasing entity (as opposed to subsidiaries not being allowed to repurchase shares in most other countries); and that share repurchases announced via SENS do not represent comprehensive share repurchase data (as opposed to global security exchanges requiring share repurchase announcements on a regular and accurate actual-time basis). When testing the current theoretical thinking on the information-signalling motivation for share repurchases, it was found that the motivation for South African open market and pro rata share repurchases mirrored the current theoretical thinking. Open market share repurchases were found to be motivated by the information-signalling hypothesis, while the short-term abnormal returns of pro rata offers were offset by the negative abnormal returns over the long term. A share repurchase type unique to the South African share repurchase environment (namely the repurchase of treasury shares by the holding company) was found not to be motivated by the information-signalling hypothesis. This study also found that companies repurchasing shares were generally classified as value companies (which tend to be undervalued) prior to the <b>repurchase</b> <b>transaction</b> which mirrored the current theoretical thinking. In developing a model of choice to determine what the main determinants were when a company had to decide between open market share repurchases and special dividends, this study found that some of the South African determinants mirrored the current theoretical thinking, but also identified determinants which were not identified as significant determinants in global research. This study found that ownership structure, size of the distribution and level of company undervaluation were the significant factors which affected a company’s choice of payout method. It was found that smaller companies, with fewer shareholders and more public investors favoured open market share repurchases over special dividends. Open market share repurchases were found to be selected for smaller distributions when compared to special dividends. Companies paying special dividends were found to exhibit lower degrees of undervaluation when compared to companies which repurchased shares in the open market. This study found that share repurchases became a popular means of distributing excess cash as from 2005. A total amount of about R 384 billion was spent on share repurchases during the reporting periods including 1 July 1999 to the 2009 year-ends of the companies included in the population of this study. Share repurchases did not exceed dividend payments over the target period and represented about 36 per cent of total payouts. In 2009, the final year of the study, share repurchases represented about 44 per cent of total payouts. The results of this study showed that investors would benefit over the long term when investing in companies which repurchased shares in the open market. It was also found that there were certain characteristics which were evident in companies when choosing open market share repurchases rather than special dividend payments. This study concluded that the South African regulatory environment possesses many characteristics of a developing economy’s financial systems. Suggestions are given on how to improve and better align the South African repurchasing environment to those of developed economies...|$|E

Finally, I examine the economic impact of the increase in transparency on these firms and show that the equity cost of capital of firms announcing repurchases decreases significantly from the low to high disclosure period...|$|R

Causal research was conducted to analyse the correlation between a share repurchase event and the share price of the featured company. The share buyback announcements were collected from the Bloomberg database. The holding period returns were calculated and compared to zero to analyse whether there was any momentum or contrarian signals. The holding period returns were also adjusted for the average of the all REIT index to ascertain whether the returns were abnormal or not.

40|$|Classic {{signaling}} {{theory suggests}} that in an economic environment which results in a pooling equilibrium, investors who have difficulty ascertaining firm quality should expect managers in low-quality firms to occasionally mimic valuation signals otherwise associated with high-quality firms. Few papers have empirically validated this simple, well-established idea. As such, we consider open market share <b>repurchases,</b> a <b>transaction</b> long held in suspicion as lacking the credibility of a costly signal, and thus potentially susceptible to mimicking. No clean measure of managerial intent exists; program size and ex-post completion rates are ineffectual {{in the context of}} this transaction. Instead, we use earnings quality as a noisy proxy. Firms which aggressively employ discretionary accruals, particularly those which also show lagging stock performance, exhibit traits which suggest that executives may have been under pressure to boost stock prices. Using this measure, we ex-ante identify a set of firms which, while benefiting in the short-term from a buyback announcement, do not show the same improvement in post-announcement operating and stock performance otherwise observed. Consistent with simple notions of signaling theory, this evidence suggests that some open marke...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} five empirical essays using Swedish data. Three of {{the essays}} examine open market share repurchases, one essay investigates changes in investors’ shareholdings surrounding equity rights offerings (ROs), {{and the last}} essay investigates owner-managers’ equity portfolio choices. The first essay examines stock performance around initiation announcements of open market share repurchase programs, the price impact of repurchase trading and the long-run stock performance following the initiation announcements. The study uses a unique data set of initiation announcements and actual share repurchases conducted by firms listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange (SSE). The results show that initiation announcements of open market repurchase programs exhibit a 2 day abnormal return (AR) of 2 % on average. The price impact on the actual repurchase days is positively correlated with the daily repurchase volume, and is both statistically and economically significant during the first 3 repurchase days in a repurchase program. The long-run abnormal stock performance is positively associated with the fraction of shares bought in the program and is on average 7 % {{for the first year}} following the initiation announcement. The results indicate that repurchase trading provides price support and that the market participants detect and perceive the initiation announcement and the first repurchase days in a repurchase program as a signal of undervaluation. The second essay examines differences in the market performance of Swedish firms that initiate repurchase programs infrequently (1 - 2 programs), occasionally (3 - 4 programs) and frequently (5 or more programs) over the period 2000 - 2009. It is found that infrequent repurchase programs are greeted with a stronger positive reaction than occasional and frequent programs. However, over the long-term, infrequent repurchase programs show no AR while occasional and frequent repurchase programs show significant positive ARs. A positive relationship between AR and repurchase size is documented for all types of repurchase programs. The third essay examines the market liquidity impact of open market share repurchases in an electronic order-driven market. The study uses a detailed data set of daily <b>repurchase</b> <b>transactions</b> on the SSE together with intraday data on bid-ask spreads and order depths which enables an investigation of the liquidity effects on the actual repurchase days. It is found that repurchase trades inside the order-driven trading system contribute to market liquidity through narrower bid-ask spreads and deeper market depths. After controlling for trading volume, price and volatility, a significant decrease of the bid-ask spread on repurchase days relative to surrounding non-repurchase days is still found. However, repurchases executed as block trades outside the order-driven trading system have a detrimental effect on the bid-ask spread, consistent with a negative response to the presence of informed managerial trading. The fourth essay examines changes in equity ownership surrounding ROs by firms listed on the SSE. The results show that domestic individual investors on average reduce their shareholdings following rights issues, whereas domestic institutional investors and foreign investors increase their holdings. However, when ownership changes are adjusted with changes in ownership in matched non-issuing firms, it is documented that domestic institutions significantly increase their shareholdings in RO firms, whereas foreign investors decrease their holdings in these firms. A positive (negative) association between the 6 month benchmark adjusted return following the offering and the change in shareholdings by foreign investors (domestic institutional investors) is also documented. Finally, the fifth and last essay investigates how Swedish owner-managers (CEO or Chairman) invest in the Swedish stock market conditional on a major investment in their own firm. No evidence is found that owner-managers seek diversification benefits when they invest in other Swedish stocks. In general, they choose other stocks that show higher correlation among themselves than the average Swedish stocks. It is also found that owner-managers within high-tech industries invest significantly more of their total Swedish stock investments in IT stocks than owner-managers within other industries.

40|$|<b>Repurchase</b> {{agreement}} (repo) <b>transactions</b> {{are widely}} used as a risk-free means of borrowing or lending funds and securities. Repo transactions can be categorized into (1) general collateral (GC) repos that borrow or lend funds, and (2) special collateral (SC) repos that borrow or lend specific securities. GC repo rates are priced at a level close to the risk-free interest rate, while SC repo rates are often priced far below the GC repo rates. This paper aims to examine the pricing mechanism of the Japanese repo market from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. First, Duffie (1996) and Krishnamurthy (2001) show that (1) equilibrium in the repo market requires no-arbitrage profits from combining repo and cash bond transactions, (2) the equilibrium level of repo spreads between GC and SC repo rates is determined {{at the point where}} the supply and demand curves of the underlying bond issues intersect in the repo market, and (3) expected returns from future matched book trading are reflected in the cash prices of SC bond issues. Second, the paper empirically examines the above theoretical implications using the data of repo rates and government bond prices in Japan. Our empirical results show that, regarding the on-the- run and the cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) issues, the above no-arbitrage condition is significantly satisfied. ...|$|R
40|$|Following the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of March 3, 1951, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) {{focused on}} free {{reserves}} - {{the difference between}} excess reserves (reserve deposits in excess of reserve requirements) and borrowed reserves - as the touchstone of U. S. monetary policy. However, managing free reserves was problematic because highly variable and not readily predictable autonomous factors, including float, Treasury balances at Federal Reserve Banks, and currency {{in the hands of}} the public, induced comparable volatility and unpredictability in reserve deposits and hence in free reserves. Managing free reserves effectively required policy instruments that could inject and drain large quantities of reserves quickly at low transaction costs. This paper surveys the two leading policy instruments for reserves management: 1) open market purchases and sales of Treasury bills, and 2) <b>repurchase</b> agreements. Outright <b>transactions</b> in bills were specifically authorized by statute and used in unexceptional ways for managing reserves over relatively long periods, but they had significant drawbacks for short-term "in and out" operations when additional reserves were needed for only a few days. Repos, however, while not specifically authorized by statute, were ideally suited for in-and-out operations. The acceptance of repurchase agreements as an instrument of monetary policy, even in the face of active resistance by some FOMC members, illustrates how utility can sometimes trump concerns about statutory authority, equity, and need...|$|R

However, there is less agreement regarding repeatpurchasing effects. Promotion usage effects may exist in which repurchase rates are negativelyaffected by the fact that a promotion was used to make a purchase.

The empirical findings of our study show that price, quality and service are important factors for repurchasing, while the location of a business has an indifferent role. We further conclude that the customers appear to be loyal to the online discount websites and respectively, the benefits gained from these websites rather than the local merchants and businesses.

MONETARY AND ECONOMIC STUDIES/OCTOBER 2003 <b>Repurchase</b> agreement (repo) <b>transactions</b> are widely used as a risk-free means of borrowing or lending funds and securities. Repo transactions can be categorized into (1) general collateral (GC) repos that borrow or lend funds, and (2) special collateral (SC) repos that borrow or lend specific securities. GC repo rates are priced at a level close to the risk-free interest rate, while SC repo rates are often priced far below the GC repo rates. This paper aims to examine the pricing mechanism of the Japanese repo market from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. First, Duffie (1996) and Krishnamurthy (2001) show that (1) equilib-rium in the repo market requires no-arbitrage profits from combining repo and cash bond transactions, (2) the equilibrium level of repo spreads between GC and SC repo rates is determined {{at the point where the}} supply and demand curves of the underlying bond issues intersect in the repo market, and (3) expected returns from future matched book trading are reflected in the cash prices of SC bond issues. Second, the paper empirically examines the above theoretical impli-cations using the data of repo rates and government bond prices in Japan. Our empirical results show that, regarding the on-the-run and the cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) issues, the above no-arbitrage condition is significantly satisfied...|$|R
