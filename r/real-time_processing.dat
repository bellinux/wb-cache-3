25|$|Machine {{vision is}} the process of {{applying}} a range of technologies & methods to provide imaging-based automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., vision based robots and systems for vision based inspection or measurement. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that <b>real-time</b> <b>processing</b> is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.|$|E

In order to verify the validity and reliability of the system, this paper uses the Hyper Lynx software to carry on the simulation test for the system, and sets the IP and sub net mask of image real time processing to obtain the eye and timing diagram of <b>real-time</b> image <b>processing.</b> Finally, the system image processing performance results can be obtained by the joint debugging, the simulation test results can be seen that the speed of <b>real-time</b> image <b>processing</b> is quick, and the rate of correct recognition is high, which can satisfy the need of <b>real-time</b> image <b>processing,</b> to provide the technical reference for the design of real time image processing system...|$|R
