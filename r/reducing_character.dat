40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight liquid hydrocarbons from various sources, could have formed an oil layer covering the primeval ocean (present already 4. 0 - 4. 4 x 10 (9) yr ago), preventing water from evaporating into the atmosphere. Water from other sources, precipitated by cold traps at higher altitude in the atmosphere, becomes {{trapped in the}} ocean. In a thereby more dry and presumably reducing atmosphere (before 3. 9 x 10 (9) yr ago) even more hydrocarbons, as well as reactive molecules will form. An oil layer can possibly act as a dry solvent for reactions, where the reactive molecules can produce monomers and condensing agents. Monomers and eventual polymers formed could become strongly concentrated at the oil-water interface, favouring molecular interactions at high mobility and low dilution, without exposure to the destructive action of UV-light. Increased water leakiness of the oil layer due to accumulation of polar molecules within, would lead to photo-oxidation of liquid hydrocarbons, and subsequent emulsification at the oil-water interface, forming cellular structures. The atmosphere would then have lost its <b>reducing</b> <b>character...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{sorption}} kinetics of Mg 2 Ni alloys {{are strongly}} improved using two different surface treatments. One {{consists of the}} preparation of tailor-made Mg 2 Ni/C composites by ball-milling with previously ground carbons. The strong <b>reducing</b> <b>character</b> of carbon, allowing for the reduction of NiO initially present at the alloy surface, leads to the partial removal of the oxide layer that strongly hinders the hydrogen migration throughout the alloy surface on desorption, whereas resulting Ni particles act as catalysts during the absorption process. The second surface treatment deals with the deposition of Pd particles on the alloy surface using the polyol process. The catalytic effect of Pd is responsible for an important enhancement of the absorption kinetic, whereas Pd particles probably act as hydrogen pumps, during the desorption process, leading to a faster hydrogen release. By combining both techniques, desorption rates as high as 2. 7 wt% in 60 min and 2. 9 wt% in 30 min are obtained at 150 and 200 °C, respectively. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale plasma {{was created}} in {{molecular}} gases (CO, CO 2, N 2, H 2 O) and their mixtures by high-power laser-induced dielectric breakdown (LIDB). Compositions of the mixtures used are those suggested for the early earth’s atmosphere of neutral and/or mildly <b>reducing</b> <b>character.</b> Time-integrated optical spectra emitted from the laser spark have been measured and analyzed. The spectra of the plasma generated in the COcontaining mixtures are dominated by emission of both C 2 and CN radicals. A vibrational temperature of ∼ 10 4 K was determined according to an intensity distribution in a vibronic structure of the CN (B 2 Σ + u-X 2 Σ + g) violet band. For comparison, the NH 3 -CH 4 -H 2 -H 2 O mixture has been irradiated {{as a model of}} the strongly reducing version of the early earth’s atmosphere. In this mixture, excited CN seems to be significantly less abundant than C 2. The LIDB experiments were in the molecular gases carried out not only in the static cell but also using a large, double stream pulse jet (gas puff target) placed in the vacuum interaction chamber.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{exception to}} the welfare <b>reducing</b> <b>character</b> of protectionism {{is based on the}} optimum tariff argument. If in addition the market power {{can be traced back to}} control of a necessary, cero substitution natural resource type input, then the corresponding trade tax and the shadow price of the resource are on common ground, eventually the former is also an instrument for charging the latter. In the political economy context such an export tax is also a device for nationalizing the income stream the scenario promises; but also, once this revenue takes over a significant fraction of fiscal income the country’s Treasury may turn into a conservative force impeding tax innovations dictated by dwindling monopoly power. Specially so if government comes to display an agency type of behavior and the revenue reductions to be derived from the adaptation of the tariff to changing demand conditions concentrate in the present, meanwhile expected benefits of such an action extend into the future. Based on a simple analytical framework and exploring the issue with a set of simulations, the optimality of the export tax on nitrates is evaluated for its complete lifespan extending over half a century. Its nil capacity for adapting to changing conditions is then interpreted in terms of the assumed incentive structure of governments, but recognizing the inherent difficulties in predicting future market power and therefore of tax design. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Antique and Byzantine sediments of the {{northern}} harbor of Tyre (Lebanon) store high amounts of metals and metalloids {{as the result of}} a millennial anthropogenic contamination as well as of efficient trapping and immobilization processes. Geochemical and mineralogical analyses reveal the contrasted patterns for the accumulation of trace metal(loid) s in the sedimentary sequence recovered by coring the inner part, now emerged, of the ancient harbor. Lead, Sn, Cu and Ag concentrations can be as high as 3000, 150, 1000, and 1. 2 lg/g, respectively. Enrichment factors were calculated with respect to (1) Th and (2) the chemistry of the substratum and appear to be driven by anthropogenic inputs. Indeed, a drastic change in both excess concentrations and concentration ratios is observed through Roman and Byzantine times, pointing to major intensification of the trade and use of metals in Tyre, coherent with historical data. Good preservation of the archeological signal, despite (1) sediment disturbances that have caused age depth inversions, and (2) the large time lapse since the time of deposition of anthropogenic trace metal(loid) s is probably due to the <b>reducing</b> <b>character</b> of the sediments. Tyre's sedimentary sequence provides an interesting analog for modern carbonate-rich harbor environments, in which a millenary accumulation of trace metal(loid) s has been overall well preserved and suggests a restricted mobility of anthropogenic contamination for a period of time in excess of 1500 year...|$|E
40|$|Partial {{reduction}} of vanadia supported on silica-titania by NH 3 + NO {{has been studied}} by electrical conductance and ESR measurements. The relationship between electrical conductance and degree of reduction was determined by oxidative and reductive titrations of V(IV) and V(V) species leached from catalyst samples which {{had been reduced to}} different levels. In situ monitoring of the steady-state V(IV) ion concentration by electrical conductance during reduction with NH 3 + NO in the concentration range 0 - 600 ppm for each reactant in a 2 vol % O 2 /Ar carrier gas was performed. In a large excess of NH 3, the V(IV) ion concentration increased sharply with even small additions of NO. In a large excess of NO, the NH 3 + NO mixture exhibited first an oxidizing character, and the V(IV) ion concentration increased when P(NH 3) > 1 / 6 P(NO). The reaction order with respect to the NO concentration, determined from both the NO conversion and the initial rate of catalyst reduction in excess NH 3, was found to be less than unity. Determination of the stoichiometry of the reaction with respect to O 2 indicated that the gas-phase O 2 concentration required to balance the <b>reducing</b> <b>character</b> of NH 3 + NO mixtures on the surface was significantly higher than predicted by the balanced equation describing the reaction. ESR measurements on the catalyst detected V(IV) ions as vanadyl groups having two different coordination spheres.
