40|$|It is {{interesting}} {{to look at what}} kind of norm the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>to</b> Protect truly is and what the effect of the norm in practice truly is. In theory a norm that creates a responsibility for the international community to act when gross human rights violations occur sounds perfect. But, is the norm as perfect in practice as it is on paper? Is the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>to</b> Protect norm specifically created as a political instrument for states to call on so they have grounds to surpass the concept of state sovereignty? In the case that the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>to</b> Protect norm {{can be seen as a}} political instrument, is this out of humanitarian reasons or out of political motives? What are the consequences of a norm like the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>to</b> Protect in practice? These questions make clear that I’m curious about the purpose and the use of the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>to</b> Protect norm and for that I will look at different case studies. In these cases the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>to</b> Protect norm will be tested on usefulness to stop the violation of human rights. In order to establish the usefulness of the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>to</b> Protect norm I use four cases. Two prior to the official establishment of the norm, the Kosovo and Chechnya case. And, two case studies after the establishment of the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>to</b> Protect norm in order to see why the international community did or did not use the norm in these human rights crisis. These cases are: Libya (2011) and Syria (2012). I know it is very early to use Libya and Syria as case studies but they are already until this point in history very important to make my argument. In these cases the international community is involved in one way or another, but not always in the way intended by the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>to</b> Protect norm. This makes it interesting to see whether or not the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>to</b> Protect norm is just another hollow norm on paper, without any real effect in practice...|$|R
5|$|When Canada {{entered the}} First World War in 1914, the {{government}} became concerned that national security might be threatened, either by immigrants who still sympathised with {{their home countries}} in central Europe, or from citizens of the United States with German or Irish backgrounds crossing over the border.

Finally, Laurier proposed in 1905 that the mounted police should remain in the new provinces, under contract to the provincial authorities for $75,000 per year apiece – about one-third of the actual operational cost – a solution which was approved by both sides. The workload on the police grew quickly as a consequence, with the criminal cases being handled almost trebling between 1905 and 1912 to over 13,000. Despite complaints from Commissioner Perry, the government refused to increase the establishment of the mounted police. By 1913, the provinces were expressing dissatisfaction about the service being delivered, and Saskatchewan indicated its intention not to renew the contract in 1916.|$|E
40|$|This article {{argues that}} [...] {{contrary}} to {{the way that it}} is often framed [...] the first pillar of the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>to</b> Protect (RtoP) is not best understood as an instantiation of a broader international <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> protect human rights. Firstly, the RtoP reverts to a discourse of powerful savours and passive victims, which runs against advocates' claim that the RtoP is a 'rights-based norm'. Secondly, although it distinguishes between prevention and response, the RtoP is still fundamentally a discussion of retrospective <b>responsibility.</b> The <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> protect human rights, by contrast, is importantly prospective. The article's separation of prospective/retrospective responsibility from the <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> prevent and to respond is an independent contribution, with broader significance beyond the RtoP context.

5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance crew's <b>responsibilities</b> <b>to</b> their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts.

Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E

The Resolution 1973 was adopted as a result of Gaddafi?s manifest intention to exterminate the Libyan population. The Resolution authorised the member nations and regional organizations to use all measures necessary to protect all civilians in Libya. 2 Thereafter, the coalition of states went to Libya, under the pretext of <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> protect and protection of civilians, and as a result the Libyan leader was killed. The killing of Gaddafi generated wide controversy as a result of the manner in which the intervening forces implemented Resolution 1973. It is against this background that this research work investigates the applicability of <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> protect and the legality of the NATO intervention in Libya. In so doing, the research study examines the historical development and content of <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> protect, which was introduced in 2001 and adopted by the world leaders in 2005.
