There are numerous motives for which openings are kept. In this respect, an experimental investigation was planned and conducted on seven models of SBWOs. The initiative was to identify the maximum load behaviour, and deflection of steel beams with openings in the web. The performance of such beams has been considered only for vertical loads. Hot rolled steel beams of ISMB 100 with openings in the web were tested to failure. The beams were simply supported at the ends and subjected to a concentrated load applied at the mid-span. The openings considered in the experimental study are circular and rectangular only. All the beams were analysed by the finite element method by using general finite element analysis software ANSYS and the results were compared with those obtained experimentally. The test results found to be very useful for optimization of spacing-to-diameter ratio and aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings.</b> The finite element results for deformation and ultimate strength shows good agreement with the corresponding values observed in the experiments. At last, a parametric study was carried out using finite element method to examine that which type of openings gives best performance during loading.|$|E
30|$|The {{information}} available on beams with web openings {{does not cover}} optimum spacing-to-diameter ratio and aspect ratio which should be adopted safely without web-post failure. The present study is, therefore, concerned with SBWOs with varying the spacing-to-diameter ratio and aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings.</b> The dimension of openings such as diameter of openings, spacing of opening in case of circular openings and aspect ratio and fillet radius of corners in case of rectangular openings are taken from BS 5950 (2000) and SCI P 355 (2011). An experimental study on such beams is described herein and {{the results from the}} experiment are compared with those obtained from finite element analysis. The object of this study is of twofold. First, the experimental results are used to calibrate the finite element modelling of SBWOs using finite element analysis software ANSYS version 12. Secondly, the test results are expected to provide an understanding of the behaviour of these beams in general. Shear-dominated failure in the web post controls the behaviour of these beams. Failure modes, load–deflection behaviour and ultimate load-carrying capacity are considered in the present investigation. Finally, a parametric study was performed to see that which type of opening gives well performance during the application of loading.|$|E

Thus, the solar energy available can significantly raise the temperature of interior spaces and also result in an uncomfortable visual environment. External perforated solar screens have been used to control solar penetration through windows. Such screens can also serve a social function, that of maintaining privacy. This paper focuses on a special case of girls’ schools in Saudi Arabia, where the privacy issue is critical due to socio-cultural and religious beliefs. Windows in girls’ schools facing public spaces are typically covered by dark opaque film to maintain privacy. This window treatment results in overreliance on artificial lighting, and in a corresponding increase in energy use. The performance of screens can be affected by many parameters, namely: perforation rate, depth ratio, shape, reflectivity of colour, aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings.</b> This paper looks at how different Aspect ratios affect the performance of screens by simulating a range of cases of different aspect ratios, using the Daylight Dynamic Performance Metrics approach (DDPM). Results recommend using 1 : 1 aspect ratio for the south orientation whereas using different aspect ratios for the North and West orientations provide better daylight levels in the studied context...|$|E

40|$|Since it is {{a design}} {{criteria}} for road drainage and sewer systems, the infiltration performance of permeable concrete block pavement (CBP) is of important significance during the service {{life of a}} road construction. Due to the entrainment of mineral and organic fines into the pores of porous concrete blocks or into the aggregates used in joints or openings, the irreversible reduction of water permeability can be assumed. Research {{results show that the}} infiltration performance decreases in the order of the power to ten after a few years. These results are confirmed by in-situ field tests with a special infiltration-meter. This instrument measures the infiltration capacity in the laid condition with no disturbance and gives immediate results, taking into consideration local conditions such as age and traffic-load. The infiltration curves are shown as regression curves of the averaged infiltration values. These tests can be continuously repeated to observe the long-term performance. These tests show especially a significant relation between infiltration and age. The study states moreover that the long-term in-situ infiltration performance and its observed decrease depend from the grain size of the aggregates used for joint filling. It is furthermore partly induced by the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> of permeable pavements respectively the pore size of porous concrete blocks...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} macroscopic {{method is}} commonly used for wind-driven ventilation analysis of buildings with small openings. Consequently, {{it is reasonable to}} question if and under what conditions will this method provide accurate results in predicting ventilation flow rates in buildings with large openings. We investigate a single-zone cubic building with two equal large openings using a computational fluid dynamics approach. We analyzed the driving forces and the ventilation flow rates due to wind {{as a function of the}} geometry, size and relative location of the two openings. The ventilation flow rates are found to be affected by both wind flows around and through the building when the two openings are relatively large. The simplified macroscopic method can provide reasonable engineering accuracy (i. e., less than 10 % error) when the porosity of the building envelope does not exceed a critical value. This critical value is not a constant; instead it depends significantly on the degree of alignment between the wind direction and the character of the dominant stream tube associated with the flow through the room. We found that the simplified macroscopic method fails to provide acceptable accuracy when this stream tube is truly dominant and parallel to the wind direction. The effects of wall thickness and aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> are also investigated. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Un-reinforced masonry {{walls are}} {{commonly}} used as infills in reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. These build-ings have high in-plane stiffness and strength, and therefore, the lateral load behaviour of such RC frames is different {{than that of the}} frames without infill walls. Openings in walls significantly reduce the lateral strength and stiffness of RC frames, and alter their failure modes. Past researchers have tried to find out experimentally and analytically the influence of several parameters, like opening size and location, aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings,</b> connection between frame and infill wall, ductile detailing in frame members, material properties, failure modes, etc. on behavior of masonry infill RC frames. Ac-cordingly, several analytical models have been proposed in the literature and seismic codes of some countries to model the stiffness and strength properties of infill walls. Most of the past studies and seismic codes recommend modeling the infills as equivalent diagonal struts, and cross-sectional area of the struts are reduced appropriately to account for openings in the walls. Analytical methods have also been proposed to estimate the possible mode of failure and lateral load carrying ca-pacity of infill frames with and without openings. The current article is intended to review and compare past relevant stud-ies and seismic codes of different countries on in-plane lateral load behaviour and modeling approaches for masonry infill RC frames with openings. The comparative study may help designers and code developers in selecting and recommending suitable analytical models for estimating strength, stiffness, failure modes, and other properties of infill RC frames with openings...|$|E

40|$|Solar screens are {{typically}} {{used to control}} solar access into building spaces. They proved their usefulness in improving the daylighting and energy performance of buildings in the hot arid desert environments which are endowed with abundance of clear skies. The daylighting and energy performance of solar screens is affected by many parameters. These include screen perforation, depth, reflectivity and color, aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>openings,</b> shape, tilt angle and rotation. Changing some of these parameters can improve the daylighting performance drastically. However, this can result in increased energy consumption. A balanced solution must be sought, where acceptable daylighting performance would be achieved at minimum energy consumption. This paper aims at defining solar screen designs that achieve visual comfort {{and at the same}} time minimum energy consumption in residential desert settings. The study focused on the effect of changing the solar screen axial rotation and the aspect ratio of its openings under the desert clear-sky. The individual and combined effects of changing these parameters were studied. Results of this study demonstrated that a non-rotated solar screen that has wide horizontal openings (aspect ratio of 18 : 1) proved to be successful in the north and south orientations. Its performance in the east/west orientations was also superior. In contrast, the screen that was rotated along its vertical axis while having small size openings (aspect ratio of 1 : 1) proved to be more successful in the east/west orientations. Its performance in the north orientation was also good. These solutions enhanced daylighting performance, while maintaining the energy consumption at a minimum. Moreover, it was observed that combining two screen parameters which proved useful in previous studies on daylighting or thermal performance does not add up to better solutions. The combined solutions that were tested in this study did not prove successful in satisfying daylighting and thermal performance criteria at the same time. This study confirmed the results of previous publications on the usefulness of using solar screens in desert environments. Solar screens could significantly enhance daylighting performance and visual comfort. They provided 66 - 97 % "daylit" areas in the tested spaces. In addition, use of solar screens reduced energy consumption by up to 25 % in comparison with a non-screened window. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Knee joints, {{the beam}} column {{connections}} {{found at the}} roof level of a moment resisting frame buildings, are inherently different from conventional interior and exterior beam column connections {{in the way that}} forces from adjoining members are transferred into joint and then resisted by the joint. A knee connection has two distinct load resisting mechanisms, each for closing and opening actions acting simultaneously under reversed cyclic loading. In spite of many distinct differences in the behaviour of shear resistance in knee joints, there are no special design provisions in the major design codes available across the world due to lack of in-depth research on the knee connections. To understand the relative importance <b>of</b> <b>opening</b> and closing actions in design, it is imperative to study knee joints under varying shear stresses, especially at higher opening-to-closing shear stress ratios. Three knee joint specimens, under different input shear stresses, were designed to produce a varying <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> input <b>opening</b> to closing shear stresses. The design was carried out {{in such a way that}} the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> flexural strength of beams with consideration of axial forces in opening to closing actions are maintained at 0. 5, 0. 7, and 1. 0, thereby resulting in the required variation <b>of</b> <b>opening</b> to closing joint shear stress ratios among the specimens.

Several dozen data sets were collected in a hydraulic laboratory, each including the measurement of upstream and downstream water depth for five different gate openings, and 17 different steady-state discharges from 0. 02 to 0. 166 m 3 /s. Various approaches were tested to define the limits of the non-orifice-to-orifice regime transition; one of these uses the specific-energy equation for open-channel flow.

Videos were extracted and analysed semi-automatically using High-Speed Video Program, obtaining measures of fundamental frequency (f 0), open quotient and speed quotient. Post-hoc analyses of sound pressure level (SPL) were also performed (n = 19). Pearson’s correlations were calculated between SPL and both speed and open quotients. Results: Male radio performers had a significantly higher speed quotient than their matched controls (t = 3. 308, p = 0. 005). No significant differences were found for f 0 or open quotient. No significant correlation was found between either open or speed quotient with SPL. Discussion: A higher speed quotient in male radio performers suggests that their vocal fold vibration was characterised by a higher <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> glottal <b>opening</b> to closing times than controls. This result may explain findings of better voice quality, highe...|$|R
40|$|Trilayer {{graphene}} exhibits exceptional electronic {{properties that}} are of interest both for fundamental science and for technological applications. The ability to achieve a high on off current ratio is the central question in this field. Here, we propose a simple method to achieve a current on off <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> 104 by <b>opening</b> a transport gap in Bernal stacked trilayer graphene. We synthesized Bernal stacked trilayer graphene with self aligned periodic nanodomain boundaries NBs on the technologically relevant vicinal cubic SiC 001 substrate and performed electrical measurements. Our low temperature transport measurements clearly demonstrate that the self aligned periodic NBs can induce a charge transport gap greater than 1. 3 eV. More remarkably, the transport gap of amp; 8764; 0. 4 eV persists even at 100 K. Our results show the feasibility of creating new electronic nanostructures with high on off current ratios using graphene on cubic Si...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies to}} reduce the amount of {{potassium}} dichromate sample for X-ray fluorescent spectrography have been made on acryl sample holders with varying depth or diameter. No change in the Cr-Kα intensity with holders deeper than 0. 1 mm is noted, which is highly larger than the calculated criticel thickness of the potassium dichromate sample. Sample holders of 0. 96 mm in depth give the reproducible Cr-Kα intensity <b>ratio,</b> regardless <b>of</b> their <b>opening</b> area exposing to the exciting X-ray beam. With the sample holders of 0. 22 mm in depth, an available diameter must exceed 24 mm to minimize the effect of the Cr-Kα intensity reduction, as well as the variations of sample weight by packing on the holders. Size of the sample holder properly employed may be useful in X-ray fluorescence analysis. The least amount for potassium dichromate thus was fouund to be 0. 15 g in this study...|$|R
