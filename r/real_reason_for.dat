5|$|In 858, Bardas deposed patriarch Ignatios and {{appointed}} Photios, well-educated but a layman, in his stead. Later chronicles report that Ignatios had excluded Bardas from communion because he maintained an incestuous relationship {{with one of}} his daughters-in-law, but the <b>real</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Ignatios's deposition was probably the patriarch's staunch refusal to tonsure Empress Theodora against her will, as demanded by Bardas. The irregular elevation of Photios, however, riled with Pope Nicholas I, who refused to recognize it. Coupled with competition between Rome and Constantinople over their missionary activities in and jurisdiction over Moravia and Bulgaria, relations with the papacy remained tense.|$|E

5|$|The feud between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels also dated back to {{the fall}} of 1993. Jack Tunney {{announced}} that he was stripping Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough. There have been reports that the <b>real</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> vacating the title was because Michaels refused to drop the belt. Ramon won the title after competing in a battle royal and defeating Rick Martel, the other finalist in the match. In the angle, Michaels refused to acknowledge the title change, however, as he insisted that he was the true Intercontinental Champion. To gain revenge against Ramon for taking the belt, Michaels attacked Ramon and helped Irwin R. Schyster to steal Ramon's gold chains.|$|E

Yiu was arrested by police in Shenzhen on charges of falsely labelling and smuggling industrial chemicals worth $220,000 in 2010 and was sentenced to prison for 10 years allegedly for smuggling, even though the <b>real</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the trumped up charges, in the eyes of many, was China's increasing restrictions on political expression under Xi.

Colleen's <b>real</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> visiting her son is that she learned from her friend in Florida that Jack is dating Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), a recent divorcée, {{and a woman who}} happens to be Jack's high school sweetheart. During dinner, Colleen does not bring Nancy up, but tells Jack she knows about his involvement with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) after an awkward encounter between Avery and Jack in an elevator with Colleen present; because of the encounter, Colleen knows that Avery and Jack are sleeping together.

5|$|Anna {{appears in}} the fourth season of Once Upon a Time, with actress Elizabeth Lail portraying the character. Following {{the events of the}} film Frozen, Anna is {{preparing}} to wed Kristoff when Elsa finds a diary from their mother stating their <b>real</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> their parents' fatal trip. Determined to seek answers, Anna postpones her wedding and travels to the Enchanted Forest (known as Misthaven in Arendelle). Anna meets David, a friend of Kristoff's, and trains him in swordsmanship so he can defend his farm from the evil warlord Bo Peep. Following Bo Peep's defeat, David gives Anna his horse and David's mother gives Anna the name of Rumplestiltskin, a powerful wizard who she believes can give her the answers she is looking for. Anna visits Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) who tells her that the King and Queen of Arendelle came to him, and he will tell her what they said if she administers a potion to an old man. Anna is afraid the potion is poison and pours it into the old man's fire. She returns to Rumplestiltskin's lair and lies, saying she has given the man the potion, and quickly learns it was an antidote, not a poison. In not giving him the drink, Anna has broken her deal with Rumplestiltskin and subjected the man to turn into a mouse. The deal, when broken, meant that Anna had to be Rumplestiltskin's slave—but, alas, Anna gets control of the dagger that controls him, and orders him to never harm her or her sister, and to send her back home with Rumplestiltskin's weapon, a magic-stealing hat. Back in Arendelle, Anna admits to Kristoff that Rumplestiltskin told her that her parents were afraid of Elsa. She does not tell this to Elsa, but is shocked to see that Elsa is learning to control her power—due to a new woman by the name of Ingrid (Elizabeth Mitchell), who claims she is their mother's sister and also has magic snow powers like her sister Elsa. Anna never knew their mother had a sister, so she is immediately skeptical. She goes to meet Grand Pabbie and the rock trolls to find out if this is the truth. While purchasing supplies at Oaken's shop, Anna runs into Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and they become friends. Together, they journey to the rock trolls, where Anna learns that her mother had two sisters named Ingrid and Helga, but Grand Pabbie changed everyone's memory in all of Arendelle. On the return journey back to the castle, Anna and Belle run into Ingrid. Ingrid sees that Anna has Rumplestiltskin's magic-stealing hat and believes she will betray her, so she grabs hold of Anna and imprisons her. Ingrid tells Anna that she has nothing in common with either her or Elsa as she has no magic as they, and now Ingrid must replace her. Eventually, Anna reunites with her sister, helps Ingrid see the errors of her ways, and marries Kristoff.|$|E
