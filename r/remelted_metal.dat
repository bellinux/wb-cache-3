First he weighed out twenty parts of the ore, which, as we have said, resembled snuff. This, he remarked, contained about five-sixths of pure tin, the remaining one-sixth being dross. He mixed it with four parts of fine coal dust, or culm, and added a little borax--these last ingredients being intended to expedite the smelting process. This compound was put into a crucible, and subjected to the intense heat of a small furnace for about twenty minutes. At {{the end of that}} time, the agent seized the crucible with a pair of tongs, poured the metal into an iron mould, and threw away the dross. The little mass of tin thus produced was about four inches long, by half an inch broad, and of a dull bluish-grey colour. It was then put into an iron ladle and melted, as one would melt lead when about to cast bullets, but it was particularly noteworthy here, that a very slight heat was required. To extract the metal from the tin ore, a fierce heat, long applied, was necessary, but a slight heat, continued for a few minutes, sufficed to melt the metal. This <b>remelted</b> <b>metal</b> was poured into a stone mould, where it lay like a bright little pool of liquid silver.

40|$|Ancestor {{artefacts}} (objects of {{an earlier}} period, valued for their age and associations, which are retained into a later period) are normally identified by archaeologists owing {{to the difference between}} the date of the object and its context. These valued artefacts often demonstrate evidence of veneration (collection, cleaning and care). Recently, the importance of fragments in referencing an earlier object and its associations has been recognized (Chapman 2000), though the detection of such fragments, even when in significant contexts, presents a challenge to archaeologists. The first example of an ancestor object which no longer exists, even as fragments, but as <b>remelted</b> <b>metal,</b> is presented in this paper. This suggests that the material of which an artefact is composed may have significantly greater cultural meaning than previously proposed. Distinguishing such ancestor material from material recycled for economic benefit or its desirable physical characteristics presents a significant challenge to the archaeologist and archaeological scientist...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} of unconventional welding methods and influence of remelting {{in the quality of}} the welded joints of the 02 Cr 10 Ni 10 Mo 2 TiAl steel. Besides usual experimental techniques the correlation of the fracture toughness with other mechanical properties is used. Amount of residual stresses is observed using the neutron diffraction. There is possible to place the methods with high energy density among unconventional methods of fusion welding, especially both, plasma arc welding and electron beam welding, used in present work. In comparison these methods with conventional methods of fusion welding, the electron beam welding appears to be the most favourable process. The remelting ensures higher homogenity of the base metal and consequently results in the higher quality of welded joints. The most common vacuum remelting method had not introduced improvements into the desired increase of the mechanical properties. The electroslag remelting with the specially designed slag positively influenced the toughness and ductility of the experimental steel. This process also eliminated the difficulties of impurities segregation {{in the area of the}} edge and the heat affected zone. Thus, the quality of the welds is defined by the solidification process of the weld metal. In some cases, it is not possible to remove a sample to conduct a standard fracture touhgness test. Also the financial aspect and the experimental seriousness do not play negligible role. Accordingly it is not advantageous to state correlation of fracture toughness with additional mechanical properties. The predicted values of fracture toughness, calculated by the correlations coefficients, showed out good agreement with the experimental values. The level of residual stresses, in the both conducted welding methods, remains low below the allowable level. The electron beam welds are characterized by only the compressive stresses. In the case the plasma arc welding is used, the maximal tensile stresses are to 6 -times lowered. The results showed good usability of the both welding methods for welding of 02 Cr 10 Ni 10 Mo 2 TiAl steel grade. For the both, plasma arc and electron beam welding methods,it is necessary the optimization of welding parameters as well as improvement of the whole welding process, including the preparation of the welded constituents. The use of the electroslag <b>remelted</b> basic <b>metal</b> conducts to the increase in toughness and ductility of welds. The final distribution and reached level of the resudual stresses are in the case of electron beam welds extraordinary promising.

40|$|Context: Remelting {{previously}} cast {{base metal}} alloy can adversely affect the mechanical {{properties of the}} alloy and necessitates addition of new alloy. Aims: To study the effect of remelting different combinations of new and used cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy on its mechanical properties and microstructure. Materials and Methods: Using induction casting, 24 tensile test specimens were prepared for eight different combinations of new and used Co-Cr alloy. The test specimens were assessed for yield strength and percentage elongation. Microhardness was evaluated using Vickers′s hardness tester. The tensile testing was carried out on a 50 kN servo-hydraulic universal testing machine. Microstructure analysis was done using an optical photomicroscope on the fractured samples after acid etching. Statistical Analysis: The mean values (±standard deviation) and coefficient of variation were calculated. Student′s ′t′ test was used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was assumed at P=. 05. Results: The mean yield strength of eight different combination groups were as follows: group A: 849 MPa, group B 1 : 834 MPa, group B 2 : 915 MPa, group B 3 : 897 MPa, group C 1 : 874 MPa, group C 2 : 859 MPa, group D 1 : 845 MPa, and group D 2 : 834 MPa. The mean percentage elongation for the different groups were as follows: group A: 7 %, group B 1 : 7 %, group B 2 : 8 %, group B 3 : 7 %, group C 1 : 8 %, group C 2 : 7 %, group D 1 : 7 %, and group D 2 : 8 %. The mean hardness values were as follows: group A: 373 VHN, group B 1 : 373 VHN, group B 2 : 346 VHN, group B 3 : 346 VHN, group C 1 : 364 VHN, group C 2 : 343 VHN, group D 1 : 376 VHN, and group D 2 : 373 VHN. Conclusion: Repeated <b>remelting</b> of base <b>metal</b> alloy for dental casting without addition of new alloy can affect the mechanical properties of the alloy. Microstructure analysis shows deterioration upon remelting. However, the addition of 25 % and 50 % (by weight) of new alloy to the remelted alloy can bring about improvement both in mechanical properties and in microstructure...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the development}} of a simulation strategy is presented, which enables a detailed description of relevant regions to appropriately model the electroslag remelting process. One of the challenges is to ensure a sufficient efficiency of the numerical model {{so that it can be}} used to perform extensive parametric studies. This is achieved by combining multiple computational domains and coupling the simulation codes ANSYS FLUENT and ANSYS EMAG. Therefore the electroslag remelting process is divided into a droplet simulation and models that account for the fluid flow in the slag and fluid flow and solidification in the metal pool. The droplet simulation considers the multiphase flow and the interaction of fluid flow and magneto hydrodynamics to simulate the behavior of the metal droplets passing through the slag layer. The Lorentz force is the main driving force for the fluid flow established in the slag region, which causes the liquid metal film on the electrode’s bottom surface to be transported to the centerline. Therefore it was found that no metal droplets detach near the electrode’s edge. Instead they accumulate at a certain characteristic radius. Between this radius and the centerline metal droplets form and detach homogeneously. The fluid flow in the slag region is directed to the centerline near the electrode’s bottom surface, points downwards on the centerline, moves outwards near the phase boundary to the metal pool and is directed upwards at the surface of the copper mold. In the case of the smaller scale IME <b>remelting</b> plant, <b>metal</b> droplets only occur on the centerline. The steady state simulation of the electroslag remelting process developed during this work introduces a static phase boundary, which separates the slag and the metal region. The formulation of the static phase boundary drastically reduced the time required until convergence is achieved. The simulation model has been extensively validated by comparing the numerical results to experimentally gathered data for both the IME laboratory scale plant and the VDM industrial scale remelting unit. The numerical model has successfully been calibrated leading to a good agreement to the experimentally gathered data for all investigated geometries and process conditions. The validation has been done considering the local solidification rate as well as the pool geometry. Parametric studies indicate that the melting rate is the most important quantity that determines the pool geometry. Two freckle criteria by Valdés and Böttger were examined. The Valdés criterion suggested that freckles may form for a variety of process conditions and might even form in the ingot center. This is contradicted by the Böttger criterion, which states that no freckles should be found in any of the examined cases. As no freckles could be found in any of the examined ingots, Böttger’s criterion appears to be more reliable. This hypothesis is supported by both the more plausible freckle position and the increased risk for freckles caused by a melting rate fluctuation. The optical evaluation of the etched ingot slices is very important as it is used to reconstruct the shape of the liquidus isothermal line. For this purpose an automatic evaluation algorithm was created, that carries out this reconstruction by looking at the grain boundary orientation on slices. A camera equipped with a macro lens has been mounted on a driven traverse system that successively takes pictures of the entire slice. These pictures were then stitched together, resulting in a multi gigapixel image. It is now possible to zoom in on every position on the slice and to measure SDAS values. Therefore the SDAS can clearly be identified and each SDAS measurement is associated with the corresponding coordinates on the slice. This technique leads to an increased spatial resolution. The opinion on the correlation between SDAS and local solidification rate, however, is not unanimous in the literature sources. Interdendritic fluid flow simulations on a micro scale were performed based on the lattice Boltzmann method to determine the permeability perpendicular to the dendrites. The simulated permeability agrees very well with the calibrated permeability obtained from the remelting simulation. Besides using this permeability to validate the calibrated value, knowledge of the interdendritic permeability is required in Böttger’s freckle criterion. The influence of the copper mold’s base plate cooling on the process has also been investigated. It was found that its effect on the pool decreases quickly as the ingot grows. The influenced region gets even smaller as the melting rate is increased. Furthermore the electrode’s energy balance has been reviewed. It was concluded analytically and numerically that for a specific alloy the ratio between melting rate and electrode diameter is crucial to predicting a possible rise of the melting rate before entering the hot topping stage...|$|R
40|$|When <b>remelting</b> {{aluminium}} scrap, <b>metal</b> losses due to dross {{generation is}} a common problem. Reduction of these losses will give substantial economic and environmental benefits. Dross is generated when aluminium metal oxidizes and films of oxide envelope molten metal. When a cold metal object is immersed in a melt, {{the heat of the}} melt around this is transferred so rapidly into the object that a shell of melt often solidifies {{to the surface of the}} object. When scrap with low bulk density is charged to a melt, solidification of melt on the cold scrap prevents melt from entering the cavities in the bulk of the scrap, and the bulk density remains low. Thus the scrap tends to float on the melt surface. Submersion of this scrap is important to avoid oxidation and subsequent dross generation. One solution to this is to roll scrap to a strip and feed it into the melt. This system has been examined by studying feeding of a continuous, thin aluminium plate into molten aluminium. Also, the effect of lacquer was considered, as well as feeding the plate into a launder with melt flowing along the surface of the plate. An analytical, one-dimensional, steady-state model has been developed to describe the melting and the melting mechanisms. It is based on a shell solidifying on the plate surface and a gap introducing a thermal resistance 1 /hg between the shell and the plate. The thermal resistance 1 /hl of the boundary layer of the melt is included. Depending on these resistances, the initial temperature of the plate and the melt temperature, a shell will form, and the plate will penetrate a distance P into the melt before it melts away. An experimental apparatus was designed and constructed to feed aluminium plate from a coil into a melt bath at a specified velocity. The plate could be withdrawn rapidly to “freeze” the situation like it was below the melt surface. The penetration depth P of the plate could be measured and shell formation observed. More than 200 experiments were performed, and by comparing the penetration depth at different feeding velocities and melt temperatures to model predictions, the two heat-transfer coefficients hl and hg could be determined by curve fitting. They agree reasonably well with values found in the literature and calculated from boundary-layer theory. In a few experiments, the plate feeding was recorded on video tape, and the cross section of some plates was studied in a microscope. Feeding of somewhat thicker plates was also tried. This gave valuable background information for comparing the experiments to the model. We believe that snap-off of the plate due to low mechanical strength around the melting temperature may affect the measurement of the penetration depth of the plate. Attempts were also made to measure the temperature in the plate by attaching thermocouples to its surface. The obtained temperature profiles in the plate were compared to the model predictions, but the method needs improvement. A criterion for formation of a shell is formulated and tested against experimental observations. Qualitative agreement is achieved. Even if there is no shell formation, it seems that there will be an air film with thermal resistance 1 /hg. This indicates that the melting rate will be independent of whether a shell is formed or not. Two additional models with only one heat-transfer coefficient are also developed in order to challenge the main model. From this analysis it is found that the use of two heat-transfer coefficients is necessary to describe the system. The model should be of direct interest when feeding rolled scrap into molten aluminium. Improvement of the model can be attained by reconsidering the assumptions made, but then numerical methods must undoubtedly be applied. These new models should include the snap-off mechanism. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
