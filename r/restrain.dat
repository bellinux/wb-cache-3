40|$|A set D⊆ V of a graph G=(V,E) {{is called}} a <b>restrained</b> {{dominating}} set of G if every vertex not in D is adjacent to a vertex in D and to a vertex in V ∖ D. The Minimum <b>Restrained</b> Domination problem {{is to find a}} <b>restrained</b> dominating set of minimum cardinality. Given a graph G, and a positive integer k, the <b>Restrained</b> Domination Decision problem is to decide whether G has a <b>restrained</b> dominating set of cardinality a most k. The <b>Restrained</b> Domination Decision problem is known to be NP-complete for chordal graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this NP-completeness result by showing that the <b>Restrained</b> Domination Decision problem remains NP-complete for doubly chordal graphs, a subclass of chordal graphs. We also propose a polynomial time algorithm to solve the Minimum <b>Restrained</b> Domination problem in block graphs, a subclass of doubly chordal graphs. The <b>Restrained</b> Domination Decision problem is also known to be NP-complete for split graphs.

5000|$|In the US, {{each state}} {{has its own}} <b>restraining</b> order laws, {{but they tend to}} be divided into about four main types. Not every state will have every type of <b>restraining</b> order on the books. A {{domestic}} violence <b>restraining</b> order generally protects only parties deemed to be in some form of [...] "domestic" [...] relationship which may, depending on the statute, include a family, household, intimate, or sexual relationship. A sexual assault <b>restraining</b> order specifically protects a victim of sexual assault regardless of what relationship may or may not exist between petitioner and respondent. If her state has no sexual assault <b>restraining</b> order statute, she may still qualify for a domestic violence <b>restraining</b> order if the sexual assault occurred {{in the context of a}} domestic relationship or if the statute is written sufficiently broad. In such cases, sexual assault survivors can sometimes qualify for domestic violence <b>restraining</b> orders because any act of sexual intercourse between petitioner and respondent, even during rape, legally establishes the required sexually intimate relationship. Harassment and stalking <b>restraining</b> orders also generally do not require any specific relationship to exist or not exist between the parties, but also may not be available in all states. These types of <b>restraining</b> orders also generally require at least two instances of, respectively, harassment or stalking to qualify. [...] In many cases, one statute may cover more than one type of <b>restraining</b> order. For example, what is called a harassment <b>restraining</b> order in Wisconsin also specifically includes cases of sexual assault and stalking.|$|R
40|$|A robust {{finding in}} eating {{research}} is the so-called counterregulation in <b>restrained</b> eaters. This means that while normal subjects eat less during a taste test, after they consumed a preload, <b>restrained</b> eaters consume more.

This reactivity is experienced as craving and leads to an increased food intake. To test this theory, 46 high and low <b>restrained</b> eaters were exposed to food or soap, while physiological measurements were made. Afterwards, the subjects performed a taste test, during which food intake was secretly measured. Unrestrained eaters showed an increase in heart rate, gastric activity, and saliva during food exposure; however, <b>restrained</b> eaters did not.
