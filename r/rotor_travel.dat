25|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of <b>rotor</b> <b>travel.</b> Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals. At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade spring. Apex seals were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the trochoid chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle. Primary power transfer to the clutch and transmission is by duplex chain.|$|E
50|$|The main {{limitation}} of the helicopter is its low speed. There are several reasons a helicopter cannot fly {{as fast as a}} fixed-wing aircraft. When the helicopter is hovering, the outer tips of the <b>rotor</b> <b>travel</b> at a speed determined by the length of the blade and the rotational speed. In a moving helicopter, however, the speed of the blades relative to the air depends on the speed of the helicopter as well as on their rotational speed. The airspeed of the advancing rotor blade is much higher than that of the helicopter itself. It is possible for this blade to exceed the speed of sound, and thus produce vastly increased drag and vibration.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Overhead view of {{helicopter}} rotors. The <b>rotor</b> tips <b>travel</b> {{much faster}} than the inner sections, so produce more lift. (For {{the purposes of this}} article, the demarcated circular regions are irrelevant and should be ignored.) ...|$|R
50|$|There is iron (usually {{laminated}} steel cores made of sheet metal) {{between the}} rotor coils and teeth of iron between the stator coils {{in addition to}} black iron behind the stator coils. The gap between rotor and stator is also made as small as possible. All this is done to minimize magnetic reluctance of the magnetic circuit which the magnetic field created by the <b>rotor</b> coils <b>travels</b> through, something which is important for optimizing these machines.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{helicopter}} designs {{compensate for}} this by incorporating {{a certain degree}} of horizontal [...] "flap" [...] movement of the rotor blades. When flapping, a <b>rotor</b> blade will <b>travel</b> upward during its advance, creating a lesser angle of attack (AOA) and therefore lesser lift. When the blade retreats, the blade falls downward again, increasing the AOA and therefore generating greater lift.|$|R
50|$|A {{helicopter}} {{rotor blade}} is an aerofoil, acting like the wing on an aeroplane being driven {{through the air}} to create lift. In {{the case of a}} fixed-wing aircraft in normal flight, the entire wing travels forward through the air at the same speed. In the case of helicopter rotor blades, the tips of the blade travel very fast through the air while the parts near the <b>rotor</b> hub <b>travel</b> much more slowly. Because lift increases with speed, the outermost sections of the rotor blades generate more lift than those parts closer to the rotor hub. So a rotor blade is said to be an aysmmetric generator of lift, because of the difference in lift generated along its length.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of force tests on and air-flow surveys near PCA- 2 autogiro rotor in the NACA full-scale wind tunnel. The force tests were made at three pitch settings and several rotor speeds; the effect of fairing protuberances on the rotor blade was determined. Induced downwash and yaw angles were determined at low tip-speed ratios in a plane 1 1 / 2 feet above the path of the blade tips. The results show that the maximum l/d of the rotor cannot be appreciably increased by increasing the blade pitch angle above about 4. 5 degrees at the blade tip; that the protuberances on the blades cause more than 5 percent of the total rotor drag; and that the <b>rotor</b> center-of-pressure <b>travel</b> is very small...|$|R
40|$|In-flight {{and ground}} icing has {{historically}} posed {{a significant problem}} {{for all types of}} aircraft, and has been determined to be the cause of numerous accidents. Canadian airspace is especially hazardous as air temperatures are typically sub-zero, leading to ripe conditions for the onset of icing. Ice accretion on the leading edge and other areas of wings, fuselage, windows, engine inlets, and sensors degrade the aerodynamic form of the aircraft, and results in decreased lift and a higher stall velocity. Multiple solutions to this problem have been developed and applied to fixed-wing and, to a lesser extent, rotary aircraft. Most of these applications have shown promise and some have already seen limited service time. However, all current applications have considerable disadvantages, specifically in terms of weight and power requirements. Rotorcraft are known to be particularly sensitive to in-flight icing due to the large effective distance the <b>rotor</b> blades <b>travel</b> compared to the effective distance that any component of a fixedwing aircraft travels. The lift generated by the rotor blades is extremely sensitive to the effective shape of the blade itself; therefore, it is imperative that ice is either prevented from forming, or effectively removed once formed. The majority of today's civil and military helicopters certified to fly in icing conditions are equipped with electro-thermal ice protection systems. Due to their proven record of reliability, durability and effectiveness versus the complete spectrum of other de-icing technologies developed, electro-thermal de-icing remains the favored solution after decades of research and development. However, due to the weight and considerable power consumption demands of an electro-thermal system, alternate anti- and de-icing methods have been intensely studied. This paper summarizes the numerous anti-/de-icing methods that have been studied and/or applied to rotorcraft to replace the electro-thermal systems and explores the feasibility of using shape memory alloy actuated systems as a more efficient means of rotorcraft de-icing.
