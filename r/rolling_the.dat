5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. <b>Rolling</b> <b>the</b> aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} control <b>rolling</b> locomotion on <b>the</b> level ground with a biologically inspired hexapod robot. For controlling rolling locomotion, a controller which can compensate energy loss with <b>rolling</b> locomotion of <b>the</b> hexapod robot is designed based on its dynamic model. The dynamic model describes <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> locomotion which is limited to planar one by an assumption that the hexapod robot does not fall down while rolling and influences due to collision and contact with the ground, and it is applied for computing the mechanical energy of the hexapod robot and a plant for a numerical simulation. The numerical simulation of <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> locomotion on <b>the</b> level ground verifies {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed controller. The simulation results show that the hexapod robot can perform <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> locomotion with <b>the</b> proposed controller.

40|$|During {{operation}} in the sea the reactor natural circulation behaviors are affected by ship <b>rolling</b> motion. <b>The</b> development of an analysis code and the natural circulation behaviors of a reactor simulator under rolling motion are described in this paper. In <b>the</b> case of <b>rolling</b> motion, <b>the</b> primary coolant flow rates in the hot legs and heating channels oscillated periodically, and the amplitude of flow rate oscillation was {{in direct proportion to}} rolling amplitude, but in inverse proportion to <b>rolling</b> period. <b>The</b> total mass flow rate also oscillated with half <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> period, and <b>the</b> average total mass flow rate was less than that in steady state. In the natural circulation under a <b>rolling</b> motion, <b>the</b> flow rate oscillations in the hot legs were controlled by the tangential force; however, the mass flow rate oscillations in the total natural circulation and the heating channels were a result of the combined action of the change of inclination angle, flow resistance, and the extra force arising from <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> motion. <b>The</b> extra tangential force brought about intense flow rate oscillations in the hot legs, which resulted in increasing total flow resistance; however the extra centrifugal force played a role in increasing thermal driving head...|$|R
