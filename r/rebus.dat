5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Skene found and {{transcribed}} a 15th-century Gaelic manuscript {{which gave the}} genealogies of many Highland clans. He first published his transcriptions and translations {{of it in the}} early 19th century Collectanea de <b>Rebus</b> Albanicis, and later with revisions in the late 19th centuryin his chief work Celtic Scotland. Today the manuscript, which Skene named MS 1450 and later MS 1467, is stored in the National Library of Scotland. The manuscript was written by Dubhghall Albanach mac mhic Cathail, in 1467 at Ballybothy, Co Tipperary. The following is Skene's versions of the genealogy attributed to the chiefs of Clan Macfie in the manuscript; first as in Collectanea de <b>Rebus</b> Albanicis secondly as in Celtic Scotland.|$|E

5|$|According to Skene in Collectanea de <b>Rebus</b> Albanicis, the Donald first {{mentioned}} {{may be the}} Donald MacDuffie who {{is recorded}} as witnessing a charter by John, Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles in 1463. In Celtic Scotland, Skene thought it was possible the mentioned Duffie/Dubshithe was identical to the lector of Iona recorded in 1164 within the Irish annals.|$|E
5|$|Historian Marcin Kromer wrote De origine et <b>rebus</b> gestis Polonorum (On {{the origin}} and deeds of Poles) in 1555 and in 1577 Polonia, a {{treatise}} highly regarded in Europe. Marcin Bielski's Chronicle of the Whole World, a universal history, was written ca. 1550. The chronicle of Maciej Stryjkowski (1582) covered the history of Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|One year later, the Alliance hires Katarn again, {{this time}} to {{investigate}} an assault {{on one of their}} bases by a new type of Imperial soldier. His investigation reveals the Imperial Dark Trooper project, led by Human General Rom Mohc (Jack Angel). His mission to stop the project takes him to the sewers of Anoat City on planet Anoat, where he captures Moff <b>Rebus,</b> an Imperial weapons specialist Human who developed the Dark Trooper weapon. Rebus' interrogation leads Katarn to a weapons research facility in the mountains of Fest and the Gromas mines where minerals are extracted for the Dark Troopers.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s Scottish {{literature}} enjoyed {{another major}} revival, particularly {{associated with a}} group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum. Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail. In the 1990s major, prize-winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). These works were linked by a sometimes overtly political reaction to Thatcherism that explored marginal areas of experience and used vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots dialect). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid, Frederic Lindsay, Christopher Brookmyre, Quintin Jardine, Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector <b>Rebus</b> novels. This period also saw {{the emergence of a new}} generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson, Robert Crawford, Kathleen Jamie and Carol Ann Duffy. Glasgow-born Carol Ann Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{remained}} {{imprisoned in}} Ravenna for three years, until released in June/July 539 {{by the new}} Gothic king, Witigis, in exchange for Gothic envoys sent to Persia who had been captured by the Byzantines. As a reward for his services, Emperor Justinian then appointed Peter to the post of magister officiorum ("Master of the Offices"), {{one of the highest}} positions in the state, heading the palace secretariat, the imperial guards (the Scholae Palatinae), and the Public Post with the dreaded agentes in <b>rebus.</b> He would hold this post for 26 consecutive years, longer by a wide margin than any other before or after. At about the same time or shortly thereafter, he was raised to the supreme title of patrician and the supreme senatorial rank of gloriosissimus ("most glorious one"). He was also awarded an honorary consulship. As magister, he took part in the discussions with Western bishops in 548 on the Three-Chapter Controversy, and was repeatedly sent as an envoy in 551–553 to Pope Vigilius, who opposed the emperor on the issue. Peter is also recorded as attending the Second Council of Constantinople in May 553.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec {{writing has}} not been {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language {{in the way that}} the writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing was not meant to be read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as mnemonics (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used only for their sound values (i.e. used according to the <b>rebus</b> principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically in the same way that the Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this could be interpreted as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre-Columbian practice.|$|E
5|$|Under Abbot Edward Knowle (1306–1332), a major {{rebuilding}} of the Abbey church began despite financial problems. Between 1298 and 1332 {{the eastern part}} of the abbey church was rebuilt in the English Decorated Gothic style. He also rebuilt the cloisters, the canons' dining room, the King's Hall and the King's Chamber. The Black Death is likely to have affected the monastery and when William Coke became abbot in 1353 he obtained a papal bull from Pope Urban V to allow him ordain priests at a younger age to replace those who had died. Soon after the election of his successor, Henry Shellingford, in 1365 Edward III took control of the monsatery and made The 4th Baron Berkeley its commissioner to resolve the financial problems. In the late 14th and early 15th centuries Abbots Cernay and Daubeney restored the fortunes of the order, partly by obtaining the perpetual vicarage of several local parishes. These difficulties meant that little building work had been undertaken for nearly 100 years. However, in the mid-15th century, the number of Canons increased and the transept and central tower were constructed. Abbot John Newland, (1481–1515), also known as 'Nailheart' due to his <b>rebus</b> of a heart pierced by three nails, began the {{rebuilding of}} the nave, but it was incomplete at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. Newland also rebuilt the cloisters, the upper part of the Gatehouse, the canons' dormitory and dining room, and the Prior's Lodging (parts of which remained until 1884 as they were built into Minster House).|$|E
25|$|Returning to St Leonards, <b>Rebus</b> {{is confronted}} by his {{immediate}} superior, Chief Inspector Lauderdale, who demands <b>Rebus</b> surrender his car keys. <b>Rebus</b> realises that {{his colleagues have}} been tipped off about the gun. But worse is to come, as the gun {{turns out to be}} the same one used in the Central Hotel shooting five years ago. <b>Rebus</b> is suspended from duty.|$|E
25|$|The next day, <b>Rebus</b> {{learns that}} Eddie has {{disappeared}} {{after a night}} out. Pat Calder insists to <b>Rebus</b> that Eddie always returns home safely, despite his alcohol problem. Willie, the assistant chef, is of little help. <b>Rebus</b> suspects that Eddie may have been warned off, or worse. Meanwhile, Rebus's superiors are annoyed at the effort he is putting into the Central Hotel case. Undaunted, <b>Rebus</b> approaches Aengus Gibson, who admits being at the hotel {{on the night of}} the fire with Vanderhyde, but insists that he left hours before the fire actually began. <b>Rebus,</b> however, is suspicious. Later that night, <b>Rebus</b> meets up with Deek Torrance, and arranges to buy a handgun from him.|$|E
25|$|When <b>Rebus</b> returns home, he {{receives}} grim news about his brother, {{who has just}} been found hanging by his legs from the Forth Rail Bridge. Michael is in shock {{and has to be}} taken to hospital. Fearing for the safety of his brother, <b>Rebus</b> decides that he needs serious protection. Remembering Deek Torrance's words 'anything from a shag to a shooter', <b>Rebus</b> decides {{to get in touch with}} his old friend.|$|E
25|$|Mulling {{over the}} cases, <b>Rebus</b> visits a Catholic church and confesses {{to the priest}} that he has bought a gun. The priest advises him to throw it into the sea. <b>Rebus</b> decides to do just that.|$|E
25|$|The Black Book is a 1993 crime {{novel by}} Ian Rankin, the {{fifth of the}} Inspector <b>Rebus</b> novels. It is the first book to feature Siobhan Clarke and Morris Gerald Cafferty appears as a main character. It is also the first book where <b>Rebus</b> is based at St Leonards police station.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rebus</b> confronts Aengus Gibson, {{demanding}} {{to know what happened}} at the night of the fire, but is forced to leave by Aengus's father. Returning to Fife, <b>Rebus</b> visits a bookmaker owned by Eck Robertson, living under a false name. Eck says that Aengus shot Tam for cheating during the poker game.|$|E
25|$|Armed {{with two}} {{sketches}} of the Robertson brothers {{as they might}} appear today, <b>Rebus</b> visits several Cowdenbeath pubs, asking customers if they recognise them. He has little luck, although a drunk old gambler claims he recognises one of the pictures, causing <b>Rebus</b> to suspect {{that one of the}} brothers may be working as a bookmaker.|$|E

25|$|<b>Rebus</b> {{finds himself}} {{with a number of}} {{problems}} on his hands. His wayward brother, Michael, has returned to Edinburgh in need of accommodation - with only the box-room in Rebus's flat available. While out drinking, he meets an old army friend, Deek Torrance, who admits to being involved in shady activities, telling <b>Rebus</b> he can get his hands on 'anything from a shag to a shooter'. <b>Rebus</b> spends so long out with Deek that he misses dinner with his girlfriend, Doctor Patience Aitken. Furious, she locks him out of her flat, forcing him to sleep in his own flat, on the sofa.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} a night of {{arguments}} with Michael and the students, <b>Rebus</b> discusses Cafferty with Siobhan. Siobhan mentions the 'Bru-head Brothers', Tam and Eck Robertson, a pair of criminals who disappeared at around {{the same time as the}} Central fire. <b>Rebus</b> then realises that the one of the names in the Black Book refers to them, and another to Cafferty himself.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, while {{overseeing the}} dull minutiae of the Operation Moneybags surveillance, <b>Rebus</b> and Siobhan hear welcome news - Brian Holmes has recovered consciousness. While he cannot remember anything about his assailant, he does tell <b>Rebus</b> {{that the final}} name in the Black Book refers to Eddie Ringan, the chef of the Heartbreak Cafe, who told Brian about the poker game.|$|E

25|$|<b>Rebus</b> {{still has}} minor fire {{damage to his}} hair, {{from the end of}} Strip Jack.|$|E
25|$|With {{few options}} left open to him, <b>Rebus</b> decides {{to talk to}} Morris Gerald Cafferty at his {{upmarket}} home in Duddingston. The two men's mutual loathing results in a tense confrontation. While Cafferty reveals relatively little, he does admit that the Robertson Brothers {{used to work for}} him as 'general employees', but left his service years ago. As <b>Rebus</b> leaves, he is certain that Cafferty was behind the attack on Michael.|$|E
25|$|After {{attending}} Eddie Ringan's funeral, <b>Rebus</b> has {{a suspicion}} of what happened. After checking the reservations {{book for the}} Heartbreak Cafe, he finds out {{that none of the}} customers remember Willie making a scene and storming out. His suspicions confirmed, <b>Rebus</b> goes to Eddie and Pat's flat, and finds the still living Eddie Ringan hiding there. He and Pat had rendered Willie unconscious by forcing alcohol down his throat, and used his body to stage a suicide attempt. <b>Rebus</b> arrests Eddie, but while taking him back to the station, stops in front of Cafferty's mansion. Eddie is clearly terrified of Cafferty, and admits that he helped burn down the Central Hotel, after a blood-splattered Aengus Gibson ran into the hotel kitchens.|$|E

25|$|<b>Rebus</b> {{interviews}} Eddie Ringan, the Elvis enthusiast {{who owns}} the restaurant, and Pat Calder, Eddie's gay (and business) partner, but they prove to be of little help. Brian's girlfriend, Nell Stapleton, tells <b>Rebus</b> that Brian had a 'Black Book', a small notebook in which he kept interesting snippets of information. She suggests that Brian was attacked because of something in it. She also feels guilty, since she had argued with Brian just {{before he went to}} the restaurant.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} chapter, <b>Rebus</b> accuses Nell Stapleton {{of being the}} one who knocked Brian Holmes out. Although he doesn't have any evidence, he does note {{that she had a}} motive after the {{arguments}} she'd been having with Brian.|$|E

25|$|Dr Curt's {{examination}} of Eddie's badly burned body turns up some suspicious findings. The deceased's liver {{was in good}} condition, even though Eddie was a persistent heavy drinker.
