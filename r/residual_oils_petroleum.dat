40|$|Carbonated Water Flooding (CWF) is an {{enhanced}} oil recovery (EOR) method where an oil reservoir is flooded with water containing dissolved CO 2. It is being {{considered as a}} promising EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) method for maturing light and heavy oil fields. A numerical and experimental study of the CWF was conducted, focusing on the underlying physical phenomena. In MATLAB, a numerical model describing a 1 D CWF process was formulated assuming immiscible conditions. Modeling predictions have shown that in this simulator the oil swelling accounts for an increased oil production, together with a reduced <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> saturation. This reduced <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> saturation is the consequence of a reduced interfacial tension. However, {{the effect of this}} reduced <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> saturation should be studied thoroughly. In addition to the numerical model, core-flood experiments have been performed using Bentheimer sandstone and n-hexadecane to validate the model predictions. It was found that injecting water containing 3. 7 % CO 2 of the total mass of the aqueous phase reduces the <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> saturation from pure water flooding to about 12. 8. The experiment is performed with periods of injection and no injection, where an experiment with continuous injection would have provided more information about oil banking. The results of the experiment have been used to validate the model. From this validation it is deducted that either the <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> saturation is reduced if the CO 2 content in the oil phase is increased or there are errors in both the experiments and simulations.

30|$|Four typical {{types of}} <b>residual</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> trapped in dead ends, oil ganglia in pore throats, oil at pore corners and oil film adhered to pore walls, were studied. According to main pore {{structure}} characteristics and the fundamental morphological features of <b>residual</b> <b>oil,</b> four displacement models for <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> were proposed, in which pore-scale flow behavior of viscoelastic fluid was analyzed by a numerical method and micro-mechanisms for mobilization of <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> were discussed. Calculated {{results indicate that}} the viscoelastic effect enhances micro displacement efficiency and increases swept volume. For <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> trapped in dead ends, the flow field of viscoelastic fluid is developed in dead ends more deeply, resulting in more contact with oil by the displacing fluid, and consequently increasing swept volume. In addition, intense viscoelastic vortex has great stress, under which <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> becomes small oil ganglia, and finally be carried into main channels. For <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> at pore throats, its displacement mechanisms are similar to the oil trapped in dead ends. Vortices are developed {{in the depths of the}} throats and oil ganglia become smaller. Besides, viscoelastic fluid causes higher pressure drop on oil ganglia, as a driving force, which can overcome capillary force, consequently, flow direction can be changed and the displacing fluid enter smaller throats. For oil at pore corners, viscoelastic fluid can enhance displacement efficiency as a result of greater velocity and stress near the corners. For <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> adhered to pore wall, viscoelastic fluid can provide a greater displacing force on the interface between viscoelastic fluid and oil, thus, making it easier to exceed the minimum interfacial tension for mobilizing the oil film.|$|R

Of the two models used, one displayed a uniform a d the other one a more heterogeneous distribution of water flood <b>residual</b> <b>oil.</b> Mobilization of <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> proceeds by an imbibition-drainage mechanism where a surfactant imbibition displacement is always associated with a corresponding oil-water displacement (drainage) process.

Although the magnitude of the <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> saturation was similar for both models, microscopic sweep and recovery efficiency are found to be significantly higher when the <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> is uniformly distributed.

30|$|Thus, the mixed-wet system {{significantly}} trapped smaller {{amount of}} <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> compared to oil-wet system, {{which is consistent}} with Amott’s finding that extreme wettability results in high <b>residual</b> <b>oil,</b> whereas weakly water-wet conditions or slightly oil-wet conditions result in low <b>residual</b> <b>oil.</b> It may be that the mixed wet system trapped less <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> {{as a result of the}} oil-wet solid surface that allows the oil blobs that are close to each other to connect and form a continuous flow path. As such, an oil-wet solid surface prevents water from forming a continuous thin film, and prevents snap-off. Likewise, the oil trapped in the smaller pores is reduced as compared to an oil-wet system, because the small pores in a mixed-wettability system are water-filled Anderson (1987). According to Anderson (1987), as compared to the water-wet system, the mixed-wet system traps less oil because it traps less oil in the larger oil-wet pores. However, in this experiment, there was no significant difference between the percent oil trapping in mixed-wet (16.39  %) and water-wet systems (17.72  %). The <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> was as small as that of the water-wet system or perhaps even smaller, suggesting that global phase trapping in porous media (residual saturation) is sensitive to the wetting characteristics of the solid matrix. Moreover, the saturation history of oil might affect the amount of <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> trapped after the water injection, as the amount of oil saturation of the acrylic bead packs (91.68  %) was higher than that of mixed-bead packs (85.92  %), resulting in higher <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> saturation.|$|R
30|$|Nonetheless, Wang et al. (2000) {{have studied}} this issue {{extensively}} by evaluating {{the effectiveness of}} polymer flooding in displacing “residual oil” after water flooding at different conditions as follows. (1) <b>Residual</b> <b>oil</b> in “dead ends”; (2) <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> films on rock; (3) <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> in pore throats trapped by capillary forces; 4) <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> unswept in micro-scale heterogeneous portions of the porous media. In all cases, Wang et al. (2000) observed that <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> was reduced after polymer flooding. Xia et al. (2008 a) used a theoretical and an experimental approach to investigate {{the effect of the}} elastic characteristics of the driving fluid on the microscopic displacement efficiency. The results show that viscoelastic polymer solutions are efficient in displacing different types of <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> without even increasing the pressure gradient. In contrast, Huh and Pope (2008) pointed out that a tertiary polymer flooding did not reduce the water flooding <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> saturation in an homogeneous, water-wet Berea sandstone core and in Antolini core with small-scale heterogeneity, but a secondary polymer flooding did displace <b>oil</b> below the <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> saturation. Hou et al. (2009) observed the increase of microscopic displacement efficiency in a polymer flooding using an industrial CT system and argued that the essence of this phenomenon is that polymer flooding increases the oil/water mobility ratio and diverts the flow profile of the displacing fluid that causes the redistribution of oil saturation. The combination of the effects of diverted waterways and polymer viscoelasticity mobilizes and displaces the <b>residual</b> <b>oil.</b> Cheng et al. (2010) analyzed the distribution of <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> in the Daqing oil field after polymer flooding. They determined that the thickness of the volume of the reservoir contacted by polymer was increased by 21.4  % and that oil saturation was reduced to 11.9  % as compared to water flooding. The <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> saturation after polymer flooding in the Daqing oil field is mainly controlled by capillary forces. Chen et al. (2011) modeled polymer flooding from the Daqing oil field. In this work, the mechanism of polymer elasticity was introduced. The field production performance of polymer flooding was matched, and the results suggested that high concentration polymer flooding cannot only enhance volumetric sweep efficiency, but also increased microscopic displacement efficiency. Meybodi et al. (2011) used an image processing technique to analyze and compare microscopic and macroscopic displacement behaviors during polymer flooding in oil-wet and water-wet porous media. They concluded that a favorable microscopic displacement could enhance the macroscopic sweep efficiency in strongly water-wet medium, but in a strongly oil-wet medium, there are more factors that influence the microscopic displacement, front stability, and oil recovery.|$|R
