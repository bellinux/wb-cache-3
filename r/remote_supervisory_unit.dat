40|$|This paper {{examines}} how multinational corporations (MNCs) selectively assign <b>supervisory</b> responsibilities to <b>units</b> {{in countries with}} varying levels of institutional quality. Arbitraging across institutional contexts is an important function of MNCs, but it also creates coordination challenges. The choice of organization structure, such as the differential assignment of supervisory responsibilities, is an important tool for managing these coordination challenges. Using data on the business activities and supervision relationships within U. S. multinational manufacturers in 1996 - 2008, I find that frontline subsidiaries in countries with weaker institutions {{are more likely to}} be supervised by foreign rather than domestic <b>supervisory</b> <b>units.</b> Foreign supervision is even more likely when subsidiaries in weak-institution countries conduct activities that are more central to or interdependent with their parentsâ€™ global operations. These findings confirm that MNCs use differential supervision to enhance global coordination. The paper highlights one of the most unique features of MNCs: a multinational hierarchy that resides within firmâ€™s boundary but across national borders. It also connects MNCsâ€™ hierarchical structure with institutional imperfections that give rise to the emergence of the firm in the first place...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{attenuating}} unknown and possibly time-varying disturbances {{acting on a}} linear time-invariant dynamical system is addressed {{by means of an}} adaptive switching control approach. Given a family of pre-designed stabilizing controllers, a <b>supervisory</b> <b>unit</b> infers in real-time the potential behavior of each candidate controller and selects the one providing the best potential performance. To this aim, a set of test functionals is defined, which is shown to enjoy favorable inference properties under certain assumptions {{on the nature of the}} disturbances. Both persistent-memory and finite-memory test functionals are analyzed. Further, an implementation of the switching controller is proposed which always guarantees stability of the feedback loop, even if the disturbance characteristics are such that the switching is persistent.
