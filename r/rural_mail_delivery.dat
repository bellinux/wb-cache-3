25|$|David Ward King (October 27, 1857 – February 9, 1920) was an American {{farmer and}} {{inventor}} of the King road drag. His invention, which was the horse-drawn forerunner of the modern road grader, had a great influence on American life because his invention improved the widespread dirt roads of his day {{to the extent that}} they could accommodate the advent of the automobile, <b>rural</b> <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> and mail order catalogues.|$|E

2500|$|In 1851, Trollope {{was sent}} to England, charged with {{investigating}} and reorganising <b>rural</b> <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> in south-western England and south Wales.

2500|$|Many Model Ts were {{converted}} into vehicles which could travel across heavy snows with kits {{on the rear}} wheels (sometimes with an extra pair of rear-mounted wheels and two sets of continuous track to mount on the now-tandemed rear wheels, essentially making it a half-track) and skis replacing the front wheels. They were popular for <b>rural</b> <b>mail</b> <b>delivery</b> for a time. [...] The common name for these conversions of cars and small trucks was [...] "snowflyers". These vehicles were extremely popular in the northern reaches of Canada, where factories were set up to produce them.|$|E
2500|$|D. Ward King {{was widely}} admired in his day. Tributes came from everywhere. With the {{exception}} of the railroads, the better roads his invention brought about benefitted nearly everyone in a highly visible and totally obvious way. The [...] "before and after" [...] contrast was dramatic. In fact, the widespread use of the King Road Drag came along near the time Henry Ford started mass-producing automobiles. Solid roads meant people could use their clackety Model T automobiles, especially on the roads between cities. Solid rural roads also made possible reliable <b>rural</b> <b>mail</b> <b>delivery,</b> which did much to promote commerce in the United States between city based businesses and the rural population. For instance, it allowed Sears and Roebuck to start sending out its catalogues to small towns and farms and thereby vastly increase the size of its customer base.|$|E

50|$|The Timaru Herald has {{a history}} of {{technical}} innovation within the New Zealand newspaper industry. At the beginning of the 20th century it {{became one of the first}} New Zealand daily papers to replace hand-composed type with Linotype setting. In 1914 the company began New Zealand's first daily <b>rural</b> <b>mail</b> and newspaper <b>delivery</b> service. By 1957 the Timaru Herald was offering two-colour printing, and in 1988 the paper introduced direct copy entry by journalists. During the late 1980s it was the first newspaper in the South Pacific to employ fully computerised page layout and production systems. In 2005 printing moved to Guardian Print, of Ashburton. In April 2013 printing moved to Fairfax Print & Logistics at 14 Logistics Drive, Harewood, Christchurch.For a brief period in the 1920s the Herald was edited by John Hardcastle(1847-1927). He was a journalist with the Herald for about 40 years, but he was also a very keen amateur scientist who has subsequently gained fame for his studies on loess and is now seen as a significant pioneer in the study of palaeoclimatology.|$|R

50|$|Japanese used vehicle {{exporting}} {{is a large}} global business, as rigorous road {{tests and}} high depreciation make such vehicles worth very little (in Japan) after six years, and strict environmental laws make vehicle disposal expensive.

Some have even been exported to countries such as Peru, Paraguay, Russia, Burma, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates, {{despite the fact that}} these countries drive on the right.
