25|$|In {{the same}} way as one f-stop {{corresponds}} to a factor of two in light intensity, shutter speeds are arranged so that each setting differs in duration by a factor of approximately two from its neighbour. Opening up a lens by one stop allows twice as much light to fall on the film in a given period of time. Therefore, to have the same exposure at this larger aperture as at the previous aperture, the shutter would be opened for half as long (i.e., twice the speed). The film will respond equally to these equal amounts of light, since it has the property of reciprocity. This is less true for extremely long or short exposures, where we have <b>reciprocity</b> <b>failure.</b> Aperture, shutter speed, and film sensitivity are linked: for constant scene brightness, doubling the aperture area (one stop), halving the shutter speed (doubling the time open), or using a film twice as sensitive, has the same effect on the exposed image. For all practical purposes extreme accuracy is not required (mechanical shutter speeds were notoriously inaccurate as wear and lubrication varied, with no effect on exposure). It is not significant that aperture areas and shutter speeds do not vary by a factor of precisely two.|$|E

40|$|Hypersensitization using H 2 gas is {{the most}} recent {{addition}} to the techniques available to reduce the effects of low intensity <b>reciprocity</b> law <b>failure.</b> Because {{of the presence of}} addenda in all commercially available emulsions, the interactive effects of hydrogen sensitization with a common stabilizer (4 -methyl- 6 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 3 a, 7 -tetraazaindene) and a common form of chemical sensitization (Sulfur Sensitization) alone and together were investigated. A primitive, single jet emulsion was coated with and without the above addenda. Samples were paired and either treated to a hydrogen baking process at 65 Â°C for 20 minutes, or left untreated. Sensitometric exposures were made in a room air environment for 1000, 100, 10, 1, 0. 01, and 0. 001 seconds. The results of this research indicated that: for exposure times where low intensity <b>reciprocity</b> law <b>failure</b> is minimal, the speed increase with H 2 sensitization is only slight; sulfur and H 2 sensitization can be partially additive; and, H 2 sensitization tends to promote HIRF.

The previous tungsten lamp has been replaced with a tungsten-halogen lamp. Versatility has been added to the machine by introducing a xenon-flash lamp in the existing lamphouse.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of luminous density distribution in plasmas by densitomtric evaluation of pictures, taken with high speed image convertor- or rotating mirror cameras, {{suffers from the}} uncertainties in spectral response, sensitivity and <b>reciprocity</b> law <b>failure</b> of photographic emulsions. The time elapsed by film processing can often be troublesome. On the other hand, arrangements with multiple light pipes and photomultipliers give a good time but a poor space-resolution, moreover several oscilloscopes must be used. The videooutput signal of a shuttered TV - Camera System yields the luminous density distribution on the photocathode of the camera tube. Using a special line selector switch, we have measured up to 10 selected lines of a single exposure with one oscilloscope. The encouraging results of this technique, applied to several experiments in the Institute {{have led to the}} design of a new compact and versatile system. It consists of the TV - Camera, the shutterpulse generator and the recording unit. The latter comprises the multiple line oscilloscope and a cinescope with a flat faced picture tube of excellent geometry for recording purposes.

By use of Image Orthicon Camera Tubes with bialcali photocathodes a shutter efficiency of 10 $^{ 5 }$ was achieved, the sensitivity is 45 DIN (app. 16000 ASA).

40|$|The {{holographic}} {{reciprocity law}} for dichromated gelatin is investigated experimentally. The results obtained {{show that this}} law does not hold true for this material. Key words: Holography, recording materials, reciproc-ity law. The reciprocity law for a holographic recording material {{is a function of}} the total exposure E = I Ã t only and is independent of the magnitude of either irradiance I or exposure time t. 1 However, we see below that the reciproc-ity law does not hold true for exposures of high irradiance (short duration) and for exposures of low irradiance (long duration). This phenomenon is called reciprocity law fail-ure. Several authors have reported a <b>reciprocity</b> law <b>failure</b> for silver halide emulsions. 1, 2 For dichromated gelatin (DCG) Chang and Leonard found a significant change in holographic characteristics that were due to the effects of reciprocity. 3 DCG has high energy sensitivity in a spectral region in which no laser sources can be found, which makes it impossible to use the chromatic sensitivity of this recording material. Thus it is necessary to expose the plate of DCG for long periods of times. If we work with short wavelengths, in which DCG has more sensitivity, it is possible to prove that the DCG response is different because its diffraction effi-ciency for a fixed level of exposure has been modified. The effects of the reciprocity law on DCG were investi-gated by recording transmission holographic gratings at the same value of exposure but with different irradiances. Measurements of diffraction efficiency for these grating...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Individuals with bipolar {{disorder}} (BPD) exhibit motor, perceptual, and cognitive disturbances involving predominantly right hemisphere dysfunction. This asymmetry {{has been used}} to advance the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of {{bipolar disorder}} may be related to disturbances of the right cerebral hemisphere. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine hemispheric asymmetries in manic and depressed BPD. A secondary goal of the Study was to examine effects of psychotropic medications on blood Volume changes in the motor cortices. Methods: We studied 18 right-handed BPD and 13 right-handed normal healthy comparison subjects. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses in the primary motor area (M 1) and Supplementary motor area (SMA) of both hemispheres were elicited during reaction time (RT) tasks. Results: Healthy subjects activated the SMA in a reciprocal fashion with significantly greater activity in the left SMA for right hand trials and the right SMA for left hand trials. Depressed BPD subjects failed to show this normal <b>reciprocity</b> indicating a <b>failure</b> to Suppress unwanted activity in the ipsilateral right SMA, whereas manic BPD subjects failed to suppress unwanted ipsilateral SMA activity in both hemispheres. Manic and depressed BPD subjects exhibited greater activity in the left primary motor area suggesting increased cortical excitability. BPD subjects treated with antipsychotics or mood-stabilizing medications exhibited longer RTs, lower BOLD responses in M 1 and SMA, and a loss of normal hemispheric asymmetry in the SMA than untreated subjects. Conclusions: The presence of a right hemisphere disturbance in BPD is consistent with the hypothesis that the right hemisphere may be dominant in mood regulation. The presence of both left and right hemisphere disturbances in mania may explain the coexisting psychotic and affective symptoms observed in this condition...|$|R
50|$|A similar problem {{exists in}} holography. The total energy {{required}} when exposing holographic film using a {{continuous wave laser}} (i.e. for several seconds) is significantly less than the total energy required when exposing holographic film using a pulsed laser (i.e. around 20 - 40 nanoseconds) due to a <b>reciprocity</b> <b>failure.</b> It can also be caused by very long or very short exposures with a continuous wave laser. To try to offset the reduced brightness of the film due to <b>reciprocity</b> <b>failure,</b> a method called latensification can be used. This is usually done directly after the holographic exposure and using an incoherent light source (such as a 25-40 W light bulb). Exposing the holographic film to the light {{for a few seconds}} can increase the brightness of the hologram by an order of magnitude.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the large}} {{f-number}} of a pinhole camera, exposures will often encounter <b>reciprocity</b> <b>failure.</b> Once exposure time has exceeded about 1 second for film or 30 seconds for paper, one must compensate for the breakdown in linear response of the film/paper to intensity of illumination by using longer exposures.|$|E
50|$|While film cameras {{can suffer}} from <b>reciprocity</b> <b>failure</b> on long {{exposures}}, {{they can use}} little to no power when making them, while long exposures on digital cameras can be particularly power thirsty, so the lack of need for batteries when making extremely long exposures can give some advantage to film.|$|E

50|$|The {{reciprocity}} law specifies the total exposure, but {{the response of}} a photographic material to a constant total exposure may not remain constant for very long exposures in very faint light, such as photographing a starry sky, or very short exposures in very bright light, such as photographing the sun.

5000|$|The {{original}} Velvia (RVP) suffered {{much more}} from <b>reciprocity</b> <b>failure</b> {{than most other}} films. Exposing the film {{for as little as}} 16 seconds produced a color shift, typically to purple or green, depending on shooting conditions.

50|$|Exposure {{values in}} Table 2 are {{reasonable}} general guidelines, {{but they should}} be used with caution.

50|$|For example, {{for a given}} film, if a {{light meter}} {{indicates}} a required EV of 5 and the photographer sets the aperture to f/11, then ordinarily a 4-second exposure would be required; a reciprocity correction factor of 1.5 would require the exposure to be extended to 6 seconds for the same result. <b>Reciprocity</b> <b>failure</b> generally becomes significant at exposures of longer than about 1 sec for film, and above 30 sec for paper.|$|E
50|$|Although all camera {{settings}} {{with the}} same EV nominally give the same exposure, they do not necessarily give the same picture.

50|$|The true {{characteristic}} of most photographic emulsions is not actually linear (see sensitometry), {{but it is}} close enough over the exposure range of about 1 second to 1/1000 of a second.
