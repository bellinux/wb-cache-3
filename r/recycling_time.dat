40|$|A {{complete}} translation {{system has}} been assembled from pure initiation, elongation and termination factors as well as pure aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. In this system, ribosomes perform repeated rounds of translation of short synthetic mRNAs which allows the time per translational round (the <b>recycling</b> <b>time)</b> to be measured. The {{system has been}} used to study the influence of release factor RF 3 and of ribosome recycling factor RRF on the rate of recycling of ribosomes. In the absence of both RF 3 and RRF, the <b>recycling</b> <b>time</b> is approximately 40 s. This time is reduced to approximately 30 s by the addition of RF 3 alone and to approximately 15 s by the addition of RRF alone. When both RF 3 and RRF are added to the translation system, the <b>recycling</b> <b>time</b> drops to < 6 s. Release factor RF 3 is seen to promote RF 1 cycling between different ribosomes. The action of RRF is shown to depend on the concentration of elongation factor-G. Even in the presence of RRF, ribosomes do not leave the mRNA after termination, but translate the same mRNA several times. This shows that RRF does not actively eject mRNA from the terminating ribosome. It is proposed that terminating ribosomes become mobile on mRNA and ready to enter the next translation round only after two distinct steps, catalysed consecutively by RF 3 and RRF, which are slow in the absence of these factors...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} further our {{understanding}} of the global geochemical structure and mantle dynamics, a global isotopic data set of oceanic basalts was analyzed by Independent Component Analysis (ICA), a relatively new method of multivariate analysis. The data set consists of 2773 mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and 1515 ocean island basalts (OIB) with five isotopic ratios of Pb, Nd and Sr. The data set spatially covers the major oceans and enables us to compare the results with global geophysical observations. Three independent components (ICs) have been found, two of which are essentially identical to those previously found for basalts from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The two ICs (IC 1 and IC 2) span a compositional plane that accounts for 95. 7 % of the sample variance, while the third IC (IC 3) accounts for 3. 7 %. Based on the geochemical nature of ICs and a forward model concerning trace elemental and isotopic compositions, the origin of the ICs is discussed. IC 1 discriminates OIB from MORB, and may be related to elemental fractionation associated with melting and the subsequent radiogenic in growth with an average <b>recycling</b> <b>time</b> of 0. 8 to 2. 4 Ga. IC 2 tracks the regional provenance of both MORB and OIB and may be related to aqueous fluid-rock interaction and the subsequent radiogenic ingrowth with an average <b>recycling</b> <b>time</b> of 0. 3 to 0. 9 Ga. IC 3 fingerprints upper continental crustal material and its high value appears in limited geographical and tectonic settings. Variations in the melt component (IC 1) and in the aqueous fluid component (IC 2) inherited in the mantle most likely reflect mid-ocean ridge and subduction zone processes, respectively. Long-term accumulation of dense materials rich in the IC 1 melt component {{at the base of the}} convective mantle accounts for its longer <b>recycling</b> <b>time</b> with respect to that for less dense materials rich in the aqueous fluid component (IC 2).

The results indicated that the desulfurization ratio increased with increasing <b>recycling</b> <b>times</b> of electrolyte. In the meantime, the increase in <b>recycling</b> <b>times</b> has led to the decrease in pH value as well as the increase in Fe ion concentration in the electrolyte, which were the main reasons for the increase in the desulfurization ratio with increasing {{recycling of}} electrolyte. The pH value of electrolyte after second electrolysis was lower than 1. 5, and the desulfurization ratio increased obviously due to the increase in Fe 3 + concentration and suppression of jarosite formation.

However, with Ca 2 + addition, the cathode surface was covered by CaSO 4 center dot nH(2) O, thus resulting in the increase of cell voltage.

40|$|The {{physical}} processes that heat the solar corona and accelerate {{the solar wind}} remain unknown {{after many years of}} study. Some have suggested that the wind is driven by waves and turbulence in open magnetic flux tubes, and others have suggested that plasma is injected into the open tubes by magnetic reconnection with closed loops. In order to test the latter idea, we developed Monte Carlo simulations of the photospheric "magnetic carpet" and extrapolated the time-varying coronal field. These models were constructed for a range of different magnetic flux imbalance ratios. Completely balanced models represent quiet regions on the Sun and source regions of slow solar wind streams. Highly imbalanced models represent coronal holes and source regions of fast wind streams. The models agree with observed emergence rates, surface flux densities, and number distributions of magnetic elements. Despite having no imposed supergranular motions, a realistic network of magnetic "funnels" appeared spontaneously. We computed the rate at which closed field lines open up (i. e., <b>recycling</b> <b>times</b> for open flux), and we estimated the energy flux released in reconnection events involving the opening up of closed flux tubes. For quiet regions and mixed-polarity coronal holes, these energy fluxes were found to be much lower than required to accelerate the solar wind. For the most imbalanced coronal holes, the energy fluxes may be large enough to power the solar wind, but the <b>recycling</b> <b>times</b> are far longer than the time it takes the solar wind to accelerate into the low corona. Thus, it is unlikely that either the slow or fast solar wind is driven by reconnection and loop-opening processes in the magnetic carpet.

Some argue that it should not, since recycling efforts are to a large extent voluntary. We demonstrate that if the government can indirectly increase voluntary recycling efforts through appeals to the public or through similar means, then the use of these means does impose a cost on households. This cost can be higher or lower than the environmental gain resulting from the increased recycling. Norwegian data indicates a willingness to pay to let others take over the individual’s sorting of household waste corresponding to a cost of about USD 87 per tonne, which is significant compared to the total treatment costs.

All the Ag-TiO 2 and bare TiO 2 photocatalysts showed a decrease in photocatalytic activity on recycling for the DCA photodegradation reaction. The decrease in activity can be attributed to poisoning of active sites by Cl− anions formed during the photocatalytic DCA degradation. The photocatalytic activity was, however, easily recovered by a simple washing technique. The reversibility of the poisoning is taken as evidence to support the idea that the recycling of Ag-P 25 TiO 2 photocatalysts does not have a permanent negative effect on their photocatalytic performance for the degradation of DCA.

In this paper, we propose a computational model investigating the coupling of these fundamental processes {{within the context of}} spontaneous (i. e. unstimulated) cell migration. In the unstimulated cell, membrane oscillations originating from the interaction between passive hydrostatic pressure and contractility are sufficient to lead to the formation of adhesion spots. Cell contractility then leads to the maturation of these adhesion spots into focal adhesions. Due to active actin polymerization, which reinforces protrusion at the leading edge, the traction force required for cell translocation can be generated. Computational simulations first show that the model hypotheses allow one to reproduce the main features of fibroblast cell migration and established results on the biphasic aspect of the cell speed as a function of adhesion strength.

The Palladium Nanoparticles can be reused without loss of activity even after <b>recycling</b> four <b>times.</b> The palladium nanoparticles were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM). The present method also allows us to synthesize highly functionalized title com-pounds from simple and readily available inputs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fluids circulating in the extensive thrust-related quartz-bearing vein systems developed within the low-grade turbidite-dominated Early Paleozoic Robertson Bay Terrane of north Victoria Land, Antarctica. It provides a well-preserved example of fossil accretionary complex, {{developed during the}} Paleozoic subdution-related accretionary process at the paleo-Pacifica margin of Gondwana. Fluid inclusions are analysed in quartz crystals hosted within distinct generations of veins, which are interpreted to record the incremental deformation history during shortening and accretionary complex formation. Our data provides clues to the tectono-thermal history associated with orogenic complex formation, also providing inferences on the fluid storage and <b>recycling</b> through <b>time...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigates a 3 echelon recycling (or remanufacturing) {{supply chain}} where a push-based policy is adopted by all 3 players in their return loop. We {{focus on the}} impact of return yield and <b>recycling</b> process/remanufacturing lead <b>time</b> on the system dynamics performance. Two variables are studied, i. e. order rate and serviceable inventory. The result suggests that unlike pull-based system, in the push-based recycling/remanufacturing system, the higher return yield does not contribute to improve dynamics performance in terms of overshoot and risk of stock out when a unit step response as input. However, rationally allocating the return yield, i. e. the amount of used products, to each player in the RSC may help to get better overall performance of the SC. The impact of <b>recycling</b> process/remanufacturing lead <b>time,</b> Tr, is not as significant as return yield. The longer Tr leads to higher overshoot and longer time to recovery inventory, as well as more oscillation in upstream echelon...|$|R
