He based his account on specimens obtained from Jamaica, though no type specimens were designated. Subsequent authors moved this species to the genus Urolophus, {{and then to}} the genus Urobatis (some literature still refers to this species as Urolophus jamaicensis). Other common names used for this ray include the yellow-spotted ray, the <b>round</b> <b>ray,</b> and the maid ray.|$|E
25|$|In 1994–95, the Sharks {{earned their}} second-straight playoff berth and again reached the second <b>round.</b> <b>Ray</b> Whitney scored a goal in double {{overtime}} of Game 7 of the Conference Quarter-finals against the Calgary Flames. Key Sharks players included goaltender Arturs Irbe, defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh and forwards Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov. Despite their success against Calgary, round two {{would prove to}} be a disaster for the Sharks, when they lost in a four-game sweep to Detroit (in a rematch of the previous year) without even holding a single lead in all four games. However, the 1995 season also saw the only rainout {{in the history of the}} NHL, when the Guadalupe River flooded its banks in March 1995, making it impossible for anyone to get into the San Jose Arena for a game between the Sharks and the Red Wings.|$|E

25|$|Stingrays are a {{group of}} rays, which are {{cartilaginous}} fish related to sharks. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (<b>round</b> <b>rays),</b> Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays), and Myliobatidae (eagle rays).|$|R

Trygonoptera can be distinguished from Urolophus in that the outer rims of its nostrils are enlarged into broad, flattened lobes; the two also differ in aspects of the skeleton.|$|R

It is a small, common ray that feeds mostly on benthic invertebrates. On the beaches of southern California, it is responsible for numerous injuries to bathers, who are stung when they accidentally step on the fish. The wound caused by its venomous spine can be painful, but is non-fatal.|$|E

50|$|Urotrygonidae is {{a family}} of rays in the order Myliobatiformes, {{commonly}} referred to as the American round stingrays or <b>round</b> <b>rays.</b> They are native to the tropical and warm temperate marine waters of the Americas.

They have a round pectoral fin disk, a slender tail with a caudal fin, no dorsal fins, and a venomous tail spine.|$|R
50|$|Urotrygon aspidura or the Spiny-tail <b>Round</b> <b>Ray</b> is a {{stingray}} species {{native to}} the Eastern central and southeast Pacific and southern Baja and the Gulf of California. It can grow up to 42 cm. They are severely threatened by shrimp fisheries.|$|E

5000|$|Urolophus is a genus of <b>round</b> <b>rays</b> mostly {{native to}} the western Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, though one species occurs in the Pacific waters of the Mexican coast. Müller and Henle erected Urolophus in an 1837 issue of Bericht Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin. The name {{is derived from the}} Greek oura, meaning [...] "tail", and lophos, meaning [...] "crest". In Urolophus, the outer rims of the {{nostrils}} are not enlarged into lobes, but may form a small knob at the back.|$|R

5|$|The <b>round</b> ribbontail <b>ray</b> is not aggressive, and {{has been}} known to {{approach}} and investigate divers. However, if harassed it can inflict a severe wound with its venomous tail spine. This species has been responsible for at least one recorded fatality, of a diver who was stabbed while attempting to ride the <b>ray.</b> The <b>round</b> ribbontail <b>ray</b> is popular with ecotourist divers because of its size and spectacular appearance. Although displayed in public aquariums, it is not hardy and 81 days is the longest one has been kept in captivity.|$|R
