5000|$|Farmers {{have been}} using the network {{to buy and sell}} {{livestock}} as well as exchange veterinary tips. The web-based agriculture application called Haatbazar (local market) has facilitated increasingly diverse agriculture applications, including yak <b>raising,</b> <b>cheese</b> making, yak and cow cross-breeding farms, fisheries and vegetable farming.|$|R
50|$|The farming {{communities}} around the monastery were generally self-sufficient with only limited trade. Beginning in the 16th century this changed as they began raising livestock for export. In 1902 the Spiez-Zweisimmen railroad connected Därstetten with the Swiss rail network and the Därstetten and Weissenburg rail stations became village centers. Today the local economy is based on cattle <b>raising,</b> <b>cheese</b> making, forestry, small businesses and tourism.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{bases of}} the local economy are timber and agriculture. Cereals are grown, livestock is <b>raised</b> and <b>cheese</b> is produced.|$|R
50|$|People make {{a living}} by {{planting}} corn and beans and selling them on the market. Many people also sell rosquillas. Cattle is also <b>raised</b> and <b>cheese</b> and other products are sold.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2011, a NIS 125 million {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Tnuva, {{alleging that the}} company [...] "abused its {{position}} to <b>raise</b> cottage <b>cheese</b> prices by more than 40% between 2006 and 2011". The Israel Antitrust Authority also opened an investigation into Tnuva over alleged abuse of monopoly power.|$|R
5000|$|The San José Buenavista Hacienda {{was founded}} in the 16th century mostly for {{agricultural}} purposes. Later it added activities such as cattle <b>raising,</b> and <b>cheese</b> and butter making. This {{was the site of}} the first primary school for girls in Temoaya. Today, it can be rented for events with its main house and chapel able to accommodate hundreds of people. [...] Other haciendas and farms from the colonial era include Rancho de Cordero, and Rancho de Luna.|$|R
50|$|Nick and La La visit Cheese to {{negotiate}} Ziggy’s debt. Nick asks {{for the car}} back so that Ziggy can sell it to <b>raise</b> the money. <b>Cheese</b> offers another week and shows Nick that they have torched Ziggy’s car. La La drives Nick to give the bad news to Ziggy.|$|R
25|$|Sicily {{has long}} been noted for its fertile soil due to the {{volcanic}} eruptions {{in the past and}} present. The local agriculture is also helped by the pleasant climate of the island. The main agricultural products are wheat, citrons, oranges (Arancia Rossa di Sicilia IGP), lemons, tomatoes (Pomodoro di Pachino IGP), olives, olive oil, artichokes, Opuntia ficus-indica (Fico d'India dell'Etna DOP), almonds, grapes, pistachios (Pistacchio di Bronte DOP) and wine. Cattle and sheep are <b>raised.</b> The <b>cheese</b> productions are particularly important thanks to the Ragusano DOP and the Pecorino Siciliano DOP. Ragusa is noted for its honey (Miele Ibleo) and chocolate (Cioccolato di Modica IGP) productions.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2011, a {{class action}} was started alleging that [...] "Tnuva abused its {{position}} to <b>raise</b> cottage <b>cheese</b> prices by more than 40% between 2006 and 2011." [...] Prof. Avia Spivak and Dr. Meir Amir claimed that between 2009 and 2010, the price of cottage cheese increased 12% while its production cost decreased 4% leaving no doubt that Tnuva took advantage of its monopoly to repeatedly raised prices. The academics claimed this [...] "was unreasonable, not to mention immoral, and could be carried out only by a monopoly." [...] Witnesses for the company claimed the price changes were caused by increased retailer profit margins, an issue Spivak and Amir claimed could be resolved by publishing wholesale figures.|$|R
50|$|In 1866 Almanzo and Alexander {{purchased}} {{land from}} the First Baptist Church of Rushford, New York. They cut down trees and shaped the land into a working farm. Although a freeze destroyed their first wheat crop, the two brothers succeeded in making <b>cheese,</b> <b>raising</b> cattle and sheep, and growing wheat, potatoes, and apples. In 1875, the Gazetter and Business Directory recorded that Almanzo and Alexander were also the proprietors of a flouring mill.|$|R
5000|$|Carandaí {{lies on the}} {{important}} BR-040 highway, 35 km. north of Barbacena. The main economic activities are services, cattle <b>raising,</b> milk and <b>cheese</b> production, small transformation industries, and the growing of flowers, fruits, vegetables, corn, coffee, potatoes, and beans. In 2005 there were 3 financial institutions. In the health sector there were 12 clinics and one hospital with 51 beds (2005). In the educational sector there were 23 primary schools and 3 middle schools. There were 2 campuses of private {{institutions of higher learning}} with 168 students in 2005.|$|R
25|$|Starting in April 2005, she and {{her family}} spent a year making every effort to eat food {{produced}} as locally as possible. Living on their farm in rural Virginia, they grew much of their own food, and obtained most of the rest from their neighbors and other local farmers. Kingsolver, her husband and her elder daughter chronicled their experiences that year in the book Animal, Vegetable, Miracle. Although exceptions were made for staple ingredients which were not available locally, such as coffee and olive oil, the family grew vegetables, <b>raised</b> livestock, made <b>cheese</b> and preserved much of their harvest.|$|R
50|$|Zorthian and his wife, Dabney (March 21, 1933 - May 10, 2006), {{lived in}} a small pseudo-brick house on the ranch, well loved by friends as {{welcoming}} although very cluttered. The couple often preferred to sleep outdoors. They slaughtered their own livestock and made their own sausage, milked their own goats and made <b>cheese,</b> <b>raised</b> their own vegetables and gathered eggs from their chickens. As a young immigrant, Zorthian had been startled by how wasteful Americans seemed and vowed to recycle everything he could and to create his own self-sufficient environment, a trait he share with rival/fellow castle-builder Michael Rubel.|$|R

50|$|The {{lakes in}} this region are remarkably beautiful. The snow-covered Andes form a {{constant}} backdrop to vistas of clear blue or even turquoise waters, as at Todos los Santos Lake. The rivers that descend from the Andes rush over volcanic rocks, forming numerous white-water sections and waterfalls. The vegetation, including many ferns in the shady areas, is a lush green. Some sections still consist of old-growth forests, and in all seasons, but especially {{in the spring and}} summer, there are plenty of wildflowers and flowering trees. The pastures in the northernmost section, around Osorno, are well suited for <b>raising</b> cattle; milk, <b>cheese,</b> and butter are important products of that area. All kinds of berries grow in the area, some of which are exported, and freshwater farming of various species of trout and salmon has developed, with cultivators taking advantage of the abundant supply of clear running water. The lumber industry is also important. A number of tourists, mainly Chileans and Argentines, visit the area during the summer.|$|R
500|$|Before {{founding}} Beecher's, Dammeier {{had never}} made cheese, and had little direct knowledge of the cheese making business. His self-described [...] "passion" [...] for cheese began during his childhood in Tacoma, Washington, where his family always kept a cheese board piled high with local <b>cheeses.</b> <b>Raised</b> in a family business involving printing and food manufacturing, he decided to open a cheese business after his family sold the printing company. He named it for his great-grandfather, Beecher McKenzie. Dammeier also owns the Seattle-based specialty grocer Pasta & Co. and is a major investor in Pyramid Breweries, Inc.; {{other members of his}} family have stakes in Pyramid as well. Dammeier also founded Bennett's Pure Food Bistro on nearby Mercer Island, and the food truck Maximus/Minimus, both of which carry many dishes prepared with Beecher's products. In 2003, Dammeier opened Beecher's in Seattle's Pike Place Market when a rare large retail location became available in the market after the nursery Molbak's closed its Market location and moved to its current Woodinville, Washington property.|$|R
50|$|Although many lovely lakes can {{be found}} in the Andean and coastal regions of central Chile, the south (Sur de Chile) is {{definitely}} the country's most lacustrine area. Southern Chile stretches from below the Río Bío-Bío at about 37° south latitude to below Isla de Chiloé at about 43.4° south latitude. In this lake district of Chile, the valley between the Andes and the coastal range is closer to sea level, and the hundreds of rivers that descend from the Andes form lakes, some quite large, as they reach the lower elevations. They drain into the ocean through other rivers, some of which (principally the Calle-Calle River, which flows by the city of Valdivia) are the only ones in the whole country that are navigable for any stretch. The Central Valley's southernmost portion is submerged in the ocean and forms the Golfo de Ancud. Isla de Chiloé, with its rolling hills, is the last important elevation of the coastal range of mountains.The lakes in this region are remarkably beautiful. The snow-covered Andes form a constant backdrop to vistas of clear blue or even turquoise waters, as at Lago Todos los Santos. The rivers that descend from the Andes rush over volcanic rocks, forming numerous white-water sections and waterfalls. The vegetation, including many ferns in the shady areas, is a lush green.
