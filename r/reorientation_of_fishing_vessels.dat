The method used in this research is descriptive method that is featured a case study with Likert Scale and Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP) done to be data analyze. The results showed that only the Minister of Communications Decree No. KM 46 Year 1996 regarding Seaworthiness Certification <b>of</b> <b>Fishing</b> <b>Vessels</b> that discussed the safety <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels.</b> Implementation <b>of</b> regulations related to safety <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> in the Pekalongan Archipelago Fishing Port within 5 (five) years ranged between 69. 31 % - 73. 08 %, it indicates that the rate of application of relevant regulations on the safety <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> belonging to the Pekalongan Archipelago Fishing Port in both categories based on predefined criteria weighting.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of literatures and the data from {{stratified}} sampling <b>of</b> 160 <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> in the East Sea Region of China, the process of institutional transition of operational systems <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> in the region, which started from 1979, their present situation and performance were analysed in this paper. The results showed: (1) The operational systems <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> have undergone many transitions from planned economy system, through dual operational system dominated by centralized operation and supplemented by decentralized operation, proportional sharing system, all-round responsibility system, to shareholding cooperative system et al. (2) The survey shows the present operational systems <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> are: 58 % of them belong to shareholding cooperative system, 23 % belong to individual ownership system, the rest 9 %, 8 %, 1 %, 1 % belong to fishermen’s cooperative system, leasehold systems, company system and partnership system respectively. (3) This gradual market-oriented transition process {{is a process of}} privatization of property rights <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels.</b> Each step resulted in improvements of micro-efficiency to some extent. Specifically, the shareholding cooperative system, which was piloted in the middle eighties of the 20 th century and promoted in the large-scale in the middle nineties, well suited the economic development level <b>of</b> the <b>fishing</b> villages <b>of</b> that period, contributed to the breakthrough of financial limits of fishermen within relatively short period of time, made relatively clear the property rights <b>of</b> the <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels,</b> and promoted the rapid development of the fishery economy in this region.

This is especially true of trawlers. Because of high fuel consumption of trawlers, there has been considerable development in the use of large diameter propellers and nozzles and large reduction gears to improve efficiency.

40|$|Research PaperIn 2002, the {{offshore}} and coastal fisheries only account for 19. 9 % and 7. 3 %, respectively, {{of the total}} landing value. Since 1978, {{the offshore}} harvests follows a downward trend, but the number <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels,</b> the total vessel tonnage, and the total horsepower of vessels follow an steady increasing trend until 1992 when the overall restriction on the construction <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> was imposed. In {{order to maintain the}} sustainability of Taiwan’s offshore fisheries stocks and to avoid overfishing, the government has implemented a fisheries management policy which regulates harvests by suspending fishing licenses, restricting construction <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels,</b> and buying back used vessels {{in order to reduce the}} offshore fleet size. The most recent measure, announced on Dec. 24, 1991, which is still in effect, restricts the construction <b>of</b> all <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels,</b> except for <b>fish</b> transport <b>vessels</b> over 2, 000 tons. In addition, the government adopted two voluntary vessel buy back programs in order to reduce the fleet size in 1991 - 1995 and 2000 - 2004, respectively. This study tries to examine whether or not the current offshore fishing industry in Taiwan falls in a Pareto inferior situation with smaller output and higher price, such as shown in the upper part of the backward bending supply. By using annual offshore fisheries harvest and the total tonnage and horse power <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> for the period 1953 to 2002, this paper utilize the bioeconomic model present in Sun (1998) to simulate the backward bending supply curve under various fishing capacity. A suggestion will also be provided to show how to reduce the fishing effort to meet the goals of conservation and the viability <b>of</b> the <b>fishing</b> industry...|$|R
