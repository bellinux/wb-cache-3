Though Walter has the upper-hand, David <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> knife and defeats Walter, secretly assuming his identity. David escapes with the few survivors aboard a cargo lander, {{which is used to}} kill an Alien giving chase. Aboard Covenant, the ship's mainframe computer, MU/TH/UR, ("Mother"), informs the crew that an [...] "unidentified life form" [...] has stowed away. David coordinates with Daniels and the ship's pilot, Tennessee, to lead the Alien to the terraforming bay, where the creature is flushed into space. David helps Tennessee into cryosleep, followed by Daniels. Before Daniels goes to sleep, she mentions her dream about a cabin on the lake, which she had previously told Walter about. When David does not recognize her story, Daniels realizes who he is and panics, before David puts her into cryosleep. David regurgitates two embryos and stores them in cold storage next to the human embryos.

500|$|Genjurō meets a priest, {{who tells}} {{him to return to}} his loved ones or certain death awaits him. [...] When Genjurō {{mentions}} the noblewoman, the priest reveals that the noblewoman is dead and must be exorcised, and then invites Genjurō to his home where he paints Buddhist prayers on his body. Genjurō returns to the Kutsuki mansion. He admits that he is married, has a child and wishes to return home. Lady Wakasa will not let him go. She and her servant admit they are spirits, returned to this world so that Lady Wakasa, who was slain before she knew love, could experience its joys. They tell him to wash away the Buddhist symbols. Genjurō <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sword, throws himself out of the manor, and passes out. The next day, he is awakened by soldiers. [...] They accuse him of stealing the sword, but he denies it, saying it is from the Kutsuki mansion. [...] The soldiers laugh at him, saying the Kutsuki mansion was burned down over a month ago. Genjurō arises and finds the mansion he has lived in {{is nothing more than a}} pile of burnt wood. The soldiers confiscate his money, but because Shibata's army burned down the prison, they leave Genjurō in the rubble. He returns home by foot, searching for his wife.|$|E
500|$|When Bart {{reaches for}} the cupcakes and collapses, it is a parody of a scene in A Clockwork Orange, where the main {{character}} Alex <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> woman's breasts. The Duff clock is a parody of the [...] "It's a Small World" [...] clock. In the Duff TV advertisement, {{a group of women}} were leading an anti-sexism protest in front of the McMahon and Tate building, a reference to the advertising agency from Bewitched. The scene toward the end where Moe points toward individual customers declaring they will [...] "be back" [...] before pointing toward and addressing the viewer (later revealed to be Barney via a cutaway) is a parody {{of the end of the}} film Reefer Madness. The final scene, where Homer and Marge cycle into the distance while [...] "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" [...] plays is a reference to the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Homer's song [...] "It was a Very Good Beer" [...] is sung to the tune of the 1961 song [...] "It Was a Very Good Year"; one of its lyrics is Homer stating he stayed up and listened to the music of the British band Queen. Bart sitting in the chair, stroking the hamster is a reference to James Bond character Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who strokes a cat in his chair.|$|E

500|$|As {{the final}} verse {{of the song}} begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a {{stalking}} cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it {{over her shoulder and}} it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was and looks up at both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, [...] "Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind".|$|E
60|$|So {{the mother}} gets her cup of tea--and puts {{a piece of}} lemon in--and then milk on top of that. The rabbit boy sucks an orange, slobbers in the tea, insists on coffee and milk, tries a piece of lemon, and gets a biscuit. The baby, with weird faces, chews pieces of lemon: and drops them in the family cup: and fishes them out with a little sugar, and dribbles them {{across the table to}} her mouth, throws them away and <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new sour piece. They all think it humorous and adorable. Arrives the milk, to be treated as another loving cup, mingled with orange, lemon, sugar, tea, biscuit, chocolate, and cake. Father, mother, and elder brother partake of nothing, they haven't the stomach. But they are charmed, of course, by the pretty pranks and messes of the infants. They have {{extraordinary}} amiable patience, and find the young ones a perpetual source of charming amusement. They look at one another, the elder ones, and laugh and comment, while the two young ones mix themselves and the table into a lemon-milk-orange-tea-sugar-biscuit-cake-chocolate mess. This inordinate Italian amiable patience with their young monkeys is astonishing. It makes the monkeys more monkey-like, and self-conscious incredibly, so that a baby has all the tricks of a Babylonian harlot, making eyes and trying new pranks. Till at last one sees the southern Holy Family as an unholy triad of imbecility.|$|E
