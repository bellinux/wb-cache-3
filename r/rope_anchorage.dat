40|$|Summary. [...] Experiments {{were carried}} out {{in order to measure}} the effect of the tension waves which are induced in an arresting gear rope system after engagement, and to try out means of suppressing these waves with a view to {{application}} to projected arresting gears suitable, for entry speeds of up to 120 and 150 knots. Rope tensions were recorded for a series of tests covering a range of entry speeds up to 117 knots with a test vehicle weight of 5, 400 lb. and up to 151 knots at a weight of 2, 450 lb. It is shown that the amplitude of the tension waves becomes relatively greater with increase of entry speed and reaches very serious proportions at the maximum speeds obtained. The use of resilient <b>rope</b> <b>anchorages</b> has resulted in the suppression of the tension waves to a large extent, reductions in peak tensions of up to 30 per cent under some conditions having been achieved. 1. Introduction. [...] Theoretical investigation 1, together with limited experimental evidence 2, has shown that tension waves are induced in an arresting gear rope immediately following engagement and that these waves may be multiplied by reflection. This results in instantaneous rope tensions considerably greater than is indicated by the standard method of estimating arresting gear characteristics in which an inextensible rope is assumed. The amplitude of these tension wave...|$|R
