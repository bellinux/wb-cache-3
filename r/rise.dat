5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding <b>rise</b> in value {{for at least}} one other currency. The corresponding <b>rise</b> will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting <b>rise</b> for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small <b>rise</b> in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, the <b>rise</b> {{of slavery}} {{was due to}} the {{increasing}} <b>rise</b> of crops being produced and traded, more specifically the <b>rise</b> of the plantation economy The <b>rise</b> of the plantations was the main reason for the trade of commodities during proto-globalization. Plantations were used by the exporting countries (mainly America) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy. Commodities that grew in trade due to the plantation economy were mainly tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and rubber.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{say that}} if the {{government}} goes for the top of this range inflation could <b>rise</b> up to 40% through the economy.

5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon. The telencephalon gives <b>rise</b> to the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The diencephalon gives <b>rise</b> to the thalamus and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon gives <b>rise</b> to the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon gives <b>rise</b> to the medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{criterion}} which can predict trajectories during sit-to-stand (STS) movement. Three types of <b>rising</b> movements from the chair, i. e., upright, natural, and leaning-forward <b>rising,</b> were measured for five subjects. The trajectories of the center of mass (COM) predicted by the minimum torque-change model, rather than the minimum jerk model, resemble the measured movements in all <b>rising</b> patterns. The upright <b>rising</b> required greater extension torque of the knee and ankle joints at seat-off. The leaning-forward <b>rising</b> required greater extension hip torque than the natural and upright <b>rising</b> conditions. Natural <b>rising</b> movement might be a result of dynamic optimization...|$|R
