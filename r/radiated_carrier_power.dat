To maintain a noise floor of 110 dB below the <b>carrier</b> <b>power,</b> i.e., CNR, a minimum <b>carrier</b> <b>power</b> is required.

50|$|A {{mobile handset}} which {{is moving in}} a cell will record a signal {{strength}} that varies. Signal strength is subject to slow fading, fast fading and interference from other signals, resulting in degradation of the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I). A high C/I ratio yields quality communication. A good C/I ratio is achieved in cellular systems by using optimum power levels through the power control of most links. When <b>carrier</b> <b>power</b> is too high, excessive interference is created, degrading the C/I ratio for other traffic and reducing the traffic capacity of the radio subsystem. When <b>carrier</b> <b>power</b> is too low, C/I is too low and QoS targets are not met.|$|R

50|$|The {{ratio of}} {{power of the}} analog signal to the digital signal was {{initially}} standardized at 100:1 (-20 dBc), making the digital signal 1% of the analog <b>carrier</b> <b>power.</b> Unlike with subcarriers, where the total baseband modulation is reduced, there is no reduction to the analog <b>carrier</b> <b>power.</b> The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) requested a 10 dB (10×) increase in the digital signal from the FCC. This equates to an increase to 10% of the analog <b>carrier</b> <b>power,</b> but no decrease in the analog signal. This was shown to reduce analog coverage because of interference, but results in a dramatic improvement in digital coverage. Other levels were also tested, including a 6 dB or fourfold increase to 4% (−14dBc or 25:1). National Public Radio was opposed to any increase because {{it is likely to}} increase interference to their member stations, particularly to their broadcast translators, which are secondary and therefore left unprotected from such interference. Other broadcasters are also opposed (or indifferent), as increasing power would require expensive changes in equipment for many, and the already-expensive system has so far given them no benefit.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / May 18 - 20, 1965 / Sheraton Park Hotel, Washington DCThe {{advantages}} of the DSB-AM subcarrier for wideband telemetry requirements have been discussed in previous papers. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to consider the specific performance of an FM telemetry r-f link when modulated by a frequency multiplex of DSB subcarriers. The performance is evaluated by constructing an appropriate model of the subcarrier multiplex based on a predicted noise power spectrum at the r-f demodulator output. The model is used to specify the individual subcarrier amplitude values that constitute the baseband signal, which will modulate the FM transmitter. The <b>carrier</b> <b>power</b> required to produce a useful signal-to-noise ratio at the outputs of the individual subcarrier demodulators is considered in general. The relationship between the degree of transmitter deviation, receiver bandwidth and the <b>carrier</b> <b>power</b> is derived. The <b>carrier</b> <b>power</b> required for operation over typical test range distances is determined in terms of the appropriate variables. The performance of two specific examples is calculated to illustrate the use of the several formulae that are derived. The examples also serve to relate and compare the performance of the DSB system configurations to the more traditional applications. Finally, the advantage of using increased r-f bandwidth is discussed...|$|R
50|$|However, many {{modulation}} schemes {{make this}} simple approach impractical because most signal power {{is devoted to}} modulation—where the information is present—and not to the carrier frequency. Reducing the <b>carrier</b> <b>power</b> results in greater transmitter efficiency. Different methods must be employed to recover the carrier in these conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of negative modulation in later systems simplified the problem because peak <b>carrier</b> <b>power</b> represented sync pulses (which were always {{guaranteed to be}} present).
