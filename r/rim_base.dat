50|$|Most alloy {{wheels are}} {{manufactured}} using casting, {{but some are}} forged. Forged wheels are usually lighter, stronger, but much more expensive than cast wheels. There {{are two types of}} forged wheels: one piece and modular. Modular forged wheels may feature two- or three-piece design. Typical multi-piece wheels consist of the inner <b>rim</b> <b>base,</b> outer rim lip and wheel center piece with openings for lug nuts. All parts of a modular wheel are held with bolts.

An absorption volume i. e. air volume (6), is integrated into the rim, and an external profile is provided for mounting the tire on the <b>rim</b> <b>base,</b> so that bumps are not externally provided in an inner circumferential edge (2) and an outer circumferential edge (3) of the <b>rim</b> <b>base.</b> A micro-perforation is provided in the <b>rim</b> <b>base,</b> and absorption volume is provided on a side that is turned away from a tire cavity. The absorption volume is partitioned along a circumference by bars. USE - Sound absorber i. e. micro-perforated sound absorber, for vehicle wheels. ADVANTAGE - The external profile is provided for mounting the tire on the rim, so that the bumps are not externally provided in the edge areas of the rim, thus ensuring easy mounting of the tire on the rim. The bumps are designed in a manner such that the bumps can stabilize the installed tire on the rim and prevent slipping of the tire.

40|$|In this research, {{experimental}} and numerical methods {{were used to}} analyse the performance of multi-piece wheel structures and two proposed innovative designs to enhance safety were validated by computer simulations. Fatality report analyses revealed that the majority (90 %) of the multi-piece wheel failures were caused by use of lock rings. Experimental tire and <b>rim</b> <b>base</b> tests were conducted to understand the deflection characteristics of off-the-road tires and to validate the finite element model of a five-piece wheel/tire (sized 29. 5 - 29) assembly. A linear relationship {{was found between the}} vertical displacement of the wheel and the maximum lateral deflection of the tire for both static and quasi static loading tests. A robust tire model was validated with an average accumulative error of 9. 7 % and an average validation metric of 0. 96 for tire deflections, compared to the experimental tests. The <b>rim</b> <b>base</b> model was validated with an average error of 7. 6 % and an average validation metric of 0. 93 for wheel deformations, and an average accumulative error of 12. 7 % and an average validation metric of 0. 88 for strains, compared to experimental tests. Based on validated FE model of the five-piece wheel/tire assembly, geometry degradation (material wear out at critical regions) and material degradation (fatigue and corrosion) were studied to estimate their effects on fatigue lives. Two design innovations were proposed to enhance safety and fatigue life of the five-piece wheel. The threaded-connection design reduced the possibility of failure due to the mismatched wheel components. The BS band pull-out simulation revealed that the threaded-connection design was twice as strong as the conventional five-piece design in holding wheel components and the tire together, and the wheel may fail in a safer mode. The fatigue lives of the <b>rim</b> <b>base</b> were two orders of magnitude higher than those of the conventional five-piece wheel. The two-piece wheel design completely removed the possibility of wheel failure due to mismatched wheel components; the fatigue lives were increased by over two orders of magnitude, compared to the conventional five-piece wheel...|$|E
40|$|Multi-piece wheels or rims used {{on large}} {{vehicles}} such as trucks, tractors, trailers, buses and off-road machines {{have often been}} known for their dangerous properties {{because of the large}} number of catastrophic accidents involving them. The main causes for these accidents range from dislocation of the rim components in the assembly, mismatch of the components, manufacturing tolerances, corrosion of components to tires. A finite element analysis of a two-piece rim design similar to one manufactured by some of the prominent rim manufacturers in the USA is undertaken. A linear static deformation analysis is performed with the appropriate loading and boundary conditions. The dislocation of the side ring with respect to the <b>rim</b> <b>base</b> and its original designer intent position is established using simulation results from ANSYS and actual rim failure cases. Reliability of the multi-piece rims is analyzed using the failure data provided by the rim manufacturers in connection with a lawsuit (Civil Action No. 88 -C- 1374). The data was analyzed using MINITAB. The effect of an OSHA standard (1910. 177) on servicing multi-piece rims was studied for change in failure patterns of different rims. The hazard functions were plotted and failure rates were calculated for each type of rim. The failure rates wer...|$|E

40|$|In December 2007, a male {{equipment}} operator was fatally {{injured by}} a metal lock ring propelled from a multi-piece wheel tire assembly he was inflating. The victim was employed by an excavating and snow removal company. At {{the time of}} the incident, he and a co-worker were getting their loaders ready to remove snow from a shopping mall parking lot. Soon after he started his loader, the victim noticed that his left front tire mounted on a multi-piece wheel was “soft”(under-inflated). The multi-piece rim wheel referring to the tire assembly consisted of six components: the <b>rim</b> <b>base,</b> valve assembly, tire, side ring, O-ring and lock ring. The function of the lock ring was to hold the tire in place by locking and securing the other wheel components when the tire was inflated. The victim asked the co-worker, whose loader had an air compressor, to put air in the tire. The initial tire pressure was not checked. The co-worker connected one end of an air hose to the quick-connect fitting on the air compressor and the clip-on chuck at the other end to the valve stem of the tire. The co-worker then went to his loader’s cab and used the throttle control to maintain the airflow. The air hose did not have an in-line pressure gauge. The victim checked the air pressure at the tire valve with a hand-held pressure gauge periodically as the tire was being inflated. The maximum cold tire inflation pressure specified by the tire manufacturer was 35 pounds per square inch (psi). After a few minutes, the victi...|$|E

To minimise embedding distortion and to keep the location of the watermark secret, instead of embedding the watermark in the least significant bits, the proposed scheme embeds the watermark by associating a small set of indexes with the intensity range of the images in a random fashion {{under the control of}} the secret key and modulating the original pixels such that the indexes associated with the modulated / watermarked pixels are equal to the watermark bits to be embedded in the corresponding pixels. ...|$|R

Therefore when any pixel of the ROI is attacked, the watermark embedded in the background areas will be different from the watermark calculated according to the attacked contents, thus raising alarm that the image in question is inauthentic. Because the creation of the watermark is content-dependent and the watermark is only embedded in the background areas, the proposed scheme can actually protect the content/ROI without distorting it...|$|R
