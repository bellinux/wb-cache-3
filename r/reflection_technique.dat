The reflection is usually described in terms of a momentum transfer vector, denoted , which describes the change in momentum of a neutron after reflecting from the material.

Well logging is another widely used technique as it provides necessary high resolution information about rock and fluid properties in a vertical section, although they are limited in areal extent. This limitation in areal extent is the reason why seismic <b>reflection</b> <b>techniques</b> are so popular; they provide a method for interpolating and extrapolating well log information over a much larger area.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{seismic wave}} {{travelling}} through the Earth encounters an interface between two materials with different acoustic impedances, {{some of the}} wave energy will reflect off the interface and some will refract through the interface. At its most basic, the seismic <b>reflection</b> <b>technique</b> consists of generating seismic waves and measuring the time taken for the waves to travel from the source, reflect off an interface and be detected by an array of receivers (or geophones) at the surface. [...] Knowing the travel times from the source to various receivers, and the velocity of the seismic waves, a geophysicist then attempts to reconstruct the pathways of the waves {{in order to build}} up an image of the subsurface.|$|E

50|$|Further {{details of}} the game engine were {{discussed}} at a talk at CEDEC (CESA Developers Conference) 2014 given by Hitoshi Mishima (三嶋 仁氏) and Haruna Akuzawa (阿久澤陽菜氏). In common with other PS4/Xbox One generation rendering engines the Panta Rhei engine used physically based rendering methods for calculating lighting reflectance; demonstrations based around the Deep Down Panta Rhei development videogame used a Oren-Nayar model for diffuse reflectance, Cook-Torrance model for specular highlights (replacing a Blinn-Phong shading model used in earlier demonstrations). Demonstrations used tile-based deferred rendering generally, with forward rendering also applied for simulations of translucent skin effects, and other transparent objects. Indirect lighting was demonstrated again, using a 128x128x128 voxel grid representing local light intensity, and voxel cone tracing along 12 directions (dodecahedral). Specific demonstrations at CEDEC were a pre-integrated skin shader for simulation of light through (human/animal) skin effects, and a 'liquid' shader; surface reflections were modelled using a screen space <b>reflection</b> <b>technique</b> originally developed by Crytek, utilising parallax-corrected environmental maps; a hair modelling effect using runtime compute shader generation of hair positions, in conjunction with tessellation.|$|E

It {{is useful in}} studying a number of conditions including sleep apnea and speech disorders. Current studies at the Vocal Tract Lab of the University of Wisconsin seek to compare acoustic <b>reflection</b> <b>technique</b> data with information from medical imaging studies. The current protocol for Acoustic <b>Reflection</b> <b>Technique</b> calls for the wave tube device {{to be held in}} the hands of a researcher throughout the duration of the scans.

The final design incorporates a miniature adjustable boom stand attached to a custom high density polyethylene base that is used to hold the wave tube device.
