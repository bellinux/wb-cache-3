5|$|Areas of the {{hippocampus}} are {{shown to be}} functionally and anatomically distinct. The dorsal hippocampus (DH), ventral hippocampus (VH) and intermediate hippocampus serve different functions, project with differing pathways, and have varying degrees of place cells. The dorsal hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> maze, lesions in the DH were shown to cause spatial memory impairment while VH lesions did not. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. The dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.|$|E
25|$|A <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> saw has a {{circular}} saw {{mounted on a}} sliding horizontal arm. In addition to making length cuts a <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> saw may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. Some <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence allowing a rip cut to be performed. In 1922, Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey invented the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> saw. A patent was applied for in 1923 and awarded to De Walt in 1925.|$|E
25|$|The same {{directionality}} {{occurs when}} rats {{participate in the}} <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> maze. The <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> maze consists of a central circle from which several arm-like projections radiate. These projections either contain food or do not. Some consider the firing or lack of firing of place cells depending on the arm to {{be a function of}} goal-oriented behavior. However, when moving from one arm to another when they both contain food, place cells only fire in one direction, meaning that one cannot attribute firing purely to a goal-approach. A directionality component must be added: for example, a North goal as opposed to a South goal.|$|E

50|$|A placodioid lichen is a crustose lichen with {{a growth}} form that radiates {{out from a}} center, {{sometimes}} peeling up {{at the ends of}} the <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> to have a leafy form, but without a cortex on the underside, like a foliose lichen.|$|R
25|$|The set up {{includes}} an air or electric driven router, {{a cutting tool}} {{often referred to as}} a router bit, and a guide template. Also the router can be fixed to a table or connected to <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> which can be controlled more easily.|$|R
25|$|Leisons to {{the medial}} prefrontal cortex impair the {{performance}} of rats on a previously trained <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> maze, however, rats can gradually improve {{to the level of}} the controls as a function of experience. Lesions to this area also cause deficits on delayed nonmatching-to-positions tasks and impairments in the acquisition of spatial memory tasks during training trials.|$|E
25|$|First {{pioneered by}} Olton and Samuelson in 1976, the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> maze is {{designed}} to test the spatial memory capabilities of rats. Mazes are typically designed with a centre platform and a varying number of arms branching off with food placed at the ends. The arms are usually shielded {{from each other in}} some way but not to the extent that external cues cannot be used as reference points.|$|E
25|$|Rats are {{commonly}} used as models of schizophrenia patients. Experimenters create lesions in the ventral hippocampal area shortly after birth, a procedure known as neonatal ventral hippocampal lesioning(NVHL). Adult rats who with NVHL show typical indicators of schizophrenia such as hypersensitivity to psychostimulants, reduced social interactions and impaired prepulse inhibition, working memory and set-shifting. Similar to schizophrenia, impaired rats fail to use environmental context in spatial learning tasks such as showing difficulty completing the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> maze and the Moris water maze.|$|E

The latter space can {{accommodate}} 3000 delegates, each with an uninterrupted view of the stage with the conference and main auditorium floors above supported on a sculptural system of <b>radial</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{critical}} factor in Tainter gate design {{is the amount of}} stress transferred from the skinplate through the <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> and to the trunnion and the resulting friction encountered when raising or lowering the gate. Some older systems have had to be modified to allow for frictional forces for which the original design did not plan.|$|R
50|$|Almost all transit lines, {{including}} those of TANK are centered on Downtown Cincinnati. This has led many people to criticize the system for being overly radial and reliant on transfers in Downtown. Several lines in Ohio, generally those ending in '1'(31, 51, 41) don't go downtown at all but provide {{a link between the}} <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> created by the other lines.|$|R
25|$|Varying {{vestibular}} system stimulation has {{an effect}} on place cells. The vestibular system, part of the labyrinth of the inner ear, {{plays an important role in}} spatial memory by tuning into self-motion such as acceleration. Bilateral lesions of the vestibular system in patients cause abnormal firing of hippocampal place cells as evidenced, in part, by difficulties with aforementioned spatial tasks such as the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> maze and the Morris water navigation task. The dysfunction in spatial memory seen with damage to the vestibular system is lasting and possibly permanent, particularly if there is bilateral damage. For example, spatial memory deficits of patients with chronic vestibular loss is seen 5–10 years after a complete loss of the bilateral vestibular labyrinths.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A affects {{spatial memory}} {{most of the}} time because the size of the nuclei in hippocampal neurons are reduced by {{approximately}} 70% when there is a deficiency which affects a person's abilities for higher cognitive function. In a study by the University of Cagliari, Italy, VAD rats had more trouble learning a <b>Radial</b> <b>arm</b> maze than rats who had normal levels of the vitamin. The healthy rats were able to correctly solve the maze within the 15-day training period and other rats that were once deficient but had vitamin A restored to normal levels were also able to solve it. Here {{it was found that the}} retinoid receptors which help transport vitamin A were of normal function.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} ethanol to impair both spatial {{long-term}} memory and spatial working memory in various tasks. Chronic ethanol exposure causes deficits in spatial learning and memory tasks. These deficits persist even {{when exposed to}} long periods of ethanol-free time after ethanol exposure, suggesting a long-lasting change in structure and function of the hippocampus, a change in its functional connectome. Whether these changes are due {{to a change in}} place cells or a change in neurotransmission, neuroanatomy, or protein expression in the hippocampus is unknown. However, impairments in using non-spatial components such as cues are not evident in various tasks such as the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> maze and the Morris water navigation task.|$|E

50|$|When a Tainter gate is closed, water bears on the convex (upstream) side. When {{the gate}} is rotated, {{the rush of}} water passing under the gate helps to open and close the gate. The rounded face, long <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> and {{trunnion}} bearings allow it to close with less effort than a flat gate. Tainter gates are usually controlled from above with a chain/gearbox/electric motor assembly.|$|R

50|$|A tunnel crankcase, tunnel {{crankshaft}} or disc-webbed crankshaft {{engine is}} a diesel engine where the crankshaft is {{designed so that}} the main bearings (the bearings that support the crankshaft within the crankcase) are enlarged in diameter, such {{that they are now}} larger than the crank webs (the <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> that link the big end bearings to the main bearings). They thus form the largest diameter of any part of the crankshaft. Rather than a conventional crankcase that has webs across it to support the narrow bearings of a conventional crankcase, the crankcase now has a large tunnel through it, hence the name.|$|R
40|$|After mating, spermatophores {{of signal}} {{crayfish}} are stored {{on the body}} of the female for a period before fertilization. This study compared the post-mating protein profile and pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation of the signal crayfish spermatophore to that of the freshly ejaculated spermatophore and found substantial differences. Two major bands of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of molecular weights 10 and 50 kDa were observed in the freshly ejaculated spermatophore of the signal crayfish. While the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein band with molecular weight 10 kDa was formed by protein(s) of similar pH, the band with molecular weight of 50 kDa consisted of proteins of varying pH. In the post-mating spermatophore, the band with molecular weight of 50 kDa was not detected, and an increase in the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in the 10 kDa band. The microtubular <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> of the spermatozoon showed a positive reaction to an anti-tyrosine antibody conjugated with gold particles in both the freshly ejaculated and post-mating spermatophores. In conclusion, the male gamete of the signal crayfish undergoes molecular modification during post-mating storage {{on the body of}} the female including changes in the level of protein expression and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Structural similarity of the <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> in the crayfish immotile spermatozoon with flagellum, which is the main site of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the mammalian motile spermatozoa, raises questions regarding evolution and function of such organelles across the animal kingdom that must be addressed in the future studies...|$|R

2500|$|In {{laboratory}} studies, {{young cattle}} {{are able to}} memorize the locations of several food sources and retain this memory for at least 8hours, although this declined after 12hours. [...] Fifteen-month-old heifers learn more quickly than adult cows which have had either one or two calvings, but their longer-term memory is less stable. [...] Mature cattle perform well in spatial learning tasks {{and have a good}} long-term memory in these tests. [...] Cattle tested in a <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> maze are able to remember the locations of high-quality food for at least 30 days. [...] Although they initially learn to avoid low-quality food, this memory diminishes over the same duration. [...] Under less artificial testing conditions, young cattle showed they were able to remember the location of feed for at least 48 days. [...] Cattle can make an association between a visual stimulus and food within 1 day – memory of this association can be retained for 1 year, despite a slight decay.|$|E
2500|$|In the Faraday's disc example, {{the disc}} is rotated {{in a uniform}} {{magnetic}} field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> due to the Lorentz force. It is interesting to understand how it arises that mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through Ampère's circuital law (labeled [...] "induced B" [...] in the figure). The rim thus becomes an electromagnet that resists rotation of the disc (an example of Lenz's law). On {{the far side of}} the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through {{the far side of the}} rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this return current opposes the applied B-field, tending to decrease the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the increase in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field increases the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the decrease in flux due to rotation. Thus, both sides of the circuit generate an EMF opposing the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to friction, Joule heating, and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting mechanical energy to electrical energy.|$|E

50|$|The {{layout of}} the garden is an {{adaptation}} of another Islamic garden layout known as the Persian gardens. This garden built on a flat land on a square plan with four radiating arms from a central location as the water source. It needed to be modified to suit the hilly terrain and availability of a well, which could be diverted from a higher elevation to the planned gardens. Modifications involved the main channel running through the garden axially from top to the lowest point. This central channel, known as the Shah Nahar, is the main axis of the garden. It runs through three terraces. This layout left out the <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> and the shape became rectangular, instead of a square plan of the Chahar Bagh.|$|R
50|$|Xyloplax medusiformis was {{the first}} sea daisy to be described. It was clearly an {{echinoderm}} but {{at first it was}} considered to be sufficiently different from starfish, class Asteroidea, as to warrant it being placed in a new class of its own, the Concentricycloidea. The main difference was that the water vascular system of asteroids has a single ring canal circling the mouth connected to <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> with short lateral side arms while that of the sea daisy had two ring canals surrounding the mouth, linked by five inter-ring canals. The concentric arrangement of plates {{on the surface of the}} sea daisy was novel and it had a single row of podia (tube feet) rather than the two rows typical of asteroids.|$|R

5000|$|The Jump & Smile {{is a type}} of {{fairground}} ride {{in which}} the chair cars are arranged on a number of <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> around a central axis. As the central axis rotates, the arms are lifted into the air at pseudo-random intervals giving an erratic jumping motion.There is another version called Techno Jump, which had a specific pattern in which the cars would go up one at a time, and then shake a little when up. Then the ride would suddenly drop up and down in order, creating the illusion of moving waves and the sound of pistons going [...] "ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch". Also this ride would freeze in midair, making riders think it was over before starting to do the same jumping motion backwards.|$|R
