500|$|Studies in 2004 and 2006 {{attempted}} {{to test the}} urban heat island theory, by comparing temperature <b>readings</b> <b>taken</b> on calm nights with those taken on windy nights. [...] If the urban heat island theory is correct then instruments should have recorded a bigger temperature rise for calm nights than for windy ones, because wind blows excess heat away from cities {{and away from the}} measuring instruments. There was no difference between the calm and windy nights, and one study said that [...] "we show that, globally, temperatures over land have risen as much on windy nights as on calm nights, indicating that the observed overall warming is not a consequence of urban development." ...|$|E
500|$|At 17:00UTC on September16, {{the storm}} made {{landfall}} near East Hampton, New York with winds of 80mph (130km/h).

Early on September17, the system weakened to a tropical storm and dissipated over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence several hours later. Parts of this storm were first described by David M. Ludlum, who called it The New England Tropical Storm of 1858. However, barometer <b>readings</b> <b>taken</b> at Sag Harbor, New York and Providence, Rhode Island, along with ship reports and wind speeds recorded at Bangor, Maine and Nantucket, Massachusetts, conclude that the system reached hurricane intensity.

2500|$|Valve lift can be {{expressed}} as an actual dimension in decimal inches or mm. It can also be specified as a ratio between a characteristic diameter and the lift L/D. Most often used is the valve head diameter. Normally engines have an L/D ratio from 0 up {{to a maximum of}} [...]35. For example, a [...] valve would be lifted a maximum of 0.350inch. During flow testing the valve would be set at L/D [...]05 [...]1 [...]15 [...]2 [...]25 [...]3 and <b>readings</b> <b>taken</b> successively. This allows the comparison of efficiencies of ports with other valve sizes, as the valve lift is proportional rather than absolute. For comparison with tests by others the characteristic diameter used to determine lift must be the same.|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{standard}} tests, as technically a new design of locomotive, Tornado {{was required to}} undergo specific extra tests to examine ride quality and track force, to assess the effect the locomotive {{would have on the}} main line track. The details of these tests are laid down by the Network Rail Safety Review Panel. It was agreed in advance between the trust and the authorities that these could be done in part at the GCR. Accordingly, on 25 September 2008, the tests were performed by running Tornado through the Kinchley Curve at speeds of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and , with a trailing saloon car fitted with monitoring equipment, including a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit to measure the precise speed and distance travelled every metre. Measurements were taken on board by 21 sensors attached to the locomotive, measuring pitch and roll, and acceleration and deceleration. Measurements were also taken through the use of track-side sensors measuring side forces exerted on the track, augmented with freeze-frame footage of the position of the wheels as they passed. The results were compared with control <b>readings</b> <b>taken</b> at the same site using Oliver Cromwell, two weeks later. The preliminary results were described as producing [...] "no untoward signals".|$|E
