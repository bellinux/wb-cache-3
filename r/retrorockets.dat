25|$|The Retro module {{contained}} four solid-fuel TE-M-385 Star-13E <b>retrorockets,</b> each spherical {{in shape}} except for its rocket nozzle, which were structurally attached to two beams that {{reached across the}} diameter of the retro module, crossing at right angles in the center. Re-entry began with the <b>retrorockets</b> firing one at a time. Abort procedures at certain periods during lift-off would cause them to fire at the same time, thrusting the Descent module away from the Titan rocket.|$|E
25|$|The Wagtail missile was {{intended}} to be fitted with a guidance system that utilised an inertial navigation system and a terrain-following radar, which allowed the missile to be fired from and navigate at extremely low altitudes. The missile was equipped with small <b>retrorockets</b> that retarded the missile following release, allowing the launching aircraft the opportunity to escape the blast wave from the missile's warhead.|$|E
25|$|The Gemini {{crew capsule}} (referred {{to as the}} Reentry Module) was {{essentially}} an enlarged version of the Mercury capsule. Unlike Mercury, the <b>retrorockets,</b> electrical power, propulsion systems, oxygen, and water were located in a detachable Adapter Module behind the Reentry Module. A major design improvement in Gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components, which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary, without removing or disturbing other already tested components.|$|E
50|$|A backup solid-fueled <b>retrorocket</b> {{was added}} {{to the top of the}} descent module in the event that the main <b>retrorocket</b> failed. This had not been {{necessary}} on Vostok as the orbit was low enough that the spacecraft would decay in ten days if the <b>retrorocket</b> failed, there being enough onboard consumables to sustain the cosmonaut that long. In any case, the Blok E equipped R-7 booster lacked sufficient lift capacity for a backup <b>retrorocket.</b> Since Voskhod was well below the maximum lift capacity of the larger Blok I equipped R-7, it would be put into a quite high orbit and not decay in ten days.|$|R

25|$|Armadillo Aerospace was {{developing}} a two-seat vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) rocket called Hyperion, {{which will be}} marketed by Space Adventures. Hyperion uses a capsule similar in shape to the Gemini capsule. The vehicle will use a parachute for descent but will probably use <b>retrorockets</b> for final touchdown, according to remarks made by Armadillo Aerospace at the Next Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference in February 2012. The assets of Armadillo Aerospace were sold to Exos Aerospace and while SARGE is continuing to be developed, {{it is unclear whether}} Hyperion is still being developed.|$|E
25|$|Stanislav Pokrovsky – Russian general {{director}} of a scientific-manufacturing enterprise Project-D-MSK who calculated that the real speed of the Saturn V rocket at S-IC staging time was only half of what was declared. His analysis appears {{to assume that the}} solid rocket plumes from the fuselage and <b>retrorockets</b> on the two stages came to an instant halt in the surrounding air so they can be used to estimate the velocity of the rocket. He ignored high-altitude winds and the altitude at staging, 67km, where air is about 1/10,000 as dense as at sea level, and claimed that only a loop around the Moon was possible, not a manned landing on the Moon with return to Earth. He also allegedly found the reason for this – problems with the Inconel superalloy used in the F-1 engine.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the lander}} was 355 m above the ground, airbags were {{inflated}} {{in less than}} a second using three catalytically cooled solid rocket motors that served as gas generators. The airbags were made of 4 inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as 28m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15m/s vertical impacts, three solid <b>retrorockets</b> were mounted above the lander in the backshell. These were fired at 98m above the ground. The lander's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0m/s between 15 and 25m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at 14m/s and limited the impact to only 18G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces).|$|E

5000|$|This, the {{eleventh}} Soviet attempt {{to achieve a}} lunar soft landing, nearly succeeded. After a successful midcourse correction on 4 December, this spacecraft headed toward the Moon without any apparent problems. Just before the scheduled firing of its <b>retrorocket,</b> a command was sent to inflate cushioning air bags around the landing probe. However, a plastic mounting bracket apparently pierced {{one of the two}} air bags. The resulting ejection of the air put the spacecraft into a spin of about 12 degrees per second. The spacecraft momentarily regained its proper attitude, long enough for a nine-second-long <b>retrorocket</b> firing, but Luna 8 became unstable again. Without a <b>retrorocket</b> burn long enough to reduce its velocity sufficiently for a survivable landing, Luna 8 plummeted to the lunar surface and crashed at 21:51:30 UT on 6 December in the west of Oceanus Procellarum. The coordinates of the crash site are [...]|$|R
50|$|At 07:25 UT, the spacecraft's {{automatic}} systems {{brought it}} into the required attitude (orientation) for the <b>retrorocket</b> firing, and shortly afterwards, the liquid-fueled engine fired for about 42 seconds over {{the west coast of}} Africa, near Angola, about 8000 km uprange of the landing point. The orbit's perigee and apogee had been selected to cause reentry due to orbital decay within 10 days (the limit of the life support system function) in the event of <b>retrorocket</b> malfunction. However, the actual orbit differed from the planned and would not have allowed descent until 20 days.|$|R
500|$|The sixth orbit was {{dominated}} by preparations for re-entry, though Schirra {{was able to take}} a last set of photographs of South America and try another set of spatial-orientation tests. He armed the <b>retrorockets</b> passing over the western Pacific, and fired the first one at 8:52 mission elapsed time. The automatic control system held the capsule [...] "steady as a rock" [...] during this period, though after the <b>retrorockets</b> had stopped firing Schirra noted that the system had burned almost a quarter of its fuel in the process.|$|E
500|$|On {{consulting}} with his flight controllers, Kraft {{became convinced that}} the indication was false, and that no action was needed. However, his superiors, including Mercury capsule designer Max Faget, felt differently. They overruled Kraft, telling him to instruct Glenn to leave the capsule's retrorocket package on during re-entry. The reasoning was that the package, which was strapped over the heatshield, would hold the heatshield in place if it was loose. Kraft, however, {{felt that this was}} an unacceptable risk. [...] "I was aghast," [...] he remembered. [...] "If any of three <b>retrorockets</b> had solid fuel remaining, an explosion could rip everything apart." [...] Yet he agreed to follow the plan advocated by Faget and by Walt Williams, his superior in the flight operations division. The <b>retrorockets</b> would be kept on.|$|E

50|$|If the <b>retrorocket</b> failed, the {{spacecraft}} would naturally decay from orbit within ten days, and the cosmonaut was provided with enough food and oxygen to survive until that time.|$|R
5000|$|The spacecraft's VA capsule {{was greatly}} {{modified}} to carry instruments - the <b>retrorocket</b> and parachute packages {{were replaced by}} scientific equipment, including an infrared telescope and the Ozon spectrometer.|$|R

2500|$|Landing a large mass on Mars is {{particularly}} challenging as {{the atmosphere is}} too thin for parachutes and aerobraking alone to be effective, while remaining thick enough to create stability and impingement problems when decelerating with <b>retrorockets.</b> Although some previous missions have used airbags to cushion the shock of landing, Curiosity rover is too heavy {{for this to be}} an option. Instead, Curiosity was set down on the Martian surface using a new high-accuracy entry, descent, and landing (EDL) system {{that was part of the}} MSL spacecraft descent stage. The novel EDL system placed Curiosity within a [...] landing ellipse, in contrast to the [...] landing ellipse of the landing systems used by the Mars Exploration Rovers.|$|E
2500|$|At the retrofire event, {{the pitch}} horizon scanner malfunctioned once more, forcing Carpenter to {{manually}} control his reentry, which {{caused him to}} overshoot the planned splashdown point by [...] ("The malfunction of the pitch horizon scanner circuit [...] dictated that the pilot manually control the spacecraft attitudes during this event.") The PHS malfunction jerked the spacecraft off in yaw by 25 degrees to the right, accounting for [...] of the overshoot; the delay caused by the automatic sequencer required Carpenter to fire the <b>retrorockets</b> manually. This effort took two pushes of the override button and accounted for another 15 to [...] of the overshoot. The loss of thrust in the ripple pattern of the retros added another , producing a [...] overshoot.|$|E
2500|$|A Redstone rocket {{was used}} to boost the capsule for 2 minutes and 30 seconds to an {{altitude}} of [...] and let it continue on a ballistic curve after booster-spacecraft separation. The launch escape system was jettisoned at the same time. At {{the top of the}} curve, the spacecraft's <b>retrorockets</b> were fired for testing purposes; they were not necessary for reentry because orbital speed had not been attained. The spacecraft landed in the Atlantic Ocean. The suborbital mission took about 15 minutes, had an apogee altitude of , and a downrange distance of [...] From the time of booster-spacecraft separation until reentry where air started to slow down the spacecraft, the pilot would experience weightlessness as shown on the image. The recovery procedure would be the same as an orbital mission.|$|E

The method is applied to a single jet and to a cluster of n identical jets.

50|$|The {{duration}} of the spaceflight of Surveyor 1 was about 63 hours, 30 minutes. Surveyor I's lunar launch weight was about 995.2 kg, and its landing weight (minus expended maneuvering propellant, its solid-fueled <b>retrorocket</b> (which had been jettisoned), and its radar altimeter system) was about 294.3 kg.|$|R
2500|$|Once in orbit, {{it was not}} {{possible}} for the spacecraft to change its trajectory except by initiating reentry. Each orbit would typically take 88 minutes to complete. The lowest point of the orbit, called perigee, was {{at the point where the}} spacecraft entered orbit and was about , and the highest point, called apogee, was on the opposite side of Earth and was about [...] When leaving orbit (E) the angle downward was increased to 34°, which was the angle of retrofire. <b>Retrorockets</b> fired for 10 seconds each (F) in a sequence where one started 5 seconds after the other. During reentry (G), the astronaut would experience about 8 g (11–12 g on a suborbital mission). The temperature around the heat shield rose to [...] and at the same time, there was a two-minute radio blackout due to ionization of the air around the spacecraft.|$|E
2500|$|The Mercury space capsule was {{produced}} by McDonnell Aircraft, and carried supplies of water, food and oxygen for about one day in a pressurized cabin. Mercury flights were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, on launch vehicles modified from the Redstone and Atlas D missiles. [...] The capsule was fitted with a launch escape rocket to carry it safely away from the launch vehicle {{in case of a}} failure. The flight was designed to be controlled from the ground via the Manned Space Flight Network, a system of tracking and communications stations; back-up controls were outfitted on board. Small <b>retrorockets</b> were used to bring the spacecraft out of its orbit, after which an ablative heat shield protected it from the heat of [...] atmospheric reentry. Finally, a parachute slowed the craft for a water landing. Both astronaut and capsule were recovered by helicopters deployed from a U.S. Navy ship.|$|E
2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Faith 7 flight {{there were}} mission-threatening {{technical}} problems. During the 19th orbit, the capsule had a power failure. Carbon dioxide levels began rising, and the cabin temperature jumped to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38°C). Cooper turned to his understanding of star patterns, took manual control of the tiny capsule and successfully estimated the correct pitch for re-entry into the atmosphere. Some precision was needed in the calculation, since if the capsule came in too steep, g-forces would be too large, and if its trajectory were too shallow, it would shoot out of the atmosphere again, back into space. Cooper drew lines on the capsule window to help him check his orientation before firing the re-entry rockets. [...] "So I used my wrist watch for time," [...] he later recalled, [...] "my eyeballs out the window for attitude. Then I fired my <b>retrorockets</b> at the right time and landed right by the carrier." [...] Cooper's cool-headed performance and piloting skills led to a basic rethinking of design philosophy for later space missions.|$|E
50|$|A <b>retrorocket</b> (short for {{retrograde}} rocket) is {{a rocket}} engine providing thrust opposing {{the motion of}} a vehicle, thereby causing it to decelerate. They have mostly been used in spacecraft, with more limited use in short-runway aircraft landing. New uses are emerging in the 2010s for retro-thrust rockets in reusable launch systems.|$|R
50|$|After a {{flawless}} {{flight to the}} Moon, radio signals from the spacecraft ceased during the terminal-descent phase at 02:03 UT on 17 July 1967, approximately 2.5 minutes before touchdown.

5000|$|Due to {{the high}} {{reliability}} demanded by <b>retrorockets,</b> Mercury spacecraft used a trio of solid fuel, 1000 lbf (4.5 kN) thrust <b>retrorockets</b> strapped to the heat shield {{on the bottom of}} the spacecraft that fired for 10 seconds each.

50|$|Surveyor 1 {{required}} {{a total of}} about 63 hours (2.6 days) to reach the Moon, and Surveyor 5 required 65 hours (2.7 days). The launch weights (at lunar injection) of the seven Surveyors ranged from 995.2 kg to 1040 kg, and their landing weights (minus fuel, jettisoned <b>retrorocket,</b> and radar unit) ranged from 294.3 kg to 306 kg.|$|R
5000|$|The Soviet Union {{continued}} to develop methods to efficiently deploy airborne vehicles, but focusing on parachute deployment from large fixed-wing aircraft instead, {{in an effort}} to render their [...] "winged infantry" [...] fully mechanized as well. By the mid-1970s, they were able to drop BMD-1s with crew members aboard, using a combination of a parachute and <b>retrorocket.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Later in the flight, {{telemetry}} {{indicated that}} the heat shield had loosened. If this reading were accurate, Glenn and his spacecraft would be incinerated on reentry. After a lengthy discussion over {{how to deal with}} this problem, ground controllers decided that leaving the solid-fueled <b>retrorocket</b> pack in place might keep the heat shield in place. They relayed these instructions to Glenn, but did not tell him that the heat shield was possibly loose; although confused at this order, he complied. Leaving the <b>retrorocket</b> pack on made large chunks of flaming debris fly past the window of his capsule during re-entry, although Glenn thought {{it might have been the}} heat shield. He told an interviewer, [...] "Fortunately it was the rocket pack—or I wouldn't be answering these questions." [...] After the flight, it was determined that the heat shield was not loose, but that the sensor was faulty.|$|R
