40|$|The most {{extensive}} set of free tropospheric ozone measurements ever compiled across midlatitude North America {{was measured with}} daily ozonesondes, commercial aircraft and a lidar at 14 sites during July-August 2004. The model estimated stratospheric ozone was subtracted from all profiles, leaving a tropospheric <b>residual</b> <b>ozone.</b> On average the upper troposphere above midlatitude eastern North America contained 15 ppbv more tropospheric <b>residual</b> <b>ozone</b> than the more polluted layer between the surface and 2 km above sea level. Lowest ozone values in the upper troposphere were found above the two upwind sites in California. The upper troposphere above midlatitude eastern North America contained 16 ppbv more tropospheric <b>residual</b> <b>ozone</b> than the upper troposphere above three upwind sites, with the greatest enhancement above Houston, Texas, at 24 ppbv. Upper tropospheric CO measurements above east Texas show no statistically significant enhancement compared to west coast measurements, arguing against a strong influence from fresh surface anthropogenic emissions to the upper troposphere above Texas where the ozone enhancement is greatest. Vertical mixing of ozone from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere can only account for 2 ppbv of the 16 ppbv ozone enhancement above eastern North America; therefore the remaining 14 ppbv must {{be the result of}} in situ ozone production. The transport of NOx tracers from North American anthropogenic, biogenic, biomass burning, and lightning emissions was simulated for the upper troposphere of North America with a particle dispersion model. Additional box model calculations suggest the 24 ppbv ozone enhancement above Houston can be produced over a 10 day period from oxidation reactions of lightning NOx and background mixing ratios of CO and CH 4. Overall, we estimate that 69 – 84 % (11 – 13 ppbv) of the 16 ppbv ozone enhancement above eastern North America is due to in situ ozone production from lightning NOx with the remainder due to transport of ozone from the surface or in situ ozone production from other sources of NOx...|$|E

40|$|The co-flight of the MLS stratospheric {{limb sounder}} and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) {{provides}} {{the capability of}} computing the Tropospheric <b>Ozone</b> <b>Residual</b> (TOR) in much greater detail [Ziemke et al., 2006]. Using forward trajectory calculations of MLS ozone measurements combined with OMI column ozone we have developed a high horizontal resolution tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>residual</b> (HTOR) which can provide even more detail than the standard TOR product. HTOR is especially useful for extra-tropical studies of tropospheric ozone transport. We find that both the Pacific pollution corridor (East Asia to Alaska) and the Atlantic pollution corridor (North America east coast to Europe) are also preferred locations for strat-trop folds leading to systematic overestimates of pollution amounts. In fact, fold events appear to dominate extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere day-to-day maps of HTOR. Model estimates of the tropospheric column are in reasonable agreement with the HTOR amounts when offsets due to different tropopause height calculations are taken into consideration...|$|R

Ozone is not as restricted as chlorination or ultraviolet radiation in the quality of water that can be treated. On-site production of oxygen will double the capacity of ozone generators and reduce costs accordingly as compared with compressed air systems.

40|$|Appropriate and {{effective}} drinking water treatment {{is critical to}} the protection of public health. Toxic cyanobacterial blooms are a globally increasing drinking water source quality-associated health risk as even very low (> 1. 5 parts per billion (ppb) or micrograms per litre (µg/L)) concentrations of the cyanobacteria-produced toxin microcystin can be unsafe to drink. Increased pressures on freshwater supplies as well as climate change associated factors such as alternating periods of drought and intense storms and increasing water temperature cause more nutrient runoff into water supplies and create favourable conditions for the growth of cyanobacteria. Ozone is generally understood to effectively destroy many toxins during drinking water treatment. Its efficacy, however, can be adversely impacted by the presence of natural organic matter, often measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The conditions that create favourable growth conditions for cyanobacteria, can also increase the concentrations of DOC in the source water of a drinking water treatment facility. The objectives of this research were to determine whether ozone is an effective cyanobacterial toxin elimination technology at the conditions studied; specifically in the presence of high DOC (~ 10 mg/L), to determine the efficacy of ozone in the destruction of intercellular (within cells) toxin vs. extracellular (within water matrix) toxin, and {{to determine the extent of}} cell destruction by ozone. Bench-scale experiments were conducted. Both extracted toxin and cyanobacterial cells were added to coagulated/flocculated/clarified water collected from the Mannheim Water Treatment Plant in Kitchener, Ontario. Microcystin concentrations were measured by the ELISA method and by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS-MS). This investigation confirmed that ozone can destroy extracellular microcystin-LR to below 1. 5 µg/L (ppb) at <b>ozone</b> <b>residuals</b> above 0. 3 mg O 3 /L when the aqueous DOC concentration was below 5 mg/L. The relationship between required <b>ozone</b> <b>residual</b> to achieve adequate extracellular toxin destruction and DOC concentration in the water matrix was quantitatively described. Notably, when Microcystis aeruginosa cells were present, an amount equivalent to less than 50 % of the concentration of extracellular microcystin-LR was destroyed by ozone. This demonstrates that significant oxidative capacity is required to lyse the cells before ozone can destroy intercellular toxin. The novel contribution of this work is that this relationship was 1) demonstrated through using toxin in extracted and cellular forms and 2) maintained when all other critical operational factors (i. e., <b>ozone</b> <b>residual,</b> DOC concentration, water matrix) were the same. These results underscore the need to reassess operational requirements for ozonation for the treatment of cyanobacterial toxins when intact cells are present as opposed to extracellular toxin, which is used in most performance assessments. Notably, as the aqueous DOC concentration increased, the proportion of live cells present following ozonation (as measured by intercellular toxin concentrations) also increased. Therefore, not only does DOC decrease the efficacy of ozone to destroy toxin, it decreases the oxidative capacity to lyse cells; moreover, the rate is not directly proportional to the aqueous DOC concentration. As a result, increases in <b>ozone</b> <b>residual</b> concentration had a minimal effect on toxin destruction in these cases. In other words, the levels of toxin destruction that would have been expected based on comparable <b>ozone</b> <b>residuals</b> in absence of DOC (or when only low levels of DOC were present) were not achieved because of the significant oxidant/ozone demand of DOC when present at high aqueous (~ 10 mg/L) concentrations. Another important contribution of this work was the demonstration that not all cyanobacterial cells were destroyed following ozonation; thus, they were described as “Damaged and Potentially Viable (DAPV) ” cells. These cells were present at <b>ozone</b> <b>residuals</b> less than 0. 45 mg O 3 /L, logically suggesting that incomplete oxidative treatment occurs at lower <b>ozone</b> <b>residual</b> concentrations. Notably, these DAPV cells may have the potential to reproduce; given this and the common assessment of treatment performance using extracellular toxin, the efficacy and operational requirements of oxidative treatment of cyanobacterial cells by ozonation may need to re-evaluated for situations in which live cells are present. These observations also underscore the need to more fully assess the significance of DAPV cells...|$|R

40|$|Ozonation of toluene over NaX, NaY and MCM- 41 {{adsorbents}} was studied targeting for {{indoor air}} purification. The combined use of ozone {{and the various}} micro- or meso-porous adsorbents aimed {{to take advantage of}} the strong oxidizing capability of ozone. At the same time the <b>residual</b> <b>ozone</b> would be minimized due to the enhanced catalytic reaction in the porous structure. To lower the <b>residual</b> <b>ozone</b> level is a crucial issue as ozone is itself an indoor pollutant. The Lewis acid sites in the adsorbents were believed to decompose ozone into atomic oxygen, and the subsequent reactions would then convert the adsorbed toluene into CO 2 and H 2 O. In the dry conditions, the MCM- 41 required the smallest amount of material to achieve the 90 % reduction target, followed by NaY and NaX. In the more humid environment (50 % RH), extra amounts of MCM- 41 and NaX adsorbents were required to reach the target as compared with the dry conditions. Desorption experiments were also conducted to study the amounts of various major species held in the adsorbents during the catalytic process. A material balance analysis of the major species in both the effluents and the adsorbents showed that within our experimental conditions, about 20 - 40 % of the removed toluene was carried out via catalytic ozonation while adsorption covered the rest. Trace amount of intermediate species such as aldehydes and organic acids were identified in the desorbed gas indicating that they were withheld by the adsorbents during the air purification process and those in the effluent were below detection levels.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} the combination effect of ozone and heat treatments in apple juice for the inactivation of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes. Apple juices inoculated {{with the three}} pathogens were treated with gaseous ozone and heat simultaneously for up to 1 min. Gaseous ozone treatment was progressed at a flow rate of 3. 0 l/min with a concentration of 2. 0 – 3. 0 g/m 3 and heat treatment was performed at temperatures of 25, 45, 50, and 55 °C. Populations of surviving pathogens decreased in all samples as treatment temperature increased from 25 to 55 °C. Heat treatment alone (25, 45, 50 and 55 °C) resulted in 0. 20, 0. 37, 2. 16 and 2. 54 logCFU/ml reductions of E. coli O 157 :H 7, respectively, in apple juice. Combination treatment of ozone and heat for 1 min reduced this pathogen by 1. 50 and 1. 60 logCFU/ml, respectively, at 25 and 45 °C, and below the detection limit (1 logCFU/ml) at 50 and 55 °C.

The trials demonstrated {{the reliability of}} performance of a seven barrier treatment process consisting of ozonation, ceramic microfiltration (MF), biologically activated carbon, reverse osmosis, ultra-violet disinfection, calcite contactor and chlorination. The seven treatment barriers were required to meet the high log removal values (LRV) required for pathogens in small systems during disease outbreak, and on-line verification of process performance was required for operation with infrequent operator attention. On-line verification of pathogen LRVs, a low turbidity filtrate of approximately 0. 1 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit), no long-term fouling and no requirement for clean-in-place (CIP) was achieved with the ceramic MF. A pressure decay test was also reliably implemented on the reverse osmosis system to achieve a 2 LRV for protozoa, and this barrier required only 2 - 3 CIP treatments each year. The ozonation process achieved 2 LRV for bacteria and virus with no requirement for an <b>ozone</b> <b>residual,</b> provided the <b>ozone</b> dose was > 11. 7 mg/L.

The acid strength and the density of acid sites in the adsorbents were characterized by NH 3 -TGA methods. The toluene oxidation performance was evaluated in both dry (0 %RH) and humid (50 %RH) environments with 6 ppm ozone at and 1. 5 ppm toluene at the inlet. A comparison was made of the amount of adsorbent for the removal of 90 % of toluene during steady state conditions. The use of ozone in the system reduced the bed length substantially for the tested adsorbents. In the dry conditions, the MCM- 4 1 required the smallest amount of material to achieve the 90 % reduction target, followed by NaY and NaX. In the more humid environment, extra amounts of MCM- 4 1 and NaX adsorb ents were required to reach the target as compared with the dry conditions. The performance of NaY, however, was more stable in the humid environment as NaY is a hydrophobic zeolite which adsorbs only a small amount of water.

40|$|Water quality {{changes that}} occur during {{establishment}} and maintenance of nitrification in two identical recirculating aquaculture systems containing rainbow trout are described. The time taken for the nitrification process to become established was 40 - 45 days. Mortality of fish attributed to elevated nitrite concentrations were recorded during the initial conditioning phase of the systems. Un-ionised ammonia concentrations did not attain lethal levels during this period. Nitrate concentrations accumulated slowly throughout the study, while the pH and alkalinity of the water decreased with progressive nitrification. Levels of carbon dioxide, calcium, dissolved and suspended solids remained relatively stable until the carrying capacity of the systems was increased, upon which they increased rapidly and general water quality deteriorated. Permanently elevated concentrations of ammonia and nitrite served as {{an indication that the}} carrying capacity of the systems had been exceeded. The use of ozone as a water enhancement treatment in aquaculture systems during one- and six-hour applications was also considered in this study. Ozonation significantly reduced nitrite levels at · low concentrations (0, 1 - 0, 15 mg/l), although they returned to pre-treatment levels within a few hours of cessation of the treatment. The formation of an unstable, intermediate product that reforms as nitrite in the absence of ozone, rather than the complete oxidation of nitrite to nitrate, is proposed. Ozonation also resulted in decreased dissolved solids, and improved the clarity and odour of the water. Ozone had no effect on ammonia concentrations (at pH > 7, 0), or on nitrate or calcium levels, and did not conclusively increase the redox potential of the water. <b>Residual</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations up to 0, 04 mg/l in a sixhour treatment had no harmful effects on rainbow trout, and there were no signs of gas-bubble disease arising from supersaturation of the water with oxygen.

During four 8 -week trials, ozone {{was added to}} the system at a rate of 0. 025 or 0. 036 – 0. 039 kg ozone/kg feed fed. In the control, where no ozone was added, and in previously published research, BGD outbreaks occurred within two weeks of stocking, and these outbreaks generally required three to four chemotherapeutant treatments to prevent high mortality. In three of four trials where ozone was added to the system, BGD outbreaks were prevented without chemical treatments, but the causative bacterium, Flavobacterium branchiophilum, still colonized gill tissue. The one ozone test where BGD outbreaks required two chemical treatments coincided with a malfunction of the ozone generator. Although ozonation did reduce BGD mortality, it failed in all trials to produce more than a one log 10 reduction in numbers of heterotrophic bacteria in the system water or on gill tissue. Failure of the ozone to lower numbers of heterotrophic bacteria or to prevent the causative BGD bacterium from occurring on gills was attributed to the short exposure time to <b>ozone</b> <b>residual</b> (35 s contact chamber) and rapid loss of oxidation caused by levels of total suspended solids. Rationale for ozone's success at preventing BGD mortalities are not fully understood but may in part be due to improved water quality. Use of the lower ozone dosing rate (0. 025 kg ozone/kg feed) appeared to provide the same benefits as the higher dosing rate (0. 036 – 0. 039 kg ozone/kg feed fed); however, the lower ozone dosing rate was less likely to produce a toxic <b>ozone</b> <b>residual</b> in the culture tank and would also reduce ozone equipment capital and operating costs...|$|R

The derived TCO field, which covers one complete year of mostly continuous daily measurements from late August 2004 through August 2005, is used for studying the regional and global pollution on a timescale of {{a few days to}} months. The seasonal and zonal characteristics of the observed TCO fields are also compared with TCO fields derived from the Global Modeling Initiative's Chemical Transport Model. The model and observations show interesting similarities with respect to zonal and seasonal variations. However, there are notable differences, particularly over the vast region of the Saharan desert...|$|R
40|$|Daily {{high-resolution}} maps of {{stratospheric ozone}} {{have been constructed}} using observations by MLS combined with trajectory information. These fields are {{used to determine the}} extratropical stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) of ozone for the year 2005 using two diagnostic methods. The resulting two annual estimates compare well with past model- and observational-based estimates. Initial analyses of the seasonal characteristics indicate that significant STE of ozone in the polar regions occurs only during spring and early summer. We also examine evidence that the Antarctic ozone hole is responsible for a rapid decrease in the rate of ozone STE during the SH spring. Subtracting the high-resolution stratospheric ozone fiom OMI total column measurements creates a high-resolution tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>residual</b> (HTOR) product. The HTOR fields are compared to the spatial distribution of the ozone STE. We show that the mean tropospheric ozone maxima tend to occur near locations of significant ozone STE. This suggests that STE may be responsible for a significant fraction of many mean tropospheric ozone anomalies...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in a continuous flow reactor at room temperature to evaluate the elimination of low-concentration toluene in the gas phase to verify if fly-ash products from biomass combustion in an ozonation system {{could be used in}} the removal of volatile organic compounds. The fly-ash products from pure biomass combustion (Ash(100)) demonstrated the highest ozonation activities upon the removal of low-concentration toluene (1. 5 ppmv), followed by the fly-ash products from co-combustion (Ash(30)) and the coal combustion (Ash(0)). Kinetic experiments showed that the activation energy of the toluene elimination process was substantially reduced with the use of ozone and the reaction intermediates, such as formic acids, aldehydes, etc. Results also showed that the intermediates were reduced with increasing humidity level. The combined use of fly-ash products and zeolite 13 X enhanced the removal of toluene to above 90 % and suppressed the release of <b>residual</b> <b>ozone</b> and intermediates by holding them in the adsorbed phase.

30|$|The {{experimental}} {{system was}} constructed with an oxygen tank, RQ- 02 ozone generator (Ruiqing, China), 200 -mL quartz column reactor, flow meter, and an exhaust gas collector. An aliquot of 100  mL of PRW-ROC and 0.5  g of catalyst were {{added in the}} reactor at 30  °C. The gaseous ozone was then introduced through a porous diffuser {{at the bottom of}} the reactor with a flow rate of 5  mg/min. The experiments were carried out under varying the initial pH values (adjusted with 1  N NaOH or HCl) and reaction times. After treatment, dried oxygen was blown into the PRW-ROC at a rate of 3.0  L/min to quench the reaction and eliminate the <b>residual</b> <b>ozone.</b> The resulting suspension was filtered (Whatman Qualitative No. 5) to separate catalyst particles prior to further analysis at various intervals. The ·OH quenching experiments were performed to determine the oxidation mechanism. The ·OH scavengers, tert-butanol (tBA), and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) were added into PRW-ROC (0.5 and 1.0  g/L, respectively) prior to experiments. All the experiments were performed in triplicate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. -Ozone {{has been}} used in a range of {{aquaculture}} applications related to disinfection and improving water quality. Ozone has seen wide use because it is a powerful oxidizing agent that has a rapid reaction rate and few harmful reaction products. This paper reviews the application of ozone within aquaria and in aquaculture systems that use single-pass or recirculated water. The issues and mechanisms required to use ozone are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the pro-cesses of ozone gas generation and gas-to-liquid absorption, the contact time for reaction, and the removal of <b>residual</b> <b>ozone.</b> In addition, the toxicity of ozone to humans and to aquatic organisms is discussed, as well as techniques to monitor or control ozone in both the gaseous and aqueous phases. Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent that can be put to numerous beneficial uses within aquaculture (Rosenthal 1981; Hochheimer and Wheaton 1995). Because many contaminants found in water used for aquaculture are easily oxidized, ozone can be used in water quality control applications rangin...|$|E
40|$|The Bihar {{pollution}} pool {{is a large}} wintertime {{increase in}} pollutants over the eastern parts of the Indo Gangetic basin. We use improved carbon monoxide (CO) retrievals from the recent Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) version 4 data along with the aerosol data from the latest version 3 of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) lidar instrument and the tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>residual</b> products from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) /Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (SBUV) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) /Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) database to characterize this pollution pool. The feature is seen primarily in the lower troposphere from about November to February with strong concomitant increase in CO, aerosol optical depth and tropospheric ozone columns. The height resolved aerosol data from CALIPSO confirm the trapping of the pollution pool at the lowest altitudes. The observations indicate that MOPITT can capture this low altitude phenomenon even in winter conditions {{as indicated by the}} averaging kernels...|$|R
40|$|Tropospheric O 3 column {{estimates}} are produced and evaluated from spaceborne O 3 observations by the subtraction of assimilated O 3 profile observations from total column observations, the so-called Tropospheric O 3 ReAnalysis or TORA method. Here we apply the TORA method {{to six years}} (1996 – 2001) of ERS- 2 GOME/TOMS total O 3 and ERS- 2 GOME O 3 profile observations using the TM 5 global chemistry-transport model with a linearized O 3 photochemistry parameterization scheme. Free running TM 5 simulations show good agreement with O 3 sonde observations in the upper-tropospheric and lower stratospheric region (UTLS), both for short day-to-day variability {{as well as for}} monthly means. The assimilation of GOME O 3 profile observations counteracts the mid-latitude stratospheric O 3 drift caused by the overstrong stratospheric meridional circulation in TM 5. Assimilation of GOME O 3 profile observations also improves the bias and correlations in the tropical UTLS region but slightly degrades the model-to-sonde correlations and bias of extra-tropical UTLS. We suggest that this degradation is related to the large ground pixel size of the GOME O 3 measurements (960 × 100 km) in combination with retrieval and calibration errors. The added value of the assimilation of GOME O 3 profiles compared to stand-alone model simulations lays in the long term variations of stratospheric O 3, not in short term synoptic variations. The evaluation of daily and monthly tropospheric O 3 columns obtained from total column observations and using the TORA methodology shows that the use of GOME UV-VIS nadir O 3 profiles in combination with the spatial resolution of the model does not result in satisfactory <b>residual</b> tropospheric <b>ozone</b> columns...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{bicarbonate}} on the characteristic transformation of fulvic acid (FA) and its subsequent trichloromethane formation potential (TCMFP) were investigated {{in the process}} of preozonation. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal rate and the <b>residual</b> aqueous <b>ozone</b> concentration during preozonation were measured with different bicarbonate concentration. The presence of bicarbonate inhibited DOC removal and decreased TCMFP yields in the initial oxidation period. In order to explain these phenomena, the molecular weight (MW) distribution ( 30 kDa) and corresponding TCMFP were investigated for FA and its subsequent oxidation products. Furthermore, transformation of molecular structure, based on MW distribution, was also characterized with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum. Bicarbonate showed different inhibiting effects on TCMFP of organic species with different MW, and more significant TCMFP decrement was observed for the high MW fraction (> 30 kDa) than for the low MW fractions. Preozonation led to obvious reduction on DOC and UV 254 in most of MW fractions wherever bicarbonate was present or not, demonstrating that ozone contributed to both organics mineralization and structure variation, synchronously. As being indicated from the results of FTIR and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the functional groups such as alcohols, epoxides and phenols, the formation of which was promoted with hydroxyl radicals ((OH) -O-center dot) and would be remarkably inhibited by bicarbonate, were responsible for the increment of TCM precursor&# 39;s concentration during ozonation. Results of these studies confirmed low dosage bicarbonate affecting the ozonation pathways, influencing the intermediate species formation and impacting its subsequent TCMFP yields through inhibiting the (OH) -O-center dot radicals reactions mainly occurred in high MW fractions.
