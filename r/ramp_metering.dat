2500|$|The {{root cause}} of the high {{congestion}} on the urban section of the M8 is that traffic from the M73 and M80 is forced onto the eastern section of M8 which within [...] converges from five lanes to two on the Kingston Bridge approaches. The result of this is often long periods of traffic congestion. Prior {{to the construction of}} the M74 extension, incentives were undertaken in an attempt to minimise delays on this section; these include restricting exits around the Kingston Bridge, a <b>ramp</b> <b>metering</b> programme, and expanded use of electronic signing above and beside the motorway as part of the CITRAC (Centrally Integrated TRAffic Control) system.|$|E

As recurrent congestion and the number of vehicles on urban freeways in Texas have increased, the ability to effectively meter traffic using single-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>meters</b> has deteriorated. Other state departments of transportation experiencing similar conditions have developed and implemented multi-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>meters</b> to address the increased demand volumes and variable on-ramp arrival patterns. These multi-lane systems have increased operational flexibility and available storage area compared to traditional single-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>meters.</b> The primary objective of this research was to evaluate the feasibility of designing and operating dual-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>meters</b> on frontage road/freeway slip-ramps commonly found in Texas in a safe and efficient manner. This assessment included a review and analysis of the geometric, traffic control, and operational elements necessary to operate this freeway management strategy. Based on an analysis of existing single-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>meter</b> traffic control parameters and operations, three primary evaluation criteria were established {{that could be used to}} determine the feasibility of operating a dual-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>meter</b> at a study site in Houston. These evaluation criteria included the ability to design and construct a dual-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>meter</b> on a frontage road/freeway slip-ramp configuration that adheres to the Texas Department of Transportation's engineering and safety requirements and economic considerations; the ability to meter a wide-range of on-ramp demand volumes and manage various arrival-type patterns; and the ability to contain queues within the on-ramp queue storage reservoir without spill-backs occurring on the adjacent frontage road. The conceptual dual-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>meter</b> design was examined both qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to the three established evaluation criteria. This evaluation included the analysis of the geometric design and construction evaluation, a comparative analysis of single-lane and dual-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>meters,</b> and a microscopic simulation analysis. The microscopic simulation analysis was used to compare the existing and proposed <b>ramp</b> <b>meter</b> configurations and to demonstrate the traffic control and operational flexibility of the dual-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>meter</b> design strategy. Based on these analyses and evaluations, the design and operation of a dual-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>meter</b> on a frontage road/freeway slip-ramp configuration was deemed feasible...|$|R

In 2000, the <b>ramp</b> <b>meters</b> were turned off for a study period mandated by the Minnesota Legislature. The bill was backed by Republican State Senator Dick Day of Owatonna, Minnesota, who has often been critical of MnDOT policies and projects. The study showed that <b>ramp</b> <b>meters</b> {{reduce the number of}} crashes on highways, and marginally reduce travel time in many cases. However, the study also showed some places where the meters were more of a hindrance, and metering strategies have been altered since that time. There are about 430 <b>ramp</b> <b>meters</b> and more than 450 traffic cameras in the Twin Cities metro area.|$|R

Two variations of demand reduction are commonly cited; one being access rate, the other diversion.

5000|$|The {{first trial}} in the UK was on the M6 J10 near Walsall in 1986. No more sites were {{developed}} {{for the next two}} decades until a second 'pilot' study in 2006 by the Highways Agency (HA) concluded that <b>ramp</b> <b>metering</b> provides a net benefit under certain conditions - generally more congested junctions. A Summary Report by the HA, dated November 2007, includes an overview of the background and history, international experience, limitations, system operation, algorithms and implementation of <b>ramp</b> <b>metering.</b> In its conclusion it [...] "envisaged <b>ramp</b> <b>metering</b> will be deployed more widely in the coming period." [...] <b>Ramp</b> <b>metering</b> was then introduced widely in England - Phase 1 involved the implementation of approximately 30 sites and was completed by 2008. Phase 2 followed and as of March 2011 there are 88 <b>Ramp</b> <b>Metering</b> sites on the 4,500 miles of strategic highways operated and maintained by the HA.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>ramp</b> <b>metering</b> in the Netherlands was {{introduced}} in 1989. <b>Ramp</b> <b>metering</b> is being introduced more widely in the Netherlands after a pilot study by the AVV Transport Research Centre which concluded that <b>ramp</b> <b>metering</b> can provide a small benefit for the traffic flow on the highway, leading to a higher capacity. Ramp meters can also contribute to decreasing 'rat running'. By 2006 50 ramp meters were installed. This number increases by 4 to 5 each year.|$|E

However, <b>ramp</b> <b>meters</b> remain controversial, and the Minnesota State Department of Transportation has developed new ramp control strategies.

There are also various Ramp Meters on the inner-city section of the Calder Freeway. Brisbane's Pacific Motorway and Bruce Highway (S/Bound Caboolture - Gateway Mwy) also uses <b>Ramp</b> <b>metering</b> on some on-ramps.
