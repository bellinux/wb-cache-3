5|$|As a result, the fielding of {{a respectable}} hoplite army without mercenaries or freed helots was difficult. Cleomenes {{increased}} the number of full citizens again and made the Spartan army operate with an increased reliance on more lightly armored phalangites of the Macedonian style. However, many of these restored citizens were killed in the Battle of Sellasia and Nabis' politics drove the remainder of them into exile. In consequence, the heavy troops were no longer available in sufficient numbers. This led to a serious decline in Sparta's military power, and the aim of Nabis reforms was to reestablish a class of loyal subjects capable of serving as well-equipped phalangites (operating in a close and deep formation, with a longer spear than the hoplites'). Nabis' liberation of the enslaved helots {{was one of the most}} outstanding deeds in Spartan history. With this action, Nabis eliminated a central ideological pillar of the old Spartan social system and the chief <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>objection</b> to Spartan expansion by the surrounding poleis (city-states). Guarding against helot revolt had been, until this time, the central concern of Spartan foreign policy, and the need to protect against internal revolt had limited adventurism abroad; Nabis' action abolished this concern with a single stroke. His freed helots received land from him and were wedded to wealthy wives of the exiled Spartan demos (all former full citizens) and widows of the rich elite, whose husbands had been killed at his orders.|$|E

Biosafety {{refers to the}} need to protect {{human health and the environment}} from the possible adverse effects of the products of modern biotechnology. Accordingly all countries to the convention are required to put in place regulatory mechanisms to enhance the safety of biotechnology in the context of the Convention’s overall goal of reducing all potential threats to biological diversity, while taking into account the risks to human health. Therefore each country party to the convention has its own procedures to enact laws to guide the safe use of biotechnology. In Uganda the process involves the drafting of the bill by the first parliamentary counsel, approval by cabinet, first reading at the parliament, committal to the responsible parliamentary sessional committee, tabling of the bill for public hearing, consultations, and final approval.

However, parents' negative reactions to being informed that their children are overweight or obese can hinder their engagement with relevant services. The present study aimed to develop a deeper understanding of why parents react negatively, to help commissioners and service providers design services that are more acceptable to them. Design Open, qualitative responses to a survey were collected using a postal questionnaire. Responses were analysed using content analysis. Setting One local authority in south-west England. Subjects The sample frame included all parents receiving letters informing them that their child was overweight (91 st- 98 th centile) or very overweight (98 th- 100 th centile) through the UK National Child Measurement Programme in 2012. Results Forty-five of 313 eligible parents (14 %) responded to the survey, of whom forty-three rejected either to the judgement that their child was overweight and/or being provided with this feedback. Primary <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>objection</b> included: lack of trust in the measures used, lack of belief that being overweight is important for children's health (relative to a healthy lifestyle), and fear that discussing weight with children will trigger eating disorders. In addition, parents' responses suggested that they considered receiving this feedback to be a criticism of their parenting skills. Conclusions Overall, three areas for improving communication with parents were suggested: tailoring letters; providing information about the importance of weight independently of lifestyle; and addressing parents' concerns about the risks of talking to children about their weight...|$|R

Conscience and conscientious objection are explicitly defined based on a literature survey, and reflective equilibrium is used to assess evidence from law, policy, and published sources. The author concludes that current strategies fail to meet moral obligations to rural nurses and physicians and recommends a strategy of accountability and openness requiring physicians, nurses, and administrators to defend their <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> conscientious <b>objection</b> and expecting peers and subordinates to respect objections that qualify as conscience based.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{ascertain}} and analyse attitudes towards wind energy at a significant time for urban Tasmania. In {{the latter half of}} 2009, in and around the capital city of Hobart, wind energy developments were proposed for the first time. This study compiled and analysed community attitudes towards three specific development proposals: atop the ANZ Bank Building in the Hobart CBD; atop the Marine Board Building on the Hobart waterfront; and in the car park of the Lindisfarne Medical Centre. The research represents an opportunity to assess local attitudes towards wind energy, pre-development. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate attitudes amongst local residents towards these three developments, and explore how these might be shaped by general environmental attitudes, sense of place, and attitudes towards wind energy, both generally and locally. The presence of a Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) mentality was also explored. The primary method used was a survey of two subpopulations of local residents living in Lindisfarne and South Hobart. Details of the three proposals — and their paths to ultimate approval — were identified through the use of local newspaper articles, media reports, development applications, and relevant city council documents. This survey employed a Likert scale questionnaire which was administered in early November 2009 within three predetermined locations according to a modified mail-based method. In an effort to identify and understand influences on support levels for the three local developments, the questionnaire included six separate sections: demographic characteristics; general environmental views; attitudes towards energy and innovation; feelings of suburban attachment; and attitudes towards wind energy both generally and locally. Statistical analyses were carried out on the resultant data. High levels of awareness and recognition regarding the environment, the state of the earth, and the need to reduce fossil fuel usage were apparent from the results. Additionally, widespread general support of wind energy was established amongst respondents, as were widespread feelings of attachment towards their suburb of residence. Regarding the specific local wind energy development proposals however, support levels experienced a drop-off. This indicates a gap between general wind energy support and support for specific, local wind energy developments. Rather, perceived local impacts such as aesthetic infringements and noise level concerns dominated the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>objection,</b> and only limited support was found for the NIMBY hypothesis. Respondents exhibited tendencies to support or oppose all developments, regardless of their varying locations.

The palm oil sector made a significant contribution to the recovery of the Indonesian economy following the 1997 Asian Crisis (Susila 2004). The economic recovery enabled the state to bring back its role in facilitating palm oil sector development, but this time the state faced increasing pressure to address sustainability issues (Pramudya et al., 2017 a). The reluctance to develop further partnerships within RSPO occurred {{at the onset of the}} rising confidence of the state to improve its facilitation roles. In the meantime, Varkkey (2016) mentioned that patronage politics from business had increasing influence on policy makers, contributing to the palm oil expansion at the expense of environmental and social needs. Patronage politics partially provided <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the <b>objection</b> of the Indonesian state in supporting the disqualification of palm oil producers that could not comply with IPOP’s pledges; this was done with the reasoning that it would protect smallholders, yet meanwhile the state did not provide reasonable solutions directing smallholders towards improved sustainable development practices. The attitude used by InPOP to approach and strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture’s role in the sustainable palm oil issue received a positive response as it did not conduct open confrontation with the government.|$|R
