25|$|Whereas a {{national}} <b>recession</b> <b>is</b> identified by two quarters of decline, defining a global <b>recession</b> <b>is</b> more difficult, because a Developing country {{is expected to}} have a higher GDP growth than a Developed country. According to the IMF, the real GDP growth of the emerging and developing countries is on an uptrend and that of advanced economies is on a downtrend since late 1980s. The world growth is projected to slow from 5% in 2007 to 3.75% in 2008 and to just over 2% in 2009. Downward revisions in GDP growth vary across regions. Among the most affected are commodity exporters, and countries with acute external financing and liquidity problems. Countries in East Asia (including China) have suffered smaller declines because their financial situations are more robust. They have benefited from falling commodity prices and they have initiated a shift toward macroeconomic policy easing.|$|E
25|$|Informally, a {{national}} <b>recession</b> <b>is</b> {{a period of}} declining economic output. In a 1974 New York Times article, Julius Shiskin suggested several rules of thumb to identify a recession, which included two successive quarterly declines in gross domestic product (GDP), {{a measure of the}} nation's output. This two-quarter metric is now a commonly held definition of a recession. In the United States, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is regarded as the authority which identifies a recession and which takes into account several measures in addition to GDP growth before making an assessment. In many developed nations (but not the United States), the two-quarter rule is also used for identifying a recession.|$|E

Market strategist Jeremy Grantham stated flatly that the EMH {{was responsible for the}} current {{financial crisis}}, claiming that belief in the hypothesis caused financial leaders to have a [...] "chronic underestimation of the dangers of asset bubbles breaking". Noted financial journalist Roger Lowenstein blasted the theory, declaring [...] "The upside of the current Great <b>Recession</b> <b>is</b> that it could drive a stake through the heart of the academic nostrum known as the efficient-market hypothesis." [...] Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker chimed in, saying it's [...] "clear that among the causes of the recent financial crisis was an unjustified faith in rational expectations [...] market efficiencies." [...] "By 2007–2009, you had to be a fanatic to believe in the literal truth of the EMH", noted one financial analyst.|$|E

Reagan also promised an end to [...] "'trust me' government" [...] and to restore economic health by implementing a supply-side economic policy. Reagan promised a balanced budget within three years (which he said would be [...] "the {{beginning of the end of}} inflation"), accompanied by a 30% reduction in tax rates over those same years. With respect to the economy, Reagan famously said, [...] "A <b>recession</b> <b>is</b> when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his." [...] Reagan also criticized the [...] "windfall profit tax" [...] that Carter and Congress enacted that year in regards to domestic oil production and promised to attempt to repeal it as president. The tax was not a tax on profits, but on the difference between the price control-mandated price and the market price.|$|E
2500|$|A large {{contribution}} to the <b>recession</b> <b>is</b> due to the closure and suspension of thousands of banks across the country. The causation of these failing financial institutions come from several reasons including unregulated lending procedures, confidence in the Gold standard, consumer confidence in future economics, and agricultural defaults on outstanding loans. With these compacting issues the banking system struggled {{to keep up with}} the high demand of cash withdraws from the public. This impact overall decreased the money supply and forced the banks to result to short sale (real estate) and liquidation of existing loans. In the race to liquidate assets the banking system began to fail on a wide scale. In November 1930 the first major banking crisis begun with over 800 banks closing their doors by January 1931; over 2100 banks will be suspended by October 1931, with the highest suspension rate recorded in the St. Louis Federal Reserve District with 2 out of every 5 banks suspended. The economy in whole experienced a massive reduction in banking footholds across the country amounting to more than nine thousand closed banks by 1933.|$|E
40|$|The gingival <b>recession</b> <b>was</b> {{assessed}} in 380 adult individuals aged more than 20 years and comprised both subjects being treated {{and looking for}} treatment at Bauru Dental School. Clinical evaluation was conducted by a single examiner in all teeth and involved analysis of four dental aspects (mesial, buccal, distal and lingual). The gingival <b>recession</b> <b>was</b> regarded as present whenever more than 1 mm of root surface was exposed, and its vertical width was measured in millimeters from the cementoenamel junction to the gingival margin. The <b>recessions</b> <b>were</b> further scored following the criteria suggested by Miller in 1985. Gingival <b>recession</b> <b>was</b> observed {{in at least one}} dental surface in about 89 % of the individuals analyzed. The prevalence, extension and severity of this clinical aspect increased with age. Class I <b>recessions</b> <b>were</b> the most frequent, yet there was a gradual increase of Class III and IV recessions as older subjects were evaluated. The mandibular teeth displayed more surfaces with gingival recession than the maxillary teeth and the mandibular incisors were the most affected teeth.

2500|$|Series four, [...] (2011), {{comprising}} ten episodes, sees Torchwood {{having been}} reduced {{to the status of}} legend following Children of Earth. The narrative follows two CIA agents (Mekhi Phifer and Alexa Havins) who discover Torchwood on the same day death ceases to occur, due to an event known as Miracle Day. The agents join Gwen and Jack as they seek to restore death to the world. While primarily a conspiracy thriller, the series also examines the depths humanity can sink to under pressure. Actress Arlene Tur portrays a surgeon who challenges the failing medical system and shifting government legislation. The characters of Oswald Danes (Bill Pullman) and Jilly Kitzinger (Lauren Ambrose) are used to highlight the precariousness of fame and the amorality of the media. The late-2000s global <b>recession</b> <b>is</b> implicated as another element of the Miracle Day conspiracy. Though largely set in the USA, Wales remains a key setting. The origins of the Miracle Day conspiracy are revealed in a 1920s flashback in [...] "Immortal Sins", as the worldwide scale of the story takes the protagonists to Shanghai and Buenos Aires in the finale [...] "The Blood Line". In the epilogue, Gwen questions Jack whether he will stay to reform Torchwood; he does not provide an answer.|$|E
