The molten metal is centrifugally flung off the bar, cools down and is collected.

5000|$|The {{production}} of ML(n-1)+ in the reaction above by the [...] "following" [...] chemical reaction produces a species {{directly at the}} electrode that could display redox chemistry anywhere in a CV plot or none at all. The change in coordination from MLn+ to ML(n-1)+ often prevents the observation of [...] "reversible" [...] behavior during electrochemical experiments like cyclic voltammetry. On the forward scan the expected diffusion wave is observed, in example above the reduction of MLn2+ to MLn1+. However, on the return scan the corresponding wave is not observed, in the example above {{this would be the}} wave corresponding to the oxidation of MLn1+ to MLn2+. In our example there is no MLn1+ to oxidize since it has been converted to ML(n-1)+ through ligand loss. The return wave can sometimes be observed by increasing the scan rates so the following chemical reaction can be observed before the chemical reaction takes place. This often requires the use of ultramicroelectrodes (UME) capable of very high scan rates of 0.5 to 5.0 V/s. Plots of forward and reverse peak ratios against modified forms of the scan rate often identify the rate of the chemical reaction. It has become a common practice to model such plots with electrochemical simulations. The results of such studies are of disputed practical relevance since simulation requires excellent experimental data, better than that routinely obtained and reported. Furthermore, the parameters of such studies are rarely reported and often include an unreasonably high variable to data ratio (ref?). A better practice is to look for a simple, well documented relationship between observed results and implied phenomena; or to investigate a specific physical phenomenon using an alternative technique such as chronoamperometry or those involving a <b>rotating</b> <b>electrode.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Rotated</b> <b>electrode</b> voltammetry, a {{subclass}} of voltammetry, is {{technique in}} which the working <b>electrode</b> usually a <b>rotating</b> disk <b>electrode</b> (RDE) or <b>rotating</b> ring-disk <b>electrode</b> (RRDE) is <b>rotated</b> {{at a very high}} rate (2000 to 10,000 (?)

This technique was made popular through the work of the Russian electrochemist, Benjamin Levich. This technique is useful for studying the kinetics and electrochemical reaction mechanism for a half reaction. This technique {{is part of a larger}} class of electroanalytical methods known as hydrodynamic voltammetry (see also hydrodynamics).|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{cyclic voltammetry}} {{is not a}} {{hydrodynamic}} technique, useful electrochemical methods are. In such cases, flow is achieved at the electrode surface by stirring the solution, pumping the solution, or <b>rotating</b> the <b>electrode</b> {{as is the case}} with <b>rotating</b> disk <b>electrodes</b> and <b>rotating</b> ring-disk <b>electrodes.</b> Such techniques target steady state conditions and produce waveforms that appear the same when scanned in either the positive or negative directions, thus limiting them to linear sweep voltammetry.|$|R

Among the most common hydrodynamic setup involves the working <b>electrodes</b> <b>rotating</b> to create a laminar flow of solution across the <b>electrode</b> surface.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this effort was on the {{development}} of an advanced fuel for gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR) applications. This composite design is based on carbide fuel kernels dispersed in a ZrC matrix. The choice of ZrC is based on its high temperature properties and good thermal conductivity and improved retention of fission products to temperatures beyond that of traditional SiC based coated particle fuels. A key component of this study was the development and understanding of advanced fabrication techniques for GFR fuels that have potential to reduce minor actinide (MA) losses during fabrication owing to their higher vapor pressures and greater volatility. The major accomplishments of this work were the study of combustion synthesis methods for fabrication of the ZrC matrix, fabrication of high density UC electrodes for use in the <b>rotating</b> <b>electrode</b> process, production of UC particles by <b>rotating</b> <b>electrode</b> method, integration of UC kernels in the ZrC matrix, and the full characterization of each component.
