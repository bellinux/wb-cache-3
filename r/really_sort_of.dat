500|$|Chris Hillman, {{who played}} bass guitar with the Byrds, saw the Beau Brummels at a Los Angeles concert, and later remarked: [...] "I {{remember}} them doing the hit they had, 'Laugh, Laugh.' They <b>really</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> answered the Beatles before we did, in that sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Krankel and Hines {{looked at}} other story-focused games, {{and felt that}} they either were linear stories driven by set pieces, or branching, player choice-influenced stories [...] told through cut scenes. [...] "We thought, why not let you move freely while communicating, interacting, and {{exploring}} a branching narrative?" [...] Krankel recalled. [...] "The first thing {{we wanted to do}} is make a game where communication is <b>really</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they do with all the other narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, where you could walk and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things." [...] Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell.|$|E
500|$|In late 1966, Redding {{returned}} to the Stax studio and recorded several tracks, including [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", written by Jimmy Campbell, Reg Connelly and Harry M. Woods in 1932. [...] This song had previously been covered by Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, and the publishers unsuccessfully tried to stop Redding from recording the song from a [...] "negro perspective". [...] Today often considered his signature song, [...] Jim Stewart reckoned, [...] "If there's one song, one performance that <b>really</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> sums up Otis and what he's about, it's 'Try a Little Tenderness'. [...] That one performance is so special and so unique that it expresses who he is." [...] On this version Redding was backed by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, while staff producer Isaac Hayes worked on the arrangement. [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] was included on his next album, [...] [...] The song and the album were critically and commercially successful—the former peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and at number 4 on the R chart.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} titled after the {{recurring}} theme {{of water in}} songs such as [...] "Diving for Hearts" [...] and [...] "I Would Like to Call It Beauty", while the music was said by Rae to possess [...] "a kind of tidal movement to it too, {{in the way that}} we recorded the songs. You know, sometimes it would just be me and my guitar. Then we'd <b>really</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> swell up into these big arrangements, only to then retreat back to it just being me and my guitar again." [...] According to Chris Mugan from The Independent, The Sea was a departure from the polished sound of Rae's debut album, while Paste magazine's Steve Labate said Rae expanded on her debut's mix of contemporary R and older soul music by incorporating pop rock, singer-songwriter influences, and occasional elements of bossa nova and trip hop. In the opinion of Craig McLean from The Daily Telegraph, the record's music evoked Simone's singing and the 1968 Van Morrison album Astral Weeks.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{character}} of Rapunzel, Mandy Moore said that Rapunzel was a relatable character and called her a [...] "Renaissance, bohemian" [...] woman rather than a typical Disney princess: Moore said [...] " [...] doesn't know she's a princess [...] She's just <b>really</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> motivated {{to find out what}} else is out there beyond this crazy tower she's lived in for 18 years," [...] and that [...] "she's very independent, she can take care of herself, and she's definitely come up with really entertaining ways to keep herself busy." [...] Moore also stated that she herself had little influence on Rapunzel: [...] "The character was developed way before I {{had anything to do with}} it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of {{his early}} days, Capote related, [...] "I began writing <b>really</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> seriously when I was about eleven. I say seriously {{in the sense}} that like other kids go home and {{practice}} the violin or the piano or whatever, I used to go home from school every day, and I would write for about three hours. I was obsessed by it." [...] In 1935, he attended the Trinity School in New York City. He then attended St. Joseph Military Academy. In 1939, the Capote family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, and Truman attended Greenwich High School, where he wrote for both the school's literary journal, The Green Witch, and the school newspaper. When they returned to New York City in 1942, he attended the Franklin School, an Upper West Side private school now known as the Dwight School, and graduated in 1943. That was the end of his formal education.|$|E
5000|$|... "Terror marketing" [...] {{to recruit}} new fighters is another motivation.

25|$|Mathematical realism, like realism in general, {{holds that}} {{mathematical}} entities exist {{independently of the}} human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. In this point of view, there is <b>really</b> one <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> mathematics that can be discovered; triangles, for example, are real entities, not the creations of the human mind.|$|R
5000|$|A {{member of}} the Rose City Copwatch group, which seeks to [...] "disrupt the polices ability to enforce race and class lines", says that the {{shooting}} [...] "demonstrates a culture of racism and brutality that's <b>really</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> {{at the core of}} policing". A grand jury later found no criminal wrongdoing on McCollister's part.|$|E

5000|$|Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 3 {{star rating}} out of 5, stating: [...] "Yeah, sure, the victims in Grimm Season 6 Episode 9 were all vile, nature-destroying malefactors, {{but what a}} way to go...!

50|$|I’m {{far more}} excited about {{anything}} currently, I’m enjoying more, I’ve read more, I’ve seen more. No nostalgia at all. A {{couple of good}} records … that I heard. Did some great travelling, but I travel better now, I was <b>really</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> medicined up. I didn’t enjoy touring as much, we were doing some touring through Europe and the States and I enjoy doing those tours more now. I enjoy everything about touring and being in the band more now. I don’t think back on it anything less than fondly, but I’m so much happier at 42 than I was at 26.|$|E
5000|$|Band member Adam Spark said: [...] ""The Saddest Thing I Know" [...] {{was a funny}} one, we’re {{not really}} sure where it came from, it’s sort of like this bluesy, drug trip - hence the <b>really</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> weird video. We had these dancing geisha girls/stripper neon acid thing going on. We ended up {{recording}} the piano three times for that one because every time we’d {{open the door to}} the studio, snow would come in as we were in the middle of winter in Sweden, and it kept ruining all the tracks and everything wouldn’t line up with it. It was a cold one, a very cold one, that one." ...|$|E

Ellis-Bextor later talked on the chart success the song had, [...] "It just didn't get heard by enough people, [...] I suppose as well it felt {{slightly}} frustrating {{because it was a}} slightly different style of song for me, and I <b>really</b> got <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> punished for it." ...|$|R

5000|$|I've {{been saying}} {{a lot of stuff}} that I didn't really believe in.

[...] So I wrote a number that touches on reincarnation, then goes into the absurd, with Father Christmas and the whole bit and right at the end just to prevent the heads from thinking that I did believe in everything like I was saying, 'cause they always seem to believe that you actually believe in your own words. I believe in some of them but not all of them, so I just wrote the joke in to throw them off, and it's done it.|$|E
5000|$|Tritt made {{a request}} {{for members of the}} Eagles to appear in his video for the song, and the {{resulting}} video for Tritt's version featured the Eagles lineup from 1978 to 1980 (Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Don Felder, Joe Walsh and Timothy B.

Frey, who had previously been reluctant to reunite with the band, later said: [...] "After years passed, you <b>really</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> remember that you were friends first ...

A new album, Hell Freezes Over, was released and a tour launched the following year.|$|E
