The synovial membrane encloses each joint and also secretes a lubricating fluid that allows different joint motions such as <b>rolling,</b> <b>folding</b> and stretching.

40|$|Abstract. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) {{constitute}} a unique class of materials that undergo a reversible phase transformation allowing {{the material to}} display dramatic stress-induced and temperature-induced deformations which are recoverable. Nickel Titanium (NiTi) SMA has be synthesized with refined grain size by a mechanical alloying process. The SMA is produced through a cold rolling fabrication strategy that yields nanocrystalline product structures. By starting with a stacked sandwich array of individual alloy components and subjecting this sample arrangement to repeated <b>rolling</b> and <b>folding,</b> a metal-metal multilayer composite is created. After the layer thickness is reduced to the nanoscale by multiple cold <b>rolling</b> and <b>folding</b> passes, an alloying and intermediate phase formation reaction is initiated. X-ray diffraction profiles confirm that the primary phase present is intermetallic NiTi phase, which is the phase that displays shape memory behavior. The presence of superelastic behavior and the shape memory effect in the product material is established by mechanical testing. At this refined grain size, the hysteresis stress observed is exceptionally small...|$|R

40|$|Invited {{to present}} this large scale {{installation}} at Central Space, London Plowman was subsequently invited to re-present and continue {{working on the}} installation at the Angel Row Gallery in Nottingham from 28. 6. 03 to 19. 07. 03. The installation was installed at Angel Row in the state it was in {{at the end of}} its Central space showing. In this installation Plowman explores his research interest in the temporal aspect of making art and the everyday. The installation becomes a metaphor for life itself, the tedium and boredom we experience that highlight the temporal aspect of our existence, the everyday. Consisting of 13 ‘areas of activity’, sheets of tracing paper each approx 3600 x 2400 mm, laid out on the gallery floor. At one end of the gallery was a wooden viewing platform, 2500 x 2400 x 2000 mm accessed by stairs. Each of these areas of activity contained off the shelf stationery material such as pencils, paper, elastic bands, erasers etc. During the course of the exhibition Plowman worked two four hour shifts on alternate days carrying out a series of relentless and repetitive activities each shift. These included sharpening, bundling, stacking, <b>rolling,</b> <b>folding</b> etc. Field of Activity is a work in a constant state of flux. The audience viewed Plowman working by accessing the viewing platform and using binoculars to zoom in on him working. Plowman photographically documented the progress and development of the installation after finishing each activity. At the Angel Row Gallery only, each day one of Plowman’s activities was filmed, this footage was played on a video monitor in the gallery in the days when Plowman was not working.

5000|$|Parachuting is {{a method}} of {{swallowing}} drugs by <b>rolling</b> or <b>folding</b> powdered or crushed drugs {{in a piece of}} toilet paper (or other similar paper) to ingest while avoiding the taste of the chemical. It is sometimes called a [...] "snow bomb", especially if using cocaine.This method is used among many pharmaceuticals that are commonly crushed for recreational use. The toilet paper method must use single ply toilet paper or one must separate the layers of double ply. Tissues are also a common go to for this method of drug ingestion. Another common paper used is rolling paper for smoking herbal substances. Opioids and other narcotics, amphetamines, and benzodiazepines are also commonly parachuted to avoid unpleasant tastes. This method's purpose is recreational because it is all absorbed at once when the paper unravels in one's stomach.|$|R
40|$|Shrinkage {{behavior}} and crack formation during firing {{have been investigated}} for Al 2 O 3 /Ce-TZP composites that have been fabricated by colloidal <b>rolling</b> and <b>folding.</b> These com-posites show improved sinterability and sinter isotropically after repeated rolling. Interface instability in rolling creates corrugated interfaces with large layer waviness; therefore, rolling can substantially alleviate the in-plane sintering constraints, which leads to improved sinterability. A loss of sintering anisotropy also is observed and is directly corre-lated to the microstructure instability, which is coincident with the laminate–cellular transition. Sintering cracks dur-ing heating and thermal cracks during cooling both are limited to the thick Ce-TZP layers in the composites. The critical layer thickness and the normalized crack spacing of the thermal cracks follow the predicted behavior of elastic-ity theory. Thus, crack-free, high-density Al 2 O 3 /Ce-TZP composites with either a laminate or cellular microstruc-ture can be obtained, with a layer thickness of 4 – 60 µm, via pressureless sintering.

40|$|Conventional {{three-dimensional}} crystal lattices are terminated by surfaces, {{which can}} demonstrate complex rebonding and rehybridisation, localised strain and dislocation formation. Two dimensional crystal lattices, of which graphene is the archetype, are terminated by lines.

We show that graphene sheet edges can adopt a range of topological distortions depending on their nature. Rehybridisation, local bond reordering, chemical functionalisation with bulky, charged, or multi-functional groups can lead to edge buckling to relieve strain, <b>folding,</b> <b>rolling</b> and even tube formation.

40|$|Large dsRNA {{molecules}} {{can cause}} potent cytotoxic and immunostimulatory effects through the activation of pattern recognition receptors; however, synthetic versions of these molecules are mostly limited to simple sequences like poly-I:C and poly-A:U. Here {{we show that}} large RNA molecules generated by <b>rolling</b> circle transcription <b>fold</b> into periodic-shRNA (p-shRNA) structures and cause potent cytotoxicity and gene silencing when delivered to cancer cells. We determined structural requirements for the dumbbell templates used to synthesize p-shRNA, and showed that these molecules likely adopt a co-transcriptionally folded structure. The cytotoxicity of p-shRNA was robustly observed across four different cancer cell lines using two different delivery systems. Despite having a considerably different folded structure than conventional dsRNA, the cytotoxicity of p-shRNA was either equal to or substantially {{greater than that of}} poly-I:C depending on the delivery vehicle. Furthermore, p-shRNA caused greater NF-κB activation in SKOV 3 cells compared to poly-I:C, indicating that it is a powerful activator of innate immunity. The tuneable sequence and combined gene silencing, immunostimulatory and cytotoxic capacity of p-shRNA make it an attractive platform for cancer immunotherapy. United States.
