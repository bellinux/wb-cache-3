40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} differences in acute and chronic <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> (AF) “organization” in canine models. BACKGROUNDElectrophysiologic changes occur during atrial remodeling, but little is known about how remodeling affects AF organization. We hypothesized that atrial remodeling induced by long-term <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> rates heterogeneously decreases AF organization. METHODSIn seven dogs, acute AF was induced by atrial burst pacing, and in eight dogs chronic AF was created by six weeks of continuous <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing. <b>Atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> was epicardially mapped from the right atria (RA) and left atria (LA). Atrial cycle length (CL), spatial organization and activation maps were compared. Spatial organization was quantified by an objective signal processing measure between multiple electrograms. RESULTSIn acute AF, mean CL was slightly shorter in the LA (124 ± 16 ms) than it was in the RA (131 ± 14 ms) (p < 0. 0001). In chronic AF, LA CL (96 ± 14 ms) averaged 24 ms shorter than RA CL (121 ± 18 ms) (p < 0. 0001). Right atria and LA in acute AF had similar levels of organization. In chronic AF, the LA became ∼ 25 % more disorganized (p < 0. 0001) while the RA did not change. In acute AF, a single broad wave front originating from the posterior and medial atrium dominated LA activation. In chronic AF, LA activation was more complex, sustaining multiple reentrant wavelets in the free wall and lateral appendage. CONCLUSIONSAcute and chronic AF exhibit heterogeneous differences in CL, organization and activation patterns. The LA in chronic AF is faster and more disorganized than it is in acute AF. Differences in the models may be due to heterogeneous electrophysiologic remodeling and anatomic constraints. The design of future AF therapies may benefit by addressing the patient specific degree of atrial remodeling...|$|R

The treatment protocol included a loading dose of 1200  mg intravenous amiodarone in 24  hours, after which amiodarone treatment was continued orally. Eleven of the 20  patients (55 %) converted to sinus rhythm within 48  hours of intravenous amiodarone treatment and were discharged in sinus rhythm, while 9 / 20 (45 %) patients failed to convert during hospitalisation. Six patients (30 %) failed to convert to sinus rhythm even after one further month of oral treatment. There was one death and a high frequency (25 %) of thrombophlebitis during hospitalisation. The in-hospital non-convertors had a significantly lower ejection fraction and initial low ventricular response rate than the convertors. In conclusion, the acute conversion rate by intravenous amiodarone was at best modest.

METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous magnesium sulfate in adult emergency department patients with <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation.</b> Study solutions were given in addition to any therapy the treating physician would normally consider appropriate, {{including the use of}} standard rate-reduction agents. Patients received either 20 mEq (2. 5 g, 10 mmol) magnesium sulfate over a 20 -minute period, followed by 20 mEq (2. 5 g, 10 mmol) over a 2 -hour period intravenously, or placebo. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-nine patients were randomized, 102 to receive magnesium sulfate and 97 to receive placebo. The antiarrhythmic drug most commonly used by treating physicians was digoxin. Magnesium sulfate was more likely than placebo to achieve a pulse rate of less than 100 beats/min (63 [65 %] of 97 versus 32 [34 %] of 93, relative risk [RR] 1. 89; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 38 to 2. 59; P or = 15 beats/min reduction) at any of the measured time points.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess whether}} rapid high voltage {{ventricular}} pacing can also induce <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation,</b> {{and whether the}} induction of <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> during ventricular fibrillation conversion testing {{is related to the}} patient's heart disease.  DESIGN—Prospective study of 50  patients who received the dual chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Ventak AV II DR (Guidant) as a first implant.

Different types of atrial electrograms during <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> have been observed and classified, but their anatomic distribution patterns, determinants and potential usefulness in guiding future catheter ablation are unknown. Methods. Two animal models of <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> were used: the sterile pericarditis model (n = 10) and the <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing model (400 beats/min for 6 weeks, n = 6). The atrial electrogram of <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> and the <b>atrial</b> effective refractory period were obtained from multiple sites of {{the right and left}} atrium. In addition, decremental <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> stimulation was applied to the site of shortest and longest atrial effective refractory periods until <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> induction in a subgroup of nine dogs. Ablation of the intereaval junction was performed using the radiofrequency catheter technique in dogs with <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> duration > 1 min. Results. In both models, organized atrial electrograms (type I) were predominantly observed at the left atrial sites and the right atrial appendage, whereas disorganized atrial electrograms (type III) were mainly observed at the right posterolateral atrium. The distribution of the atrial electrogram types closely followed that of the atrial effective refractory period, with the shortest atrial effective refractory period corresponding to organized atrial electrograms (type I) and the longest atrial effective refractory period corresponding to disorganized atrial electrograms (type III). The correlation of atrial electrogram type with the atrial effective refractory period was further demonstrated by the effect of <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> stimulation. When <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> stimulation was applied to the site with the shortest atrial effective refractory period, disorganized atrial electrograms were observed at sites with the longest atrial effective refractory period, whereas 1 : 1 atrial capture was still present at the stimulation site. Ablation of the intercaval junction made <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> noninducible or tended to shorten the <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> duration (from 26. 4 ± 24. 2 to 8. 8 ± 22. 6 min in the pericarditis group, p = 0. 02, and from 33. 7 ± 29. 2 to 12. 1 ± 23. 8 min in the rapid pacing group, p = 0. 09) bud did not change the atrial electrogram types during <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation.</b> Conclusions.

Electrophysiological investigation revealed counterclockwise AFL. Catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus was performed. Burst pacing from the coronary sinus ostium to confirm the block line of the isthmus induced rapid, regular, ventricular pacing at a rate of 110 bpm. The differential diagnosis of this tachycardia included ectopic atrial tachycardia and pacemaker-mediated, endless loop tachycardia (ELT). We diagnosed this arrhythmia as ELT, because temporary reprogramming of the pacemaker mode from DDD to VVI terminated the tachycardia. In this patient, pacing parameters favored ELT (long atrioventricular delay [AVD] and short postventricular atrial refractory period [PVARP]), and atrioventricular and ventriculoatrial conduction time was prolonged as a result of amiodarone administration. The ELT continued because the rate was lower than the programmed upper tracking rate. Reprogramming the parameter (decreasing AVD and increasing PVARP) resulted in termination of ELT...|$|E

The influence of flecainide on various electrophysiological properties of the accessory pathway with special emphasis on ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation was investigated in 9 patients with severe symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

In 4 patients sustained <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> converted to sinus rhythm. The rate of circus movement tachycardia decreased from 166 /min to 130 /min after flecainide, due to a lengthening of retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction time over the accessory pathway.

40|$|AbstractRapid atrial pacing is {{a useful}} {{technique}} and often the therapy of choice to terminate atrial flutter in patients. However, interruption of <b>atrial</b> flutter by <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing may not always produce sinus rhythm, but rather may result in <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation.</b> Twelve patients with spontaneous atrial flutter that had been present for > 24 h were studied to assess the efficacy of atrial pacing, alone and in combination with procainamide, to convert atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. <b>Rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing for ⩾ 15 s from selected atrial sites at selected pacing rates were performed during atrial flutter. The initial pacing rate was always at a cycle length 10 ms shorter than the atrial flutter cycle length. If atrial flutter persisted after cessation of pacing, it was repeated at progressively shorter cycle lengths until either a rate of 400 beats/min was achieved or <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> was induced. In two patients, atrial Rutter was converted to sinus rhythm with pacing alone. Three patients developed sustained <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> {{as a result of}} the <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing, this rhythm ultimately reverting back to atrial flutter in two. Ten patients received procainamide and 9 of the 10 had lengthening of the atrial flutter cycle length by a mean of 68 ms (1 patient continued to have <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation).</b> Then, using the same atrial pacing protocol, high right atrial pacing alone at a mean cycle length of 227 ms interrupted atrial flutter in all these patients, returning their rhythm to sinus rhythm.

We describe {{a patient with}} a recent chest tube insertion leading to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate that led to multiple inappropriate internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD) shocks. This is the first reported case of this occurring in a patient with an ICD leading to inappropriate shocks. Our elderly patient with emphysema presented with a spontaneous pneumothorax and developed <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> following emergency tube thoracostomy. The patient had a single lead ICD and received multiple inappropriate shocks for the rapid ventricular rate in the therapy zone. Although medical treatment helped stabilize the patient, resolution of the atrial fibrillation occurred only after the chest tubewas removed. In a patientwith a chest tube or other intrathoracic catheters, maintaining a high index of suspicion that chest tube insertions can cause secondary life threatening cardiovascular complications needs to be considered. In such patients, removal of the device proves {{to be the most}} prudent treatment action. 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Mania with {{psychotic}} features presenting following abrupt normalisation of thyroid function {{from severe}} Graves’s disease is reported. Clinical picture: A 33 -year-old man with severe, untreated Graves’s disease was treated aggressively, with rapid restoration of normal serum thyroid hormone levels. Symptoms of mania and psychosis then developed. Treatment: Tme limited antipsychotic medication and continuing medical treatment. Outcome: There was resotution of psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: The association of mania and psychosis with thyroid disease is rare, but aggressive medical treatment and rapid restoration of normal serum thyroid levels {{may increase the}} risk of the emergence of such symptoms. Key words: Graves’s disease, hyperthyroidism, organic mania, psychosis. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry 1997; 31 : 762 - 764 A 33 -year-old man with no past psychiatric history had presented 3 years previously with Graves’s disease a year after he had migrated to New Zealand from a Pacific Island Nation. At that time, he had asymptomatic atrial fibrillation and no psychiatric symptomatology. He subsequently defaulted on follow-up and further treatment. The patient re-presented with severe life-threaten-ing complications of Graves’s disease; and was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit with severe cardiac failure, cardiomegaly, <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation,</b> exo-phthalmos and tremor. There was no pyrexia, alcohol or drug abuse or other medical illnesses. Laboratory tests at that time showed free thyroxine (FT,) levels of 90. 3 pmol/L (normal 10 - 23), free tri-iodothyronine (FTJ levels greater than 30. 6 pmol...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: A recent single-center report {{indicated}} that the performance of atrial fibrillation ablation in patients on uninterrupted warfarin using a conventional deflectable tip electrode ablation catheter may be as safe as periprocedural discontinuation of warfarin and bridging with heparin. Novel multi-electrode array catheters for atrial fibrillation ablation are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. While offering the possibility of more <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> ablation, they are stiffer and necessitate the deployment of larger deflectable transseptal sheaths, and {{it remains to be}} determined if they increase the risk of cardiac perforation and vascular injury. Such potential risks would have implications for a strategy of uninterrupted periprocedural anticoagulation. METHOD AND RESULTS: We audited the safety outcomes of our atrial fibrillation ablation procedures using multi-electrode array ablation catheters in patients on uninterrupted warfarin (CHADS 2 score>or= 2) and in patients not on warfarin (uninterrupted aspirin). Two bleeding complications occurred in 49 patients on uninterrupted warfarin, both of which were managed successfully without longterm sequelae, and no bleeding complication occurred in 32 patients not on warfarin (uninterrupted aspirin). There were no thromboembolic events or other complication with either anticoagulant regimen. CONCLUSION: Despite the larger diameter and increased stiffness of multi-electrode array catheters and their deflectable transseptal sheaths, their use for catheter ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation on uninterrupted warfarin in this single-center experience {{does not appear to be}} unsafe, and thus, an adequately powered multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{tachycardia}} with {{block was}} induced by <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing {{in a patient}} with refractory supraventricular tachycardia {{in an effort to}} control the ventricular rate. It was initially decided to induce <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> as necessary {{with the use of a}} perma-nent radiofrequency-controlled atrial pacemaker. Several days after implantation of the pacemaker, however, <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing produced atrial tachycardia with atrio-ventricular block rather than <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation.</b> Despite this apparent failure, the ven-tricular rate has been adequately controlled by <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing for the past 9 months. Intermittent induction of atrial tachycardia with block with a permanent radiofrequency atrial pacemaker may represent a useful approach to the treatment of patients with refractory supraventricular tachycardia.

40|$|AbstractThe mode {{of onset}} of 103 episodes of <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> lasting ≥ 30 s was studied in 79 {{patients}} with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome during electrophysiologic study. No patient had organic heart disease, and 31 had clinical <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> before study. These 79 patients were then compared with a control group of 53 patients with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome in whom <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> could not be induced. Ninety-five of the 103 episodes were technically suitable for analysis. <b>Atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> invariably began with <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> tachycardia that became progressively disorganized within 10 to 20 cycles. It was initiated during right atrial stimulation (n = 52), right ventricular stimulation (n = 8), reciprocating tachycardia (n = 33) and spontaneously (n = 2). Most episodes started at a high right atrial site regardless of accessory pathway location, with only 19 % of episodes starting at the electrode closest to the accessory pathway. During reciprocating tachycardia (n = 33), either atrial (n = 8) or ventricular (n = 5) extrastimuli initiated <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation.</b> <b>Atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> started at the accessory pathway site in 6 of 20 episodes occurring spontaneously during reciprocating tachycardia. Patients with <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> had a longer PA interval (54 ± 14 versus 42 ± 12 ms, p < 0. 0001), shorter atrial functional refractory period (226 ± 38 versus 240 ± 30 ms, p = 0. 049) and shorter anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway (279 ± 26 versus 304 ± 75 ms, p = 0. 03). Clinical reciprocating tachycardia was documented with equal frequency in both the <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> and control groups (59. 5 % versus 52. 9 %, p = 0. 58). These data suggest that atrial abnormalities independent of the accessory pathway {{play an important role}} in the onset of <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Background Prolonged {{periods of}} <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> or <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing induce {{shortening}} of the atrial {{effective refractory period}} (AERP), which {{is thought to be}} related to the lower success rates of various antifibrillatory treatments when the arrhythmia has lasted for a longer period of time. Methods and Results To investigate whether an increase in intracellular calcium could be the stimulus for electrical remodeling, the effects of verapamil on shortening of the AERP in response to 24 hours of <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing (300 bpm) were studied in five chronically instrumented conscious goats during infusion of saline or verapamil. During <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing, the ventricular rate was kept constant by ventricular pacing (150 bpm). The AERP was measured by programmed electrical stimulation at basic cycle lengths of 430, 300, and 200 ms. Verapamil had no effects on the AERP before <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing. However, in the course of 24 hours of <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing, the AERP shortened significantly less (27 % to 58 %) in the presence of verapamil compared with control (at 430, 300, and 200 ms, P Conclusions Electrical remodeling of the atrium during <b>rapid</b> <b>atrial</b> pacing was significantly attenuated by verapamil.
