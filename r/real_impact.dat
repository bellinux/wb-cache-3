Ján Svorada won stage nine and then stage eleven after dodging a crash that marred the stage's finish. Djamolidine Abdoujaparov out-sprinted {{the rest of the}} field to win the race's tenth stage. The Giro's twelfth stage featured a few categorized climbs as the race made its way into Slovenia for the stage's finish in Kranj. Despite the climbs, the stage ended with a field sprint that was won by Andrea Ferrigato. Italian Michele Bartoli won the race's undulating thirteenth stage by being a part of the stage's initial breakaway and then attacking later on and soloing to the stage's conclusion in Lienz, Austria.|$|E
5|$|As Liberal leader, Thorpe {{provided}} a clear {{contrast with the}} pedestrian images of Wilson and Edward Heath, the Conservative leader since March 1965. He was considerably younger, and much more telegenic. His first years of leadership were problematic; he found himself {{at odds with the}} Young Liberals, who were advocating policies far {{to the left of the}} Liberal mainstream. Their demands for workers' control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from NATO, and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government's rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right among voters. The beneficiaries were the Conservatives, who made spectacular by-election gains at Labour's expense while the Liberals failed to make any <b>real</b> <b>impact.</b> Discontent against Thorpe's leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young Liberals in an attempt to depose him. Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck. The timing of their attempted coup, widely seen in and out of the party as treachery, ensured that on Thorpe's return the party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2.|$|E

5|$|Two more combat {{versions}} of the PanzerI were designed and produced between 1939 and 1942. By this stage, the design concept had been superseded by medium and heavy tanks and neither variant was produced in sufficient numbers to have a <b>real</b> <b>impact</b> {{on the progress of}} the war. These new tanks had nothing in common with either the Ausf.A or B except name. One of these, the Panzer I Ausf.C, was designed jointly between Krauss-Maffei and Daimler-Benz in 1939 to provide an amply armoured and armed reconnaissance light tank. The Ausf.C boasted a completely new chassis and turret, a modern torsion-bar suspension and five Schachtellaufwerk-style interleaved roadwheels. It also had a maximum armor thickness of 30millimeters (1.18in), over twice that of either the Ausf.A or B, and was armed with an EW 141 semi autocannon, with a 50-round drum, firing 7.92mm anti-tank shells. Forty of these tanks were produced, along with six prototypes. Two tanks were deployed to 1st Panzer Division in 1943, and the other thirty-eight were deployed to the LVIII Panzer Reserve Corps during the Normandy landings.|$|E

40|$|This thesis formulates, calibrates, and simulates Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) {{models to}} {{investigate}} the monetary transmission mechanism and the <b>real</b> <b>impacts</b> of monetary policy in a Cash-in-Advance (CIA) economy. The contributions of this thesis include: {{a resolution of the}} liquidity effect puzzle, which is a negative correlation between nominal interest rates and money growth rate, through the banking sector an examination of the <b>real</b> <b>impacts</b> of monetary policy, with various nominal interest rates, under a CIA framework an evaluation of a simple CIA economy and monetary banking models with business cycle facts and an emphasis of the contribution of a banking sector and a Stockman (1981) CIA constraint. The first chapter reviews a theoretical explanation of the liquidity effect puzzle. It includes the limited participation monetary shock from Lucas (1990) and market segmentation from Alvarez, Lucas and Webber (2001). It discusses the interaction between nominal and real economy with different monetary transmission channels (such as nominal wage contract, sticky price and monetary misperceptions). Chapter 2 resolves the liquidity effects puzzle with a banking sector. By generating liquidity effect on nominal interest rates, the model is able to replicate the economic fluctuations observed in the data. Chapters 3 and 4 explain the <b>real</b> <b>impacts</b> of monetary aggregates under a flexible price framework. The model is able to account for both the nominal interest rate behaviour and the business cycle facts without sticky price/wage and limited participation monetary shocks. Chapter 5 evaluates both simple and banking CIA models with business cycle facts, and emphasises the contribution of productive banks and Stockman's (1981) CIA constraint. It focuses on the interaction between nominal and real variables and concludes that by integrating banking production function and Stockman CIA constraint into CIA economy, the model is able to examine the certain business cycle facts. Chapter 6 concludes the contributions of the thesis...|$|R

Richthofen was following a considerably difficult assignment, stemming from a directive issued to the Reichswehr before Adolf Hitler's rise to power. In July 1932, the Reichswehr had been pursuing the Schnellbomber (fast bomber) concept. The need for modern and fast bombers was to meet the future vision of air warfare for bombers that were faster than fighter aircraft. These concepts became even more important when Hitler seized power and issued demands for rapid rearmament.|$|E

The Slovenian government insisted that the withdrawal should proceed on its terms; the YPA was not allowed to take much of its heavy weaponry and equipment, which was later either deployed locally or sold to other Yugoslav republics. The withdrawal began about ten days later and was completed by 26 October.|$|E
25|$|Carnot {{published}} his {{book in the}} heyday of steam engines. His theory explained why steam engines using superheated steam were better because of the higher temperature of the consequent hot reservoir. Carnot's theories and efforts did not immediately help improve the efficiency of steam engines; his theories only helped to explain why one existing practice was superior to others. It was only {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century that Carnot's ideas, namely that a heat engine can be made more efficient if the temperature of its hot reservoir is increased, were put into practice. Carnot's book did, however, eventually have a <b>real</b> <b>impact</b> on the design of practical engines. Rudolf Diesel, for example, used Carnot's theories to design the diesel engine, in which the temperature of the hot reservoir is much higher than that of a steam engine, resulting in an engine which is more efficient.|$|E
25|$|The Committee, {{initially}} {{consisting of}} a professor of English literature, two members of parliament, a Church of Ireland clergyman and a Roman Catholic priest heard submissions from individuals, organisations and institutions, including religious and social institutions. Its report, which expressed dissatisfaction with the existing laws, {{was presented to the}} minister on 28 December 1926. One problem was {{that the vast majority of}} the publishers of offensive material operated outside Ireland, leaving only individual booksellers and distributors liable to prosecution. Their prosecution did not have any <b>real</b> <b>impact</b> on the availability of objectionable material. Another problem was that powers of customs and postal authorities to seize this material was ill-defined and seizure was thus ineffectual. The Committee concluded that it was the Irish state's duty to prevent the circulation of publications that were considered to be obscene and morally corrupting. The Committee proposed the introduction of new legislation and the establishment of a censorship board to advise the minister on which publications should be prohibited. The new legislation – the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929 – established the Censorship of Publications Board.|$|E

25|$|Among the European nations, Russia reacted most {{promptly}} to the events. According to Venizelos' biographer Chester, the Russian conscripts {{were particularly}} cruel in their {{treatment of the}} Venizelists. During March and April, a contingent of the Tsar's soldiers marched toward the Lefka Ori accompanied by Cretan gendarmes. At the beginning of June, Russian troops disembarked in Crete and took several villages while the Russian fleet bombarded several others. The British, despite their support of the existing regime, only took a few symbolic actions without <b>real</b> <b>impact.</b> As for the French and the Italians, they avoided taking part in any anti-revolutionary activity. Nevertheless, an international force was assembled at Alikianos, {{on the road to}} Theriso, ready to receive orders. With the arrival of troops at Alikianos, Colonel Lubanski of the French Army organised a first meeting with the insurgents at Fournes, between Alikianos and Theriso, in a spot where the insurgents could see unmistakably the European force gathered in the valley. The talks took place on 1 April and were attended by Konstantinos Foumis and Konstantinos Manos, with Colonel Lubanski receiving the insurgents' grievances. The following day, the latter went to Theriso with a message for Venizelos: the Powers were unanimous regarding the impossibility of the island's annexation by Greece.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{validity}} of previous findings, some researchers still question whether EI – job performance correlation makes a <b>real</b> <b>impact</b> on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to media advertising, rather than objective scientific findings. Also, it is mentioned that relationship between job performance and EI is {{not as strong as}} suggested. This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job contexts of high managerial work demands, which improves job performance. This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts. Moreover, Joseph and Newman (2010) suggested that emotional perception and emotional regulation components of EI highly contribute to job performance under job contexts of high emotional demands. Moon and Hur (2011) found that emotional exhaustion (“burn-out”) significantly influences the job performance – EI relationship. Emotional exhaustion showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism and social skills). This association impacted negatively to job performance, as well. Hence, job performance – EI relationship is stronger under contexts of high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels of optimism and social skills possess better resources to outperform when facing high emotional exhaustion contexts.|$|E
