25|$|Horizontal-axis wind {{turbines}} (HAWT) have the main <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft</b> and electrical generator {{at the top}} of a tower, and must be pointed into the wind. Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane, while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a servomotor.

25|$|Increasing the {{displacement}} {{and power of}} a rotary engine by adding more rotors to a basic design is simple, but a limit may exist {{in the number of}} rotors, because power output is channeled through the last <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft,</b> with all the stresses of the whole engine present at that point. For engines with more than two rotors, coupling two bi-rotor sets by a serrate coupling between the two rotor sets has been tested successfully.|$|E
25|$|A pair of roof-mounted Turbomeca Turmo {{turboshaft}} engines {{power the}} Puma's four-blade main rotor. The helicopter's rotors are driven {{at a speed}} of roughly 265 rpm via a five reduction stage transmission. The design of the transmission featured several unique and uncommon innovations for the time, such as single-part manufacturing of the <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft</b> and the anti-vibration measures integrated into the main gearbox and main rotor blades. The Puma also featured an automatic blade inspection system, which guarded against and alerted crews to fatigue cracking in the rotor blades. There are two hydraulic systems on board, these operate entirely independent of one another, one system powers only the aircraft's flight controls while the other serves the autopilot, undercarriage, rotor brake, and the flight controls.|$|E

500|$|The concept {{proposed}} by de Lackner Helicopters was a one-man flying platform, and it received the company designation [...] "DH-4". The DH-4 {{was expected to}} be able to carry up to [...] of cargo or an auxiliary [...] fuel tank to extend its range up to [...] in addition to its pilot; in addition, a cargo lifting line could be threaded through the <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft</b> for the carrying of slung loads underneath the craft.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{operators}} {{discovered that}} if the APS5000 Auxiliary power unit was shut down with the inlet door closed, heat continued to build up in the tail compartment and cause the <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft</b> to bow. [...] It could take up to 2 hours for the shaft to straighten again. This was particularly acute on short haul flights as there was insufficient time to allow the unit to cool before a restart was needed. Procedures were modified and the APU was later redesigned to address the issue.|$|E
2500|$|Vertical-axis wind {{turbines}} (or VAWTs) have the main <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft</b> arranged vertically. One {{advantage of this}} arrangement is that the turbine {{does not need to}} be pointed into the wind to be effective, which is an advantage on a site where the wind direction is highly variable. It is also an advantage when the turbine is integrated into a building because it is inherently less steerable. [...] Also, the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground, using a direct drive from the rotor assembly to the ground-based gearbox, improving accessibility for maintenance. However, these designs produce much less energy averaged over time, which is a major drawback.|$|E

40|$|Conventional Savonius rotors {{have high}} {{coefficient}} of static torque at certain rotor angles and a negative coefficient of static torque from 135 degrees to 165 degrees and from 315 degrees to 345 degrees in one cycle of 360 degrees. In order to decrease this variation in static torque from 0 degrees to 360 degrees, a helical Savonius rotor {{with a twist}} of 90 degrees is proposed. In this study, tests on helical Savonius rotors are conducted in an open jet wind tunnel. Coefficient of static torque, coefficient of torque and coefficient of power for each helical Savonius rotor are measured. The performance of helical <b>rotor</b> with <b>shaft</b> between the end plates and helical <b>rotor</b> without <b>shaft</b> between the end plates at different overlap ratios namely 0. 0, 0. 1 and 0. 16 is compared. Helical Savonius <b>rotor</b> without <b>shaft</b> is also compared {{with the performance of}} the conventional Savonius rotor. The results indicate that all the helical Savonius rotors have positive coefficient of static torque at all the rotor angles. The helical <b>rotors</b> with <b>shaft</b> have lower coefficient of power than the helical <b>rotors</b> without <b>shaft.</b> Helical <b>rotor</b> without <b>shaft</b> at an overlap ratio of 0. 0 and an aspect ratio of 0. 88 is found to have almost the same coefficient of power when compared with the conventional Savonius rotor.

2500|$|The J402-CA-400 was a {{single-shaft}} engine, {{with one}} axial compressor stage and one centrifugal compressor stage. The compressed air was combusted in an annular combustor, and then {{passed through a}} single high-pressure turbine stage before being exhausted. Because the engine was designed for a one-time use missile, its service life was only one hour. The primary challenge of the [...] "wooden round" [...] requirement was to design the engine to be as reliable as possible. To that end, significant {{efforts were made to}} reduce the number of individual parts throughout the engine. For example, the rotor system of the J402 had 16 parts, while the J69 (the parent engine) had 149 parts for the same system. Another simplifying measure was to eliminate the standard gearbox. All the engine accessories, like the fuel pump and electrical alternator, ran directly off the <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft.</b> Engine starting was another reliability-critical function of the engine, and to accomplish that requirement, the J402 utilizes pyrotechnic cartridges to start the engine. Finally, the engine was among the first to feature a fully electronic analog fuel controller.|$|E

50|$|This {{combination}} of features enables the rotor {{to respond to}} aerodynamic forces and tilt in any direction without introducing mechanical bending forces between the rotor and the <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft.</b> At {{the same time it}} is possible to control the rotor by tilting the <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft</b> (helicopter) in the desired direction of flight. The forward speed is however limited because the rotors have a high tendency to tilt up to counteract any horizontal movement.

An analysis of the influence of steady torsion loading on fatigue crack growth rates under rotating of reversed bending is presented. Tests were carried out on cylindrical specimens in DIN Ck 45 steel and results are compared for two different testing conditions: rotating bending and reversed bending, simulating the real conditions on power <b>rotor</b> <b>shafts.</b> The growth and shape evolution of semi-elliptical surface cracks were measured for several Mode III/Mode I ratios. An analysis was carried out in 3 D finite elements in order to obtain a polynomial equation which allowed to know the boundary correction factors for semi-elliptical surface cracks in round subjected to bending combined with torsion loading. Stress Intensity Factors K_I were compared with available literature results in order to validate the proposed model. Experimental results have shown that the steady Mode III loading superimposed to the cyclic Model I leads to a significant reduction on the crack growth rates.
