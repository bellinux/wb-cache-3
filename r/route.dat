5|$|A major restructure of Northeast Seattle service {{occurred}} in 2002 {{to accommodate the}} new Sound Transit Express <b>route</b> 522 from Seattle to Woodinville via the State <b>Route</b> 522 corridor. As part of the restructure, <b>route</b> 307 was eliminated and replaced by <b>route</b> 522 as well as increased service on <b>route</b> 41, which was extended to Lake City and given service 7 days a week with frequencies as high as 15 minutes at midday on weekdays.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} Lewistown to Canton has existed since 1918, {{and it became}} part of <b>Route</b> 6 by 1926. A section of a road from Monticello to Lewiston was paved in gravel two years later. In 1931, <b>Route</b> 6 was re-aligned south of Canton, and the former {{alignment}} was designated as <b>Route</b> 96. The next year, <b>Route</b> 96 was fully paved in gravel. The <b>route</b> was renumbered to <b>Route</b> 16 in 1941, and was fully paved in concrete by 1942. In 1977, US 61 was realigned west of Canton, and the old <b>route</b> became <b>Route</b> B. Around 1989–90, US 61 Business was designated, concurrent with <b>Route</b> B through Canton. An interchange was built at US 61 and <b>Route</b> 16 around 2001–02.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Schuyler Avenue (which runs as Hudson County <b>Route</b> 507 {{to the south}} of <b>Route</b> 7 and Bergen County <b>Route</b> 130 to the north of <b>Route</b> 7), the road turns NNW, narrowing again to two lanes undivided. In this portion of the <b>route,</b> it had a concurrency with County <b>Route</b> 507 (both Bergen and Hudson counties). It keeps this configuration for about a half mile, as it still runs along the Kearny/North Arlington border. At that point, it meets the southern terminus of State <b>Route</b> 17 (Ridge Road) and the northern terminus of Hudson County <b>Route</b> 697 (Kearny Avenue).|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} Middlesex County, <b>Route</b> 18 continues {{north as}} a freeway, entering Old Bridge Township. After interchanging with U.S. <b>Route</b> 9 (exit 30), the freeway ends, and the <b>route</b> becomes an arterial highway through a mostly wooded commercial stretch of Old Bridge. The <b>route</b> crosses several roads in this area. It then passes under County <b>Route</b> 516 and County <b>Route</b> 527 (Old Bridge-Matawan Road), {{but has no}} northbound interchange to connect with them; motorists have to travel through a residential area to access these roads. On the southbound side, motorists can use a cloverleaf or Englishtown Road. <b>Route</b> 18 then enters East Brunswick, then interchanging with Middlesex County <b>Route</b> 615, which also connects to County <b>Route</b> 527.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} <b>route</b> between Los Angeles and Bakersfield {{followed the}} southern {{approach to the}} Ridge <b>Route</b> to Saugus, but took a longer <b>route</b> between Saugus and Gorman, heading northeast through the San Francisquito Canyon to the Antelope Valley and west to Gorman. The rest of the <b>route,</b> from Gorman toward Bakersfield via the Tejon Pass, followed the same path as the Ridge <b>Route.</b>|$|E

5|$|As part of {{improving}} road {{access to the}} Fort Dix Military Reservation {{at the onset of}} World War II, a Works Progress Administration project improved the paved road connecting the fort to Bordentown. In 1941, this road was legislated as <b>Route</b> S39, a state highway spur of <b>Route</b> 39 (now US206) that was to run from the fort to Mansfield Square. Construction on the access road was completed in 1943 at a cost of over $2 million. <b>Route</b> S39 became <b>Route</b> 68 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. The same year, an extension of <b>Route</b> 68 was legislated to run south from Fort Dix to the intersection with <b>Route</b> 70 and <b>Route</b> 72 at the Four Mile Circle. In 1961, a freeway was proposed along the <b>Route</b> 68 corridor, running from a planned <b>Route</b> 38 freeway near Fort Dix south to <b>Route</b> 70 and <b>Route</b> 72; however, this was never built.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{proposed}} Penns Neck Bypass on U.S. <b>Route</b> 1, the New Jersey Department of Transportation plans on realigning County <b>Route</b> 571 and <b>Route</b> 526 from the western terminus of Route64 to a northerly <b>route</b> to <b>Route</b> 1. Although <b>Route</b> 571 and <b>Route</b> 526 are proposed to be realigned onto the new alignment, there is no designated change proposed for <b>Route</b> 64. On the contrary to this, one state figure shows <b>Route</b> 64 running along Washington Road, where the two county routes currently run.|$|E
5|$|At Martinez, the Martinez-Benicia Ferry took {{automobiles}} {{across the}} Carquinez Strait to Benicia, where <b>Route</b> 7, {{one of the}} original state highways from the 1910 bond issue, led north and northeast past Fairfield towards Sacramento and Oregon. The portion north from Benicia to Fairfield became part of <b>Route</b> 74 in 1935, when <b>Route</b> 7 was realigned to the more direct American Canyon <b>route</b> that is now I-80. None of the aforementioned roads were given state sign <b>route</b> numbers in 1934, when that system was laid out, but by 1937 they had been numbered SR 21. This <b>route</b> began at the intersection of Warm Springs Boulevard and Brown Road in Warm Springs, where <b>Route</b> 5 and <b>Route</b> 69 (SR 17) split, followed <b>Route</b> 5 along Mission Boulevard to Mission San Jose (this part later became an overlap with SR 9), and then continued to US 40 (<b>Route</b> 7) at Cordelia. The routing was very close to the present I-680, following such roads as Pleasanton Sunol Road, San Ramon Valley Boulevard, Danville Boulevard, Main Street in Walnut Creek, Contra Costa Boulevard, and Pacheco Boulevard.|$|E
50|$|As of April 2012, Winnipeg Transit {{operates}} 94 <b>routes.</b> Of these, 29 are labelled {{either as}} express <b>routes</b> or park-and-ride, 13 are RT (Rapid Transit) <b>routes</b> {{running on the}} Southwest Transitway, 28 are regular <b>routes</b> connecting the city centre with the suburbs, 20 are suburban <b>routes,</b> 5 are crosstown <b>routes,</b> 4 are Downtown Spirit/Osborne Village Connector <b>routes,</b> and 4 are dial-a-ride transit (DART) <b>routes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the five <b>routes,</b> there were minor <b>routes</b> that were unofficial branches of or alternates to the main <b>routes,</b> or infrequently used <b>routes.</b> Some of the <b>routes</b> were referred to as hime kaidō, as they were alternate paths for main trade <b>routes,</b> but none were officially called that.|$|R
50|$|Arterial <b>routes</b> are {{designated}} by two-digit numbers, with north-south <b>routes</b> having odd numbers, and east-west <b>routes</b> having even numbers. Primary <b>routes</b> (i.e. major thoroughfares) have 5 or 0 as their last digit, while secondary <b>routes</b> end in other digits.|$|R
5|$|At the County <b>Route</b> 61 (Farview Avenue) {{interchange}}, {{the road}} regains a third lane in each direction. <b>Route</b> 17 passes by Westfield Garden State Plaza {{on the west}} side of the road before coming to an interchange with <b>Route</b> 4. <b>Route</b> 17 is flanked by businesses and shopping malls for most of its length in Paramus. Following <b>Route</b> 4, the road interchanges with Century Road. <b>Route</b> 17 comes to a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway (exit 163), with access limited to northbound-to-northbound and southbound-to-southbound movements between the two roads. North of the Garden State Parkway, <b>Route</b> 17 features interchanges for Midland Avenue, the Paramus Park shopping mall and an industrial park, and County <b>Route</b> 80 (Ridgewood Avenue) just north of the Fashion Center shopping mall.|$|E
5|$|At {{the border}} with Deptford Township, <b>Route</b> 47 reaches an {{intersection}} known as Five Points. Here, the road meets <b>Route</b> 41, County <b>Route</b> 603, and County <b>Route</b> 630. <b>Route</b> 47 turns northwest as this intersection and runs through wooded areas with some dwellings, with <b>Route</b> 55 intersecting the <b>route</b> at a cloverleaf interchange a short distance later. Past this interchange, the road continues through wooded inhabited areas, eventually turning due north. It comes to an intersection with the western terminus of County <b>Route</b> 534 as the <b>route</b> heads through more suburban homes along with businesses. Past this intersection, <b>Route</b> 47 passes businesses before crossing over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange. From here, it heads through more inhabited areas before entering Westville. Upon entering Westville, the <b>route</b> has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 295. Past this interchange, the road runs through neighborhoods, intersecting County <b>Route</b> 621 (Almonesson Road) and County <b>Route</b> 551. The latter forms a concurrency with <b>Route</b> 47 and these two routes run northeast through commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road, crossing the Big Timber Creek into Brooklawn, Camden County. Here, {{it comes to a}} traffic circle with U.S. <b>Route</b> 130 and County <b>Route</b> 753, where <b>Route</b> 47 ends and County <b>Route</b> 551 continues on to Camden, forming a brief concurrency with U.S. <b>Route</b> 130.|$|E
5|$|At the {{intersection}} with Seashore Road (County <b>Route</b> 603), {{the designation of}} <b>Route</b> 626 picks up again, following Seashore Road northward through rural Cape May County. The <b>route</b> leaves the rural area, intersecting with U.S. <b>Route</b> 9 (Sandman Boulevard), where the commercial district picks up. County <b>Route</b> 626 heads northward through the short district, entering an area of residences and intersecting with Academy Road (County <b>Route</b> 639). The <b>route</b> passes a large field with one large red barn before turning northeastward past more residences. County <b>Route</b> 626 parallels U.S. <b>Route</b> 9 for a distance, intersecting with the Bennetts Crossing, which connects the two roads. The highway continues northeastward through Cape May County, intersecting with Tabernacle Road (County <b>Route</b> 647). County <b>Route</b> 626 continues through the residential districts in Lower Township, paralleling U.S. <b>Route</b> 9 and a local railroad for some distance. The highway intersects with the Old Stage Road, a dead-end stagecoach road, heading through a short rural area {{before returning to the}} residential districts. The highway continues northward, switch names to South Railroad Avenue and into the community of Rio Grande. County <b>Route</b> 626 becomes a divided highway before reaching an intersection with New Jersey <b>Route</b> 47, where county maintenance ends completely. North Railroad Avenue continues locally along the right-of-way.|$|E
40|$|Work on {{standardization}} of OSI <b>routeing</b> protocols has already started. A <b>routeing</b> framework defining the functional {{components of the}} <b>routeing</b> problem was published.

5|$|At this point, the Ocean Drive moniker merges onto <b>Route</b> 147 and {{the road}} crosses over the Beach Creek into the beach resort of North Wildwood. Here, the <b>route</b> turns south and becomes Spruce Avenue, which heads between {{marshland}} {{to the west and}} resort homes to the east. At the intersection with West Angelsea Drive, <b>Route</b> 147 becomes a four-lane undivided road that continues past more developments, turning to the southeast. <b>Route</b> 147 heads through a mix or residential and commercial establishments before ending at the intersection with New York Avenue. From here, County <b>Route</b> 621 continues south along the roadway as New Jersey Avenue. <b>Route</b> 147, along with County <b>Route</b> 618, provide an alternate <b>route</b> to The Wildwoods from <b>Route</b> 47.|$|E
5|$|Between 1918 and 1926, <b>Route</b> 46 was {{extended}} to Sheridan. Soon after, in 1933, it extended south, two miles east of Sheridan. The extension caused the road to Sheridan to become a spur <b>route</b> of <b>Route</b> 46. The spur <b>route</b> was then extended west into Nodaway County around 1948–1949, and was numbered supplemental <b>route</b> D. Four years later, the <b>route</b> {{was extended}} to <b>Route</b> 27 (now <b>Route</b> 148). In 1954, <b>Route</b> 246 was designated, starting from Sheridan, and ending at <b>Route</b> 46. The next year, <b>Route</b> 246 {{was extended to}} replace supplemental <b>route</b> D as the main connector from Hopkins to <b>Route</b> 46.

50|$|Prior to 1933, <b>routes</b> were {{assigned}} by district. Two-digit <b>routes</b> generally crossed district lines, while three-digit <b>routes</b> {{were assigned}} {{with their first}} digit as the district number. The new system also grouped <b>routes</b> by district, but not as strictly (these <b>routes</b> could cross lines) and with no room for expansion; thus additional <b>routes,</b> starting later in 1933, often received numbers from 283 up.|$|R
5|$|Between 1927 and 1953, <b>Route</b> 83 {{was a part}} of <b>Route</b> 49, which {{originally}} ran {{south of}} Millville along <b>Route</b> 47 between Millville and South Dennis and along the entire length of <b>Route</b> 83. In 1953, the <b>route</b> became <b>Route</b> 83 when <b>Route</b> 49 was realigned to follow what was then <b>Route</b> 47 between Millville and Tuckahoe and <b>Route</b> 47 was aligned to follow <b>Route</b> S49 between South Dennis and Wildwood. In 2007, the state completed reconstruction of the intersection with <b>Route</b> 47 to include a traffic signal. A school bus accident has prompted the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) to install a traffic signal at the Y intersection of <b>Route</b> 83 and US 9.|$|E
5|$|By 1937, most of <b>Route</b> 6 {{had been}} {{completed}} {{with the exception of}} the Paterson bypass. In 1938, a spur of <b>Route</b> 6 called <b>Route</b> 6A was legislated to run from <b>Route</b> 6 in Dover north to US 206/Route S31 in Lafayette Township; this became <b>Route</b> 15 in 1953. A realignment at the Passaic River crossing near Pine Brook was built in the 1940s, along with a new road for a short distance west from Pine Brook. Also in the 1940s, the road was widened west into Denville, and a bypass of downtown Denville, including an interchange at <b>Route</b> 5N (now <b>Route</b> 53) was built. The <b>Route</b> 6 designation was dropped in favor of U.S. <b>Route</b> 46 in the 1953 renumbering.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, <b>Route</b> 47 {{was moved}} from High Street to North Second Street through the {{northern}} part of Millville. An alternate <b>route</b> of <b>Route</b> 47 was eventually created to the east along county routes in Cape May and Cumberland counties; this eventually became <b>Route</b> 347 by the 1990s. In the 2000s, Rio Grande Avenue in Wildwood received improvements to make it reminisce the doo wop atmosphere the beach resort is known for. The <b>Route</b> 47 bridge over Dennis Creek in Dennis Township and the <b>Route</b> 83 intersection received improvements that were completed in July 2007. The <b>Route</b> 47 bridge over the creek was structurally deficient and in need of replacing. The job was completed with wider shoulders and a wider sidewalk on the new bridge.
