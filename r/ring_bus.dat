Spatial bandwidth reuse can significantly increase the effective throughput delivered by the network and is, therefore, desirable to be implemented in high-speed LANlMAN environments. However, spatial bandwidth reuse can result in unfair access among nodes in the network and, thus, a fairness algorithm is needed to regulate the access to the network. A local fairness algorithm views the network as multiplicity of communication resources {{as opposed to a}} global fairness algorithm, which views the network as a single communication resource. Our algorithm can be applied to any dual <b>ring</b> or <b>bus</b> architecture such as MetaRing [l],[4]. In the dual bus configuration, when transporting ATM cells, the local fairness algorithm can be implemented using two generic flow control (GFC) bits in the ATM cell header. In the performance study section of our paper, we will show that this local fairness algorithm can exploit the throughput advantage offered by spatial bandwidth reuse better than a global fairness algorithm. This is accomplished because it ensures fair use of network resources among nodes which are competing for the same subset of links, while permitting free access to noncongested parts of the network. We will demonstrate the performance advantage of our local fairness scheme by simulating the system under various traffic scenarios and compare the results to that of the MetaRing SAT-based global fairness algorithm.

5000|$|The Cell {{processor}} from STI, {{an alliance}} of Sony Computer Entertainment, Toshiba Corporation, and IBM, is a hardware architecture that can function like a stream processor with appropriate software support.

In the native programming model all DMA and program scheduling is left up to the programmer. The hardware provides a fast <b>ring</b> <b>bus</b> among the processors for local communication. Because the local memory for instructions and data is limited the only programs that can exploit this architecture effectively either require a tiny memory footprint or adhere to a stream programming model.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} delay {{performance}} of all-optical packet communication networks configured as <b>ring</b> and <b>bus</b> topologies employing cross-connect switches (or wavelength routers). Under a cross-connect network implementation, a packet experiences no (or minimal) internal queueing delays. Thus, the network {{can be implemented}} by high speed all-optical components. We further assume a packet-switched network operation, such as that using a slotted <b>ring</b> or <b>bus</b> access methods. In this case, a packet’s delay is known before it is fed into the network. This {{can be used to}} determine if a packet must be dropped (when its end-to-end delay requirement is not met) at the time it accesses the network. It also leads to better utilization of network capacity resources. We also derive the delay performance for networks under a store-and-forward network operation. We show these implementations to yield very close average end-to-end packet queueing delay performance. We note that a cross-connect network operation can yield a somewhat higher queueing delay variance levels. However, the mean queueing delay for all traffic flows are the same for a cross-connect network operation (under equal nodal traffic loading), while that in a store-and-forward network increases as the path length increases. For a ring network loaded by a uniform traffic matrix, the queueing delay incurred by 90 % of the packets in a cross-connect network may be lower than that experienced in a store-and-forward network. We also study a store-and-forward network operation under a nodal round robin (fair queueing) scheduling policy. We show the variance performance of the packet queueing delay for such a network to be close to that exhibited by a cross-connect (all-optical) network...|$|R

5000|$|One copy of 8 x87 FP {{push down}} stack by default, MMX {{register}} were virtually simulated from x87 stack and require x86 register to supplying MMX instruction and aliases to exist stack. On P6, the instruction independently {{can be stored}} and executed in parallel in early pipeline stages before decoding into micro-operations and renaming in out-of-order execution. Beginning with P6, all register files do not require additional cycle to propagate the data, register files like architectural and floating point are located between code buffer and decoders, called [...] "retire buffer", Reorder buffer and OoOE and connected within the <b>ring</b> <b>bus</b> (16 bytes). The register file itself still remains one x86 register file and one x87 stack and both serve as retirement storing. Its x86 register file increased to dual ported to increase bandwidth for result storage. Registers like debug/condition code/control/unnamed/flag were stripped from the main register file and placed into individual files between the micro-op ROM and instruction sequencer. Only inaccessible registers like the segment register are now separated from the general-purpose register file (except the instruction pointer); they are now located between the scheduler and instruction allocator, {{in order to facilitate}} register renaming and out-of-order execution. The x87 stack was later merged with the floating-point register file after a 128-bit XMM register debuted in Pentium III, but the XMM register file is still located separately from x86 integer register files.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next major}} {{change to the}} core is with its memory bus. R420 and R300 had nearly {{identical}} memory controller designs, with the former being a bug fixed release designed for higher clock speeds. R520, however, differs with its central controller (arbiter) that connects to the [...] "memory clients". Around the chip there are two 256-bit ring buses running {{at the same speed}} as the DRAM chips, but in opposite directions to reduce latency. Along these ring buses are 4 [...] "stop" [...] points where data exits the ring and going into or out of the memory chips. There is actually a fifth stop, one that is significantly less complex, designed for the PCI Express interface and video input. This design allows memory accesses to be far quicker though lower latency by virtue of the smaller distance the signals need to move through the GPU, and by increasing the number of banks per DRAM. Basically the chip can spread out memory requests faster and more directly to the RAM chips. ATI claims a 40% improvement in efficiency over older designs. Again, the smaller cores such as RV515 and RV530 receive cutbacks due to their smaller, less costly designs. RV530, for example, has two internal 128-bit buses instead. This generation has support for all recent memory types, including GDDR4. In addition to <b>ring</b> <b>bus,</b> each memory channel now has the granularity of 32-bits, which improves memory efficiency when performing small memory requests.|$|E
5000|$|Later P6 {{implementations}} (Pentium M, Yonah) introduced [...] "Shadow Register File Architecture" [...] that {{expanded to}} 2 copies of dual ported integer architectural register file and consist with context switch (between future&retirered file and scaled file {{using the same}} trick that used between integer and floating point). It was in order to solve the register bottleneck that exist in x86 architecture after micro op fusion is introduced, {{but it is still}} have 8 entries 32 bit architectural registers for total 32 bytes in capacity per file (segment register and instruction pointer remain within the file, though they are inaccessible by program) as speculative file. The second file is served as a scaled shadow register file, which without context switch the scaled file cannot store some instruction independently. Some instruction from SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3 require this feature for integer operation, for example instruction like PSHUFB, PMADDUBSW, PHSUBW, PHSUBD, PHSUBSW, PHADDW, PHADDD, PHADDSW would require loading EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX from both of register file, though it was uncommon for x86 processor to take use of another register file with same instruction; most of time the second file is served as a scale retirered file. The Pentium M architecture still remains one dual-ported FP register file (8 entries MM/XMM) shared with three decoder and FP register does not have shadow register file with it as its Shadow Register File Architecture did not including floating point function. Processor after P6, the architectural register file are external and locate in processor's backend after retired, opposite to internal register file that are locate in inner core for register renaming/reorder buffer. However, in Core 2 it is now within a unit called [...] "register alias table" [...] RAT, located with instruction allocator but have same size of register size as retirement. Core 2 increased the inner <b>ring</b> <b>bus</b> to 24 bytes (allow more than 3 instructions to be decoded) and extended its register file from dual ported (one read/one write) to quad ported (two read/two write), register still remain 8 entries in 32 bit and 32 bytes (not including 6 segment register and one instruction pointer as they are unable to be access in the file by any code/instruction) in total file size and expanded to 16 entries in x64 for total 128 bytes size per file. From Pentium M as its pipeline port and decoder increased, but they're located with allocator table instead of code buffer. Its FP XMM register file are also increase to quad ported (2 read/2 write), register still remain 8 entries in 32 bit and extended to 16 entries in x64 mode and number still remain 1 as its shadow register file architecture is not including floating point/SSE functions.|$|E
