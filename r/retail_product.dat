5|$|From {{its release}} in 1998, Half-Life saw fervent support from {{independent}} game developers, due {{in no small}} part to support and encouragement from Valve Software. Worldcraft, the level-design tool used during the game's development, was included with the game software. Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft's eventual release as a <b>retail</b> <b>product,</b> but these plans never materialized. Valve also released a software development kit, enabling developers to modify the game and create mods. Both tools were significantly updated with the release of the version 1.1.0.0 patch. Many supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and rival level editors like the multiple engine editor QuArK) were either created or updated to work with Half-Life.|$|E

Behavioral loyalty, cognitive loyalty, affective loyalty and conative loyalty are the macro-constructs of retailer brand loyalty investigated. To this aim, a quantitative research has been conducted, collecting a sample of 320 interviews to retail customers through a structured questionnaire administered in-store. Interviewees were equally divided in buyers and non-buyers of non-traditional <b>retail</b> <b>products</b> and services. Findings evidence that buyers of non-traditional <b>retail</b> <b>products</b> and services possess higher level of retail customer loyalty compared to non-buyers.

The Origins Edition, available {{both as a}} downloadable and <b>retail</b> <b>product,</b> includes the base game and five additional character skins, {{as well as other}} bonus items for other Blizzard games via Battle.net. The Collectors Edition, only available as retail, includes the Origins Edition content as well as a statue of Soldier: 76, one of the playable characters, along with the game's soundtrack and a source book. Those that purchased either the Origins or Collectors Editions received the Baby Winston battle pet in World of Warcraft.|$|E
500|$|In June 2012, Capcom {{announced}} that a high-definition remastering of the game, Ōkami HD (Ōkami Zekkei-ban; roughly translated, Ōkami Magnificent Version), would be released worldwide for PlayStation 3 on October 30 and 31, 2012; a <b>retail</b> <b>product</b> was released in Japan, while the game is available for download through the PlayStation Network in Europe and North America only. The remastered edition supports the PlayStation Move peripheral, and Trophy support has been added. While the remastered edition used the ending credits sequence of the original PS2 release, the ending song, [...] "Reset", was replaced by an instrumental theme. The remastering was done between Capcom and HexaDrive, who had previously worked on the high-definition remastering of Rez.|$|E
500|$|Portal {{was first}} {{released}} {{as part of}} The Orange Box for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on October 9, 2007, and for the PlayStation 3 on December 11, 2007. The Windows version {{of the game is}} also available for download separately through Valve's content delivery system, Steam, and was released as a standalone <b>retail</b> <b>product</b> on April 9, 2008. In addition to Portal, the Box also included Half-Life 2 and its two add-on episodes, as well as Team Fortress 2. Portals inclusion within the Box was considered an experiment by Valve; having no idea of the success of Portal, the Box provided it a [...] "safety net" [...] via means of these other games. Portal was kept to a modest length in case the game did not go over well with players. Since then, a standalone version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows users.|$|E

500|$|Lead {{designer}} Cliff Bleszinski credits {{much of the}} game's {{success to}} its community. As {{he said in the}} November 2001 issue of Maximum PC, [...] "Unreal Tournament would not have sold nearly two million copies if it did not have support from the community... We ship the very same tools that we used to build the game, and folks use these tools to realize their own visions of first-person action." [...] Like Unreal, Unreal Tournament is designed to be easily programmable and highly modularized. Through its scripting environment UnrealScript and level editor UnrealEd, developers are able to modify easily most parts of the game to both manipulate default game behavior and to supplement the game with their own mods. These range from slight changes on some aspects of gameplay (such as map voting) to total conversions. One modification, ChaosUT, became popular enough that it was included with the 'Game of the Year' edition of the game, while [...] was released as a stand-alone <b>retail</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero: Smash Hits {{received}} moderate {{praise from}} reviews, {{many of which}} cited that the game itself demonstrates the over-saturation of the music game market and {{the sheer number of}} titles with the Guitar Hero series that Activision has marketed. Chris Roper of IGN summarized that the game [...] "is the definition of 'milking'", noting that, save for the PlayStation 2 version, all of the songs in the game could have been distributed as downloadable content or reused within other compatible titles. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb commented that [...] "something about the game's full [...] price tag doesn't quite feel right" [...] and reaffirmed that being able to select a handful of the songs to play again would have been a preferred method of distribution. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer further suggested that a simultaneous release of both the <b>retail</b> <b>product</b> and the same songs as downloadable content would have been an improvement. Chris Kohler of Wired listed Smash Hits on a list of [...] "raw deals" [...] for gamers, citing Activision's approach that results in [...] "players end up paying more for segregated song lists", and contrasted the approach to that of the Rock Band series, in which downloadable content is integrated into existing games. Game Informers Matt Helgeson noted that, ultimately, the cost per song was still cheaper than current prices for downloadable content, but he still felt the game's purpose was solely for [...] "creating revenue for Activision".|$|E
500|$|The writers {{originally}} conceived several premature joke game endings if {{the player}} performed certain actions, but these required too much development effort for little payback and were scrapped. One of these joke endings {{was triggered by}} shooting a portal onto the moon's surface, after which the player's character would die from asphyxiation over a closing song, {{but the idea of}} creating a portal on the moon was incorporated into the game's final ending. The writers planned that Chell would say a single word during the ending, but this was not considered funny enough. In an early version of the script, Chell finds a lost [...] "tribe" [...] of turrets looking for their leader, a huge [...] "Animal King" [...] turret which can be seen in in-game videos of the <b>retail</b> <b>product.</b> As a reward, the Animal King would have married Chell to a turret, which would have followed Chell around the game without visible movement. The cooperative campaign was planned to feature a more detailed storyline, in which GLaDOS would send two robots to discover human artifacts, such as a comic based on a pastiche of Garfield. The writers hoped to use this idea to make the robots human-like for testing purposes, but recognized that unlike the captive audience of the single-player campaign, the two players in cooperative mode may simply talk over the story, and thus the story was condensed into very basic elements.|$|E
