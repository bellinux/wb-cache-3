In 1993 she gave herself up and only was charged with mafia association: prosecutors alleged she had been running her brother's organisation. She was acquitted 9 times of murder.

25|$|King's addictions {{to alcohol}} and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he {{acknowledged}} in On Writing in 2000, he can barely remember writing Cujo. Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the <b>rug</b> <b>in</b> front of him evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since. The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was Needful Things.|$|E

25|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, new {{construction}} in the Palace was specifically designed to make use of the space by the Royal Family: the windows in the antechamber of the Sala do Despacho were completed by Paul Sormani; new lace draperies were installed in the windows from Switzerland; the Quarto de D. Luís (D. Luís Room) was sectioned, with a lowered ceiling, used as an office space with washroom; the installation of a new <b>rug</b> <b>in</b> the Sala de Trabalho do Rei (King's Office), produced by English company Thomas Bontor & Company, which also produced new rugs for the Sala Chinesa (Chinese Hall); also, the older Sala de Bilhar (Billiard Room) was divided into two rooms: the Sala Chinesa (Chinese Room) and the Sala Império (Imperial Hall).|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 14th century, carpets with stylized single- or double-headed eagles appear. These are frequently seen in paintings of the Siena and Florence school. During {{the second half of the}} 14th century, stylized birds opposing a tree appear in Lippo Memmi's Virgin Mary and Child, 1340–50, and in Sano di Pietro's Marriage of the Virgin, 1448-52. Yetkin has identified a similar <b>rug</b> <b>in</b> the Vakıflar Halı Museum, Istanbul (Yetkin 1981, plate 17). The field of this rug is arranged in the common style, with birds facing a tree, but the birds are crested, and their design is more elaborate. The corners of the composition are filled with animal motifs, perhaps dragons. An animal-style rug with this more developed design appears on a painting by William Larkin (Yetkin, 1981, p.28).|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} <b>rugs</b> <b>in</b> America is extensive; however, today hooked rugs and Navajo rugs are synonymous with American rug design. Settlers {{who were working}} with limited {{resources}} developed hooked <b>rugs</b> <b>in</b> the 17th century. The rugs continued to be popular through the 19th century. The design motifs on early American hooked rugs varied, consisting predominantly of geometric patterns, floral designs, landscapes, seascapes and animals. No matter what the motif, hooked rugs displayed {{a great sense of}} individual expression.|$|R

500|$|At around 16:15, Linge ordered SS-Untersturmführer Heinz Krüger and SS-Oberscharführer Werner Schwiedel {{to roll up}} the <b>rug</b> <b>in</b> Hitler's {{study to}} burn it. Schwiedel later stated that upon {{entering}} the study, he saw {{a pool of blood}} the size of a [...] "large dinner plate" [...] by the arm-rest of the sofa. Noticing a spent cartridge case, he bent down and picked it up from where it lay on the rug about 1mm from a 7.65 pistol. The two men removed the blood-stained rug, carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden. There the rug was placed on the ground and burned.|$|E
500|$|Chandler's {{strategy}} in the campaign was to launch an attack upon the Wetherby administration and, before the Clements-Wetherby-Combs faction could react to it, to launch a new one. He claimed Wetherby had used the state's money frivolously by installing air conditioning in the state capitol and installing a $20,000 <b>rug</b> <b>in</b> his office. (An invoice showing that carpeting for the entire {{first floor of the}} capitol had cost one-tenth that amount did not stop Chandler from repeating the claim, which he said [...] "didn't hurt anybody, and people liked to hear it".) After a Wetherby administration official approved the purchase of African mahogany paneling for the governor's office, Chandler charged that Wetherby had gone [...] "clear to Africa" [...] to find paneling for his office and promised that, if elected, he would use good, honest Kentucky wood for decoration. He also denounced the construction of a turnpike connecting Elizabethtown and Louisville, the state fairgrounds, and Freedom Hall as unnecessary.|$|E

On his [...] "retirement tour" [...] he received standing ovations at games, {{home and away}} and gifts ranging from a yacht that said [...] "Captain Skyhook" [...] to framed jerseys from his basketball career to an Afghan <b>rug.</b> <b>In</b> his biography My Life, Magic Johnson recalls that in Abdul-Jabbar's farewell game, many Lakers and Celtics legends participated. Every player wore Abdul-Jabbar's trademark goggles and had to try a skyhook at least once, which led to comic results. The Lakers made the NBA Finals in each of Abdul-Jabbar's final three seasons, defeating Boston in 1987, and Detroit in 1988. The Lakers lost to the Pistons in a four-game sweep in his final season.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{examples}} are known of paintings with single birds in rows without the rectangular field partition. A <b>rug</b> <b>in</b> the Konya Archaeological Museum, dated to the 15th century, represents an original from this group (Yetkin, 1981, p.31, plate 20). A painting by Jaume Huguet in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya contains a nearly identical rug. Similar rugs {{can be seen}} in a painting by Giovanni di Paolo in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome, and in [...] "Madonna enthroned" [...] by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (Yetkin, 1981, p.34, ill. 7 and 8). Another animal-type carpet of different design appears in Carlo Crivelli's [...] "Annunciation", 1482. The design of this rug consists of stylized animal figures arranged between eight-pointed stars. A paired animal rug can be seen on Fra Angelico's San Marco Altarpiece.|$|E
2500|$|Benny {{also was}} caricatured in several Warner Brothers {{cartoons}} including Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur (1939, as Casper the Caveman), I Love to Singa, Slap Happy Pappy, and Goofy Groceries (1936, 1940, and 1941 respectively, as Jack Bunny), Malibu Beach Party (1940, as himself), and The Mouse that Jack Built (1959). The last {{of these is}} probably the most memorable: Robert McKimson engaged Benny and his actual cast (Mary Livingstone, Eddie Anderson, and Don Wilson) to do the voices for the mouse versions of their characters, with Mel Blanc—the usual Warner Brothers cartoon voicemeister—reprising his old vocal turn as the always-aging Maxwell, always a phat-phat-bang! away from collapse. In the cartoon, Benny and Livingstone agree to spend their anniversary at the Kit-Kat Club, which they discover the hard way is inside the mouth of a live cat. Before the cat can devour the mice, Benny himself awakens from his dream, then shakes his head, smiles wryly, and mutters, [...] "Imagine, me and Mary as little mice." [...] Then, he glances toward the cat lying on a throw <b>rug</b> <b>in</b> a corner and sees his and Livingstone's cartoon alter egos scampering out of the cat's mouth. The cartoon ends with a classic Benny look of befuddlement. It was rumored that Benny requested that, in lieu of monetary compensation, he receive a copy of the finished film.|$|E
