5000|$|While {{maintaining}} 5,000 {{feet and}} a heading of 300 degrees, Flight 705 contacted controllers and requested clearance {{to climb to}} a higher altitude. After a discussion between the flight and the <b>radar</b> <b>departure</b> controller about the storm activity, and while clearance to climb was being coordinated with the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center, the flight advised [...] "Ah-h we're in the clear now. We can see it out ahead ... looks pretty bad." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Radar's</b> <b>departure</b> is {{revisited}} in {{events surrounding}} B.J. and Klinger. Klinger is {{still unable to}} perform the duty of company clerk as efficiently as Radar did and is receiving backlash for it from Colonel Potter, Margaret and Charles.|$|R

50|$|A hybrid SID is a {{departure}} that combines {{elements of both}} the pilot-nav and <b>radar</b> vector <b>departures.</b> A hybrid SID usually requires the pilot to fly a set of instructions, then be vectored to a defined route to a transition to leave the terminal area.|$|R

5000|$|The ship {{features}} a [...] "low point" [...] design and combines this with radar absorbing paint to reduce <b>radar</b> signature.In a <b>departure</b> from existing designs, {{there is no}} funnel stack. Instead, the diesels exhaust near the waterline to minimise infrared signatures.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{following}} episode, [...] "Period of Adjustment," [...] <b>Radar's</b> <b>departure</b> is revisited in events surrounding B.J. and Klinger. Klinger is {{still unable to}} perform the way Radar had and is catching hell from Col. Potter for it, and B.J. has gone into a depression {{over the fact that}} his daughter Erin, who was meeting Radar in San Francisco with B.J.'s wife Peg, mistakenly called Radar [...] "Daddy." [...] Realizing that he's been missing out too much on his daughter's childhood, B.J. decides to drink {{his way out of the}} army and when told by Hawkeye that won't work, he destroys their still and decides to desert, punching out Hawkeye on his way. He eventually meets up with Klinger, who is having just as hard a time dealing with his own issues, and the two go on a drunken spree that ends with both of them trashing Col. Potter's office. Eventually Potter is convinced to ease off Klinger after having a discussion with Father Mulcahy, who reminds him that Radar had the same struggles when he began as company clerk. B.J. ends up breaking down in Hawkeye's arms, upset over the fact that Radar was the first person his daughter called [...] "Daddy" [...] and being unable to get that moment back.|$|R
5000|$|Aircraft are {{frequently}} {{out of the}} range of ground based radar due to altitude. Radar can be blocked by mountains, and typically is not useful for coverage near an airport unless that airport itself has <b>radar.</b> Thus, approach, <b>departure,</b> and especially taxi/ground based operations are compromised (a major selling point of the system).|$|R

The helicopter disappeared from the airfield's <b>departure</b> <b>radar</b> 40 miles west of the airfield. All on board were killed.|$|R
5000|$|In some countries, flight {{progress}} strips {{have been}} replaced by computer displays. This is not always a problem free transition, since physical strips have many characteristics that a computer system cannot replicate. In fact, the term [...] "handoff," [...] which is used today to denote the computerized transfer of control of an aircraft from one sector to another, comes from the older technique of physically handing off the flight progress strip to the next controller to denote the transfer of responsibility. This technique is still used today within some control towers; for example, the ground controller may physically hand the strip to the local controller as the aircraft reaches the runway, or the local controller will drop the strip and strip holder down a chute to the <b>departure</b> <b>radar</b> controller in the room below, once the aircraft has been cleared for takeoff.|$|R
40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringOver {{the past}} several years, the {{computer}} vision community has been researching object detection and classification. These can be applied many fields, but are particularly important to autonomous car development. In initial work in this area, many researchers sought higher accuracy on images. The recently developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) stands as great achievement. However, its training model is only suitable for photos, because its training data consists of many photos. To achieve higher performance on dash-cam videos, we need to acquire and process voluminous dash-cam training data for suitable training. For supervised learning, each object must be labelledhowever, is the computation cost for this is very high because the video has many frames and many objects. For reducing cost of labeling and automatically increasing object detection and classification system accuracy, the present study proposes incremental learning for an object recognition system. The proposed model {{is based on a}} Faster R-CNN (Regions with Convolutional Neural Network features) model for object detection and recognition. My main idea can be divided into two parts. The first is detection with object tracking. Faster R-CNN’s object detector depends solely on an object proposal network. Thus, sometimes it ignores many objects. In the proposed method, this shortcoming is overcome using video’s feature. Video has a time domain, and previous and current frames have correlation of visualized objects. Accordingly, an object tracker is used. Summation of object proposal and object tracking results yields remarkable progress in object detection. The second is object classification and incremental learning. Previous works train a model using training data, and they focus on optimizing the model with training data. Thus, to improve the accuracy or add training data, we should use a re-training model. This method requires a division of time between training and testing. Thus, a simultaneous learning system for real-time to improve accuracy is proposed here. If inputted data’s output object score is higher than a threshold, then we retain this object for reuse as training data. This method makes mAP improvement effects. For availability of autonomous vehicles, security is paramount. State-of-the-art works are based on sensor or simple visual detection. For example, distance between vehicles is detected using the <b>radar,</b> and lane <b>departure</b> detection is done using a line detection algorithm. However, this is just a single functionit can detect head-on collisions but cannot execute sufficiently rapidly for dangerous situations. So, a hazard or accident prediction and accident categorization system is proposed here. The proposed system can detect a variety of hazards and accidents, and it can categorize kinds of accident, not only involving the user’s car but also between others. The proposed system focuses on giving warning information to drivers. The algorithm used here is based on a CNN-LSTM model with many accident videos. Two models are used for this system. The first is a hazard or accident detection model. This model attaches the label of accident probability, and final loss layer is the Euclidean loss layer for model training. This enables it to detect the probability of hazard or accident, and if its output is over the threshold then a hazard is identified and then input into the accident categorization model. Second is an accident categorization model. My system can detect nine kinds of accidents: forward, cut in car accident, intersection accident, jay walking, collision with two-wheeled vehicle, collision between another vehicle and a two-wheeled vehicle, another car slipping, another car reversing, and rollover accident of another car. The algorithm uses a max-pooling layer after LSTM layers for feature information propagation of having striking features. clos...|$|R
