5|$|On the {{offshore}} Socotra island, over 1,000families evacuated to schools {{set up as}} shelters. On 1November, Chapala became the first hurricane-force storm to impact Socotra since 1922, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. Residents reported rainfall {{to be the most}} severe in decades, and northeastern areas of the island were rendered inaccessible due to flooding, forcing residents to <b>ride</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm on their roofs. Chapala damaged Socotra's main port, and also caused an island-wide power outage. Chapala wrecked 237homes on the island and damaged at least 497homes, forcing about 18,000people to leave their homes. Initial reports indicated that three people were killed and at least 200others sustained injuries on the island; subsequently, the government reported that there were no deaths on the island.|$|E
5|$|Passing through The Bahamas on August 6–7, the {{tropical}} storm caused minor {{damage on the}} islands. Due to the rough seas, ships were taken to Nassau Harbor to <b>ride</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm. The storm passed without any disruption of shipping services. However, the flying boat Topsy Fish, containing two people, became lost over Bahamian waters on August8. The plane and crew were later found north of Andros Island by a Miami relief plane and a boat from Nassau three days later. Cuba, located south of the storm throughout its duration, reported minimal effects from the hurricane, other than a lowering of barometric pressures as reported by José Carlos Millás, then-chief of the Cuban National Observatory. However, occasional thunderstorm activity fueled by the hurricane dropped rainfall over the island, and the storm generated heavy seas at the Cuban coast.|$|E
5|$|When Galveston's {{second major}} {{hurricane}} hit the Texas coastline in mid-August 1915, {{most of the}} Army units had scattered to safe locations away from the storm's path, with a few units remaining in the secure buildings of Fort Crockett or in downtown Galveston. The Middletons chose to <b>ride</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm at the Hagemann house. Following the storm cleanup, in October 1915, the 7th Regiment was ordered to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas as events in Mexico flared up again. Here they were put {{under the command of}} Brigadier General John Pershing, a highly capable officer who had skipped three ranks by being promoted from captain to brigadier general for his exceptional service during the Philippine-American War.|$|E

5|$|Along the Makran coast, heavy {{rainfall}} washed away hundreds of houses, leaving residents to <b>ride</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm along adjacent hillsides. Between Jiwani and Gwadar, Phet's rains washed away a bridge and damaged several {{portions of the}} Makran Coastal Highway, while also halting service for Pakistan Railways. Ten hours of rainfall in Gwadar flooded the port, damaging dozens of boats and launches. Throughout the town, Phet wrecked around 10,000houses. The storm flooded coastal neighborhoods, inundating the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation building which temporarily lost its capability for FM broadcasting. For five days, the town and other coastal locations were without power or natural gas due to the storm. Elsewhere, the rains filled and washed away irrigation dams, and swept away fishing boats. Heavy rainfall also caused power outages in Hyderabad. Along the Sindh coast, the storm wrecked around 3,000houses made largely of straw. Residual storm flooding damaged around 180,000bags of wheat weighing millions of tons.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its formation, forecasters {{determined}} that Fern might loop around in the Gulf of Mexico and it was more threatening to land than Hurricane Edith which was also projected to hit the Gulf Coast. On September 9, as Fern was becoming organized, forecasters issued a hurricane watch along the Texas coast, anticipating that Fern might strengthen into a hurricane. In addition, small boats were warned to stay in port and residents were advised to be aware of storm conditions brought by Fern. The next day, the hurricane watches were changed to warnings, forcing residents living on the Texas coast to board up and evacuate. In preparation for the storm's impact, Civil Defense workers and the American Red Cross were put on alert. In Galveston, eight emergency shelters were planned to open but five were closed when officials learned that they were not needed as most residents chose to <b>ride</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm in their homes. When Fern moved inland, the National Weather Service issued 21 tornado warnings and numerous flood warnings. In North Beach, city buses were used to transport evacuees inland and local officials were concerned {{about what to do with}} the relief trailers used to house survivors of Hurricane Celia a year earlier.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{uncertainty}} in forecasting when and if Emily would make its northeast turn, Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder {{declared a state of}} emergency and put the National Guard on alert. In Virginia Beach, residents of seaside homes and low-lying areas were recommended to evacuate, while a mandatory evacuation was ordered for Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay. Residents in mobile homes and on campgrounds were also advised to seek shelter. At least 750people left their homes, 711 of whom resided in storm shelters. The Norfolk International Airport was closed for 13hours, and rail service was suspended. To the north, officials in Ocean City, Maryland, declared a phase-one emergency ahead of the storm; beaches were closed, and tourists were recommended to leave. About 100,000people evacuated from the coast of Maryland; 3,600 stayed in storm shelters. In Delaware, 892people used storm shelters after voluntarily evacuating. Beaches in New Jersey closed due to threatening waves. About 20,000people also evacuated from Fire Island, New York. Across the Atlantic coast, 33emergency shelters were opened in response to Emily, though most evacuees instead relied on hotels or the homes of friends and relatives to <b>ride</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm.|$|E

5|$|Governor Lawton Chiles {{declared}} a state of emergency and activated about one-third of the Florida National Guard. Many residents evacuated, most voluntarily, from Broward, Charlotte, Collier, Lee, Martin, Dade, Monroe, Palm Beach, and Sarasota counties. A total of 142shelters opened in these counties and collectively housed at least 84,340people. In Dade County alone, 515,670people were ordered to evacuate. As Andrew was approaching, an estimated 20,00030,000tourists were in the Florida Keys (Monroe County). Overall, almost 1.2million people evacuated, which contributed to the low number of fatalities, despite the intensity of the storm. Many evacuees also checked into hotels, with rooms completely booked as far north as Ocala. Ultimately, the sheer number of evacuees led to likely the largest traffic jam in the history of Florida, mostly along Interstate 95. United States Coast Guard vessels on or near the Florida coastline were either secured onshore or sent to <b>ride</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm at sea. Government offices and public and private schools were closed from Monroe County northward to St. Lucie County. Many colleges and universities in southeast Florida also closed, including Barry University, Broward Community College, Florida Atlantic University, Florida International University, Nova Southeastern University, and the University of Miami. Major airports such as the Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood, Key West, Miami, and Palm Beach international airports closed.|$|E
5|$|Occurring a {{year after}} Hurricane Donna, {{officials}} in the Florida Keys took precautions to brace for potential impact from the storm. The United States Navy flew their planes out of Key West, while Coast Guardsmen evacuated Alligator Reef Light, American Shoal Light, and Sombrero Key Light. Ships docked at Key West sailed out to sea to <b>ride</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> squalls. On the morning of September7, a hurricane watch was issued from the entire coast of Louisiana eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. On September8, a hurricane watch was issued along the southwest coast of the state from Vermilion Bay westward. It was later extended westward to include the entire coast of Texas, and eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. A portion of the hurricane watch from Aransas Pass, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1600UTC on September9. An estimated 500,000people fled the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, making it the largest evacuation {{in the history of}} the United States, at the time. Further, at least half of those people were from Texas. In small towns along the coast of Texas, 90100% of their populations evacuated, while 20% of people left the larger cities. Many in Galveston stayed due to protection from the Galveston Seawall.|$|E
5|$|Ships {{and other}} water craft were advised {{to avoid the}} Cape Cod area as the storm was {{forecast}} to brush that area, which was put under a hurricane warning by the National Hurricane Center. In Massachusetts, schools were closed and emergency shelters were opened to accommodate evacuees. Evacuations were ordered for residents living in low-lying areas in Cape Cod. In Boston, {{the threat of the}} storm caused both elementary and middle schools to close at noon while high schools were closed at 1 p.m. (est). The approach of the storm also postponed a fair at a local hospital and planes at Otis Air Force Base were quickly moved to their hangars. Much of southeastern Massachusetts civil defense and fire departments were alerted in preparation of the storm's impact. In Rhode Island, schools and other buildings were used as shelter to house evacuees. As Hurricane Gerda sped up the East Coast of the United States, the National Hurricane Center extended the hurricane warnings from Block Island, Rhode Island to Eastport, Maine. At Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island, two ships of the United States Navy left their berths to <b>ride</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm. One of which was the Comsixthflt flagship USS Puget Sound (AD-38).|$|E
