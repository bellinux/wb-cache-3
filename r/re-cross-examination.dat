60|$|Such was the {{substance}} of the evidence of the harpooner, and neither cross-examination nor <b>re-cross-examination</b> by Mr Tooth, the counsel for the defendant, could induce Tim Rokens to modify, alter, omit, or contradict one iota of what he had said.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the young}} clerk was examined. He had, he said, {{witnessed}} {{in his time}} four, ten, twenty, and, under pressure, he confessed {{to as many as}} a hundred and twenty business signatures on the part of his employer, Sir Joseph. He thought he had witnessed a hundred and twenty, but would take his oath he had not witnessed a hundred and twenty-one. He did remember witnessing a signature of his master about the time specified by the date of the codicil, and he remembered the maid-servant also signing at the same time. Mr. Usbech was then present; but he did not remember Mr. Usbech having the pen in his hand. Mr. Usbech, he knew, could not write at that time, because of the gout; but he might, no doubt, have written as much as his own name. He swore to both the signatures--his own and his master's; and in cross-examination swore that he thought it probable that they might be forgeries. On re-examination he was confident that his own name, as there appearing, had been written by himself; but on <b>re-cross-examination,</b> he felt sure that there was something wrong. It ended in the judge informing him that his word was worth nothing, which was hard enough on the poor young man, seeing that he had done his best to tell all that he remembered. Then the servant-girl came into the witness-box. She was sure it was her own handwriting. She remembered being called in to write her name, and seeing the master write his. It had all been explained to her at the time, but she admitted that she had not understood the explanation. She had also seen the clerk write his name, but she was not sure that she had seen Mr. Usbech write. Mr. Usbech had had a pen in his hand; she was sure of that.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{qualitative}} discourse {{analysis of the}} case of Karla Homolka. The purpose of this thesis has been to examine how Karla Homolka was socially constructed within the three data sources: (1) the trial transcripts from R. v. K. Bernardo, 1993; (2) her testimony In Chief, cross-examination, re-dress, and <b>re-cross-examination</b> from R. v. P. Bernardo, 1995; and (3) The Report to the Attorney General on Certain Matters Relating to Karla Homolka, 1997. A critical examination of how Homolka was constructed as being representative of both {{the two sides of}} three dichotomies was conducted. The three dichotomies are: (1) angelic/demonic; (2) Madonna/whore; and (3) woman in danger/dangerous woman. Evidence supporting Homolka's construction as being simultaneously the two sides of each dichotomy was found. The motives behind the varying claims purported by the different claims-makers were examined. It was concluded that Homolka's characterization as being simultaneously in danger and dangerous led to the clouding of the comprehension of her character and her role in the crimes she committed. This confusion regarding her persona has demonstrated that there is a newly emerging category of offender, that of the sexually violent female predator. It was proposed that this confusion might lead correctional officials to be more oppressive and possibly more punitive with respect to other violent women...|$|E
