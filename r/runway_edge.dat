25|$|On 13 January 2007, a Boeing 737-200 {{belonging}} to the Gading Sari Aviation Services Sdn Bhd crash-landed while attempting to land at 5.52 a.m. The aircraft's fuselage was badly damaged, and the landing gears and right engine were torn off during the crash. All four crew members escaped unhurt. The airport was closed for six hours while the plane was towed away from the crash site and debris cleared from the runway. Departures and arrivals of 16 MAS and 14 AirAsia flights were delayed affecting 2,200 passengers – 1,000 passengers of MAS and 1,200 from AirAsia. An earlier flight from Kuala Lumpur had to be diverted to Miri Airport. Damages included navigational lights - eight taxi lights, five <b>runway</b> <b>edge</b> lights, two end lights, and one precision approach path indicator. It reopened at noon.|$|E
500|$|The {{final report}} from the NTSC stated that the {{probable}} cause of the accident was an excessive sink rate upon touchdown, following an unstabilised approach. In the report, the INTSC noted that the approach was unstable below , with a vertical speed occasionally greater than 2500 ft/min (13 m/s). The vertical acceleration on landing was measured at 5 g. Additionally, the aircraft initially touched down with the right main gear approximately [...] outside of the <b>runway</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E

2500|$|At 1:38am the {{aircraft}} began its take-off roll one degree {{to the right}} of the runway center line. Approximately 30 seconds later {{the aircraft}} was [...] down the runway when the crew realized they were approaching the plowed snow on the right edge and overcorrected to the left four degrees. When the aircraft reached , [...] down the runway the pilot rotated the nose wheels off the ground. At a distance of [...] meters from the beginning of the runway, accelerating through , the left main landing gear entered the [...] deep snow, causing the aircraft to yaw left and pitch down. The left main gear then impacted a <b>runway</b> <b>edge</b> light. Instead of aborting the take-off the pilot banked right, striking the propellers of engines 3 and 4 on the runway. The aircraft then spun to the right, flipped over and burst into flames. The forward fuselage and main wing section were completely destroyed. The force of the impact tore away the tail section and it came to rest inverted separated from the burning forward section. Many of the survivors were seated in this part of the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Airport runway {{detection}} {{is a vital}} aspect {{for both}} military and commercial applications. An algorithm to extract <b>runway</b> <b>edges</b> based on edge detection and line detection techniques is discussed. The runway images are initially enhanced by dilation, thresholding and edge detection. Based on some unique characteristics like the runway being gray with two white lines indicating the runway boundaries, long and continuous <b>edges</b> of the <b>runway</b> {{are considered to be}} straight lines. The straight lines are detected using Convolution operators pertaining to vertical, 45 ° or - 45 ° lines. Hough Transform is then applied to fit only the pair of lines corresponding to the runway boundaries in certain orientations. The test results prove that combination of Convolution and Hough transform is very competent in detecting <b>runway</b> <b>edges</b> accurately...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel real-time algorithm for runway detection and tracking {{applied to the}} automatic takeoff and landing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The algorithm {{is based on a}} combination of segmentation based region competition and the minimization of a specific energy function to detect and identify the <b>runway</b> <b>edges</b> from streaming video data. The resulting video-based runway position estimates are updated using a Kalman Filter, which can integrate other sensory information such as position and attitude angle estimates to allow a more robust tracking of the runway under turbulence. We illustrate the performance of the proposed lane detection and tracking scheme on various experimental UAV flights conducted by the Saudi Aerospace Research Center. Results show an accurate tracking of the <b>runway</b> <b>edges</b> during the landing phase under various lighting conditions. Also, it suggests that such positional estimates would greatly improve the positional accuracy of the UAV during takeoff and landing phases. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is further validated using Hardware in the Loop simulations with diverse takeoff and landing videos generated using a commercial flight simulator...|$|R

50|$|On November 6, 1967, TWA Flight 159, a Boeing 707 on its {{takeoff roll}} from the then-named Greater Cincinnati Airport, passed Delta Air Lines Flight 379, a Douglas DC-9 {{stuck in the}} dirt a few feet off the <b>runway's</b> <b>edge.</b> The first officer on the TWA {{aircraft}} heard a loud bang, now {{known to have been}} a compressor stall induced by ingestion of exhaust from Delta 379 as it was passed. Believing a collision had occurred, the copilot aborted the takeoff. Because of its speed, the aircraft overran the runway, injuring 11 of the 29 passengers, one of whom died four days later {{as a result of the}} injuries.|$|R
5|$|The NTSB {{concluded}} that the crash occurred due to the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff due to {{the speed of the}} aircraft, and that a runway overrun was unavoidable at the 707's speed. The disabled DC-9, a Delta Air Lines flight which had reported that it had cleared the runway when in fact it had not, was a contributing factor in the crash. The NTSB recommended that the FAA establish and publicize standards of safe clearance from <b>runway</b> <b>edges</b> for both aircraft and ground vehicles which also take into account the exhaust fumes of jet engines. The board also recommended a reevaluation of training manuals and aircraft procedures in regard to abort procedures.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{parallel}} north-south runways and a disused cross runway. The western runway, 03L/21R, is over 4400 m (14,000 ft) long, {{making it one}} of the world's longest international airport runways. Fully laden aircraft require a far greater length of runway to achieve take-off velocity at this altitude. Both runways are equipped with Instrument Landing Systems (ILS). Furthermore all runways are equipped with Approach Lighting Systems. Sequenced flashers are not used at any South African runways and therefore not installed. Touchdown zone (TDZ) lighting is available, but never turned on. <b>Runway</b> Threshold, <b>Edge</b> and Centerline lights are the only lighting available. Runway 03R/21L is 3,400m (11,155 ft) long and is also equipped at both ends with ILS. The airport used to have a third runway but this was closed due to the danger it posed. It is now a taxiway.|$|R
40|$|Past {{studies have}} shown that {{touchdown}} rates of descent (sink rates) are higher in aircraft simulators than in aircraft under similar conditions. The objective of this paper was to use a psychophysical technique to investigate a pilot's ability to distinguish between two different sink rates close to the ground. The pilots observed a collimated computer graphics display of a typical <b>runway</b> with <b>edge,</b> zone, and centerline lights. The results showed that with a forward velocity of 120 knots, pilots could reliably distinguish between a sink rate of 0. 5 m/sec (1. 7 ft/sec) and 0. 9 m/sec (2. 9 ft/sec). The results also showed that the absolute rate of sink did not significantly affect the perception of sink rate. Time of sink and total height drop during the sink did affect the minimum detectable difference between sink rates (the differential threshold). The effects were such that a greater time of sink and greater height drop produced lower threshold...|$|R

50|$|The airport has two asphalt paved runways: {{the main}} runway 18/36 {{measures}} 2556 x 60 m (Mark up, original 80 m wide, and runway 11/29 is 2449 x 45 m although initaily built 65 m wide,. The two airstrips cross each other, {{but since they}} have a different orientation, they could never operate as individual runways for planes, but 11/29 is most commonly used as the activate helicopter runway, whilst 18/36 for planes, although the helicopters utilise the CATII on runway 18/36. 11/29 is used when the situation demands for it to serve as the main runway, typically when heavy winds from The Atlantic Ocean occurs, and landing in heavy gusts of crosswind makes it demanding to operate to and from 18/36. Although the orientation isn` t ideal for operating planes from both runways, they are both most commonly active at the same time, 18/36 for planes and 11/29 for helicopters operating from it, having to keep well within the bounds of their intersection allowing for helicopters to operate from 29 to taxiway H, and departure from 11 from taxiway H, utilising both directions for helicopters, hotel and to the outer <b>edge.</b> <b>Runway</b> 18-36 has a CAT II landing system, enabling landing in very poor visibility. 11/29 only has ILS from one direction, 29, 11 is less frequently used, among other considerations to reduce noise emissions and flying over built areas, catering for population living in central parts of Sola municipality.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{installations}} include medium- or high-intensity {{approach light}} systems (abbreviated ALS). Most often, these are at larger airports but many small general aviation airports in the U.S. have approach lights {{to support their}} ILS installations and obtain low-visibility minimums. The ALS assists the pilot in transitioning from instrument to visual flight, and to align the aircraft visually with the runway centerline. Pilot observation of the approach lighting system at the Decision Altitude allows the pilot to continue descending towards the runway, even if the runway or runway lights cannot be seen, since the ALS counts as runway end environment. In the U.S., an ILS without approach lights may have CAT I ILS visibility minimums as low as 3/4 mile (runway visual range of 4,000 feet) if the required obstacle clearance surfaces are clear of obstructions. Visibility minimums of 1/2 mile (runway visual range of 2,400 feet) are possible with a CAT I ILS approach supported by a 1400 to 3000 ft ALS, and 3/8 mile visibility 1800 ft visual range is possible if the <b>runway</b> has high-intensity <b>edge</b> lights, touchdown zone and centerline lights, and an ALS that is at least 2400 ft long (see Table 3-5a in FAA Order 8260.3b). In effect, ALS extends the runway environment out towards the landing aircraft and allows low-visibility operations. CAT II and III ILS approaches generally require complex high-intensity approach light systems, while medium-intensity systems are usually paired with CAT I ILS approaches. At many non-towered airports, the pilot controls the lighting system; for example, the pilot can key the microphone 7 times {{to turn on the}} lights on the high intensity, 5 times to medium intensity or 3 times for low intensity ...|$|R
