The electrostatics were designed by David Williamson, and the company's founder, Peter Walker, from a principle elaborated by Edward W. Kellogg for General Electric that was granted a patent in 1934. However, more immediately, a book published in the US in 1954 extolling the scientific merits of the electrostatic [...] transducer inspired Walker to develop an electrostatic loudspeaker of his own; this was technologically enabled by the Mylar film developed by Dupont that came to market in 1949. Walker demonstrated a prototype electrostatic panel speaker (with exceptional clarity in the midrange), and a full-frequency infinite baffle speaker (with ample bass response) at the British Sound <b>Recording</b> <b>Association</b> Annual Exhibition in May 1955. After more research, the large panel speaker with better response over the whole frequency range was demonstrated to the Physical Society in March 1956. The ESL entered commercial production in 1957, and was discontinued only in 1985.|$|E

After sessions with Ted Lewis (1931), Jack Teagarden (1931) and Billy Banks Rhythmakers (1932), he began in May 1934 the voluminous series of recordings with a small band known as Fats Waller and his Rhythm.

A cow evaluation (cow index) was also started in Hokkaido. All these projects were primary importance in creating systematic scheme for genetic improvement of dairy cattle. In this way, the same arrangement for dairy cattle breeding as in North America and Europe has now been organized in the Hokkaido dairy industry. It is of urgent necessity for the Hokkaido dairy industry to evaluate the optimum breeding plan for dairy cattle which incorporated these projects.
