Biodiesel <b>fuel</b> properties have limited their application in diesel engines at high blending ratio therefore, chemical additives introduced as a vaible option to improve these properties. Hence, in the present study, the effect of alcohol additived with biodiesel-diesel blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 on diesel engine cyclic variations was investigated with 6 % of two alcohol additives (ethanol and butanol). The in-cylinder pressure analyses results reveal that the lowest coefficient of variation indicated for the blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 without additives. Furthermore, the engine cyclic variability increases above that of diesel fuel when using alcohol additives with blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 with higher engine cyclic variation for the blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 with ethanol compared to butanol. The results of wavelet power spectra analysis reveal that the in-cylinder pressure variations exhibit different types of behavior varying from intermittent fluctuations for B 30 without additive to strongly periodic oscillations for B 30 with alcohol additives compare to that of diesel fuel.

40|$|Biodiesel is a renewable, clean, {{alternative}} energy source with advantages such as excellent lubricity, superior biodegradability and high combustion efficiency. Biodiesel is considered for mixing with fishing boat fuels to adjust their fuel characteristics so that toxic pollutants and greenhouse-effect gas emissions from such shipping might be reduced. The effects of blending fishing boat <b>fuels</b> A and <b>B</b> with various weight proportions of biodiesel are experimentally investigated in this study. The results show that biodiesel blending can significantly improve the inferior fuel properties of both fishing boat fuels and particularly <b>fuel</b> <b>B.</b> The flash points of both of these fuels increases significantly {{with the addition of}} biodiesel and thus enhances the safety of transporting and storing these blended fuels. The flash point of fishing boat <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> even increases by 16 % with 25 wt% biodiesel blending.

Effects of thinning and prescribed fire on forest-floor fuels were studied in mixed-oak forests of south-eastern Ohio to examine fuel dynamics over time.

40|$|Biodiesel is {{receiving}} {{more and more}} attention as a renewable fuel; serve {{as an alternative to}} mineral diesel. Fossil fuels are depleting with time due to their limited resources. On the other hand; the world energy consumption increases continuously due to the modern life requirements which lead to series energy crises. Although blended biodiesel-diesel fuel can replace mineral diesel satisfactorily at low blending ratios up to 20 % biodiesel, problems related to fuel properties persist at high blending ratio more than 20 %. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of biodiesel-diesel blended fuel at 30 % biodiesel, as fuel for unmodified diesel engines. Chemical additives are introduced as a viable option to improve the blended fuel properties. The experimental characterization of the blended fuel properties was conducted with ethanol, butanol and diethyl ether additives at low ratios up to 8 % compared to the blended fuel standard ASTM D 7467. Furthermore, engine is tested with blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 and additives to investigate the engine performance, exhaust emissions and engine cyclic variations using the coefficient of variation and the wavelet analysis method. A statistically significant improvement in blended fuel kinematic viscosity and density was observed with all additives starting at 4 % and 6 % additive ratios for kinematic viscosity and density, respectively. On the other hand, a significant reduction in the blended fuel heating value was observed with all additive types starting at 6 % additive ratio. The least reduction of blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 heating value observed at 8 % additive ratio is about 4 % for B 30 with diethyl ether additive. The blended fuel cold flow properties were improved with increasing additive ratios and maximum reduction in pour and cloud point was observed with diethyl ether by 2 oC and 3 oC respectively; at 8 % additive ratio. The engine brake thermal efficiency was comparable for blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 with different additives and mineral diesel. Furthermore, blended fuel with diethyl ether additive showed higher engine power at lower brake specific fuel consumption compared to other additives at similar ratios, and better engine brake power was achieved at 6 % diethyl ether with increasing the additive ratio. The formation of NOx and CO 2 emissions was reduced significantly with increasing the additive ratios. Better improvement in these emissions observed with diethyl ether additive at 8 % ratio, which was comparable to that of diesel fuel. The significant impact of the additives on reducing the maximum in-cylinder pressure for B 30 was observed with increasing additive ratios and the better trend obtained for B 30 with 4 % to 6 % diethyl ether additive, which was comparable to that of the mineral diesel. Both the wavelet analysis and coefficient of variation reveal that increasing the additive ratio would give a noticeable effect on increasing the engine cycle-to-cycle variations which limits their usage at high ratios. It can be concluded that chemical additives are a viable option to introduce the blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 as an alternative fuel for diesel engine that meets the blended fuel standard ASTM D 7467 specifications...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of the engine, installed in an agricultural tractor, fueled before with diesel oil (B 0) and then with biodiesel (B 100). This was done both vs. the engine speed, which vs. engine load. To understand the influence of the fuel heating value and the brake thermal efficiency (BTE), a mathematical modeling of the BTE vs. engine speed and engine torque was developed. The bench tests on the engine, fueled with the two <b>fuels</b> (<b>B</b> 0 and B 100), allowed to point out that on average, the BTE of the engine was unchanged in the comparison between the two fuels, while the average BSFC was 19 % higher with the B 100, consistent with the lower heating value of B 100 (- 17. 2 %). However, the power output of the engine with the B 100 was not reduced by the same amount, but with an average value of 11 %, as there was a partial recovery due to the slight increase in the fuel consumption rate. The fitting of the mathematical model to the engine, fuelled with the two <b>fuels</b> (<b>B</b> 0 and B 100), allowed to draw the diagrams of the calculated BTE and BSFC contours for both fuels, with a good accuracy represented by a mean relative error of 2. 1 ± 2. 2 % (B 0) and 2. 0 ± 1. 5 % (B 100). Finally, the comparison of the previous results, allowed to highlight the points of the engine speed-torque plane where the biodiesel BTE was different than that of diesel oil BTE. It emerged that the engine fuelled with B 100 had a higher BTE at low load and speed, but lower than that of B 0 at high speed due to reduced inclination to evaporate compared to diesel oil, which is critical when the speed increases and the time available for combustion is reduced...|$|R
