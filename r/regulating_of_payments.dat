50|$|The {{litigation}} involving those contracts {{was made}} even more complex because the area <b>of</b> law which <b>regulates</b> recover <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> is the law of restitution.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, with that amount of litigation, the various aspects of the law of restitution got significant further consideration from judges, practitioners and academics alike. Professor Ewan McKendrick would later note that the swaps litigation had been instrumental in developing the modern law of restitution in England.|$|R

The adverse effect of late or non-payment of contractors and consultants are well known to all in the construction industry.

It will not, in my opinion, be safe to permit an entirely arbitrary discretion even in the First Lord of the Treasury himself; {{it will not be}} safe to leave with him a power of diverting the public money from its proper objects, of paying it in an irregular course, or of inverting perhaps the order of time, dictated by the proportion of value, which ought to <b>regulate</b> his application <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> to service.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 established the federal government's policy of developing {{and maintaining a}} commercial merchant marine capable of carrying {{a substantial portion of}} the nation's waterborne commerce and performing as a military auxiliary in time of war. Today the merchant marine continues to serve the nation in commerce and provides sustainment sealift assets and skilled seafaring crews to help meet DOD strategic mobility requirements. To maintain such a fleet, a highly <b>regulated</b> system <b>of</b> subsidy <b>payments</b> was provided to ship owners to offset the higher costs associated with the U. S. registry. Despite the outlay of over $ 14 billion in aid, the U. S. merchant marine has continually declined both in numbers of ships and the percentage of U. S. trade carried. This study examines the development of the Maritime Security Act of 1996 (MSA), and the policy decision to continue financial assistance in support of maintaining the merchant marine. To analyze the implications of this policy a comprehensive examination of congressional documents and industry publications was conducted. DOD and DON mobility planners can benefit from this study, as the condition of the merchant marine impacts both national security and mobility readiness. The study concluded that the MSA was a compromise reflecting many interests, reducing federal investment in the program and requiring recipients <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> to make available their entire transportation infrastructures to support DOD mobility requirements in times of crisis[URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{macroeconomic}} {{determinants of}} the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in Namibia for the period 1999 to 2009. The investigation was conducted through cointegrated vector autoregression methods. The investigation reveals that fiscal balance, GDP and interest rate are the main determinants <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in Namibia. Increase in GDP and interest rate causes an improvement in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> The positive effect of GDP on balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> suggests that expansion of export has {{a positive impact on}} current account and the overall balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> More increased export potential through the development of new products and services should be encouraged.
