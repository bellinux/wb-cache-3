5|$|For years Oldham's {{economy was}} heavily {{dependent}} on manufacturing industry, especially textiles and mechanical engineering. Since the deindustrialisation of Oldham in the mid-20th century, these industries {{have been replaced by}} home shopping, publishing, healthcare and food processing sectors, though factory-generated employment <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> significant presence. Many of the modern sectors are low-skill and low-wage.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Albania {{became the}} world {{center of the}} Bektashi Order, a Muslim sect. The sect was {{headquartered}} in Tirana, and Gjirokastër was one of six districts of the Bektashi Order in Albania, with its center at the tekke of Baba Rexheb. The city <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> large Bektashi and Sunni population. Historically there were 15 and tekkes and mosques, of which 13 were functional in 1945. Only Gjirokastër Mosque has survived; the remaining 12 were destroyed or closed during the Cultural Revolution of the communist government in 1967.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010 a large hoard of third-century Roman coins was {{unearthed}} {{in a field}} {{near the}} town. Frome {{was one of the}} largest towns in Somerset until the Industrial Revolution, and was larger than Bath from AD 950 until 1650. The town originally grew due to the wool and cloth industry. It later diversified into metal-working and printing, although these have declined. The town was enlarged during the 20th century but still <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> very large number of listed buildings, and most of the centre falls within a conservation area.|$|E

5|$|Literature <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> strong {{tradition}} in the country; most traditional writers and poets write in the classical Arabic style. In recent years, the number of younger poets influenced by western literature are rising, most writing in free verse and often including political or personal content. Ali Al Shargawi, a decorated longtime poet, was described in 2011 by Al Shorfa as the literary icon of Bahrain.|$|E
5|$|The Charles Payne House is an {{historic}} site at 25 Brown Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The {{house was built}} in 1855–56 by Charles Payne and later expanded {{with the addition of}} two ells and a porch. The -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage is architecturally significant as a 19th-century vernacular cottage in a picturesque setting. Though the round-head picket fence and entry gates were later removed, the property <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> large shaded garden on with ample street frontage. The Charles Payne House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E

5|$|The Orange County Flood Control Act of 1927 {{was created}} in the wake of some of the earlier {{flooding}} events of this era. Dams and reservoirs, some of the largest of which include Irvine Lake and the Sulphur Creek Reservoir, were the first features to be constructed following the passage of this act. Starting from the 1960s, most Orange County rivers, including Aliso Creek, were channelized. Some, like the Santa Ana River, were entirely lined with concrete, but Aliso Creek <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> natural riverbed in most parts despite being bound to a narrow channel.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} migrations of Britons {{date from}} the 5th and 6th centuries AD, when Brittonic Celts fleeing the Anglo-Saxon invasions migrated what is today northern France and north western Spain and forged the colonies of Brittany and Britonia. Brittany remained independent of France until the early 16th century and still <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> distinct Brittonic culture and language, whilst Britonia in modern Galicia was absorbed into Spanish states {{by the end of}} the 9th century AD.|$|E

They have raised over US$100 million for these and other charitable causes. Despite their philanthropic work, the Hogettes are disliked by some and have even been attacked by fans of opposing teams.|$|E

5|$|The sexes are similar, but {{the female}} {{tends to be}} duller than the male, with a brown tint to the head, brown upperparts and less bright underparts. However, some birds cannot be safely sexed on plumage alone. The {{juvenile}} is paler in color than the adult male and has dark spots on its breast, and whitish wing coverts. First-year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults, {{but they tend to}} be duller, and a small percentage <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> few juvenile wing coverts or other feathers.|$|E
5|$|Although single western towers {{are common}} in English parish churches, only one medieval cathedral, Ely, <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> {{centrally}} placed western tower, and in that case, it was framed by two lower lateral towers, one of which has since fallen down. Ely, alone among England’s cathedrals, has a central feature over the crossing that somewhat resembles the polygonal vaulted lantern towers of Spain. This elaborate lantern-like structure known as “The Octagon” spans both the nave and aisles, and is thus said to have inspired Christopher Wren’s design for the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Its upper parts are supported by hidden wooden hammer-beams, an architectural device unique to English Gothic.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 {{a replica}} of the {{original}} Ooser was produced by John Byfleet, which has since been on display at Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. This mask <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> place in Dorset folk culture, being removed from the museum for use in local Morris dancing processions held by the Wessex Morris Men on both St. George's Day and May Day. The design of the Ooser has also inspired the production of copies which have been used as representations of the Horned God in the modern Pagan religion of Wicca in both the United Kingdom and United States.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He <b>retains</b> <b>a</b> piece of his dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On {{the left of the}} mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E
