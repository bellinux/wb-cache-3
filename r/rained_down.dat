5|$|On 8 February 1984, New Jersey fired almost 300 shells at Druze and Shi'ite {{positions}} in the hills overlooking Beirut. Some 30 of these massive projectiles <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> on a Syrian command post in the Bekaa Valley east of Beirut, killing the general commanding Syrian forces in Lebanon and several other senior officers. This was the heaviest shore bombardment since the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|After {{the players}} had {{collected}} their medals, UEFA president Lennart Johansson {{handed over the}} trophy to Bülent Korkmaz. Korkmaz celebrated by raising the silverware, together with Şükür {{and the rest of}} the Galatasaray squad on the podium, including the ejected Hagi himself as golden confetti <b>rained</b> <b>down.</b> In a press conference room, a selected UEFA panel named Taffarel as the man of the match, by awarding him a match trophy.|$|E
5|$|As Bode was {{in action}} at Poling, Alfons Orthofer's unit {{attacked}} Ford. There were only six Lewis machine guns manned at Ford and the Ju 87s {{were able to}} attack with complete confidence. Bombs <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> on huts, hangars, building and amongst aircraft drawn up together for maintenance. Early on bombs struck the field's oil tanks and storage compounds causing an enormous blaze which contributed to the crippling damage on the airfield. Gosport also came under attack soon after. Siegel's Ju 87s, with no air opposition, swooped onto their targets causing large-scale damage.|$|E

5|$|On 6 December the Australians {{attacked}} again, {{this time}} with two companies approaching from the north-east, using an intense artillery and mortar bombardment to prepare the area first; the attack was repulsed with heavy fire. A further barrage <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> on the Japanese and by sunset, the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion, severely depleted with most its companies– several of which were commanded by junior non commissioned officers due to heavy casualties amongst the subalterns– at platoon strength, had managed to establish a lodging {{near the top of}} the feature on its eastern approach. That night the Japanese fell back from the position and the following day the Australians occupied Christmas Hills.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Ark Royal, the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds. As the Swordfish approached, Bismarck fired her main battery at Sheffield, straddling the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> on Sheffield, killing {{three men and}} wounding several others. Sheffield quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; Bismarck began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{paraffin}} wax waterproofing of the tent, the flames spread rapidly. Many people were badly burned by the melting paraffin, which <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> from the roof. The fiery tent collapsed in about eight minutes according to eyewitness survivors, trapping hundreds of spectators beneath it.|$|E

25|$|On 2 February 1971, the PAVN <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> {{a barrage}} of {{artillery}} fire on the Neutralists at the Moung Soui air base. Five of the PAVN PT-76 tanks closed for an assault. By 0600 hours 3 February, BI 17 was fleeing their stronghold, abandoning four 75mm howitzers.|$|E
25|$|The dome, {{supported}} by 12 steel ribs, would rise 100ft above the floor, and be illuminated by an electric lantern 45ft in diameter — {{the only source}} of light, for the room had no windows.

25|$|A late Washington rally {{fell short}} {{and the game}} ended in controversy. Quarterback Jake Locker scored on a 3-yard {{touchdown}} run with 2 seconds remaining in the game, cutting BYU's lead to 28–27. But Locker was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct, and the extra point attempt was moved back 15 yards. The ensuing PAT try was blocked, BYU players rushed the field, and a chorus of boos <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> from the Husky faithful.|$|E

25|$|In 1922, Duff {{sold the}} S.61 {{and focused on}} making Mephistopheles faster and more reliable. Harry Ricardo made a set of {{aluminum}} pistons and raised the engine’s compression ratio. In May, Duff finished third in Brooklands’ 100Mile Handicap. In its next race, one of the Fiat’s engine blocks detached from the crankcase. When the engine blew, the hood was torn off the car, just missing Duff’s head. Engine parts <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> on the track. Duff sold the car for scrap.|$|E
25|$|Massive aerial {{bombardment}} against Pathet Lao and NVA forces {{was carried}} out by the United States. It has been reported that Laos was hit by an average of one B-52 bombload every eight minutes, 24 hours a day, between 1964 and 1973. US bombers dropped more ordnance on Laos in this period than was dropped during the whole of the Second World War. Of the 260 million bombs that <b>rained</b> <b>down,</b> particularly on Xiangkhouang Province on the Plain of Jars, some 80 million failed to explode, leaving a deadly legacy.|$|E
25|$|From 5–14 November 1944, VF-80 <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> {{destruction}} upon Japanese shipping in {{the vicinity}} of Manila; mauled targets on Zablan, Clark and Pasig airfields; and otherwise flew anti-sub and CAP patrols to protect the task group. At this point in the war the carriers were facing significantly less air opposition—certainly less than Vorse had been accustomed to during his time with VFs 2, 3 and 6. Japan's experienced aviators were dwindling, as were its carriers, which it guarded jealously for the final conflict. Even if these resources were available, the American re-capture of the Philippines effectively cut off Japan from much-needed oil.|$|E

25|$|On April 2, 2008 Florian {{defeated}} Joe Lauzon at UFC Fight Night 13 by TKO due to strikes from mount {{early in}} the second round to secure his spot among the UFC's top lightweight contenders. The first round went back and forth as Kenny landed a vicious body kick and Lauzon looked for knee bars and heel hooks. Florian finished the round with some hard shots to Joe's head. Florian opened the 2nd round with a takedown and <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> punches on Lauzon from the mount position. Lauzon attempted another heel hook but Florian continued to strike which resulted in Herb Dean stopping the fight.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{nonetheless}} {{did receive}} artillery support, from their counterparts. Most of the Japanese shells <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> {{on the main}} column at the bridge, adding to the rising death toll. The ambush party, having done a substantial slaughter, duly fell back in several groups that same evening and by next day most of B Company had rejoined their battalion in a position near Gemas. B Company lost one man killed in action and six men missing in the fighting at the bridge. The six missing men were later learned to have been shot after being captured by the Japanese. The Japanese 9th Brigade war diary puts the casualties of the Mukaide Detachment at seventy dead and fifty-seven wounded {{but this does not}} include the other attached units.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to the 3rd Marine Regiment advance was strong, {{with all}} three battalions engaged with the Japanese. The 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment—having crossed the Piva River without trouble—advanced toward a slight rise and as the lead scouts came {{over the top of}} this ridge, the Japanese opened fire from reverse slope {{positions}}. The scouts—having been pinned down—held their positions {{while the rest of the}} battalion moved forward with a strong charge over the ridge and cleared the area of Japanese. 90mm mortar fire then <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> on the Americans, who sheltered in the foxholes that the Japanese had dug throughout the area. Suffering a number of casualties, the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment established itself in a defensive night position.|$|E

25|$|Hoping {{to break}} a {{stalemate}} at Monte Cassino, the Allies landed {{on the coast of}} Italy at Nettuno, ancient Antium, which was midway between Ostia and Terracina. They found that the place was undefended. They intended to move along the line of the via Appia to take Rome, outflanking Monte Cassino, but they did not do so quickly enough. The Germans occupied Mounts Laziali and Lepini along the track of the old Via Latina, from which they <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> shells on Anzio. Even though the Allies expanded into all the Pomptine region, they gained no ground. The Germans counterattacked down the via Appia from the Alban hills in a front four miles wide, but could not retake Anzio. The battle lasted for four months, one side being supplied by sea, the other by land through Rome. In May 1944, the Allies broke out of Anzio and took Rome. The German forces escaped to the north of Florence.|$|E
25|$|Al Harrington, a {{small forward}} who had {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} best sixth-men in the NBA, was dealt in the offseason to the Atlanta Hawks in return for Stephen Jackson after Harrington allegedly demanded that the Pacers start him or trade him. Nevertheless, the Pacers started off the 2004–05 season in extremely strong fashion–until the infamous events of November 19, 2004. Toward the end of a Pacers victory over the Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills on November 19, 2004, the Pacers' Ron Artest committed a hard foul against Ben Wallace. Wallace retaliated with a hard push, and the situation escalated to a full-scale brawl, with fans and several Pacers taking part. While Artest defiantly laid atop the scorer's table, Pistons fan John Green threw a cup of Diet Coke at Artest, causing him to charge into the stands. Stephen Jackson followed him into the stands while Jermaine O'Neal struck a fan who came onto the court. The game was called off with 46 seconds left on the clock and the Pacers left the floor amid a shower of beer and other beverages that <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> from the stands.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Brook {{production}} seems to have provided an impetus for directors to tackle the play, and ever since 1955, {{there has been a}} steady stream of performances on the English and American stages. After Brook, the next major production came in 1967, when Douglas Seale directed an extremely graphic and realistic presentation at the Centre Stage in Baltimore with costumes that recalled the various combatants in World War II. Seale's production employed a strong sense of theatrical realism to make parallels between the contemporary period and that of Titus, and thus comment on the universality of violence and revenge. Seale set the play in the 1940s and made pointed parallels with concentration camps, the massacre at Katyn, the Nuremberg Rallies and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Saturninus was based on Benito Mussolini and all his followers dressed entirely in black; Titus was modelled after a Prussian Army officer; the Andronici wore Nazi insignia and the Goths {{at the end of the}} play were dressed in Allied Forces uniforms; the murders in the last scene are all carried out by gunfire, and at the end of the play swastikas <b>rained</b> <b>down</b> onto the stage. The play received mixed reviews with many critics wondering why Seale had chosen to associate the Andronici with Nazism, arguing that it created a mixed metaphor.|$|E
