40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} {{a class of}} restless multiarmed bandit processes (RMABs) that arises in dynamic multichannel access, user/server scheduling, and optimal activation in multiagent systems. For this class of RMABs, we establish the indexability and obtain Whittle <b>index</b> in <b>closed</b> <b>form</b> for both discounted and average reward criteria. These results lead to a direct implementation of Whittle index policy with remarkably low complexity. When arms are stochastically identical, we show that Whittle index policy is optimal under certain conditions. Furthermore, it has a semiuniversal structure that obviates the {{need to know the}} Markov transition probabilities. The optimality and the semiuniversal structure result from the equivalence between Whittle index policy and the myopic policy established in this work. For nonidentical arms, we develop efficient algorithms for computing a performance upper bound given by Lagrangian relaxation. The tightness of the upper bound and the near-optimal performance of Whittle index policy are illustrated with simulation examples.

40|$|We utilise {{and develop}} Whittle's restless bandit {{formulation}} to analyse a simple class of inventory routing problems with direct deliveries. These routing problems {{arise from the}} practice of vendor-managed inventory replenishment and concern the optimal replenishment {{of a collection of}} inventory holding locations controlled centrally by a decision maker who is able to monitor inventory levels throughout the network. We develop a notion of location indexability from a Lagrangian relaxation of the problem and show that (subject to mild conditions) the locations are indeed indexable. We thus have a collection of location <b>indices</b> in <b>closed</b> <b>form,</b> namely, real-valued functions of the inventory level (one for each location), which measure in a natural way (namely, as a fair charge for replenishment) each location's priority for inclusion in each day's deliveries. We discuss how to use such location indices to construct heuristics for replenishment and assess a greedy index heuristic in a numerical study where it performs strongly. A simpler approximate index analysis is available for the case in which the demand at each location is Poisson. This analysis permits a more explicit characterisation of the range of holding cost rates for which (approximate) location indexability is guaranteed...|$|R

We consider that a base-station updates many users on stochastic information arrivals over a wireless broadcast network, where only one user can be updated for each time. In this context, we aim at developing a transmission scheduling algorithm for minimizing the long-run average age. To develop a low-complexity transmission scheduling algorithm, we apply the Whittle's framework for restless bandits. We successfully derive the Whittle <b>index</b> in a <b>closed</b> <b>form</b> and establish the indexability, by introducing a post-action age.

Variations in culprit plaque morphology {{may account for}} these inaccuracies. Methods and Results—We compared the 10 -year Framingham <b>risk</b> <b>index,</b> histologic coronary calcification, and culprit plaque morphology in 79 consecutive adults with sudden cardiac death. There was a modest relationship between the Framingham <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> {{and the extent of}} histologic coronary calcification (r 50. 35, P 50. 002). Agreement in risk classification between the histologic calcification score and the Framingham <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> occurred in 50 of 79 cases (63. 3 %, P 50. 039). Either a focus of coronary artery calcification $ 40 mmol/L (62 % of cases) or a Framingham <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> score $ average risk for age (62 % of cases) were present in 66 of 79 (83. 5 %) cases. Cases with plaque erosion (n 522) had significantly less coronary calcification (P 50. 003) and lower Framingham <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> (P 50. 001) scores than stable (n 527) or ruptured (n 530) plaques.

The proposed maintenance adjustment model consists of an operation data analysis and risk analysis. The risk analysis comprises the definition of the upper and the lower risk criterion, as well as the definition of a <b>risk</b> <b>index.</b> If the <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> is higher than the lower risk criterion, the component is significant, while it is not significant and has an acceptable <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> if the <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> is lower than the lower risk criterion. For each significant component with a <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> found to be “unacceptable” or “undesirable”, an efficient maintenance policy needs to be adopted.
