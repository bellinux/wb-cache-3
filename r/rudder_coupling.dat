40|$|Autonomous Underwater Vehicles find {{extensive}} {{applications in}} defense organizations for underwater mine detection and region surveillance. These are also useful {{for oil and}} gas industries in detection of leakage in the pipelines and also in many other marine industries. Underwater Robots can be categorized into two types namely (i) Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and (ii) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). A ROV is a remotely operated vehicle usually connected with the mother ship or base station through a tethered wire whereas AUV is an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle which traverses autonomously without any external interference. As opposed to ROV, control of an AUV is difficult because it is an underactuated system (whose actuator inputs are less than the number of degrees of freedom to be controlled), also the dynamics of AUV is influenced by external disturbances such as ocean current and hydrodynamic effects. The motion control problems of an AUV can be of different types such as path following, trajectory tracking, waypoint tracking and also localization. The thesis first develops path following control of a single AUV using the Serret- Frenet(S-F) frame approach and error backstepping technique. Later on the same back- stepping approach has been extended for implementation of formation control for multiple AUVs. Out of various motion control strategies, this thesis mainly focusses on path following control problem of a single AUV. To address this problem of path following, a virtual frame is considered. This virtual moving frame is called the S-F frame. The purpose of using S-F frame is to represent the AUV kinematics in terms of virtual frame parameters. Then a suitable control strategy has been developed which generates appropriate thruster force and rudder orientation enabling the AUV to follow the desired path. In the thesis, the path following controller has been developed using the concept of error backstepping method. In the developed controller it is also shown that the path following error i. e. distance between virtual frame and AUV actual frame approaches to zero and it is also ensured that other states of the AUV remain stable and bounded. Although error backstepping approach has been employed for path following problem but the earlier work [1] has not considered the surge motion dynamics and coupling of rudder angle. Therefore, this thesis has addressed the limitation of [1] and developed the backstepping controller considering the <b>rudder</b> <b>coupling</b> term. Although using a single AUV has many advantages but in case of its failure, the com- plete mission may be affected. Further, the area coverage by an individual AUV is limited. Thus, multiple AUVs are deployed for achieving a co-operative operation. Co-operative working of multiple AUVs obviate the aforesaid disadvantages as the group of AUVs in co-operative motion provides robustness in case of an individual AUV failure. Recently, a lot of research has been directed on developing cooperative motion control of multiple AUVs. Co-operative motion control can be achieved through different control strategies such as Leader-Follower, Virtual Based structure and Behavior Based Formation Con- trol. These cooperative control strategies have their own advantages and disadvantages. Hence, these strategies have been reviewed and in this work, the concept of S-F together with error backstepping approach have been exploited to develop formation control of multiple AUVs. A fuzzy logic controller has also been implemented for deriving the con- trol algorithm for leader-follower formation control scheme applied to control a group of AUVs. Subsequently, the thesis presents a graphical simulation environment using VRML and SIMULINK 3 D to visualize the effect of controllers developed in providing the desired path following and formation control activities of AUV(s). This graphical simulation accepts the AUV states as inputs and represents the motion in an oceanic environment. Also a proposal on hardware set up design of a single AUV is presented in the thesis. The selection of necessary sensors, actuators and various electronics components for the AUV hardware have been presented...|$|E
5000|$|In cases, when a pure servo {{pendulum}} self-steering gear is not usable (Hydraulic rudder gear, {{very big}} force needed {{to turn the}} rudder), auxiliary rudder systems are used. They consist of a servo pendulum <b>rudder</b> <b>coupled</b> directly to an auxiliary rudder {{which is part of}} the self-steering system. The main rudder in such case is used to [...] "trim" [...] the main course and the self-steering gear steers [...] "around" [...] that main course according to the changes of the apparent wind.|$|R
50|$|During the {{production}} of the Series II the tail skids were replaced with tail wheels and later on, swiveling wheels. Skis were also available, although open cockpit flying in the winter could be a challenge. Rudder pedals were introduced which allowed side slipping of the aircraft as well as crosswind landings. The <b>rudders</b> could be <b>coupled</b> to the ailerons or de-coupled and controlled by the pedals in flight through a mixer gear.|$|R
5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern on {{the port}} side, near the port <b>rudder</b> shaft. The <b>coupling</b> {{on the port}} rudder {{assembly}} was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|R
50|$|The I-20 is a modernized {{version of}} the M-20. It is a 20 ft sloop rigged scow with a spinnaker. The boat was first built at Melges Boat Works, now Melges Performance Sailboats. The boat has two bilgeboards and two small <b>rudders.</b> After a <b>couple</b> years of experimentation, the class settled on its current rules in 2002. The new rules {{permitted}} a larger, asymmetrical spinnaker and a carbon fiber rig. It is currently made by Windward Boatworks. In 2005, Melges brought out a new Melges 17 {{to compete with the}} I-20.|$|R

50|$|Its wooden high {{gull wing}} had a {{rectangular}} centre section, occupying about 20% {{of the overall}} 26 m span and mounted with marked dihedral. On each side a pair of rearwards leaning N-form lift struts braced {{the end of this}} section to the lower fuselage longeron. The outer panels had no dihedral and were strongly straight tapered, with a taper ratio of 1:4.7, though the trailing edges were unswept. They were also strongly tapered in thickness. Its large area wing and consequent low wing loading meant the Obs flew slowly. The thin, narrow chord wing tips carried endplate fins; like those on some of Lippisch's Storch tailless gliders, these carried <b>rudders</b> that were <b>coupled</b> to the conventional rear rudder, assisting it and allowing the Obs to have a short fuselage. The trailing edge of each outer panel carried three equal span ailerons. The outer one, together with that on the other wing, acted as differential ailerons but the inner pair also served as camber changing flaps. There is some doubt whether or not the wing was fitted with inboard upper surface airbrakes; these may have been added as a result of test flying.|$|R
