5|$|How {{the matter}} {{escalated}} to a duel {{is also the}} subject of some uncertainty. In his biography of Benjamin Hardin, Lucious P. Little recounts that Chambers immediately challenged <b>Rowan</b> to a duel. According to Little, <b>Rowan,</b> embarrassed at his behavior, refused the challenge and repeatedly apologized for his actions, but Chambers was insistent on the duel and continued hurling insults of growing severity at <b>Rowan</b> until <b>Rowan</b> accepted the challenge. A letter from George M. Bibb, published {{a year after the}} event and reprinted in 1912 in the Register of the Kentucky State Historical Society, claims that Chambers' challenge was issued through a letter delivered to <b>Rowan</b> by Chambers' friend, Major John Bullock, on January 31, 1801. Bibb claims that he and <b>Rowan</b> had, after the night of the incident, gone to nearby Bullitt County on business, that <b>Rowan</b> had returned first, and that <b>Rowan</b> showed Bibb the letter upon his return on February 1.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} first session of the Tenth Congress, <b>Rowan</b> {{proposed}} that a congressional committee be formed to investigate accusations against General James Wilkinson that, in 1788, he took money from the government of Spain in exchange for efforts to separate Kentucky from Virginia and unite it with Spain rather than the United States. Aaron Burr {{had been accused of}} working with Wilkinson in the so-called Spanish Conspiracy, and when Burr had approached <b>Rowan</b> in 1806 to solicit his services in defending Burr against the charges, <b>Rowan</b> had declined because he believed Burr to be guilty. Rowan's proposal to form an investigative committee against Wilkinson failed, but he succeeded in gaining approval for a committee to investigate federal judge Harry Innes' purported role in the Conspiracy. <b>Rowan</b> was appointed to the committee and delivered its report April 19, 1808; the report stated that the committee could find no evidence of wrongdoing by Innes.|$|E
5|$|Completing {{his studies}} in 1793, <b>Rowan</b> moved to Lexington, Kentucky and read law under former Kentucky Attorney General George Nicholas. He was {{admitted}} to the bar in May 1795 and commenced practice in Louisville. <b>Rowan</b> struggled financially during his early years as a lawyer. Nelson County judge Atkinson Hill took an interest in <b>Rowan,</b> furnishing him with money to expand his law library and taking him as a business partner. In order to earn some money, <b>Rowan</b> accepted an appointment as a public prosecutor, but after securing a felony conviction against a young man in his first case, he was so troubled that he resigned the office and resolved never again {{to play the role of}} prosecutor. For the remainder of his career, he always represented defendants. An advocate of education, <b>Rowan</b> allowed several prominent young law students to study in his office, including future U.S. Treasury Secretary James Guthrie, future Supreme Court Justice John McKinley, and future Kentucky Governor Lazarus W. Powell.|$|E

5|$|In 1836, <b>Rowan</b> and {{two other}} men founded the Louisville Medical Institute, the forerunner of the University of Louisville medical school. The next year, <b>Rowan</b> {{was chosen as the}} school's first president, serving in that {{capacity}} until 1842. He also served as the first president of the Kentucky Historical Society from 1838 until his death.|$|E
5|$|In 1839, {{the house}} {{suffered}} fire {{damage to the}} third story and roof. Carpenter Alexander Moore was hired to repair the damage, as he had worked on the design elements and woodwork in 1818. John <b>Rowan,</b> Jr. occupied Federal Hill {{after the death of}} his father. When John, Jr. died in 1855, his widow, Rebecca Carnes <b>Rowan,</b> occupied Federal Hill until 1897. The house then passed to their daughter, Madge (<b>Rowan)</b> Frost.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} act of public service, in 1839 <b>Rowan</b> was {{appointed}} as a commissioner to adjust land claims of U.S. citizens against the Republic of Mexico. During an adjournment {{of the commission}} in 1842, <b>Rowan</b> returned to Kentucky to visit relatives. While there, he fell ill {{and was unable to}} return to Washington, D.C.; consequently, he resigned his commission. <b>Rowan</b> died July 13, 1843. He was interred in the family burial ground at Federal Hill. In his will, <b>Rowan</b> specified that no marker should be placed over his grave, noting that his parents' graves had no markers, and {{he did not want to}} be honored above his parents. Several years later, members of his family placed a marker over his grave, despite his wishes. According to legend, the marker frequently tumbles from its base, purportedly a manifestation of <b>Rowan</b> haunting his grave.|$|E

5|$|On April 10, 1826, <b>Rowan</b> {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to legislation to reorganize the federal judiciary that would have required seven justices to concur with a decision in order to strike down a law as unconstitutional. The amendment, which ultimately failed, was offered {{in the aftermath of}} a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States declaring an occupying claimant law to be unconstitutional; <b>Rowan</b> personally disagreed with the Court's decision. <b>Rowan</b> offered another amendment providing that ministers of the federal courts would be subject to state laws when carrying out the decisions of the federal courts. After a month of debate, the entire bill was tabled.|$|E
5|$|Public {{sentiment}} {{was against}} <b>Rowan</b> {{in the matter}} of his duel with Chambers. Soon after the duel, friends of Chambers formed a posse and rode toward Rowan's house. <b>Rowan</b> concocted a ruse whereby he dressed a family slave in his coat and hat and sent him riding from the house on horseback. The posse was fooled into thinking the slave was <b>Rowan</b> and gave chase, but the slave escaped and Rowan's life was spared as well. Days later, the owner of the land where the duel had taken place swore out a warrant for Rowan's arrest for murder. Some accounts hold that, as Commonwealth's Attorney, Rowan's friend Felix Grundy would have been responsible for prosecuting the case against <b>Rowan</b> and that Grundy resigned the position to avoid prosecuting his friend. Grundy's biographer, John Roderick Heller, admits that this was possible, although no evidence exists to confirm it. Heller also points out that Grundy was Commonwealth's Attorney not in Nelson County (the location of Bardstown), but in neighboring Washington County at the time. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss and Colonel William Allen served as counsel for <b>Rowan.</b> The judge opined that there was insufficient evidence to send the case to a grand jury, and <b>Rowan</b> was released.|$|E
5|$|Relative of the <b>Rowan</b> family, Stephen Collins Foster, {{occasionally}} visited Federal Hill {{according to}} letters penned by Stephen's brother Morrison Foster. Stephen {{was inspired by}} the imagery witnessed at Federal Hill and by Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin to write his ballad My Old Kentucky Home. The mansion remained in the possession of Rowan's family until 1922, when his granddaughter, Madge (<b>Rowan)</b> Frost, sold it to the state of Kentucky to be preserved as a state shrine. Today, it is a part of My Old Kentucky Home State Park in Bardstown. In 1856, the Kentucky General Assembly created a new county from parts of Fleming and Morgan counties and named it <b>Rowan</b> County in Rowan's honor.|$|E

5|$|<b>Rowan</b> {{was known}} {{throughout}} his life as an avid gamester. On January 29, 1801, <b>Rowan</b> joined Dr. James Chambers and three other men for a game of cards at Duncan McLean's Tavern in Bardstown. After several beers and games of whist, Chambers suggested playing Vingt-et-un for money instead. <b>Rowan</b> had determined not to gamble during this session of gaming, but impaired by the alcohol, he agreed. After a few hands, an argument broke out between Chambers and <b>Rowan.</b> The exact nature of the argument is not known. Some accounts claim it was over who was better able to speak Latin and Greek; others suggest that general insults were exchanged between the two men. A brief scuffle followed the disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} duel with Chambers, <b>Rowan</b> moved to Frankfort, Kentucky, the state capital. In 1802, {{he was one}} of 32 men who signed a pledge to bring James Madison to Transylvania University as superintendent. This action began a long {{relationship}} between <b>Rowan</b> and Transylvania, and the university presented him with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1823. Governor Christopher Greenup appointed <b>Rowan</b> Secretary of State in 1804. He served until 1806, when {{he was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives. He represented Kentucky's Third District (which included Bardstown) during the Tenth Congress from March 4, 1807 to March 3, 1809, even though he did not reside in that district at the time.|$|E

5|$|After {{his service}} in the Senate, <b>Rowan</b> {{returned}} to Kentucky, dividing his time between Louisville and Bardstown. During an epidemic of cholera that spread through Bardstown in 1833, three of Rowan's children (William, Atkinson, and Mary Jane) died. The spouses of William and Mary Jane also died of cholera, as did Mary Jane's daughter, and Rowan's sister Elizabeth and her husband. Aid from Bishop Joseph Flaget {{and a group of}} nuns who traveled to Federal Hill during the epidemic probably spared the life of Rowan's orphaned granddaughter, Eliza <b>Rowan</b> Harney.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1824 elections, the Relief faction gained a 22–16 {{majority}} in the state Senate and a 61–39 majority in the House. The pro-Relief majority in the state Senate subsequently elected <b>Rowan</b> to the U.S. Senate, which had the inadvertent effect of weakening the faction's cause in the House by removing its leader there. <b>Rowan</b> served in the Senate from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1831. During the Twenty-first Congress, he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E
5|$|Bullock {{served as}} Chambers' second for the duel; Bibb acted as second for <b>Rowan.</b> According to Bibb, he and Bullock met on February 1 {{to discuss the}} {{parameters}} for the duel. Bullock proposed that the matter be dropped, but Bibb insisted that Chambers would have to retract his challenge, to which Bullock would not consent. The duel was held February 3, 1801, near Bardstown. Both combatants missed with their first shots. Both men fired again, and Rowan's second shot struck Chambers, wounding him severely. (Bibb's account says that Chambers was struck in the left side; other accounts state that the shot hit Chambers in the chest.) <b>Rowan</b> then offered his carriage to take Chambers to town for medical attention, and Chambers asked that <b>Rowan</b> not be prosecuted. Despite medical aid, Chambers died the following day.|$|E
5|$|Concerned for the {{education}} of his children, Captain <b>Rowan</b> moved the family to Bardstown, Kentucky in 1790. There, John <b>Rowan</b> began his education under Dr. James Priestly at Salem Academy. Salem Academy was, at the time, considered one of the best educational institutions in the west. Among Rowan's classmates at the Academy were future U.S. Attorney General Felix Grundy, future U.S. Senator John Pope, future U.S. District Attorney Joseph Hamilton Daveiss, and future Kentucky state senator John Allen. <b>Rowan</b> and Grundy were members of a debating society called the Bardstown Pleiades which may have been an outgrowth of Salem Academy. Other notable members of the society included future Florida Governor William Pope Duval, future U.S. Postmaster General and Kentucky Governor Charles A. Wickliffe, and future Kentucky Senator Benjamin Hardin.|$|E
