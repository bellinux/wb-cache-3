Water is drawn from the river at two points: the <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> station at Zorn Avenue and River Road, and the B.E. Payne Pump Station northeast of Harrods Creek. Water is also obtained from a riverbank infiltration well at the Payne Plant. There are also two water treatment plants serving the Louisville Metro area: The Crescent Hill Treatment Plant and the B.E. Payne Treatment Plant. In June 2008, the Louisville Water Company received the [...] "Best of the Best" [...] award from the American Water Works Association, citing it as the best-tasting drinking water in the country.|$|E
50|$|From {{the point}} of origin the river flows north turning left where it is joined by River Salpe, its right-bank tributary. It then begins its north-eastward journey and passes the Anglo-Eastern Maritime Academy which is {{situated}} on its right bank at Khandpe village. The river bypasses the Palasdhari village where it receives the discharge from the Palasdhari Dam starting a northward course beyond this point coming to lie parallel to the rail tracks only to be distracted by the town of Karjat. Meandering through Karjat, it reaches further north synapsing with River Peg between Bhivpuri Road and Neral. Continuing its run along Neral it is joined by River Poshir, another right-bank tributary at Nikhop village. It flows north skirting Badlapur where it receives the run-off from Chikhloli Dam. Near <b>Raw</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> house of MIDC Jambhul the river meets Barvi Dam discharge water also called as Barvi River. The confluence is a tourist and fishing hub for villagers around. The river flows through Ulhasnagar to which it gives its name.It then passes under the rail bridge connecting Ambivali and Shahad(A part of Ulhasnagar city) and shortly after confluences with its biggest tributary formed by merging of River Bhatsa and River Kalu which together account for 55.7% of the total catchment area of River Ulhas.|$|E

40|$|A {{membrane}} {{pilot study}} was conducted at the Surface Water Treatment Plant in Monroe, Georgia between November 23, 1999 and March 12, 2000. During the pilot study, a microfiltration pilot unit was rented from Memcor, Inc., a division of US Filter. This unit treated 20 to 21 gallons per minute (gpm) of raw water from Monroe’s <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> station that {{is located on the}} Alcovy River. The membrane selected to conduct the pilot study was tolerant of oxidizing agents (e. g., chlorine or chlorine dioxide), which were required to control iron and manganese. In summary of the pilot study, the microfiltration unit was able to treat raw water directly from the Alcovy River (i. e., direct filtration) without incidence of any potential violation of drinking water regulations on a full-scale basis. Effluent turbidity averaged 0. 038 NTU throughout the study, which is well below the filtered effluent turbidity level of 0. 3 NTU being imposed by the USEPA as part of the new Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR). Based on effluent turbidity levels, membrane pore size (approximately 0. 1 microns), and bacteriological test results, microfiltration also appears to offer effective protection against Cryptosporidium and Giardia cysts (i. e., pathogens) ...|$|E
40|$|Condition {{assessment}} of aging assets and infrastructure {{is a growing}} concern in North America. The Canadian Water and Wastewater Association (CWWA) estimated that a $ 28 billion investment is needed for municipal water systems in Canada from 1997 to 2012. The condition of 43 % of water supply systems in Canada is unacceptable. A systematic condition assessment is a pre-requisite of an effective asset and infrastructure management practice. The present study focuses on analyzing the principal factors that affect infrastructure condition, data requirement, and how the condition of a targeted element can be assessed. The main objectives of this research are to develop condition assessment models for selected existing elements of Drinking Water Treatment Plant (DWTP) and develop condition rating scales and a web-based tool. The condition of five DWTP elements are studied in this research: settling tank, filtration tank, chlorination tank, <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> and clean water pump. Condition rating (CR) models are designed using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Multi Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) approaches. Evaluation results show that the top ranked category for tanks is 'Physical (design and construction stage) ' with a relative importance of 32 % and for pumps is 'Operational' with an importance of 34 %. The preference level of each parameter is being measured on a numerical scale of 0 - 10. Twenty five practical case studies are used to validate the developed models, which show robust results.

40|$|At present, {{there is}} very few {{published}} literature for energy cost of water supply. National Water Supply and Drainage Board(NW&SDB) is the prime organization responsible for providing drinking water to public in the country. Therefore the NWS&DB has the vested interest to optimize the energy of operation and maintenance for the water supply schemes {{in order to give}} more benefits to the public. Hence it was decided to carry out this research work and to utilize the outcome of the research for the NWS&DB. The effect of water level variation to energy wastage in the water supply intake on Kelani River for Ambatale water supply scheme was selected as this is {{the most common type of}} intake of water supply schemes in NWS&DB. The main focus of this research is to identify and evaluate the energy conservation potential for the water supply scheme. The research was based on the available data of past records of water supply intake at Ambatale. Such as annual water level variations of the Kelani River at the intake, annual water production, annual electricity consumption, actual pumps performances and system performance data. Data was analyzed to obtain power consumption and intake water level variation, operation condition of pumps and the system was modeled using Water CAD computer model to obtain actual status of the operational condition of pumps and the system. Analyses were carried out for scenarios during drought where highest water level fluctuation is occurred and the normal situation and the flooding situation. Analyses showed that flow variations in drought were 6, 600 m 3 /day and 5, 016 m 3 /day for old and new intakes respectively for single pump operation, resulting total energy loss of 286, 413. 9 kWh and 1, 066. 8 kWh per month for old and new intakes respectively and <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> <b>pumping</b> energy variation is about 34 %. The highest water level variation the intake was 2. 2 m. The specific energy consumption for the treatment plant was found to vary between 0. 307 kWh/m 3 and to 0. 479 kWh/m 3. Therefore any effort on energy conservation should concentrate more on reducing energy consumption of <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> and distribution <b>pumping.</b> The research identified <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> <b>pumping</b> energy consumption varies according to the water level of the intake.

50|$|The Lansing Board of Water and Light obtains all <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> from {{a series}} of 124 wells located {{throughout}} the city of Lansing, {{making it one of the}} few public utilities for large cities that provides water exclusively from wells.

The <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> is <b>pumped</b> directly to two conditioning plants: the John Dye plant located in downtown Lansing and the Wise Road plant located on the southwest side of the city. At these plants, water hardness is reduced by adding lime and soda ash to the water, which reacts with dissolved calcium and magnesium to form calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide floc. The floc then settles out of the water in large settling basins, and any residual floc is removed via sand and gravel filtering. This process reduces the hardness of the water from approximately 411 parts per million (ppm) to about 85 ppm. The finished water is then chlorinated and fluorinated, and sent to storage prior to distribution.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{demand for}} urban water supply is {{emerging}} as a significant issue. This work undertakes a multi-city time-series analysis of the direct energy use for urban water supply. It quantifies the energy use and intensity for water supply in 30 cities (total population of over 170 million) and illustrates their performance with a new time-based water-energy profiling approach. Per capita energy use for water provision ranged from 10 kWh/p/a (Melbourne in 2015) to 372 kWh/p/a (San Diego in 2015). <b>Raw</b> <b>water</b> <b>pumping</b> and product <b>water</b> distribution dominate the energy use of most of these systems. For 17 cities with available time-series data (between 2000 and 2015), a general trend in reduction of per capita energy use for water provision is observed (11 %– 45 % reduction). The reduction {{is likely to be}} a result of improved water efficiency in most of the cities. Potential influencing factors including climate, topography, operational efficiency and water use patterns are explored to understand why energy use for water provision differs across the cities, and in some cities changes substantially over time. The key insights from this multi-city analysis are that i) some cities may be considered as benchmarks for insight into management of energy use for water provision by better utilising local topography, capitalising on climate events, improving energy efficiency of supply systems, managing non-revenue water and improving residential water efficiency; ii) energy associated with non-revenue water is found to be very substantial in multiple cities studied and represents a significant energy saving potential (i. e. a population-weighted average of 16 kWh/p/a, 25 % of the average energy use for water provision); and iii) three Australian cities which encountered a decade-long drought demonstrated the beneficial role of demand-side measures in reducing the negative energy consequences of system augmentations with seawater desalination and inter-basin water transfers...|$|R

40|$|In Suriname {{groundwater}} {{is mostly}} used for drinking water production. Depending {{on the ground}} layers from which groundwater is extracted, groundwater is characterized as aggressive water. The disadvantage of aggressive water {{is its ability to}} cause corrosion of metal pipelines and cement bound materials. In drinking water practice this water type is conditioned by means of air stripping, dosing of hydroxides or filtration through carbonate rich media. Currently the drinking water company SWM in Suriname suffers from water quality problems regarding low pH and occasionally low hardness and low alkalinity. These water quality problems are observed at pumping stations with aggressive <b>raw</b> <b>water.</b> Despite the conditioning of the aggressive groundwater by means of shell filtration, the drinking water quality does not satisfy the National Drinking Water Standards and VEWIN recommendations.
