The model {{is based on the}} probability of not finding any sphere center in an arbitrary volume of a given size. This probability contains a limiting packing density, Φm, as a fitting parameter. The physical meaning of Φm is the solids concentration above which every particle in the suspension is in contact with at least one of its neighbors. It means that at solids concentration Φ=Φm the fraction of particles whose motions are constrained by the presence of any other contacting particles becomes unity. The value of Φm is evaluated from nearest neighbor distributions in <b>random</b> <b>assemblies</b> of spheres obtained by computer simulation. The closeness of the resulting value, Φm= 0. 52, to that reported by Probstein et al.

40|$|Resistive {{switches}} are a {{class of}} emerging nanoelectronics devices that exhibit {{a wide variety of}} switching characteristics closely resembling behaviors of biological synapses. Assembled into random networks, such resistive switches produce emerging behaviors far more complex than that of individual devices. This was previously demonstrated in simulations that exploit information processing within these random networks to solve tasks that require nonlinear computation as well as memory. Physical assemblies of such networks manifest complex spatial structures and basic processing capabilities often related to biologically-inspired computing. We model and simulate random resistive switch networks and analyze their computational capacities. We provide a detailed discussion of the relevant design parameters and establish the link to the physical assemblies by relating the modeling parameters to physical parameters. More globally connected networks and an increased network switching activity are means to increase the computational capacity linearly at the expense of exponentially growing energy consumption. We discuss a new modular approach that exhibits higher computational capacities and energy consumption growing linearly with the number of networks used.

30|$|Although {{multistage}} lithographic or patterning techniques {{produce the}} most reproducible SERS substrates, these methods are not cost-effective. Moreover, the lithographic SERS substrates can provide only a moderate enhancement {{as compared with}} some <b>random</b> <b>assemblies</b> [40]. In common practice, SERS substrates of the second type are fabricated by depositing a thin metal layer onto a self-assembled colloidal crystal. The plasmonic and SERS properties of such substrates {{are determined by the}} size of the colloidal templates used and the thickness of the deposited metal film. The film-over-spheres method allows the substrate structure to be precisely controlled, with the number of the necessary fabrication steps being minimal, which makes this technique more cost-effective. Furthermore, these substrates retain their SERS activity for months, even after their being exposed to high temperatures. For example, quite recently, Greeneltch et al. [41, 42] have fabricated a new type of plasmonic SERS substrates in the form of silver or gold nanorods immobilized on silica or polystyrene microspheres covered by thin silver or gold films. This method produces radially oriented SERS-active pillars separated by small gaps. The surface plasmon resonance of such substrates was shown to be capable of being tuned from 330 to 1, 840 nm by varying the microsphere diameter. For optimized substrates, the large-scale SERS enhancement was about 108 under near-infrared (NIR) excitation (1, 064 nm).|$|R

30|$|Several {{ways are}} {{possible}} {{to optimize the}} method described here. First, it seems advisable to replace gold nanorods with silver-coated nanorods [63] or to investigate other types of nonspherical gold or silver nanoparticles [64]. For example, Zhang et al. [65] fabricated SERS substrates based on large-scale metallic thin films assembled from size-selected silver nanoplates with tunable plasmonic properties. It was shown [65] that the aggregation of silver nanoplates with sharp corners produces hot spots between the corner gaps, thus leading to strong electromagnetic SERS enhancement. Unfortunately, unlike that of gold nanorods, the high-yield fabrication of monodisperse silver nanorods {{is not an easy}} task [66, 67], and a recent review of this issue has been published by Negri and Dluhy [68]. However, gold nanorods can be used as convenient templates for subsequent silver coating to ensure flexible tuning of the localized plasmon resonance from near-infrared (e.g., 900 nm) to visible (e.g., 580 nm) [69]. Our preliminary results show that the Au@Ag core-shell nanorod assemblies demonstrate better SERS performance as compared to aggregated gold nanorod films. Our full 3 -D finite-difference time-domain simulations [70] confirm the existence of enhanced local electromagnetic hot spots that are more intensive in the case of <b>random</b> <b>assemblies</b> of silver-coated nanorods. Investigations along these lines are under way at our laboratories, and the results will be published elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical study of flow through static <b>random</b> <b>assemblies</b> of monodisperse, spherical particles. A lattice Boltzmann approach {{based on a}} two relaxation time collision operator is used to obtain reliable predictions of the particle drag by direct numerical simulation. From these predictions a closure law F(Re, φ) of the drag force relationship to the bed density φ and the particle Reynolds number Re is derived. The present study includes densities φ ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 35 with Re ranging up to 300, that is compiled into a single drag correlation valid for the whole range. The corelation has a more compact expression compared to others previously reported in literature. At low particle densities, the new correlation {{is close to the}} widely used Wen & Yu - correlation. Recently, there has been reported a discrepancy between results obtained using different numerical methods, namely the comprehensive lattice Boltzmann study of Beetstra et al. (2007) and the predictions based on an immersed boundary - pseudo-spectral Navier-Stokes approach (Tenneti et al., 2011). The present study excludes significant finite resolution effects, which have been suspected to cause the reported deviations, but does not coincide exactly with either of the previous studies. This indicates the need for yet more accurate simulation methods in the future. Comment: Preprint submitted to Elsevier. Comments welcome...|$|R
