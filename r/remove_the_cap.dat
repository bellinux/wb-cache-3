25|$|In {{response}} to the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill at an offshore drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico threatening the coast of Louisiana, Vitter introduced legislation along with Jeff Sessions of Alabama to increase the liability cap of an oil company from $75 million to its most recent annual profits (or $150 million if greater). In the case of BP, {{the owner of the}} oil lease, its liability would be $20 billion. Vitter later introduced an amendment that would <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> entirely for this particular spill. Competing Democratic proposals would have raised the liability to $10 billion regardless of profits or removed the cap altogether. Sessions argued that large caps unrelated to company profits would harm smaller companies.|$|E

50|$|ALKA, the {{predecessor}} {{of the modern}} ring-pull caps, was introduced during the 1930s. ALKA had a seal made of natural cork. It became popular in Nordic countries as an easy-to-open cap. ALKA was made of aluminum and had a tab that was pulled to <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cap.</b> There was no scoring on an ALKA cap. In the 1970s the MaxiCap was first produced. A MaxiCap is an aluminum closure with scoring and a tab to pull. They were easier to use than the ALKA and pre-manufactured outside of the bottling plant. This allowed for increased production speeds on the bottling line. Soon after the MaxiCap came the RingCrown closure. Invented in the early 1980s it was originally called MaxiCrown and later became known as RingCrown. The RingCrown is easier to use than its predecessors because it has an attached ring rather than a static pull off tab.|$|E
50|$|Some {{expensive}} merchandise {{will be in}} {{a locked}} case requiring an employee to get items at a customer's request. The customer is either required to purchase the merchandise immediately or it is left at the checkout register (under the supervision of a cashier) for the customer to purchase when finished shopping. This prevents the customer from having a chance to conceal the item. Another way of locking merchandise, especially popular in liquor stores, is to place it in a secure, store-administered hard-plastic cap on a regular bottle top. Once purchased the clerk will <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> with a store key. It is not otherwise easily removable. Many stores also lock CDs, DVDs, and video games in locking cases, which can only be opened by the checkout operator once the item has gone through the checkout. Many stores have certain items on locking pegs which are secure hooks to where the item cannot be removed from the hook.|$|E

The organization {{is located in}} East Harlem ("El Barrio"), on 117th St and 2nd Avenue. Founded in February 2003 by five female Mexican street vendors, EdB campaigns for economic access for its street vendor members, which currently number over 600. The vendor-members sell street food or other goods, such as fresh flowers and toys. They work and live all over the city, especially in Upper Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. Esperanza del Barrio also provides ESL classes, video production classes, after-school tutoring for children, a youth group, and a legal clinic. In 2005, Esperanza del Barrio succeeded in passing legislation (Intro 491-A) in City Council that removes the necessity of showing working papers to receive a personal vending license from the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs. The organization is currently fighting to <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> on general pushcart permits. Esperanza del Barrio is a core member of the Street Vendors for Justice Coalition.|$|E

30|$|The “protective/safety cap” {{category}} includes use errors {{divided into}} four subcategories. “Incorrect needle capping after the injection” refers to cases in which users failed to cover or cap the needle after the injection or did not cover it as recommended. Four publications reported that users did not cap the needle after an injection (Phillips et al., 2011; Hudry et al., 2017; Schertz et al., 2011; Saunders et al., 2012). Two publications state that the needle capping was not done as recommended (Jeannerot et al., 2016; Mahony et al., 2015). For instance, they capped the needle using one hand, rather than two (Mahony et al., 2015). Removal of the protective/safety cap prior to an injection concerned cases in which users did not <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> at all, and {{cases in which the}} users did not <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> as recommended. For the first case (“cap not removed”), users were not aware that they had to do this, or they simply forgot to do so (Fujioka et al., 2015; Sicherer et al., 2000; Robinson et al., 2014; Matfin et al., 2015; Salter et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2013; Guerlain et al., 2010 a; Umasunthar et al., 2015; Bakirtas et al., 2011; Mehr et al., 2007; Arga et al., 2011; Topal et al., 2013; Hanna et al., 2016; Schmid et al., 2013; Rohrer et al., 2013; Hudry et al., 2017; Lange et al., 2014; Schertz et al., 2011; Guerlain et al., 2010 b; Andre et al., 2017). In the second case (“incorrect cap removal”), users either did not hold the device correctly during cap removal (Phillips et al., 2011; Brown et al., 2013), or used the wrong hand (Saleh-Langenberg et al., 2017). One publication mentioned that users removed the cap manually rather than by extending the device’s injector shield while they were pointing it away from the body (Phillips et al., 2011). Use errors related to “cap removed in wrong order” were solely reported for the two adrenaline auto-injectors Anapen (Salter et al., 2014) and Twinject (Guerlain et al., 2010 a), both of which have two safety caps.|$|E
40|$|How {{much does}} the current social {{security}} system redistribute from rich to poor? We propose alternative concepts of well-being {{that can be used}} to classify individuals from rich to poor, and we show how social security redistributes differently under each concept. We use the PSID to estimate lifetime wage profiles and actual earnings each year for a sample of 1778 individuals, and we use mortality probabilities to calculate expected payroll taxes and social security benefits. For a given set of “facts ” about the net flows experienced each year by each individual, measured progressivity depends on many assumptions. This paper attempts to capture and to quantify all of the data and characteristics relevant to determine each individual’s “income ” under several def-initions. We then use each definition of income to classify individuals from rich to poor and to calculate the progressivity of social security. We proceed in seven steps. First, we classify individuals by annual income and use Gini coef-ficients to find that social security is highly progressive. Second, we reclassify individuals on the basis of lifetime income and find that social security is less progressive. Third, we <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> on measured earnings and find that social security is even less progressive. Fourth, we switc...|$|E
