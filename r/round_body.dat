5|$|Rowland (2009) {{identified}} {{an additional}} mechanism of countershading not previously analysed, namely that a <b>round</b> <b>body</b> like a cylinder illuminated and seen from above {{appears to have}} dark sides. Using a graphics tool, she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading. Since predators are known to use edges to identify prey, countershading may therefore, she argues, make prey harder to detect when seen from above.|$|E
5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous air sacs under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones. The air sacs {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how air sacs are inflated. The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial air sacs may also help to <b>round</b> <b>body</b> contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Like other hamsters, {{members of}} Phodopus have a <b>round</b> <b>body</b> shape, short tails and cheek pouches {{in which they}} can store food. They all live in dry {{conditions}} with extreme temperatures. They inhabit the forests, steppes and semi-deserts of Mongolia, Siberia, China and Kazakhstan. Fossils of Phodopus have been found in Pleistocene and Pliocene deposits in Europe and Asia.|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of Vibrio marinus MP- 1 was {{studied by}} phase and electron microscopy. The ultrastructure of the vibrio form of V. marinus {{was found to}} be typically gram-negative with a trilaminar plasma membrane and cell wall. The coccoid or <b>round</b> <b>bodies</b> noted in otherwise pure cultures of V. marinus were frequently found in early and late stationary phase of growth. The <b>round</b> <b>bodies</b> in ultrathin section were found to contain at least one, and often three or four, cell units. Three types of <b>round</b> <b>bodies</b> were observed in ultrathin section, each differing in size and behavior: “spherules,” “spheres” or the “round body,” and “giant cells” or “macrospheres. ” The <b>round</b> <b>bodies</b> appeared to be associated with, or to result from, the constrictive cell division of V. marinus...|$|R

25|$|Compared to {{standard}} intermediate cartridges one can carry more 4.6×30mm ammunition {{due to the}} lighter weight and relative small dimensions of the cartridge. Also, due to the lighter weight of the bullet, aiming in rapid fire is much easier as recoil depends much on {{the weight of the}} bullet. CRISAT testing shows that because of the smaller diameter and high projectile velocity of the <b>round,</b> <b>body</b> armor penetration is higher than that of traditional handgun projectiles.|$|E
25|$|This Soviet plug, still {{widely used}} in modern Russia, has pin {{dimensions}} and spacing equal to the Europlug, but lacks the insulation sleeves. Unlike the Europlug, it is rated 6A. It has a <b>round</b> <b>body</b> like the French CEE 7/6 or flat body with a round base like CEE 7/17. The round base has no notches. The pins are parallel and do not converge. The body is made of fire resistant thermoset plastic. The corresponding 6A socket accepts the Europlug, but not others as the 4.5mm holes {{are too small to}} accept the 4.8mm pins of CEE 7/4, CEE 7/6 or CEE 7/7 plugs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{giant panda}} (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, {{literally}} [...] "black and white cat-foot"; , literally [...] "big bear cat"), {{also known as}} panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its <b>round</b> <b>body.</b> The name [...] "giant panda" [...] is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. Though {{it belongs to the}} order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.|$|E
2500|$|Sonic's {{appearance}} varies greatly {{depending on}} the medium and the style {{in which he is}} drawn. In the video games, Sonic's original design by Oshima was short and round, with short quills, a <b>round</b> <b>body,</b> and no visible irises. Artwork featuring this design and drawn by Akira Watanabe was displayed on the package artwork for Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic's proportions would change for the release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on the Mega Drive; Sonic's head to height ratio was changed from 1:2 to 1:2.5. For the 1998 release of Sonic Adventure, Sonic was redesigned by Yuji Uekawa as a character with longer legs and a less spherical body, longer and more drooping quills, and green-colored irises. For the 2006 game, Sonic was redesigned to make him look adult-like and taller to appeal to the next generation players. This was also done because Sonic would interact with humans more often and his design was supposed to fit. An alternative [...] "Werehog" [...] form was introduced in Sonic Unleashed, placing more emphasis on Sonic's melee skills rather than speed. Although Tetsu Katano acknowledged the large negative fan response to the Werehog, he believes it could return in a future game.|$|E
