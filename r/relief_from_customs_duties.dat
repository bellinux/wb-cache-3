5000|$|This ateleia {{might even}} become {{equivalent}} to the full franchise, as, e. g. the Byzantines gave the exemption from liturgies, and the franchise to all Athenians that might go to Byzantium. (Dem. De Coron. p. 256.) In many instances a partial ateleia, or an exemption <b>from</b> <b>custom</b> <b>duties,</b> was granted {{for the purpose of}} encouraging commerce. (Theophr. Char. 23 Schol. ad Aristoph. Plut. 905, with Bockh's remarks, Publ. Earn. p. 87.) With regard to the inhabitants of a state, we must, {{as in the case of}} Athens, again distinguish between two classes, the resident aliens (metics) and real citizens. At Athens all resident aliens had to pay a tax (metoikion or xenikon telos) which we may term protection-tax, because it was the price for the protection they enjoyed at Athens; but as it was the interest of the state to increase commerce, and for that purpose to attract strangers to settle at Athens, many of them were exempted from this tax, i. e. enjoyed the ateleia metoikiou, (isoteleia equal rights) (Dem. c.Aristae): p. 691), and some were even exempted <b>from</b> <b>custom</b> <b>duties,</b> and the property tax or eisphora from which an Athenian citizen could never be exempted. The ateleia enjoyed by Athenian citizens was either a general immunity (ateleia apanton), such as was granted to persons who had done some great service to their country, and even to their descendants, as in the case of Harmodius and Aristogeiton; or it was a partial one exempting a person from all or certain liturgies, <b>from</b> certain <b>custom</b> <b>duties,</b> or <b>from</b> service in the army. The last of these immunities was legally enjoyed by all members of the [...] council of the Five Hundred (Lycurg. c. Leocr. 11), and the archons for the time being, by the farmers of the <b>custom</b> <b>duties</b> (Dem. c. Neaer. 1353), and by those who traded by sea, although with them the exemption must have been limited. (Schol. ad Arist. Plut. 905, Acham. 39i); Suid. s. v. emporos eimi) Most information respecting the ateleia is derived from Demosthenes' speech against Leptines. But compare also Wolf's Prolegom. ad Lept. p. Ixxi. &c.; Bockh,Pz^ Econ. p. 85, &c.; Westermann, De publicis Atheniensium Honoribus et Praemiis^ p. 6, &c. S.|$|R

5000|$|I take s. 121, apart <b>from</b> <b>customs</b> <b>duties,</b> to {{be aimed}} against trade {{regulation}} {{which is designed}} to place fetters upon or raise impediments to or otherwise restrict or limit the free flow of commerce across the Dominion as if provincial boundaries did not exist. That it does not create a level of trade activity divested of all regulation I have no doubt; what is preserved is a free flow of trade regulated in subsidiary features which are or have come to be looked upon as incidents of trade. What is forbidden is a trade regulation that in its essence and purpose is related to a provincial boundary.|$|R
