For the hydrogen atom, the role of reduced mass is most simply seen in the Bohr model of the atom, where the reduced mass appears in a simple calculation of the <b>Rydberg</b> <b>constant</b> and Rydberg equation, but the reduced mass also appears in the Schrödinger equation, and the Dirac equation for calculating atomic energy levels.|$|E

For values of Z between 11 and 31 this latter relationship had been empirically derived by Moseley, in a simple (linear) plot of the square root of X-ray frequency against atomic number (however, for silver, Z = 47, the experimentally obtained screening term should be replaced by 0.4). Notwithstanding its restricted validity, Moseley's law not only established the objective meaning of atomic number (see Henry Moseley for detail) but, as Bohr noted, it also did more than the Rydberg derivation to establish {{the validity of the}} Rutherford/Van den Broek/Bohr nuclear model of the atom, with atomic number (place on the periodic table) standing for whole units of nuclear charge.|$|E

Lunar laser ranging data are found to be consistent with this hypothesis, which also provides a straightforward explanation for the so-called Pioneer anomaly, that is, a time-dependent blue-shift observed when analyzing radio tracking data from distant spacecrafts, as well as an alternative explanation for both the apparent time-dilation of remote events and the apparent acceleration of the Universe. The main argument against this hypothesis, namely, the constancy of fine-structure and <b>Rydberg</b> <b>constants,</b> is discussed. Both of them being combinations of several physical constants, their constancy imply that, if the speed of light is indeed time-dependent, then at least two other “fundamental constants ” have to vary as well.

40|$|For my thesis, I worked towards {{using two}} {{reference}} cavities to provide frequency stabilization to a 486 nm dye-ring laser. After a doubling cavity doubles the frequency to 243 nm, the laser beam {{is used to}} excite ground state hydrogen to the 2 S state: {{the first step of}} an experiment to accurately measure the 2 S-NS transitions of hydrogen and measure the Lamb shift and <b>Rydberg's</b> <b>constant.</b> Two stabilization cavities were used to prevent the frequency from drifting and to narrow the laser's line-width. I aligned the majority of the optics and coupling light into fiber-optic cables and Fabrey-Perot cavities. Coupling light into a high finesse Fabrey-Perot cavity requires matching the radius of curvature of constant phase of the laser with the geometry of the cavity. To do this, I first measured the physical properties of the laser beam and then numerical arrived at a solution using two lenses to match the conditions imposed by the cavity's geometry. I aligned the cavity and then observed a Pound-Drever-Hall error signal. This error signal will be fed back into the laser to stabilize the frequency. It is anticipated that when the electronics to utilize the error signals are completed, the laser frequency will be stabilized to a hundred hertz, an four order of magnitude improvement over the stability provided by the commericial laser. by Charles A.

40|$|We {{study the}} interplay between {{rotating}} wave approximation and optimal control. In particular, we show that for a wide class of optimal control problems one can choose the control field such that the Hamiltonian becomes time-independent under the rotating wave approximation. Thus, we show how to recast the functional minimization defined by the optimal control problem into a simpler multi-variable function minimization. We provide the analytic solution to the state-to-state transfer of the paradigmatic two-level system and to the more general star configuration of an $N$-level system. We demonstrate numerically the usefulness of this approach in the more general class of connected acyclic $N$-level systems with random spectra.

40|$|Abstract- The {{coupling}} {{of electronic}} and nuclear motions in the rovibronic {{levels of the}} lowest Rydberg states of methyl iodide is {{discussed in terms of}} a frame transformation between lab- and body-frame coordinate systems for an s Rydberg electron in the field of an electronically-degenerate, symmetric-top molecular ion core. It is shown that the r-dependence of exchange, spin-orbit, spin-rotation, and vibronic interactions, where r is the radial distance of the electron from the ion core, must be considered in order to provide a consistent analysis of the experimental data. Molecular constants, obtained by fitting one- and two-photon absorption spectra, show conclusively that the spin of the Rydberg electron is uncoupled from the molecular frame. Bandshape fitting reveals that the interaction between electronic and vibrational angular momenta leads to complete angular momentum quenching in some vibronic levels, in which it appears that the vibrating core "traps " the <b>Rydberg</b> electron. <b>constants</b> permit extrapolation of channel mixing across ionization thresholds in CH 3 I but not in HI. discussion of these events is sketched.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the photoabsorption and the {{constant}} ion state spectroscopy of vinyl bromide (C 2 H 3 Br). The photoabsorption spectrum was measured using synchrotron radiation and was investigated in detail between 5. 0 and 12. 0 eV photon energy revealing many previously unobserved structures. These features were analyzed in terms of valence to virtual valence transitions and Rydberg series. The examination of the three Rydberg series converging towards the first ionization threshold (2 a"->ns, 2 a"->np and 2 a"->nd) leads to wavenumbers of 335 +/- 30, 690 +/- 30 and 1305 +/- 30 cm- 1. The vibrational wavenumbers of the progressions belonging to Rydberg series converging towards the second ionization threshold are 485 +/- 30 and 1145 +/- 50 cm- 1. Ab initio calculations helped the assignment of the valence transitions and of the observed vibrational wave numbers in the <b>Rydberg</b> series. <b>Constant</b> Ionic State spectra were recorded for vibronic states corresponding to {{the first and the}} second electronic states of the ion.
