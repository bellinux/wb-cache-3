25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1884, Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri (ZBD), three {{engineers}} associated with the Ganz factory, determined that open-core devices were impractical, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage. In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a wound around iron wire <b>ring</b> <b>core</b> or b)surrounded by iron wire core. In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely {{within the confines of}} the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see toroidal cores). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs. The Ganz factory in 1884 shipped the world's first five high-efficiency AC transformers.

5000|$|Many fish species’ {{life cycle}} {{involves}} two distinct habitats. The adults live in warmer temperate waters south of Cape Hatteras, NC while the juveniles {{are found in}} estuaries of cooler waters north of Cape Hatteras. Warm <b>Core</b> <b>Rings</b> {{play an important role}} in the transport of larvae between the two habitats. Species like the bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) and pearly razorfish (Xyrichtys novacula) spawn near the western edge of the Gulf Stream just south of Cape Hatteras. [...] Because of the convergence of the Gulf Stream from the south and cooler coastal water current from the north, most water around Cape Hatteras flows into the Gulf Stream. [...] The larvae released near this convergence is swept into the Gulf Stream and flows north. Since the larvae are planktonic, they don’t swim into the center of the Gulf Stream but stay near the western edge. [...] This is beneficial for when warm <b>core</b> <b>rings</b> form. Warm <b>core</b> <b>rings</b> are formed when the crest of a meander breaks off from the Gulf Stream. Any larvae in the crest of the meanders are then entrapped in the warm <b>core</b> <b>ring.</b> [...] Once the warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> breaks way, it takes a southwesternly path towards the coast. The interaction between warm <b>core</b> <b>rings</b> and the continental shelf creates a weakening of the ring and enables the larvae to escape and continue their journey to nearby estuaries. The warm <b>core</b> <b>rings</b> formed along the northeastern states can last between 4 and 5 months. [...] During this time the larvae grow so that by the time they reach the estuaries, they are able to swim away from the warm <b>core</b> <b>ring</b> into the estuaries.|$|R

40|$|A {{model that}} {{describes}} the magnetic behavior of nanocrystalline <b>ring</b> <b>cores</b> is useful for simulations of electronic circuits that contain inductors or transformers using these cores. A general but computationally demanding model combines a macroscopic model of the ribbon with a dynamic Preisach hysteresis model. In this paper, we present two models that-taking into account the principle of loss separation-make it possible to avoid {{the use of the}} CPU time consuming dynamic Preisach model. Both models compute the waveform of the magnetic flux density for an arbitrary waveform of the magnetic field, or vice versa. The first model uses a macroscopic model based on the plane wave theory and the classical rate-independent Preisach formalism. The macroscopic model operates in the frequency domain and applies the harmonic balance principle. Because of nonlinearity, the model is solved iteratively by a Newton-Raphson scheme. The second model starts from a single evaluation of the classical Preisach model. Additionally, it uses a lookup table that {{is a function of the}} flux density and its time derivative to evaluate the classical and excess field to be added.

Window-type current transformers (aka zero sequence current transformers, or ZSCT) are also common, which can have circuit cables run through the middle of an opening in the core to provide a single-turn primary winding. To assist accuracy, the primary conductor should be centered in the aperture.|$|E
