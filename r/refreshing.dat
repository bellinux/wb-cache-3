40|$|Technology obsolescence, {{also known}} as DMSMS (Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages), is a {{significant}} problem for systems whose operational life is much longer than the procurement lifetimes of their constitute components. The most severely affected systems are sustainment-dominated, which means their long-term sustainment (life-cycle) costs significantly exceed the procurement cost for the system. Unlike high-volume commercial products, these sustainment-dominated systems may require design <b>refreshes</b> to simply remain manufacturable and supportable. A strategic method for reducing the life-cycle cost impact of DMSMS is called <b>refresh</b> planning. The goal of <b>refresh</b> planning is to determine when design <b>refreshes</b> should occur (or what the frequency of <b>refreshes</b> should be) and how to manage the system components that are obsolete or soon to be obsolete at the design <b>refreshes.</b> 	Existing strategic management approaches focus on methods for determining design <b>refresh</b> dates.

40|$|Abstract—Ever-growing {{application}} data footprints demand faster main memory with larger capacity. DRAM {{has been the}} technology choice for main memory due to its low latency and high density. However, DRAM cells must be <b>refreshed</b> periodically to preserve their content. <b>Refresh</b> operations negatively affect performance and power. Traditionally, the performance and power overhead of <b>refresh</b> have been insignificant. But as the size and speed of DRAM chips continue to increase, <b>refresh</b> becomes a dominating factor of DRAM performance and power dissipation. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the issues related to <b>refresh</b> operations in modern DRAMs. Specifically, we describe the difference in <b>refresh</b> operations between modern synchronous DRAM and traditional asynchronous DRAM; the <b>refresh</b> modes and timings; and variations in data retention time. Moreover, we quantify <b>refresh</b> penalties versus device speed, size, and total memory capacity. We also categorize <b>refresh</b> mechanisms based on command granularity, and summarize <b>refresh</b> techniques proposed in research papers. Finally, based on our experiments and observations, we propose guidelines for mitigating DRAM <b>refresh</b> penalties...|$|R
40|$|DRAM cells must be <b>refreshed</b> (or rewritten) {{periodically}} to maintain data integrity, and as DRAM density grows, {{so does the}} <b>refresh</b> time and energy. Not all data need to be <b>refreshed</b> with the same frequency, though, and thus some <b>refresh</b> operations can safely be delayed. Tracking such in-formation allows the memory controller to reduce <b>refresh</b> costs by judiciously choosing when to <b>refresh</b> different rows. Solutions that store imprecise information miss opportu-nities to avoid unnecessary <b>refresh</b> operations, but the stor-age for tracking complete information scales with memory capacity. We therefore propose a flexible approach to re-fresh management that tracks complete <b>refresh</b> information within the DRAM itself, where it incurs negligible storage costs (0. 006 % of total capacity) and can be managed easily in hardware or software. Completely tracking multiple types of <b>refresh</b> information (e. g., row retention time and data va-lidity) maximizes <b>refresh</b> reduction and lets us choose the most effective <b>refresh</b> schemes. Our evaluations show that our approach saves 25 - 82 % of the total DRAM energy over prior refresh-reduction mechanisms. 1...|$|R
50|$|The row {{address of}} the row that will be <b>refreshed</b> next is {{maintained}} by external logic or a counter within the DRAM. A system that provides the row address (and the <b>refresh</b> command) does so to have greater control over when to <b>refresh</b> and which row to <b>refresh.</b> This is done to minimize conflicts with memory accesses, since such a system has both knowledge of the memory access patterns and the <b>refresh</b> requirements of the DRAM. When the row address is supplied by a counter within the DRAM, the system relinquishes control over which row is <b>refreshed</b> and only provides the <b>refresh</b> command. Some modern DRAMs are capable of self-refresh; no external logic is required to instruct the DRAM to <b>refresh</b> or to provide a row address.|$|R
