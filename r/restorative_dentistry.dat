2500|$|The {{arrangement}} of enamel rods is understood {{more clearly than}} their internal structure. Enamel rods are found in rows along the tooth, and within each row, the long axis of the enamel rod is generally perpendicular to the underlying dentin. [...] In permanent teeth, the enamel rods near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) tilt slightly toward {{the root of the}} tooth. Understanding enamel orientation is very important in <b>restorative</b> <b>dentistry,</b> because enamel unsupported by underlying dentin is prone to fracture.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{alternative}} to simply reactively repairing the damage to teeth and conforming to the existing occlusal scheme, occasionally some dentists will attempt to reorganize the occlusion {{in the belief that}} this may redistribute the forces and reduce the amount of damage inflicted on the dentition. Sometimes termed [...] "occlusal rehabilitation" [...] or [...] "occlusal equilibration", this can be a complex procedure, and there is much disagreement between proponents of these techniques on most of the aspects involved, including the indications and the goals. It may involve orthodontics, <b>restorative</b> <b>dentistry</b> or even orthognathic surgery. Some have criticized these occlusal reorganizations as having no evidence base, and irreversibly damaging the dentition on top of the damage already caused by bruxism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Restorative</b> <b>dentistry</b> is the study, {{diagnosis}} and integrated management of {{diseases of the}} teeth and their supporting structures and the rehabilitation of the dentition to functional and aesthetic requirements of the individual. <b>Restorative</b> <b>dentistry</b> encompasses the dental specialties of endodontics, periodontics and prosthodontics and its foundation is based upon how these interact in cases requiring multifaceted care.

The Ti 02 nano-composite was prepared and divided into four groups: The first group was an untreated Ti 02 nano-composite. The second group was silane-treated Ti 02 nano-composite. The third group was treated Ti 02 nano-composite which was combined with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHxG).

40|$|A {{patient of}} 58 {{years of age}} without medical {{problems}} came to the clinic due to missing teeth in the upper posterior region and to change the partial fixed prosthesis in the upper anterior area. Proposed treatment: surgical phase of three conical shape tapering implants with prosthetic platform in occlusal direction with mechanize collar tissue level with fixtures to place implant-supported metal-ceramic restorations. In the anterior area, a zirconium oxide fixed partial prosthesis was vertical preparation of the tooth?s. When preparing teeth to receive fixed prostheses, the definition and shape of finish lines has been a subject of endless discussion, modification, and change ever since the beginnings of <b>restorative</b> prosthetic <b>dentistry.</b> The BOPT technique (biologically oriented preparation technique) was first described {{in the context of}} tooth-supported restorations but has recently been applied to dental implants with the aim of ensuring healthy peri-implant tissue and creating the possibility of modeling the peri-implant sulcus by modifying prosthetic emergence profiles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thorough {{diagnosis}} of the esthetic requirements and ramifications of <b>restorative</b> and implant <b>dentistry</b> in the esthetic zone requires a standardized, methodical approach. Examination of the periodontal and peri-implant tissues is {{an essential component of}} this approach because overall gingival display, soft-tissue position and volume, and papilla quantity and quality can exert significant influence on overall implant position as well as the overall esthetic outcome. This article aims to present a method {{that can be used in}} daily clinical prac-tice to consistently evaluate and document a patient’s esthetic require-ments. Smile analysis and smile design principles are used to identify relationships between a patient’s face, smile, periodontium, and natu-ral dentition in preparation for any periodontal–restorative or implant-supported reconstruction where esthetics is a priority.

40|$|Resin {{composites}} and adhesives {{are increasingly}} popular in dental restorations, but secondary caries {{is one of}} the main reasons for restoration failure. Quaternary ammonium monomers (QAMs) have an anti-microbial effect and are widely used in many fields. Since the concept of the immobilized antibacterial effect was put forward, dental restorations containing QAMs have been studied to reduce secondary caries. Previous studies have been struggling to develop novel anti-caries materials which might have triple benefits: good mechanical properties, antibacterial effects and remineralization potentials. Different kinds of QAMs have been proven to be effective in inhibiting the growth and metabolism of biofilms. Combination of QAMs and other nanoparticles in resin composites and adhesives could enhance their anti-caries capability. Therefore, QAMs are promising to show significant impact on the future of <b>restorative</b> and preventive <b>dentistry.</b> Keywords quaternary ammonium monomer; dental caries; anti-biofilms; dental materials 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review was to evaluate the existing scientific evidence on human clinical studies describing the application of computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology in <b>restorative</b> implant <b>dentistry.</b> Materials and Methods: Electronic searches for clinical studies from 1966 through May 2008 focusing on long-term follow-up were performed using the PubMed search engine. Concentrating on the restorative aspect of the CAD/CAM technology applicable to implant dentistry, pertinent literature was divided into articles related to implant abutments and implant frameworks. Results: Of the 885 articles initially reviewed, 5 articles (3 CAD/CAM framework and 2 CAD/CAM abutment) satisfied the search criteria of the literature search performed. Combining {{the results from the}} framework clinical trial studies, there were a total of 189 prostheses supported by 888 implants. The follow-up varied between 12 and 60 months. Four implants were lost prior to the insertion of the prosthesis and 46 after the insertion. One prosthesis failure was reported. Similarly, in the 2 abutment clinical trial studies there were a total of 53 ceramic abutments supported by 53 implants. The patients were followed between 12 and 44 months. No significant failures or complications were reported in association with the implants and their restorations. Conclusions: Based on a {{systematic review}} of literature concerning CAD/CAM used for fabrication of frameworks and abutments, preliminary proof of concept was established. Clinical studies on the use of these techniques were too preliminary and underpowered to provide meaningful conclusions regarding the performance of these abutments/frameworks...|$|R
30|$|Recently silver {{compounds}} and nanoparticles are studied for their vast {{area of research}} in dental applications such as dental restorative material, endodontic retro fill cement, dental implants and caries inhibitory solutions (Jia et al. 2008; Pissiotis and Spngberg 2000; Sheikh et al. 2010; Swift 1989). Glass ionomer cement (GIC) {{is known for its}} adhesiveness and biocompatibility; therefore, it is used as <b>restorative</b> material in <b>dentistry</b> (Pereira et al. 2002; Brentegani et al. 1997). Low wear resistance and facture toughness are the major disadvantages which result in the failure of restoration and leads to growth of bacterial proliferation. These failures can even lead to ancillary caries and tooth fracture. Extensive research had been done to overcome these failures and enhance the mechanical properties and bonding nature of GIC. Silver-amalgam particles, zirconia, spherical silica are some of the promising notable fillers reinforced with GIC to improve mechanical properties of GIC (Contreras et al. 2015).|$|R
