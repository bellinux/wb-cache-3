2500|$|The {{technique}} has an ancient {{tradition in the}} Near East, and is represented in all or most early cultures from the area, and the Indus Valley civilization. The cylinder seal, whose design only appears when rolled over damp clay, from which the flat <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> developed, was the usual form in Mesopotamia, Assyria and other cultures, and spread to the Minoan world, including parts of Greece and Cyprus. These were made in various types of stone, not all hardstone. [...] The Greek tradition emerged in Ancient Greek art under Minoan influence on mainland Helladic culture, and reached an apogee of subtlety and refinement in the Hellenistic period.

40|$|Abstract. Comparison is {{made between}} three {{different}} indices that characterise the individual rings {{of a wide}} range of condensed benzenoid hydrocarbons. Two of these ("π-electron partitions " and the six-centre delocalisation-indices that have been called "Δ 6 -values") have been introduced only recently as potential indicators of what might be called "local aromaticity", whilst the third ("topological π-electron ring-currents") was suggested as a possible discriminator in this regard nearly fifty years ago. Whilst linear correlations between ring currents and π-electron partitions within certain restricted classes of <b>ring</b> <b>types</b> are good (with correlation coefficients of up to 0. 998), agreement between the two indices over all classes of <b>ring</b> <b>types</b> is poor. Predictions arising from a consideration of π-electron partitions and Δ 6 -values seem, on the other hand, to be in somewhat better accord. It is therefore concluded that, despite its superficially intuitive appeal, the ring-current index is out of step both with π-electron partitions and Δ 6 -values as a general indicator of so-called "local aromaticity".

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we compute the Hilbert-Kunz {{functions}} of two-dimensional <b>rings</b> of <b>type</b> ADE by using representations of their indecomposable, maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules {{in terms of}} matrix factorizations, and as first syzygy modules of homogeneous ideals. For these computations we need to compute the Hilbert-series of the involved first syzygy modules {{as well as the}} fact that the surface <b>rings</b> of <b>type</b> ADE defined over the complex numbers are the rings of invariants of C[x,y] under actions defined by the finite subgroups of SL 2 (C). Finally, we will show that the developed tools can be used to compute Hilbert-Kunz functions of two-dimensional <b>rings</b> of <b>type</b> ADE with respect to other (monomial) ideals than the maximal. Moreover, Hilbert-Kunz functions of two-dimensional Fermat rings can be computed by the same method. There is also a paper, named "The Hilbert-Kunz functions of two-dimensional <b>rings</b> of <b>type</b> ADE", which gives a survey of main ideas and results. Moreover, the main theorem from Monskys paper "The Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of an irreducible trinomial" will be generalized to a non-standard graded situation. This result will be used to study the behavior of the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity in degenerations of the hypersurface rings defnied by those specific trinomials.
