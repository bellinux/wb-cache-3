The study aims at understanding the link between social inhibition and social phobia, as well as depression in social phobia. What the study found was an important link connecting the severity of social inhibition during childhood to the severity of social phobia and factors of social phobia in later years. Severe social inhibition during childhood {{can be related to}} lifetime social phobia. Further, the researchers point out that inhibition during childhood is significantly linked to avoidant personality disorder in social phobia as well as childhood inhibition linked with major depressive disorder in social phobia that spans across the individual's lifetime. A major suggestion related to {{the results of the study}} suggested that while inhibition can be a general predictor of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> social phobia, it may not be a specific predictor of social phobia alone.|$|E

Objectives: Data analysis was done <b>to</b> study the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> obesity in school age children in Jakarta. Material and Methods: Experimental design was cross sectional. Samples were primary school, junior high school and senior high school students age 6 – 18 years old in five regions of DKI Jakarta. The number of total samples was 7195 students. Data collected were anthropometry, social-economy, food consumption pattern, physical activities, and life style. Nutrition Status was determined by calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) using CDC 2000 reference. Results: The prevalence of overweight student in DKI Jakarta was 6 %. The prevalence of malnutrition and severe malnutrition students were 11, 2 % and 1, 2 % respectively. The group of student ≤ 9 years old had the highest prevalence of obesity and severe malnutrition. The prevalence was more in male students than female.
