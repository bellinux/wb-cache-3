40|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{effectiveness}} of the application of static magnetic field (SMF) on pain relief, we performed a study on rats with adjuvant arthritis (AA). Sixty female Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (age: 6 weeks, body weight: approximately 160 [*]g) were divided into three groups [SMF-treated AA rats (Group I), non-SMF-treated AA rats (Group II) and control rats (Group III) ]. The SD rats were injected in the left hind leg with 0. 6 [*]mg/ 0. 05 [*]ml Mycobacterium butyrium to induce AA. The rats were bred for 6 months as chronic pain model. Thereafter, the AA rats were or were not exposed to SMF for 12 weeks. We assessed the changes in the tail surface temperature, locomotor activity, serum inflammatory marker and bone mineral density (BMD) using thermography, a metabolism measuring system and the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) method, respectively. The tail surface temperature, locomotor activity and femoral BMD of the SMF-exposed AA rats were significantly higher than those of the non-SMF-exposed AA rats, and the serum inflammatory marker was significantly lower. These findings suggest that the pain <b>relief</b> <b>effects</b> are primarily due to the increased blood circulation caused by the rise in the tail surface temperature.

5000|$|These {{problems}} are further {{compounded by the}} fact that pigments do not dye parchment; instead, they lie on the surface of the parchment and so are rather fragile. Pressing an illuminated manuscript pushes the pigment down, altering the image itself and likely causing damage (such as a <b>relief</b> <b>effect</b> to the other side of the page) so it is very important to not put any pressure upon images on parchment, especially when it is wet. [...] This fact also has to be taken into account when cleaning dirt from the image and when encapsulating or framing illuminated parchment for an exhibition. There must be enough room between the image and the protective surface (such as Perspex) that the image will not be subject to rubbing if the parchment should expand with rising humidity.|$|E

50|$|Chronic {{pain can}} be treated {{in a number of}} ways, and varies {{depending}} on the type and severity of the condition. Common pain medications prescribed to children include paracetamol, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid. Researchers have also found that psychotherapies are often helpful in reducing functional disability in children with chronic pain. A meta-analysis by Christopher Eccleston and colleagues found that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) significantly reduced pain severity for children with chronic headaches. Additionally, biofeedback and relaxation therapy can be used in conjunction with CBT to treat chronic pain. Research thus far has typically found small effects for improving psychological wellbeing, but more robust outcomes for pain relief. Studies have also found significant pain <b>relief</b> <b>effect</b> for alternative medicine treatments, such as acupuncture and herbal medicine. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of other alternative medicine techniques, such as arts therapy, homeopathy, and hypnosis.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, {{treatment}} with intravenous infusions of lidocaine (Xylocaine®) in varying doses {{was reported in}} nine patients. The resulting pain relief lasted from 10 hours to 12 months. In five of the cases, the lidocaine treatment was combined with mexiletine (Mexitil®), which is a class 1B anti-arrhythmic with similar pharmacological properties as lidocaine.The mechanism by which lidocaine reduces pain in Dercum’s disease is unclear. It may block impulse conduction in peripheral nerves, and thereby disconnect abnormal nervous impulse circuits. Nonetheless, it might also depress cerebral activity {{that could lead to}} increased pain thresholds. Iwane et al. performed an EEG during the administration of intravenous lidocaine. The EEG showed slow waves appearing 7 minutes after the start of the infusion and disappearing within 20 minutes {{after the end of the}} infusion.

If a prayer rug design is used, the niche and spandrels are typically tall and narrow. Likewise, the central field is not substantially larger than the main border. Typical for Taşpınar are elongated, almost ogival central medallions, the dominant colours are warm red, blue, and light green. Fertek rugs are distinguished by their simple, floral ornaments. The main field is often not separated from the main border, as usual, by a smaller secondary border. The outermost secondary border often has reciprocal crenellation patterns. The colour composition often contains soft reds, dark olive greens, and blue. Maden rugs used coccineal red for their main fields, which are narrow and slim, as typical for Niğde rugs. The foundation of their main border is often dyed in corrosive brown, which caused deterioration of the carpet pile in these areas, and produces a <b>relief</b> <b>effect.</b> Yahali is a regional center and market place for its surroundings.

The PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases as well as three Chinese databases including the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and VIP platforms were searched through November 2016. The outcome was the extent of pain relief from baseline within 30 [*]min of the first acupuncture treatment.

Real acupuncture showed statistically significantly greater pain <b>relief</b> <b>effect</b> compared to sham acupuncture (SMD, − 0. 56; 95 % confidence interval [CI], − 1. 00 to − 0. 12; 9 RCTs) and analgesic injection (SMD, − 1. 33; 95 % CI, − 1. 94 to − 0. 72; 3 RCTs).
