50|$|The Better Use of Light Bulbs Act (BULB Act), or H.R. 91 (introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives January 5, 2011) repeals {{provisions}} from EISA 2007 regarding lighting energy efficiency. There {{are eight}} provisions to be repealed by this bill, and include those that: prescribe energy efficiency standards for general <b>service</b> incandescent <b>lamps,</b> <b>rough</b> <b>service</b> <b>lamps,</b> and other designated lamps; direct the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to conduct and {{report to the}} Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on an annual assessment {{of the market for}} general <b>service</b> <b>lamps</b> and compact fluorescent lamps; direct the Secretary to carry out a proactive national program of consumer awareness, information, and education about lamp labels and energy-efficient lighting choices; prohibit a manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler from distributing in commerce specified adapters for incandescent lamps; authorize the Secretary to carry out a lighting technology research and development program; set forth minimum energy efficiency standards for incandescent reflector lamps; sets forth requirements for the use of energy efficient lighting fixtures and bulbs in public building construction, alteration, and acquisition, and; require metal-halide lamp fixtures and energy efficiency labeling for designated consumer electronic products to be included within the Energy Policy and Conservation Act's (EPCA) regulatory oversight.|$|R
50|$|The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act, or H.R. 849 (introduced 3/1/2011), also amends {{provisions}} {{from the}} EISA 2007, but is less restricting than H.R. 91. These provisions concern energy efficiency standards for general <b>service</b> incandescent <b>lamps,</b> <b>rough</b> <b>service</b> <b>lamps,</b> and other designated lamps, {{as well as}} incandescent reflector lamps. This bill requires that the Comptroller General present to Congress a report within {{six months of the}} Act's enactment. This report would need to include information that proves that: (1) consumers will obtain a net savings in terms of dollars spent on monthly electric bills and expenses for new light fixtures to accommodate the use of the light bulbs required by such provisions, compared to dollars spent before their enactment; (2) the phase-out of incandescent light bulbs required by such provisions will reduce overall carbon dioxide emissions by 20% in the United States by 2025; and (3) such phase-out will not pose any health risks, including risks associated with mercury containment in certain light bulbs, to consumers of the general public, including health risks with respect to hospitals, schools, day care centers, mental health facilities, and nursing homes. This report would also include monthly and yearly projections of expenses for electric bills and new light fixtures from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2017.|$|R

25|$|Consumption of {{incandescent}} light bulbs grew {{rapidly in the}} US. In 1885, an estimated 300,000 general lighting <b>service</b> <b>lamps</b> were sold, all with carbon filaments. When tungsten filaments were introduced, about 50 million lamp sockets existed in the US. In 1914, 88.5 million lamps were used, (only 15% with carbon filaments), and by 1945, annual sales of lamps were 795 million (more than 5 lamps per person per year).|$|R

The light bulb is housed in a protective cage and a handle that are molded to form a single unit. It has a long power line for distant reaching; the handle may also have electrical outlet on it, allowing the light to also double as an extension cord.|$|R
25|$|During {{ordinary}} operation, the tungsten of the filament evaporates; hotter, more-efficient filaments evaporate faster.

Theatrical, photographic, and projection lamps may have a useful life {{of only a few}} hours, trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form. Long-life general <b>service</b> <b>lamps</b> have lower efficiency but are used where the cost of changing the lamp is high compared to the value of energy used.|$|R

50|$|Fall {{prevention}} is thus {{an important consideration}} in designing homes for the elderly, {{and one of the}} most critical parts of that design process is supplying strong and effective lighting. Thus, when switched on, lights should react instantaneously, so the user is not surprised by a hidden obstacle as he or she moves into a kitchen or bathroom, for example. In such a case, incandescent light bulbs are preferred over fluorescent lighting, because they react instantaneously while a CFL takes time to warm up and become bright. Incandescent light bulbs also offer much greater illuminance than many other light sources, are relatively low cost and easy to install. Higher lighting levels enable users to see potential hazards before they need to take avoiding action, and so negotiate them safely and easily. Excellent colour rendering (as measured by the Colour rendering index) by such incandescent light also helps users identify colours correctly. Halogen bulbs are also available for greater efficiency, as are <b>rough</b> <b>service</b> bulbs to avoid discriminatory regulations, especially in the EU. No doubt LED lights will become an alternative source of high quality lighting in the future, but in 2013 they remain expensive for domestic use. <b>Rough</b> <b>service</b> bulbs are available in sizes up to 200 watt in all varieties of fittings. Although lifetime is generally lower than for CFLs, they are replaced easily.|$|R
2500|$|In flood lamps {{used for}} {{photographic}} lighting, the tradeoff {{is made in}} the other direction. Compared to general-service bulbs, for the same power, these bulbs produce far more light, and (more importantly) light at a higher color temperature, at the expense of greatly reduced life (which may be as short as two hours for a type P1 lamp). The upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal. Tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point, [...] A 50-hour-life projection bulb, for instance, is designed to operate only [...] below that melting point. Such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt, compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general <b>service</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|R

[...] Light bulbs outside of this range are exempt from the restrictions. Also exempt are several classes of specialty lights, including appliance <b>lamps,</b> <b>rough</b> <b>service</b> bulbs, 3-way, colored lamps, stage lighting, plant lights, candelabra lights under 60 watts, outdoor post lights less than 100 watts, nightlights and shatter resistant bulbs.

25|$|This {{means that}} a 5% {{reduction}} in operating voltage will {{more than double the}} life of the bulb, at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16%. This may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficult-to-access location (for example, traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings). Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off. Since the value of the electric power they consume is much more than the value of the <b>lamp,</b> general <b>service</b> <b>lamps</b> emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps. Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours. When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life.|$|R
