5|$|On 11 July 2012, {{the show}} {{producer}} Christer Björkman advised the public {{not to buy}} tickets for the 2013 Contest that are currently in circulation and instead to wait for tickets to be released through official channels. Björkman said that official tickets {{had not yet been}} released, as necessary decisions over the stage and seating plans had not yet been made. Björkman also gave <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> accommodation would be available, as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of hotel rooms, some may be made available to the general public. On 21 November 2012, SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> this was not a theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> the {{character}} would not fail. The global head of marketing, Al Nilsen, became involved, and playtested the game across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown Mario and then played Sonic the Hedgehog. 80 percent preferred Sonic the Hedgehog, {{and the game}} was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. The game was released in North America on June 23, 1991, and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month. Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles, replacing Altered Beast. This tactic enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail. Sega of America created a large-scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company.|$|E
5000|$|Moderate anxiety: Reality-oriented <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> {{were used}} to prepare a patient with {{moderate}} anxiety for an operation are stored in the patient’s memory, so they are available to aid in post-operational stress.|$|R
50|$|Douglas Fairbanks {{had played}} the role of Bertie in the {{original}} stage production, but was already committed to his own film project when he was approached about the film adaptation. Instead, Fairbanks recommended Keaton for the role instead with his confident <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> the comedian would be appropriate.|$|R
5000|$|Low anxiety: The {{defenses}} of denial and other <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> {{were created to}} ward off the worry and apprehension preoperatively are not effective long-term. When all the pain and stress is experienced post-operatively, the emotional tension is unrelieved because there aren’t any real reassurances available from the pre-operational stage.|$|R
25|$|If {{the degree}} of {{bleeding}} is mild, all that may be sought by the woman is the <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> there is no sinister underlying cause. If anemia occurs due to bleeding then iron tablets {{may be used to}} help restore normal hemoglobin levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{criticism}} {{is that the}} system of voting power distribution through a quota system institutionalises borrower subordination and creditor dominance. The resulting division of the IMF's membership into borrowers and non-borrowers has increased the controversy around conditionality because the borrowers are interested in increasing loan access while creditors want to maintain <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> the loans will be repaid.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{a run on}} {{potassium}} iodide tablets in pharmacies in Western Canada, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, issued statements on 15 March of <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> Canada was not at risk from the fallout, and that taking the iodine tablets was unnecessary. British Columbia's health officer Dr. Perry Kendall, urged residents not to stockpile the tablets.|$|E
50|$|Russia {{initially}} avoided direct {{confrontation with}} Turkey, but insisted repeatedly that {{the sale of}} S-300s to Cyprus would proceed without interference. Turkey consequently looked to her strategic NATO partners, including the United States for <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> {{she would not be}} prevented from acting against the perceived threat, should the need arise.|$|R
50|$|On 24 February 2006, {{northeast}} Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima Province authorities met {{to discuss}} the 2007 SEA Games schedule, and progress on the province's under-construction US$65 million sports complex. Presided over by governor Somboon Ngamlak, the meeting provided an overview of facilities, and ended with <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> facilities would be ready for SEA Games in 2007.|$|R
50|$|At a Rio Group summit held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, on 7 March 2008, after {{a heated}} {{exchange}} of accusations between Correa and Uribe, the diplomatic crisis was temporarily resolved with Colombia's apologies {{for the attack}} and <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> it won't be repeated. Correa said that with this resolution Latin America was starting a new era where international principles of justice will have preeminence over power.|$|R
25|$|Education of patients, families, and {{caregivers}} {{is an important}} component of the appropriate treatment of PBA. Crying associated with PBA may be incorrectly interpreted as depression; laughter may be embarrassing. It is therefore critical for families {{and caregivers}} to recognize the pathological nature of PBA and the <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> this is an involuntary syndrome that is manageable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reassurance</b> <b>that</b> the {{condition}} is benign, elimination of precipitating factors and improving oral hygiene are considered initial management for symptomatic OLP, and these measures are reported to be useful. Treatment usually involves topical corticosteroids (such as betamethasone, clobetasol, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone) and analgesics, or if these are ineffective and {{the condition}} is severe, the systemic corticosteroids may be used. Calcineurin inhibitors (such as pimecrolimus, tacrolimus or cyclosporin) are sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|In August 1940, Soviet Foreign {{minister}} Molotov {{told the}} Germans that, {{with the government}} change, they could close down their Baltic consulates by 1 September. The Soviet annexations in Romania caused further strain. While Germany had given the Soviets Bessarabia in the secret protocols, it had not given them North Bukovina. Germany wanted guarantees of the safety of property of ethnic Germans, security for the 125,000 Volksdeutsche in Bessarabia and North Bukovina, and <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> the train tracks carrying Romanian oil would be left alone.|$|E
50|$|In May 2004, after <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> {{he would}} not be {{tortured}} if he was extradited to Turkey, a German court rescinded his refugee status and authorised his extradition to Turkey. Shortly after the court's decision, before German police could arrest him, Kaplan disappeared from Cologne. After the court decision was temporarily suspended, Kaplan reappeared on May 31, claiming to have been sick during his disappearance.|$|R
50|$|Toby's {{behaviour}} {{and ability}} to perform his job have deteriorated {{to the point where}} the school is losing pupils. The other members of the Board want to sack Toby. Miles has come to ask Celia for <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> Toby will change and that she will stand by him. Celia can not imagine Toby ever changing and announces that she is about to leave him.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{the many}} {{uncertainties}} about AIDS are {{the center of}} discourse on the illness, and <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the general population" [...] is safe are multiplying. The judgments on the illness and the patients are still implicit in any discussion, and Sontag believes that detaching the guilt and shame from perspectives on this disease, and retiring the military metaphors from the discussion, will contribute to productive discourse on AIDS and help those who have contracted the illness.|$|R
25|$|In {{his speech}} to WJC delegates, Orbán {{condemned}} the rise in anti-Semitism in Hungary and in Europe more widely. He called it a danger that “threatens even us Christians” and voiced determination to stamp it out. The WJC said in reaction that Orbán had not confronted {{the true nature of}} the problem. “We regret that Mr. Orbán did not address any recent anti-Semitic or racist incidents in the country, nor did he provide sufficient <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> a clear line has been drawn between his government and the far-right fringe,” a WJC spokesman said afterwards.|$|E
25|$|A residue may form on newly erupted {{teeth of}} both dentitions that may leave the teeth extrinsically stained. This green-gray residue, Nasmyth membrane, {{consists}} of the fused tissue of the reduced enamel epithelium and oral epithelium, {{as well as the}} dental cuticle placed by the ameloblasts on the newly formed outer enamel surface. Nasmyth membrane then easily picks up stain from food debris and is hard to remove except by selective polishing. The child’s supervising adults may need <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> it is only an extrinsic stain on a child’s newly erupted teeth.|$|E
25|$|After Alessio pulled out, Diaz took {{advantage}} of the opportunity, submitting veteran Josh Neer in the third round. Seemingly back in the UFC, Diaz stopped Brazilian newcomer Gleison Tibau with strikes in his next fight at UFC 65. However, even after the win and the <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> the UFC would give him another fight, Diaz decided to sign with the Gracie Fighting Championships and leave the UFC. GFC had Diaz scheduled to fight Thomas Denny in January 2007, but due to poor ticket sales the event was ultimately scrapped.|$|E
5000|$|After the forgery {{was exposed}} {{there was great}} {{interest}} in the exact source of the funding. It was composed of [...] "£360,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, a further £75,000 from the National Art Collections Fund and £2,500 from the Friends of Bolton Museum and Art Gallery," [...] plus a further £1,500 from the J. B. Gass Trust. Bolton Museum detailed the financing on their website, and gave <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> no council money was involved.|$|R
5000|$|Hitchcock {{closed the}} show {{in much the same}} way as it opened, but mainly to tie up loose ends rather than joke. Frequently, in the filmed story, a leading {{character}} would have seemingly gotten away with a criminal activity; in the postscript, Hitchcock would briefly detail how fate (or the authorities) eventually brought the character to justice. Hitchcock told TV Guide <b>that</b> his <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> the criminal had been apprehended were [...] "a necessary gesture to morality." ...|$|R
25|$|During the First World War, Head treated {{patients}} with brain injuries in London. The war prompted Head to write poetry which was later published in 1919 {{in the volume}} Destroyers and Other Verses, it also brought him together with fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon, who was under Rivers's care. After Rivers's premature death in 1922, Head adopted the mentoring role that he had once occupied, comforting a distraught Sassoon with remembrances of their friend and <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> nothing mattered except life.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the apparent variations in marine biodiversity may actually be an artifact, with abundance estimates directly related to quantity of rock available for sampling from different time periods. However, statistical analysis shows that this can only account for 50% of the observed pattern, and other evidence (such as fungal spikes) provides <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> most widely accepted extinction events are real. A quantification of the rock exposure of Western Europe indicates that many of the minor events for which a biological explanation has been sought are most readily explained by sampling bias.|$|E
25|$|As {{a form of}} entertainment, magic easily {{moved from}} {{theatrical}} venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included Okito, David Devant, Harry Blackstone Sr., Harry Blackstone Jr., Howard Thurston, Theodore Annemann, Cardini, Joseph Dunninger, Dai Vernon, Fred Culpitt, Tommy Wonder, Siegfried & Roy, and Doug Henning. Popular 20th and 21st century magicians include David Copperfield, Lance Burton, James Randi, Penn and Teller, David Blaine, Criss Angel, Hans Klok and Derren Brown. Well-known women magicians include Dell O'Dell and Dorothy Dietrich. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> the illusions are not obtained with post-production visual effects.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the strong}} {{association}} between awake bruxism and psychosocial factors (the relationship between sleep bruxism and psychosocial factors being unclear), {{the role of}} psychosocial interventions could be argued to be central to the management. The most simple form of treatment is therefore <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> the condition does not represent a serious disease, which may act to alleviate contributing stress. Other interventions include relaxation techniques, stress management, behavioural modification, habit reversal and hypnosis (self hypnosis or with a hypnotherapist). Cognitive behavioral therapy has been recommended by some for treatment of bruxism. In many cases awake bruxism can be reduced by using reminder techniques. Combined with a protocol sheet this can also help to evaluate in which situations bruxism is most prevalent.|$|E
50|$|The Cape {{finally agreed}} to {{incorporate}} the territory four years later in 1877, following agreement by the British government on compensation to the Orange Free State for its competing land claims. The Cape Prime Minister John Molteno still had serious doubts about annexing the heavily indebted region, but, after striking {{a deal with the}} Home Government and receiving <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> the local population would be consulted in the process, he passed the Griqualand West Annexation Act on 27 July 1877.|$|R
50|$|In July 2006, with soaring cement prices {{due to lack}} of supply, Tapgun {{was head}} of an inter-ministerial {{committee}} to assess the investors in the industry.Fidelis Tapgun visited the site of a closed cement factory in Ebonyi State, stalled due to a dispute between the state government and company management. Despite <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> the plant would soon reopen, it was still closed as of November 2009.In January 2007 Tapgun became a Minister of State in the newly combined Ministry of Commerce and Industry.|$|R
5000|$|Lawrence {{was known}} as a {{theological}} conservative in the Episcopal Church. He was consecrated as the diocesan bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina on January 26, 2008, after a second election. He had first been elected in 2006, but did not gain approval to take office because of concern that he might try to lead a schism in the Diocese of South Carolina. His second election was approved following his <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> he would keep the diocese within the Episcopal Church.|$|R
25|$|He missed {{most of the}} 2007–08 season due to a {{ruptured}} left Achilles' tendon. However, Brand {{made his}} return to the Clippers' lineup April 2, 2008 after being out {{since the end of the}} previous season. He contributed 19 points in his return. Brand played in only eight games that season. Brand later opted out of the final year of his contract and became a free agent. Sources indicated that Brand chose to opt out from his contract in order to provide Clippers with more payroll flexibility in hopes of strengthening their roster. This came to fruition when Clippers landed Golden State Warriors star Baron Davis. Briefly, this gave Clippers' management and the media the <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> Brand would indeed re-sign with the team.|$|E
25|$|The secret {{protocols}} caused Hitler {{to be in}} the humiliating {{position of}} having to hurriedly evacuate ethnic German families, the Volksdeutsche, who had lived in Finland and the Baltic countries for centuries, while officially condoning the invasions. While the three Baltic countries, not knowing about the secret protocols, sent letters protesting the Soviet invasions to Berlin, Ribbentrop returned them. In August, Molotov told the Germans that, with the government change, they could close down their Baltic consulates by September 1. The Soviet annexations in Romania caused further strain. While Germany had given the Soviets Bessarabia in the secret protocols, it had not given them Bukovina. Germany wanted the 100,000 tons of grain for which they had previously contracted with Bessarabia, guarantees of German property safety, guarantees for 125,000 Volksdeutsche in Bessarabia and Bukovina, and <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> the train tracks carrying Romanian oil would be left alone.|$|E
500|$|The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies {{chose the}} inaugural theme, [...] "ANew Birth of Freedom", {{a phrase from}} Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address from the Civil War era. The theme, which was {{selected}} by the committee to mark the inaugural occasion and honor the 200thanniversary year of Lincoln's birth, expressed [...] "Lincoln's hope that the sacrifice {{of those who died}} to preserve the United States would lead to 'a new birth of freedom' for the nation.'" [...] In his reliance on the inaugural theme, Obama wanted [...] "to give Americans <b>reassurance</b> <b>that</b> today, as in Lincoln's time, the country would find its way through any crisis".|$|E
500|$|In 1940, Joseph Stalin {{proposed}} that Speer {{pay a visit}} to Moscow. Stalin had been particularly impressed by Speer's work in Paris, and wished to meet the [...] "Architect of the Reich". Hitler, alternating between amusement and anger, did not allow Speer to go, fearing that Stalin would put Speer in a [...] "rat hole" [...] until a new Moscow arose. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Speer came to doubt, despite Hitler's <b>reassurances,</b> <b>that</b> his projects for Berlin would ever be completed.|$|R
50|$|Blur {{played a}} {{surprise}} {{show at the}} O2 Academy in 2009, their first appearance in Newcastle for twelve years. Katy Perry performed at the venue on her Hello Katy Tour in August 2009, and Adele made a much-hyped appearance in 2011. The popular alternative night Alpha moved to the O2 Academy in February 2014. The freehold of the venue was put up for sale by Newcastle City Council in 2015 for £625,000, with <b>reassurances</b> <b>that</b> {{the operations of the}} venue would not be affected.|$|R
