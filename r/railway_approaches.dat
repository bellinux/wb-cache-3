25|$|The High Level {{station is}} {{the larger of}} the two levels, and is the {{terminus}} for the Edinburgh shuttles and all routes north of the Central Belt run by Abellio ScotRail diesel multiple units. The high level <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> the station building through the Queen Street Tunnel, which runs beneath the Buchanan Galleries shopping centre to the Sighthill area northeast of the city centre. Platforms 1–7 occupy the High Level, Platform 1 being at the western end of the trainshed, and being considerably shorter – it is usually only used for local stopping services.|$|E
25|$|Only one railway now {{crosses the}} ranges: the major Adelaide-Melbourne line, which was first {{constructed}} in the 1870s and has had only minor realignments since (the most significant {{of which was the}} boring of a new tunnel at Sleeps Hill). Passenger services used to run from the city to Bridgewater {{in the heart of the}} hills and ranges, but now stop at Belair in the foothills. A <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> the ranges at Willunga (although it was discontinued in the 1960s and has since been replaced by a cycling trail). The Mount Barker to Victor Harbor line (now used only for recreational purposes) largely skirts the eastern edge of the ranges. North of Adelaide, there is a railway to Angaston in the east of the Barossa Valley, and former railways to Truro and across the ranges near Eudunda to Morgan on the Murray River.|$|E

50|$|The <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> too, {{including}} the tunnel, had experienced difficulty, {{and due to}} very slow progress the work was taken from Vickers and Cooke and allocated to Gareth Griffiths of Lydney in 1878.|$|E
50|$|The <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> from Newton Abbot in the {{north-east}} runs south-westerly {{through the}} station and then swings to the west on a right-hand curve, which {{is the start of}} the steep climb up to Rattery. There are four tracks through the station with platforms alongside the outer pair.|$|E
25|$|The station {{entrance}} {{was originally}} at Three Castles House {{on the corner}} of London Bridge Street and <b>Railway</b> <b>Approach,</b> but has since been moved to Borough High Street and Tooley Street. The original entrance remained standing until March 2013 when it was demolished.|$|R
50|$|Originally Twickenham {{station was}} {{situated}} {{on the western side}} of the A310 London Road bridge before the new station was opened on the eastern side. This accounts for roads named <b>Railway</b> <b>Approach</b> and Station Road, which now give no access to the station.|$|R
5000|$|The Hamburg freight rail bypass (Güterumgehungsbahn) is {{a railway}} {{line in the}} German city of Hamburg. It runs from Hamburg-Eidelstedt via Hamburg-Rothenburgsort to Hamburg-Harburg and connects the long-distance <b>railways</b> <b>approaching</b> Hamburg, {{bypassing}} the link line and the railway junctions on the approaches to Hamburg-Altona station and Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. The line is mainly used for rail freight.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{connects the}} Carrer de Bac de Roda, {{to the south}} in Sant Martí, with the Carrer de Felip II, to the north in Sant Andreu, across the main <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> to Barcelona from the north. The Bac de Roda station, on line 2 of the Barcelona Metro, is some 100 m {{to the south of}} the bridge.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} the tunnel was finished, having taken four years to build and a further three to {{complete}} the <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> to it, the project had crippled the finances of the Carmarthen to Cardigan Railway, which soon went into receivership. After the railway was closed to freight traffic on 28 September 1973, the track was removed. The tunnel was not demolished and remains in place.|$|E
50|$|The Qinghai-Tibet <b>Railway</b> <b>approaches</b> Lhasa {{from the}} northwest. It descends from the Amdo grasslands to Nagchu and Damshung, and then follows the Toelung River from Yangpachen through Toelung Dechen county into west Lhasa. A new railway bridge was {{built over the}} Lhasa river to link the station in Liuwu {{township}} {{on the south side}} of the river to central Lhasa on the north side.|$|E

5|$|The station, its {{surrounding}} {{streets and the}} <b>railway</b> <b>approach</b> feature prominently in the 1955 Ealing comedy film The Ladykillers. In the story, a gang robs a security van near the station after planning in a house overlooking the railway. When they fall out, members of the gang are dropped into passing goods wagons from the parapet of the Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{the name}} Somers Town {{was used for}} the larger {{triangular}} area between the Pancras, Hampstead, and Euston Roads, but it is now taken to mean the rough rectangle bounded by Pancras Road, Euston Road, Eversholt Street, Crowndale Road, and the <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> to St Pancras Station; that is to say, the area about 200 metres east and west of Chalton Street. Somers Town is within the parish and district of St Pancras.|$|E

50|$|The through station, {{which is}} {{oriented}} in the southwest-northeast direction, is the terminus of three routes. The Děčín-Dresden-Neustadt <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> the station {{from the other}} side of the Elbe (chainage: 66.333 km) over the Marienbrücke. The Görlitz-Dresden (102.102 km) and Leipzig-Dresden (115.936 km) railways approach from the northeast. The direct line of the tracks forms the connection from the Marienbrücke towards Görlitz. The line from Leipzig connects through a curve from the northwest around 650 metres to the northeast of the station in Bischofsplatz. This connection is the only grade-separated junction in the station area.|$|E

50|$|Cobb was {{an astute}} {{business}} and marketing man. He advertised his store {{as having the}} latest fashions from Paris and London. Over the next 30 years he purchased shops {{either side of his}} own, expanding the business into each unit with new departments. The business by 1898 occupied 297-301 Kirdale, 270-272 Kirkdale, a furniture depository in Silverdale and an estate agents and funeral parlour at 1-3 <b>Railway</b> <b>Approach.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Fitzmaurice {{was born}} at Clogher, Tralee, County Kerry, Ireland in 1861. He {{received}} an education at The Royal School, Armagh prior to studying civil engineering at Trinity College, Dublin from 1878. [...] He graduated in 1882 and was articled (a form of apprenticeship) to Benjamin Baker where his first project was {{the construction of the}} south pier and <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> to the Forth Railway Bridge. This work finished in 1888 and he spent the next three years working on the aborted construction of the Chignecto Ship Railway in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Between Virginia Water and Chertsey, {{the line}} crosses the M25 {{motorway}} {{by means of}} a cable-stayed bridge. The bridge is of note because it is one of few such bridges to carry a heavy railway required here as the <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> the motorway at an angle of 28 degrees. The bridge consists of two concrete towers set into the central reservation of the motorway. The concrete edge beams are suspended from the towers, and each is supported by a pair of cables linked to the towers. The edge beams support a concrete deck slab on which the tracks run. The bridge is 120 yards (110 metres) long and 72 feet (22 metres) high, and was completed in 1979.|$|E

50|$|The Berwick Inn on {{the corner}} of High Street and Lyall Road, was {{licensed}} at Berwick in 1857 as the Border Hotel. The original one-storey section is now the bar. The two-storey section was added in 1877 as the <b>railway</b> <b>approached.</b> The western section was built later in the century. The first licensee was Robert Bain who owned the town's first store and post office and donated the land on which the shire hall was later built.|$|R
50|$|The Inverness station {{had been}} built as a {{terminus}} for trains arriving from the east, and the frontage faced directly on to Academy Street, {{making it impossible to}} convert the station to a through configuration. The Inverness and Ross-shire <b>Railway</b> <b>approached</b> from the west, and curved in to the alignment of the existing station on the immediate approach. The third side of the triangle (later to become known as the Rose Street Curve) was formed by adaptation of the existing Harbour Branch.|$|R
60|$|The advance soon began; it was {{composed}} of six companies of the 60th Rifles, four companies of the 38th, and four of the 46th. These were to march by the canal, while seven companies of the marines moved along the railway embankment in company with the iron-clad train. The two parties were to join {{at the point where}} the canal and the <b>railway</b> <b>approach</b> closely to each other. The ground between the two embankments consisted of fields and marshy swamps.|$|R
50|$|The line {{leaves the}} Keilbahnhof ("wedge station") of Döbeln in a southeastern {{direction}} and crosses the southern urban area, while the Riesa line branches {{off to the}} northeast. Federal highway 175 is crossed at the station exit. The line crosses the narrowing valley of the Freiberger Mulde several times after Döbeln Zentrum station. After Niederstriegis, the dismantled line of the former Roßwein-Niederwiesa <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> and follows the Borsdorf-Coswig railway for about two kilometres to Roßwein station. After crossing and recrossing the Freiberger Mulde, the connecting line from the Rhäsa tank farm approaches {{from the north and}} the two lines runs parallel past the Altzella Abbey (Kloster Altzella) and meet the Zellwald railway, which comes from the south, pass under the B 175 and enter Nossen station. The line crosses federal highway 101 at a level crossing and passes along a sloping section and reaches the Meissen highland in the Waldhufendorf ("forest village") of Eula. From Deutschebora, the highest point, the line turns north-east, crosses the A 14 and turns into the landscape protection area of the valley of the Triebisch. From here, it follows the river through the Garsebacher Schweiz ("Garsebach Switzerland") over a length of about 10 kilometres, past the Götterfelsen ("God's rocks"), which rise 60 metres above the valley, to Meißen-Triebischtal station, where the wiring for the Dresden S-Bahn begins. After crossing the Elbe together with federal highway 6 and passing through Meissen station, the now two-track line turns south-east, rules through a sparsely-built flatland and rejoins the Leipzig-Dresden railway between Weinböhla and Coswig.|$|E
50|$|At the {{southern}} exit of Dessau Hauptbahnhof, {{the line to}} Köthen branches off {{to the west and}} about three kilometres later the line reaches Dessau repair shop (Ausbesserungswerk). Between Dessau-Haideburg and Marke the line runs through a wooded area, and approximately half-way through it, national highway 9 passes under the line. The line follows the cultivated part of the Mulden valley until Raguhn, but the industrial area around Bitterfeld-Wolfen begins in Jeßnitz. In Bitterfeld the line from Stumsdorf, which is used only for freight traffic, runs from the west while the Berlin-Halle railway runs from the north through the Mulde valley. The latter line runs parallel for about two kilometres from Bitterfeld station until the vicinity of Holzweißig, where it crosses over using a flying junction and runs away to the southeast towards Halle. Near Petersroda the line passes Ludwigsee and the Neuhäuser See (lakes) at a distance and it then crosses the border with Saxony. After crossing the Lober, the line again returns to its original route and soon reaches Delitzsch with its repair shop and Delitzsch unterer (lower) station. South of Delitzsch the line run almost straight to the outskirts of Leipzig and passes under federal highway 184 and autobahn 14. Near the Leipzig Trade Fair (Messe), the Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle high-speed <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> from the west. After Leipzig Messe station, the old line from Halle approaches from the same direction, together with the freight ring. The latter turns to the east at Eutritzsch towards Engelsdorf, while the line from Eilenburg comes from the same direction. After a slight change of direction to the southwest, the line reaches Leipzig Hauptbahnhof near to the centre of its many tracks.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The NZ {{railway track}} and {{structures}} infrastructure is {{managed by the}} New Zealand Railways Corporation (trading as ONTRACK). The civil asset consists of 4, 161 km of mainline track, 6. 45 million sleepers, 1582 rail bridges, 149 tunnels with a cumulative length of 87 km, and 12, 900 culverts. There {{are a number of}} infrastructure challenges faced by ONTRACK due to the asset age and condition combined with changing expectations of the level of service required of the asset and increasing demand. These challenges are significantly influencing the short to medium term asset management strategies currently being devised. A selection of brief case studies on the rail sector will be presented in the paper, demonstrating how lessons can be reinforced or learned by the wider transportation profession. Case studies will be selected from the following areas: <b>railway</b> <b>approaches</b> to risk management; deterioration modelling of treated pinus radiata sleepers; culvert risk analysis; strength rating of timber bridges and innovative design solutions to replace large numbers of timber bridges. The case studies will use a mixture of empirical physical examples and also present the results of engineering analysis and modelling...|$|E

2500|$|The railway {{opened on}} 3 March 1845, {{and it had}} the track gauge of [...] The canal at Cuilhill Gullet was on an {{embankment}} above the local ground level, and the <b>railway</b> <b>approached</b> on a viaduct and crossed to {{the north side of}} the canal. The main line of the canal was diverted to the north of the wharf, forming an island. By 1849 the railway was sending 90 boatloads of coal a year to Glasgow. In 1849 an extension to pits at Tannochside opened.|$|R
25|$|The {{trackbed}} to {{the east}} of Station Road in East Grinstead to the Lewes Road tunnel was taken over by the A22 road as a relief road, with the two tunnels being opened out. The station's goods yard area was also eaten up by the A22 which carved a path running parallel with <b>Railway</b> <b>Approach.</b> This required the removal of the locomotive shed which was demolished in 1976 despite the efforts of the East Grinstead Society which had attempted to raise funds for its preservation as a drama and arts workshop.|$|R
