40|$|In larger {{developments}} {{there is}} potential for construction cranes to encroach into the airspace of neighbouring properties. To resolve issues of this nature, a statutory <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> may be sought under s 180 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld). Section 180 allows {{the court to}} impose a statutory <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> on servient land where it is reasonably necessary {{in the interests of}} effective use in any reasonable manner of the dominant land. Such an order will not be made unless the court is satisfied that it is consistent with public interest, the owner of the servient land can be adequately recompensed for any loss or disadvantage which may be suffered from the imposition and the owner of the servient land has refused unreasonably to agree to accept the imposition of that obligation. In applying the statutory provision, a key practical concern for legal advisers will be the basis for assessment of compensation. A recent decision of the Queensland Supreme Court (Douglas J) provides guidance concerning matters relevant to this assessment. The decision is Lang Parade Pty Ltd v Peluso [2005] QSC 112...|$|E
40|$|Section 180 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) makes {{provision}} for an applicant {{to seek a}} statutory <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> over a neighbour’s property where such right of use is reasonably necessary {{in the interests of}} effective use in any reasonable manner of the dominant land. A key issue in an application under s 180 is compensation. Unfortunately, while s 180 expressly contemplates that an order for compensation will include {{provision for}} payment of compensation to the owner of servient land there are certain issues that are less clear. One of these is the basis for determination of the amount of compensation. In this regard, s 180 (4) (a) provides that, in making an order for a statutory <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>user,</b> the court: (a) shall, except in special circumstances, include provision for payment by the applicant to such 	person or persons as may be specified in the order of such amount by way of compensation or 	consideration as in the circumstances appears to the court to be just The operation of this statutory provision was considered by de Jersey CJ (as he then was) in Peulen v Agius [2015] QSC 137...|$|E

The thesis also outlines the history of the legal regulation of usufructs from the 19 th century as it {{is an integral part of}} the issue in question. The thesis briefly introduces other forms of usufructs, such as loan, personal <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> and last, but not least, the right to manage national property.

The next chapter deals with the problematic of divided co-ownership and the common assets of married couples. The last two chapters are devoted to restriction of ownership rights to property and expropriation of property. In the first of the two previously mentioned chapters I focus on the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> (from their origin to their extinction). Second chapter listed is about particular phases of expropriation of the property including the expropriation procedure. In the practical part of this thesis I did an analysis of recording the ownership right into the Real Estate Cadastre of the Czech Republic...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a number of}} emerging technologies and how they challenge the underpinnings of copyright law in Australia. It draws upon the idea that copyright law must ‘balance’ the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> stakeholders (creators of works, inventors <b>of</b> technology and <b>users</b> <b>of</b> works) {{in order to provide}} the most effective environment for the protection and use of works. This paper further suggests that existing copyright legislation can be divided into provisions that offer <b>rights</b> to creators <b>of</b> works (‘front end’ provisions), and other provisions that restrict the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and inventors <b>of</b> technology (the ‘back end’ provisions). It analyses the use of ‘media neutral’ language in copyright legislation in both the front and back end provisions and argues that the creators of works have far broader rights and protections than those offered in the back end to users and inventors. Further, through an analysis of emerging technologies it is argued that this imbalance offers an environment that restricts the uptake of new technologies and fails to properly foster the protection <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> <b>of</b> these new works and technologies...|$|R

Background: Quality of {{care and}} respect for the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> are {{critical}} to achieve positive health outcomes and respond appropriately to the expectations of people, particularly if they have mental illnesses. Aim: To carry out a baseline diagnosis of quality {{of care and}} respect for rights in public outpatient psychiatric services. Material and Methods: Quality of care and respect for patients’ rights was assessed by a mental health professional and a trained psychiatric service user in 15 ambulatory psychiatric services. The WHO QualityRights instrument was used, reviewing documentation and making observations in each facility, as well as interviewing 146 patients, 148 health care workers and 64 relatives of patients. Results: A high level of achievement was accomplished in terms of discrimination-free health care, availability of psychotropic medications, lack of abuse or neglect and use of informed consents. A low level of achievement was found in terms <b>of</b> <b>user</b> support to cope with community living, access to education or work and participation in community activities, respect for user treatment preferences and preventive measures to avoid maltreatment and cruelty. Conclusions: Chile could improve the performance of psychiatry services having laws based on the “Convention <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Persons with Disabilities” and standards of the World Health Organization, having national policies about quality <b>of</b> care and <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>users,</b> reinforcing the community work of mental health care teams, reinforcing and informing users about their rights and promoting research on interventions to improve the respect <b>of</b> their <b>rights.</b> [URL]...|$|R
