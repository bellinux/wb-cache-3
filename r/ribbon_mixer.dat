50|$|There are {{two main}} types of close-clearance mixers: anchors and helical <b>ribbons.</b> Anchor <b>mixers</b> induce solid-body {{rotation}} and do not promote vertical mixing, but helical ribbons do. Close clearance mixers {{are used in the}} laminar regime, because the viscosity of the fluid overwhelms the inertial forces of the flow and prevents the fluid leaving the impeller from entraining the fluid next to it.

40|$|Particle mixing is an {{essential}} unit operation {{in the manufacture of}} many granular products, for example, in pharmaceutical, food and chemical engineering industries. A cylindrical mixer, <b>ribbon</b> <b>mixer</b> and rotating drum were investigated for the predictability of the mixture quality using the discrete element method. The mixture quality is known to be affected by variables such as particle properties, operational parameters and geometrical parameters. The particle (or mixture) properties considered are: particle size, particle density, volume fraction and cohesion, of which the predictability is sought only in relation to the first three variables. The effects of these three variables on the mixing behaviour of binary particles can be predicted for all three mixers with the rotating drum being operated in the rolling mode. The prediction equations for the mixers have a similar form but different in the coefficients. Further, the size and density interactions were interpreted using the mechanism of the driving-force generation due to size differences and its completion with the particle weight {{in the case of a}} cylindrical mixer. The effect of cohesion on particle mixing was investigated in micro and macro <b>ribbon</b> <b>mixer</b> systems by creating geometrically and dynamically similar conditions by matching Froude and Bond numbers. A similarity was observed between the two systems in each of the results for mixing index, particle velocity and particle contact forces in the case of non-cohesive mixtures. The quality of the cohesive and non-cohesive mixtures each improved with an increase in the shaft speed up to 100 rpm after which it deteriorated. A four-bladed ribbon impeller was found to be more effective for mixing cohesive particles and use at a higher fill level. A parametric study on the effects of impeller geometry showed that the blade pitch, width and clearance significantly affect the particle flow pattern, mixing rate and homogeneity of cohesive particle mixtures. In the case of a four-bladed impeller, the outer blade angle affects the mixing behaviour, but the inner blade angle has no significant effect. Overall, the present work has used the discrete element method successfully in the study of particle mixing behaviours in three mixers...|$|E

Only when the mixed materials showed no segregation {{it was possible}} to analyse the mixing process quantitatively. In this case the mixture could be described by the 'χ' Square test. Longitudinal mixing could be studied by estimating the spread in residence times. In two common types of mixers the mixing was studied of two kinds of granular materials, differing only in colour of granules. (Colour had no influence on mixing.) In a continuously operating semi-technical 'Spaans' screw and <b>ribbon</b> <b>mixer</b> the mixing proceeded rapidly but irregularly. The minimal mixer length necessary for apparent completion of mixing decreased at higher speeds of rotation. The performance of a more widely pitched. screw and ribbon element was slightly better. The spread in residence times was appreciable. Longitudinal mixing was slightly more intensive at higher speeds of rotation, wider screw and ribbon pitches and greater mixer lengths. In a mixer consisting of a simple, rotating, slightly inclined, partially filled, hollow cylinder mixing proceeded more gradually. Mixing was 'diffusive'. The mixing rate increased with increased rotational speed, increased wall roughness and decreasing feed rate. Longitudinal mixing proved to be very limited...|$|E

40|$|Experiments of bulk solid mixing in a twin ribbon blade blender {{have been}} {{performed}} in this work in order to characterize mixing behavior in such a mixer for binary mixtures with different cohesionless materials. The effects of fill height and blade rotation speed on mixing homogeneity have been studied. Mixing homogeneity was determined by sampling. It has been observed that mixing is relatively fast towards a final mixing state within approximately 100 blade rotations for different combinations of material, fill height and blade rotational speed. Moreover, these final mixing states seemed stable within a range of fluctuations, which may prove useful in determining an optimal mixing time for binary, cohesionless particle mixtures and potentially lead {{to a reduction in}} the required number of blade rotations in mixers of this type in industry. Mixing homogeneity results indicated an increased final mixing homogeneity for increasing fill height, most clearly in the range of 30 – 70 vol. % in the studied twin <b>ribbon</b> blade <b>mixer.</b> The torque on one of the shafts was determined. The latter results showed that no significant influence of rotational speed on the required torque for the tested mixtures at rotational velocities in the range of Fr 0. 17 – 1. 1 could be determined for most combinations of the tested materials and fill heights in this work.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. A method has been developed by which the process engineer {{will be able to}} design continuous mixing systems and to explore mixing strategies, thus enabling him {{to take advantage of the}} benefits of the continuous mixing of particulate solids. The method is based on the prediction of the degree of smoothing out of periodic fluctuations in composition from a knowledge of the residence time distribution of the mixer and the nature of the fluctuations. Experimental verification of the method has been carried out in a <b>ribbon</b> blade continuous <b>mixer</b> using both free flowing sand and cohesive chalk. The residence time distributions were measured by adding an impulse of coloured tracer and measuring the outgoing composition, continuously, by a reflectivity device. Models involving a proportion of piston flow and of simple (or perfect) mixers in series were found to fit the experimental distributions. Periodic fluctuations were approximated by a Fourier Series and the amplitude reduction of rectangular periodic impulses were computed and compared with the measured amplitude reduction. With few exceptions the agreement was satisfactory for engineering purposes. It is claimed that the method can be used for designing continuous mixing systems and it is shown how a minor ingredient can be added in periodic impulses rather than a continuous stream to produce a satisfactory mixture...|$|R

Considering the medium used in the process, i. e. 12 % (v/v) suspension of hematite particles in 50 % sodium hydroxide aqueous, the sedimentation velocity of hematite particle at 110 degrees C is 0. 010 mm/s, which is very slow because the average size of the solid particles is around 10 mu m and the significant collisions and inter-actions occuring between the particles in the concentrated suspension.

Operational parameters studied were rotational speed and mixing time. The feed preparations studied were the use of preblending and the particle size of the feed materials. The blends of ascorbic acid, zinc oxide, and lactose were prepared with preblending and without preblending, prior to mixing at different blender rotation speeds and mixing times. Chemical tests were performed to measure the homogeneity of the ascorbic acid in the model mixture. Results: With preblending, a mixture with lactose 200 M achieved the required homogeneity in a shorter period of time at a lower rotational speed. Conclusion: The results indicated that the homogeneity of the mixtures was influenced by the blender rotation speed and mixing time. Better mixing can be obtained with higher rotation speeds and longer mixing time. It was also observed that preblending and smaller feed particle size achieved the required homogeneity in a shorter period of time at a lower rotational speed. These results illustrate that using binders with a smaller particle size and a preblending technique improves the mixing process in a convective batch ribbon powder mixer. However, prolonged periods of high-speed mixing will lead to mixture segregation. Keywords: powder blending, ascorbic acid, rotational speed, particle size, preblendin...|$|E
40|$|Swine Industry Day, 2014 {{is known}} as Swine Day, 2014 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine how the time required to create a uniformly mixed batch of feed is influenced by diets that differ in bulk density. Three 60 -lb batches of a corn-soybean meal–based diet (high bulk density) or a high-fiber diet (low bulk density) containing 30 % dried distiller’s grains with solubles (DDGS), and 19 % wheat midds were prepared. The ingredients for each batch were placed in a 60 -lb capacity experimental double-ribbon mixer with all batches containing 0. 35 % table salt. Ten samples were obtained from different parts of the mixer for each batch of feed after 60, 120, and 240 sec of mixing time. Ten additional samples were taken as the feed was discharged from the bottom of the mixer after 240 sec. The three batches of each diet type were mixed and sampled using the same procedures and were considered separate observations, making 3 replications for each mixing time within diet type. The CV among 10 samples collected at each mix time was used to determine mixer efficiency by measuring Cl concentration (Quantabs, Environmental Test Systems, Elkhart, IN). After 60 sec of mixing, the corn-soybean meal–based diet achieved a CV of less than 10 %; however, the high-fiber diet required 240 sec to achieve a CV of less than 10 %. In conclusion, using this experimental <b>ribbon</b> <b>mixer,</b> diet bulk density affected the time required to mix a batch of feed thoroughly, which suggests that feed manufacturers should reevaluate mixing times when using low-bulk-density ingredients such as DDGS and wheat midds. Further research is needed to verify these results in large-scale commercial mixers...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: High {{perinatal}} calf mortality {{associated with}} gestational vitamin A deficiency {{has been reported}} during extended dry seasons in the Mitchell grass rangelands (Hill et al. 2009). Adding vitamin A to supplements may aid prevention however it is inherently sensitive to degradation. Stability depends upon the manufacturing conditions (heat, moisture and pH), oxidising potential of ingredients and storage conditions (Shurson et al. 2011). The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the stability of Vitamin A when included in dry season supplements manufactured using different methods. Methods: Three commercially available dry season supplements were manufactured using contrasting manufacturing methodologies; loose lick (LL), molten blocks (MB) and cold pour blocks (CB). All supplements were blended in a horizontal <b>ribbon</b> <b>mixer.</b> The LL supplements were decanted directly into 25 kg bags. The MB mixture was transferred to a heat jacketed mixing vessel, and then poured into cardboard cartons at 90 °C prior to hardening. Manufacturing of CB used a patented manufacturing method (IP No. 725349) under ambient temperature. The major ingredients in LL and MB were salt (275 - 300 g/kg as fed) and urea (250 - 300 g/kg). Composition of CB included 200 g/kg molasses, 150 g/kg urea and 100 g/kg salt. Rovimix® A 1000 (DSM) was included in each supplement to deliver 40 000 iu vitamin A/day. Expected concentrations were 240, 335, 270 iu Vitamin A/g for LL, MB and CB respectively. Samples were collected at day 0, 90 and 180 to determine Vitamin A status. Results and Discussion: Vitamin A degradation was both immediate and extensive for LL and MB relative to target concentrations (see Table 1). The levels decreased between manufacturing and day 90 for LL and MB (P< 0. 05), approaching the limit of detection by 180 days. Vitamin A concentrations of CB remained stable for the duration of the trial. The use of a CB manufacturing process is likely to have greater efficacy than either LL or MB when attempting to deliver vitamin A via dry season supplements...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of using salt with different particle sizes and of using different samplepreparation methods on mixer-efficiency testing (time required to achieve a coefficient of variation (CV) of 10 % or less among 10 feed samples). A 3000 -lb capacity horizontal <b>ribbon</b> <b>mixer</b> was used to mix batches of feed. Ten samples were collected at eight times during mixing (0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 5, 5. 5, 8. 0, and 10. 5 min) after all ingredients were added from pre-determined locations in the mixer. Coefficient of variation {{was used to measure}} mixer efficiency by analysis for chloride concentration in each sample with Quantab® chloride titrators. In Exp. 1, four 3000 -lb batches of feed were prepared, two with 440 - micron salt and two with 730 -micron salt. Samples were analyzed as collected (unground; approximately 700 microns) or were ground with a coffee grinder (ground; approximately 400 microns). A salt particle size × sample preparation × mixing time interaction (P< 0. 001) was observed, but a CV of 10 % or less was never achieved, indicating inadequate mixing. In Exp. 2, all samples were collected from 2000 -lb batches of feed made in the 3000 -lb-capacity mixer. Four different salt particle sizes (440, 730, 1999, and 3000 micron) were used, and each set of samples collected was also analyzed as unground or ground. A salt particle size × sample preparation × mixing time interaction (P< 0. 04) was observed. As salt particle size decreased and mixing time increased, there was a decrease in CV. Grinding samples before analysis decreased CV, compared with that of the unground samples, but to a greater extent with coarse salt than with fine salt. The batch mixed with 440 -micron salt and the batch mixed with 730 -micron salt (ground) reached a CV of less than 10 %, indicating a uniform mixture. No other treatments reached a CV of 10 % or less. When the mixer was filled to the rated capacity we were unable to achieve an acceptable CV for mixer efficiency; therefore, it is important to test mixers at various fill levels.

40|$|Swine research, 2005 {{is known}} as Swine day, 2005 Although the {{importance}} of thoroughly mixing diets is often emphasized, little data is available to quantify the impact of inadequate mixing on pig growth performance. Therefore, a 28 -d trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of mixing time on growth performance of nursery pigs. A total of 180 weanling pigs (13. 9 ± 1. 8 lb BW, 21 ± 3 d of age) were used, with 6 pigs per pen and 6 pens per treatment. Experimental treatments consisted of mixing a diet for 0, 30, 60, 120 or 330 s in a horizontal <b>ribbon</b> <b>mixer.</b> Diets were fed in two phases (d 0 to 14 and 14 to 28), with diets in both phases containing relatively large amounts of lowinclusion ingredients such as synthetic amino acids, zinc oxide, and phytase. Diets in Phase 1 also contained 3. 75 % fish meal and 15 % dried whey. Eight samples were collected from the mixer {{at the completion of}} the mixing time for each batch of feed to determine a coefficient of variation (CV). Each bag (50. 0 lb) was labeled (first to last) and sampled to determine the degree of mixing that occurred as feed was conveyed from the mixer to the bagger. Each pen of pigs was then assigned a bag of feed. Bags were distributed in the order bagged (1, 2, 3, etc.). As feed was needed, the next chronological bag of feed was then added. Mixer CV values were 178, 38, 26, 21, and 5 % for Phase 1 and 172, 79, 60, 48, and 26 % for Phase 2 as mixing time increased. Bag CV values were 26, 20, 16, 11, and 7 % for Phase 1 and 56, 45, 40, 33, and 12 % for Phase 2 as mixing time increased, indicating the degree of mixing that takes place as feed is conveyed from the mixer to the bagger. Growth performance was improved as mixing time increased (linear, P< 0. 01) in both phases. From d 0 to 28, increasing mix time increased (linear, P< 0. 01) ADG (0. 73, 0. 89, 0. 90, 0. 94, and 1. 02 for 0, 30, 60, 120, and 330 s, respectively). Increasing mixing time also improved F/G (linear, P< 0. 01; quadratic, P< 0. 07; 1. 55, 1. 40, 1. 32, 1. 33, 1. 30 for 0, 30, 60, 120, and 330 s, respectively). With greater use of lowinclusion ingredients such as synthetic amino acids in swine diets, these data demonstrate that inadequate mixing reduces nursery pig performance...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryCharles R StarkThe {{uniformity}} of a feed mixture is determined from {{the coefficient of}} variation (CV) of ten samples in a single batch of feed. The feed industry standard is a %CV of less than 10 using a single source tracer such as salt, trace minerals or iron filings. The {{uniformity of}} mix can be affected by many factors including ingredient properties, equipment design, mix time, sampling method, sample preparation and overall precision of method. The objectives of this thesis were to verify the chloride ion test by the Quantab® chloride titrator method and {{to determine the effect}} of extended mixing time, salt particle size, sample preparation, wet mix time, spray condition, application time of the liquid addition, percent liquid addition and mixer type on the uniformity of mix. The first experiment evaluated the effect of water temperature, technician, extraction time, dissolution time on the chloride ion test by the Quantab® chloride titrator method. The salt concentration was significantly affected by water temperature and dissolution time. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated the 60 ºC water temperature and the 30 s extraction time by stirring followed by immediately placing the strip into the solution after extraction should be used for the Quantab® chloride titrator method. The second experiment evaluated the effect of extended mix time, particle size of salt and sample preparation on the %CV. The extended mix time did not result in segregation (P > 0. 30). However, particle size of the salt and sample preparation significantly affected the uniformity of mix. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that the extended mix time of up to 60 minutes did not increase the %CV of the feed; the particle size of the salt used in the uniformity of mix test can significantly change the results of the test; and grinding the sample prior to analysis improved the precision of the Quantab® chloride titrator method when coarse salt is used in the manufacturing process. The third experiment evaluated the effect of wet mix time and the timing of the liquid addition using different spray conditions on the %CV. The wet mix time significantly changed the %CV of the mixture (P = 0. 0057). The use of a spray nozzle had no effect on the %CV of the feed mixture when a 1. 14 % of a 23 % saline solution was sprayed on to the feed (P = 0. 7435). The results of Experiment 3 indicated the wet mix time had a greater influence on the uniformity of mix than the type of nozzle used to apply the liquid; and the shorter liquid application time allowed more time for the mechanical shear of the ribbons and paddles to break up the agglomerated wet particles and distribute them throughout the feed mixture when the total time of the liquid addition plus wet mix time was fixed. The fourth experiment evaluated the effect of different percent liquid addition, application time and mixer type with different wet mix times on the uniformity of mix. The %CV of feed mixed using a fixed wet mix time setting did not change when the percent liquid addition was increased, while the %CV of the feed mixed using a fixed total liquid mix time setting increased when increasing the percent liquid addition. The %CV of feed mixed with a <b>ribbon</b> <b>mixer</b> did not change when the liquid application time was decreased while the %CV of the feed mixed with a paddle mixer increased when decreasing the liquid application time. Differences were observed in the %CV based on the parameters of liquid cycle time, mixer type and mixer size. The results of Experiment 4 indicated the liquid addition time and the percent of liquid addition affected the uniformity of mix. The uniformity of liquid application should be tested with the highest percent liquid addition. Furthermore, application and wet mix times should be determined for each mixer type and size to establish the optimal batch cycle...|$|E
