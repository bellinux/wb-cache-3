25|$|Fiscal {{efficiency}} is separate from economic efficiency. Economic analysis of recycling {{does not include}} what economists call externalities, which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions. Examples include: decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration, reduced hazardous waste leaching from landfills, <b>reduced</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> and reduced waste and resource consumption, {{which leads to a}} reduction in environmentally damaging mining and timber activity. About 4,000 minerals are known, of these only a few hundred minerals in the world are relatively common. Known reserves of phosphorus will be exhausted within the next 100 years at current rates of usage. Without mechanisms such as taxes or subsidies to internalize externalities, businesses may ignore them despite the costs imposed on society. To make such nonfiscal benefits economically relevant, advocates have pushed for legislative action to increase the demand for recycled materials. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded in favor of recycling, saying that recycling efforts reduced the country's carbon emissions by a net 49 million metric tonnes in 2005. In the United Kingdom, the Waste and Resources Action Programme stated that Great Britain's recycling efforts reduce CO2 emissions by 10â€“15 million tonnes a year. Recycling is more efficient in densely populated areas, as there are economies of scale involved.|$|E
500|$|According to Saunders, {{increased}} {{energy efficiency}} tends to increase energy consumption by two means. First, {{increased energy efficiency}} makes the use of energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use (the direct rebound effect). Second, increased energy efficiency leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use for the whole economy. At the microeconomic level (looking at an individual market), even with the rebound effect, improvements in energy efficiency usually result in <b>reduced</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> That is, the rebound effect is usually less than 100%. However, at the macroeconomic level, more efficient (and hence comparatively cheaper) energy leads to faster economic growth, which increases energy use throughout the economy. Saunders argued that, taking into account both microeconomic and [...] macroeconomic effects, technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use.|$|E

40|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} of supercomputers, <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> by large scale computer systems {{has become a}} major concern. How to <b>reduce</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> is now a critical issue in designing high-performance computing systems. Moreover, <b>reducing</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> for high-performance computing can bring various benefits such as, reduce monetary operating costs, increase system reliability, and reduction of environmental impacts. Therefore, in this paper we address the problem of scheduling precedence-constrained parallel applications on heterogeneous scalable computing systems with the objectives of minimizing finish time and <b>reduce</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> We provide a scheduling algorithm based on the best-effort idea that adopts dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) to <b>reduce</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> That is, the algorithm firstly looks for nearoptimal solutions employing a list-based scheduling algorithm to find the minimum finish time (besteffort). Then, a fast random local search algorithm that exploits voltage scaling is used to <b>reduce</b> the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of the generated schedule without any performance degradation. Simulation results on structured graphs representing real-world applications emphasize the interest of the proposed approach...|$|R
