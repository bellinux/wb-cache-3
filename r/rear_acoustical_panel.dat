40|$|Abstract:-Many times {{dismissed}} {{spaces are}} utilised as auditoria, especially for musical performances. Furthermore, in Italy {{there is a}} lack of concert halls specially designed for music, due to the historical tradition of Opera. Therefore, a strong request of concert halls requires converting more buildings than in foreign Countries. In this paper two different spaces recently converted to Auditorium are analysed. The first one is an ancient Romanic church in Central Italy, whilst the second one is a former sugar factory in Northern Italy. Both of them were provided with variable acoustics. A measuring campaign was carried out by means of binaural and 3 D microphones and omni-directional loudspeaker. The measurements were finalized to relate sound quality to different configuration of <b>acoustical</b> <b>panels</b> and sound source position in the stage. The results of the measurements are presented...|$|R

The present study deals with the design of active  façades based on tensegrity units, which supports shading devices and/or solar panels. The tensegrity units are foldable and deployable and are controlled by stretching or relaxing selected cables.  Wind generators to convert the strain energy stored in the cables of wind-excited units into electrical power are also designed. The proposed structures offer portable applications for small spans and are easy to assemble using prefabricated component parts in the case of large spans...|$|R

In this contribution we investigate the application of the so-called mantle cloaking technique to the environmental acoustical problems. We propose an innovative way to achieve the acoustical insulation of a confined environment, aiming to lower noise pollution, by designing a subwavelength-thick surface with proper surface acoustic impedance.

50|$|The remodeled arena {{maintained}} the architectural {{integrity of the}} original roofline by using the existing steel trusses in combination with four new main diagonal trusses. The wood, steel and concrete from the demolition was either reused in construction of the new arena or sold to recyclers. The original <b>acoustical</b> <b>panels,</b> the panels attached to the roof that keep the space from echoing, were refurbished and reused. The court was lowered 35 ft below street level to allow for 3,000 more seats. The doors opened to the newly renovated arena on October 26, 1995. The sightlines, however, benefitted the SuperSonics {{at the expense of}} the junior Thunderbirds. The floor was just barely large enough to fit a regulation rink. Many seats in the lower level were so badly obstructed that almost half the lower level was curtained off for T-Birds games. The new scoreboard was significantly off-center in the hockey configuration, hanging over one blue line instead of the center-ice faceoff circle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With rapid urbanization, {{the volume}} of traffic in urban area has been {{significantly}} increased. This in turn led to problem which {{can be described as}} Road Traffic Noise. Currently, to alleviate the road traffic noise damage, a demand for installation of soundproofing walls is rising. Among different shapes of soundproof walls being installed, the reflection-type <b>acoustical</b> insulation <b>panel</b> is highly drawing attentions of residents {{due to the fact that}} it does not obstruct their field of vision in contrast with the opaque <b>acoustical</b> insulation <b>panel.</b> On the other hand, improving the soundproofing wall of the reflection-type <b>acoustical</b> insulation barrier <b>panel</b> needs to be focused on since it has a possibility to cause a secondary damage by reflected sounds. Therefore, in this research, study has been carried out to improve the forms in order to minimize travelling of reflected sounds through changing the frontal surface shape and geometrical shape of the reflection-type soundproofing panel. A result from comparison between the normal reflection-type soundproofing panel and the improved soundproofing panel, with reduction effects in the noise reflection, showed that the curved type of soundproofing panel has an impact on reducing the noise up to 1. 5 dB. Furthermore, from the research conducted, it appears that the increase and decrease in the reflected sounds can be changeable depending on various design factors. Thus, it turns out that the study shows a potential possibility to develop a reduction technology of the reflected sound...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNowadays {{there is}} a trend for {{developing}} multifunctional structures involving mechanical specifications with other requirements such as acoustical and thermal management. For that purpose, hybrid materials have been developed during the past decades showing their high efficiency for multifunctional applications. [1 – 4] Hybrid materials take advantage from the combination of materials and {{from the use of}} an additional design scale which is the geometry. Architectured materials such as foams, honeycombs, and truss structures have been widely studied regarding both the influence of the materials and the geometrical parameters. [5 – 7] Among these, foams are the most studied, the less expensive and the most used of hybrid materials, and therefore could be considered as the most representative hybrid materials. It is used for very demanding applications such as for aeronautical industry [8] but also in building trades or in packaging. [9] When integrated in a sandwich panel, the performances achievable with foams can be tremendous. Its porosity network ensures a good thermal resistance due to the presence of air, while its low density is bene fi cial for mechanical applications. The mechanical behavior of such sandwich panels has been studied by several authors leading to series of books [10, 11] and articles. [12 – 14] The structure of a sandwich panel has also been investigated to develop efficient <b>acoustical</b> <b>panels</b> with an increased acoustical transmission loss. A prior work from Lang and Dym [15] showed that sandwich panels with a soft core could be designed in order to favor the development of unsymmetrical vibration modes which enables to obtain an improved transmission loss. Based on this work, several authors developed acoustical models dedicated to the prediction of the acoustical transmission loss of sandwich panels. [16 - 18] The main issue addressed in this paper is that a high stiffness-to-mass design of a sandwich panel usually ends to a poor acoustical transmission loss. Then the design of a panel for both mechanical and acoustical properties becomes sensitive. Wang et al. [19] investigated the optimal design of a sandwich panel by setting constraints on the acoustical and mechanical behavior and by looking for the minimum weight design. For that purpose the previous authors used a genetic algorithm and found a competitive solution compared to usual mechanical structures. Generic design methods have been developed in the late 1990 s, particularly the performance index method. [20] However, a more re fi ned procedure is needed to deal with multiple criteria in the design process. In this paper, the design of a classical sandwich panel with a foam core is considered. A Pareto set optimization using a genetic algorithm is used to assess the interactions between a set of performances composed of mass, fl exural stiffness and acoustical transmission loss. Trade-off surfaces will be calculated in order to evaluate the in fl uence of material and geometrical parameters. The design process developed here involves both materials selection and geometrical design and is part of a toolbox for a “ materials by design ” approach...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the feasibility of Arenga Pinnata fiber to be applied for acoustical material component. There different binders namely polyurethane, urea formaldehyde and latex were employed as binder. The weight percentages of binder used were 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, and 30 %. Hand layup process was used in specimens production. The physical, acoustical and durability properties of the panels were investigated experimentally. The result shows that panel with high percentages of binder tends to have high density and tortuosity, but less porosity. The optimum porosity of 0. 94 was obtained from panel that added with 10 % Latex. In general, Arenga Pinnata panels show good sound absorption from mid to high frequency that is from 2000 Hz to 5000 Hz. The best sound absorption is performed by panel added with 10 % Latex with a maximum absorption coefficient (α) of 0. 96 at 3000 Hz. The average Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) for all panels is 0. 40. The value indicates that Arenga Pinnata panels are highly absorptive material. However, Arenga Pinnata panel is poor insulator since the optimum sound transmission loss (STL) is only 9. 37 dB from panel added with 15 % polyurethane at 5000 Hz. Thus, Arenga Pinnata panel is applicable to reduce echo caused by reflection effects within a room. Sound absorption increases as porosity increase and decrease as density-tortuosity increase. Hence, Arenga pinnata fiber is applicable for <b>acoustical</b> component <b>panel.</b> Moreover, Arenga Pinnata panels are durable that resist in water, heat, and fire. It is applicable for heat insulation...|$|R
40|$|Today with rapid {{industrial}}ization, {{industrial noise}} {{has become a}} serious environmental problem in Sri Lanka. The noise which is generated by machines in industry is called as industrial noise. This excessive noise can interfere with communication between supervisors and employees. Continuous exposure to noise can cause fatigue, which often results in accidents and reduces the pace and quality of work. Noise affects negatively on the day today life of surrounding people, who have faced with many problems mentally and physically. Therefore, noise control {{is one of the}} major requirements to improve the living environment. Most of the developed countries use practical techniques to minimize the nuisance such as barrier walls, duct silencers, <b>acoustical</b> wall <b>panel,</b> soundproof curtains, sound enclosures for industrial machinery and other similar noise control treatments that are installed near the source to effectively reduce the sound level. However, Sri Lanka has not yet yielded much into this issue as noise reduction methods are costly. Therefore, it is necessary to find out cost effective methods to control industrial noise. This research was conducted to investigate the potential uses of Salvinia dust as natural sound reduction material, to give a solution for the existing industrial noise problems. Specimens having a size of 75 mm (diameter) x 25 mm (thickness) were made by using Salvinia dust. Salvinia dust was mixed with cement at a ratio of 1 : 1 and water was added. Noise Reduction Coefficient of these specimens were investigated by using an experimental set-up including signal generator, speaker and noise level meter. Noise reduction ability of the materials was quantified by using Noise Reduction Co-efficient (NRC). Variation of NRC with particle size, mix proportion and sample thickness were also investigated.
