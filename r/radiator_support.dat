Passive cryogenic radiator technology is under devel-opment at the Satellite Thermal Control Laboratory at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, where two experimental prototypes have been built and ground tested.

40|$|Worldwide, {{the pace}} of {{development}} in pedestrian countermeasures is increasing rapidly. To better understand {{the state of the}} art in bumper design for pedestrian impact, a survey of literature and patents has been performed. Two general approaches to reducing the severity of pedestrian lower limb impacts were identified: (a) Provide cushioning and support of the lower limb with a bumper and a new lower stiffener, or (b) Use the bumper as a platform for impact sensors and exterior airbags. This study focused on the first approach. Excluding bumper sensors, airbags, and non-design-related articles, a total of 130 relevant technical articles and 147 patents were identified. The most common method proposed for cushioning the lower limb in an impact uses an energy absorber (plastic foam or ‘egg-crate’) in front of a semi-rigid (steel or aluminum) beam. There are also proposals for ‘spring-steel’, steel-foam composites, crush-cans, and plastic beams.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a theoretical}} phase-control design strategy for idle shake affected by {{an arrangement of}} a powerplant on transversely mounted Front engine Front Wheel Drive (FWD) passenger cars. There {{are two types of}} powerplant arrangement for FWD cars heading up to the North in the top view. One of them is a typical “east-west arrangement” which allows the “front” of the engine to be placed to the right or “east”, and the “rear” of the engine that is to mate to the transmission to be placed to the left or “west” (Fig. 1). Another one is “west-east arrangement”, where the engine is positioned to “west”, and the transmission is positioned to “east” (FIG. 2). In general, a dynamic damper like a <b>radiator</b> <b>supported</b> by a rubber bush built in {{the front end of the}} engine compartment is widely believed to reduce a gain of FRF (Frequency Response Function) at resonant frequency. In addition to that, it becomes clear in this paper that the dynamic damper has an additional phase-shift effect between the two FRFs. That is to say, the two vector responses of the body vibration caused by the two excitation forces, which are the roll moment and the vertical force of the engine, cancel each other and the resultant vector becomes so small. In this manner, the powerplant arrangement affects idle shake deeply correlating with the phase-control design. A combination of the East-West arrangement and a 2 nd order balancer-less engine is the best design for idle shake of the 2 nd order harmonics. On the contrary, a combination of the West-East arrangement and a balancer-less engine is the worst design. If the engine is equipped with 2 nd order balance shafts, idle shake is estimated to be middle between them, regardless of the powerplat arrangement...|$|R

The system utilizes a reflective catenary shaped trough deployed about a vertical radiator to shade the radiator from heat emitted by the hot lunar surface. The catenary shaped trough is constructed from a film material and is aligned relative to the sun so that incoming solar energy is focused to a line just above the vertical radiator and can thereby isolate the radiator from the effects of direct sunlight. The film is in a collapsed position between side by side support rods, all of which are in a transport case. To deploy the film and support rods, a set of parallel tracks running perpendicular to length of the support rods are extended out from the transport case.

50|$|Excess {{waste heat}} created on the {{spacecraft}} is rejected to space {{by the use}} of radiators. Radiators come in several different forms, such as spacecraft structural panels, flat-plate radiators mounted {{to the side of the}} spacecraft, and panels deployed after the spacecraft is on orbit. Whatever the configuration, all radiators reject heat by infrared (IR) radiation from their surfaces. The radiating power depends on the surface's emittance and temperature. The radiator must reject both the spacecraft waste heat and any radiant-heat loads from the environment. Most radiators are therefore given surface finishes with high IR emittance to maximize heat rejection and low solar absorptance to limit heat from the sun. Most spacecraft radiators reject between 100 and 350 W of internally generated electronics waste heat per square meter. Radiators weight typically varies from almost nothing, if an existing structural panel is used as a radiator, to around 12 kg/m2 for a heavy deployable <b>radiator</b> and its <b>support</b> structure.|$|R

40|$|A small ultra-thin planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) {{which can}} be {{switchable}} or tunable using PIN or varactor diodes, respectively, is proposed. The antenna consists of two radiators and connected together using two PIN or varactors diodes. Frequency reconfigurability is obtained by (i) tuning using varactor diodes or (ii) switching using PIN diodes. In the study, when varactors are used, the PIFA is optimized to operate in five frequency bands centered at 0. 72, 1. 35, 1. 98, 3. 6, and 5 GHz. Varying the voltages across the varactors can tune these five bands over the range of 45. 33 % (0. 58 - 0. 92 GHz), 17. 77 % (1. 23 - 1. 47 GHz), 26 % (1. 57 - 2. 04 GHz), 6. 66 % (3. 48 - 3. 72 GHz), and 0. 97 % (4. 99 - 5. 04 MHz), covering the DVB-H, GSM 800 / 900, GPS, PCS, DCS, UMTS, Wibro phase III, WiMAX, WLAN systems, etc. If PIN diode switches are used instead, the frequency bands can be switched among different standards, including the DVB-H, GSM, UMTS, DCS, GPS, WiMAX, and WLAN systems, depending on the switching states.

40|$|Low {{pressure}} {{hot water}} radiators {{are the most}} popular type of heat emitter used in UK buildings. Because of high surface temperatures, or for aesthetic reasons, radiators are often encased in some form of architectural casing which reduces their output. An alternative method of reducing surface touch temperature and enhancing the appearance of radiators may be achieved by using decorative covers. This research examines how the heat output from a radiator is affected by the application of an innovative magnetic decorative cover to the radiator surface. A series of tests was run which compared the heat output from a bare radiator, to the output when the radiator is installed (a) under a magnetic cover, and (b) within a traditional wooden cover. Since the heat output from a radiator is by convection and radiation, thermocouples were located on <b>radiator</b> and <b>supporting</b> wall surfaces, {{as well as in the}} air spaces around the radiator. By this means the temperature differences which drive both heat transfer mechanisms could be determined. Additionally, temperatures were also monitored by a thermal imaging camera. The scenario tests were carried out under steady state conditions at closed room space, with controlled room temperature. Results from the tests showed that magnetically applied radiator covers efficiency increased by 13 - 20 % relative to traditional radiator wooden cover. In terms of space-heating, this can reduce energy input needed to achieve comfort temperature. This demonstrates that magnetic radiator covers can offer improved heating system energy performance.

40|$|On-axis and {{far-field}} series expansions {{are developed}} for the sound pressure due to an arbitrary, circular symmetric velocity distribution on a flat radiator in an infinite baffle. These expansions are obtained by expanding the velocity distributions in terms of orthogonal polynomials R(/a) =Pn(2 (/a) 2 - 1) with Pn the Legendre polynomials. The terms R {{give rise to a}} closed-form expression for the pressure on-axis {{as well as for the}} far-field pressure. Furthermore, for a large number of velocity profiles, including those associated with the rigid piston, the simply <b>supported</b> <b>radiator,</b> and the clamped radiators as well as Gaussian radiators, there are closed-form expressions for the required expansion coefficients. In particular, for the rigid, simply <b>supported,</b> and clamped <b>radiators,</b> this results in explicit finite-series expressions for both the on-axis and far-field pressures. In the reverse direction, a method of estimating velocity distributions from (measured) on-axis pressures by matching in terms of expansion coefficients is proposed.

40|$|We {{know that}} the {{universe}} consists of 22 % dark matter. The dark matter particle has to be stable, non-relativistic and only weakly interacting. But we don't know what the dark matter is made of {{and how it is}} distributed within our Galaxy. Supersymmetric models predict the existence of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is stable if R-parity is conserved. In supersymmetric models inspired by supergravity, the commonly accepted LSP candidate is the lightest neutralino which is a neutral and weakly interacting massive particle. It is a viable candidate for dark matter since the derived relic abundance is naturally within the observed range. In general, the cosmic antiparticles are expected as secondary products of interactions of the primary cosmic-rays (CRs) with the interstellar medium during propagation. While the measurements of cosmic positrons, antiprotons and diffuse gamma rays have become more precise, the results still do not match with the pure secondary origins. The comparison of the expected background of positron, antiproton and gamma-ray fluxes with experimental data have been performed using CR propagation models. A phenomenological study based on the mSUGRA frameworks was carried out and showed a better interpretation of CR fluxes including neutralino annihilations in the galactic halo or center. The combined data of positrons, antiprotons and gamma rays give a strong constraint on the mSUGRA parameter space. The light neutralino has a mass between 80 and 120 GeV annihilating dominantly to W+W-. The most preferred mSUGRA parameter space belongs to the focus point region. This region also produced the correct dark matter abundance consistent with the WMAP 3 and the 2 dFGRS data. This result might be considered as first evidence of a neutralino dark matter scenario. However, future experiments have to provide measurements of CRs with higher precision. AMS- 02 will be the major particle physics experiment on the ISS and will make a profound impact on our knowledge of high energy CRs with unprecedented accuracy. It will extend our knowledge on CR origins, acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Especially, the measurement of the positron flux may be the most promising for the detection of the neutralino dark matter, since the predicted positron flux is less sensitive to the astrophysical parameters responsible for the propagation and the dark matter halo profile. The AMS- 02 Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) is designed to provide a positron separation from the proton background with high efficiency in the momentum range of 1 GeV/c upto leq 300 GeV/c. It consists of 20 layers of straw module, proportional counters using Xe/CO 2 gas mixtures, interleaved with fleece <b>radiators</b> <b>supported</b> in a conical octagon structure. Major design constraints arise from operating it in a space environment with limited power resources. The TRD readout system is divided into 82 front-end electronic circuits and two pairs of crate electronics and power distribution boxes. A front-end board employs a 64 channel charge sensitive amplifier, shaper and multiplexer based on low noise and low power with a high dynamic range. In addition, it contains an analog-digital-converter, calibration, hybrid control and logic circuits. The front-end electronics has been developed and constructed to meet the requirements of space qualification issued by NASA. Results of functional tests during a series of space qualification tests have been presented and the TRD performance has been investigated using a testbeam at CERN. All of the flight frond-end boards are produced and passed the EMI, vibration and thermal vacuum tests without any failure. Each AMS sub-detector will be delivered to CERN in 2007 for the detector integration. The fully assembled AMS- 02 detector will be tested with high energy beams at CERN. Afterwards a space qualification test will be performed using a large space simulator at ESA-ESTEC. Then it will be delivered to NASA-KSC to prepare for the launch with a space shuttle.

A traditional sandwich structure is envisioned where heat pipes are embedded between two high thermal conductivity face sheets. The heat pipe evaporators are to be thermally connected to the heat source through one or more manifolds containing coolant. Initial radiator operation on the lunar surface would likely follow a cold soak where {{the water in the}} heat pipes is purposely frozen. To achieve heat pipe operation, {{it will be necessary to}} thaw the heat pipes. One option is to allow the sunlight impinging on the surface at sunrise to achieve this goal.

It was found that sunlight impinging on the radiator surface at sunrise was insufficient to solely achieve the goal of thawing the water in the heat pipes. However, starting from a frozen condition was accomplished successfully by applying power to the evaporators. Start up in this fashion was demonstrated without evaporator dryout.

Further differentiation included a unique suspension design with custom components, 100% unique sheetmetal and a 95% exclusive interior." [...] The steel-reinforced fully boxed ladder-like unibody frame with its [...] "four-bone" [...] design and four-wheel independent suspension provided space for designers to build unique storage solutions in, around, {{and on top of}} the frame. Starting {{at the front of the}} Ridgeline, engineers crafted a hood that supported a unique cold air intake system for the engine that draws outside air from above and in front of the <b>radiator</b> to <b>support</b> torque production and deep water fording. This hood design also allowed engineers to build environmentally protected windshield wipers that were also heated to improve winter performance. [...] Honda also incorporated large side-view mirrors to support better visibility while towing; due to the mirrors’ size, Honda built small vortex generators on top of the mirrors to help reduce air turbulence. [...] In the crew-cab, the unibody frame allowed engineers to build a cabin with a flat load floor (i.e. no transmission hump) and more passenger space than other mid-size trucks. [...] At the center of the truck, the C-pillar's unique shape was specifically designed to help distribute large loads across the unibody frame and the cab so the truck could achieve its targeted payload and towing figures. [...] Also, the design of the C-pillar, rear roof garnish, and tailgate were built to maintain good aerodynamics and reduce turbulence between the cab and the tailgate while maintaining driver visibility. This aerodynamic design allowed them to create a rear garnish that shields the rear glass window so when it's opened at speed there is no buffeting or rainwater intrusion.

2500|$|According to Honda, [...] "Engineers {{started with}} Honda’s Global Light Truck {{platform}} and transformed 93% {{of the components}} into a mission-specific platform using approximately 44% high-strength steel across the unibody and seven high-strength steel cross members to create a fully boxed ladder frame that is fully integrated into the unibody. [...] Further differentiation included a unique suspension design with custom components, 100% unique sheetmetal and a 95% exclusive interior." [...] According to Autoweek, The Ridgeline's [...] "unibody has many braces, brackets, and reinforced areas that require more welding than traditional pickups." [...] The steel-reinforced fully boxed ladder-like unibody frame with its [...] "four-bone" [...] design and four-wheel independent suspension provided space for designers to build unique storage solutions in, around, {{and on top of}} the frame. Starting {{at the front of the}} Ridgeline, engineers crafted an aluminum hood that supports a unique cold air intake system for the engine that draws outside air from above and in front of the <b>radiator</b> to <b>support</b> torque production and deep water fording which Honda attempted to patent. [...] This hood design also allowed engineers to build environmentally protected windshield wipers that are also heated to improve winter performance. [...] Honda also incorporated large side-view mirrors to support better visibility while towing; due to their size, Honda incorporated small vortex generators on top of the mirrors to reduce air turbulence which Honda also attempted to patent. [...] In the crew-cab, the unibody frame allowed engineers to build a cabin with a flat load floor (i.e. no transmission hump) and more passenger space than other mid-size trucks. [...] At the center of the truck, the C-pillar's unique shape was specifically designed to help distribute large loads across the unibody frame and the cab so the truck could achieve its targeted payload and towing figures. [...] Also, the design of the C-pillar, rear roof garnish, and tailgate were built to maintain good aerodynamics and reduce turbulence between the cab and the tailgate while maintaining driver visibility. [...] This aerodynamic design allowed them to create a rear garnish that shields the rear glass window so when it's opened at speed there is no buffeting or rainwater intrusion. [...] The bed is built out of steel-reinforced Sheet Molding Composite (SMC) which is dent resistant, corrosion resistant, and is covered with a non-slip coating. [...] It is supported by high-strength steel crossmembers (three under the bed and two in the rear cab wall) to safely secure and support heavy loads, even under conditions that would cause the SMC to fail or during collisions that would try to force that load into the cab.|$|R
