40|$|The {{right to}} {{initiate}} enforcement measures {{belongs to the}} creditor, unless otherwise provided by law, who nevertheless cannot proceed in this respect unless it meets procedural requirements expressly regulated by the lawmaker. The procedural formalities required to initiate the enforcement measures are {{the existence of an}} unquestionable and due claim, the submission of a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>enforcement</b> to the competent bailiff, obtaining the permission for enforcement from the enforcement court and the preliminary notification of the debtor. The initiation of enforcement measures in the regulation brought by the new Civil Procedure Code seems a complex activity of a mixed nature, which has both a jurisdictional side, represented by the activity of the court of law, and an administrative side, consisting in the enforcement activity of the bailiff. </p...|$|E

5000|$|States Parties are to {{establish}} a Central Authority for the convention. The Authority {{in the country of}} residence of the requester is the authority through which <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>enforcement</b> of judicial or administrative decistions can be made, while the authority in the country to which the request is lodged should provide further -free- help with the application. As the convention is based on enforcement of judicial decisions, the merit of the decision itself may not be taken into account. The request should include the decision as well as proof that the [...] "respondent had proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard, or that the respondent had proper notice of the decision and the opportunity to challenge or appeal it on fact and law". The receiving authority is required to actively enforce the decisions by means which are at least as effective as those used when enforcing decisions within that country. They may include withholding of wages or social security payments or garnishments from bank accounts. Also public bodies may request enforcement if they are eligible to receive payments because one of the parties has made a claim to public funds.|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{held that}} the fact that an event was not wholly [...] "private" [...] did not mean that an {{individual}} had no interest in limiting its disclosure. The privacy interest in a rap sheet was substantial. Whether an invasion of privacy was warranted had to turn {{on the nature of the}} requested document and its relationship to the basic purpose of the FOIA, which focused on the citizen's right to be informed about the government's actions. The news groups in this case did not intend to discover anything about the conduct of the agency, and response to the request would not shed any light on the agency's conduct. Thus, the public interest in release of a rap sheet was not the type of interest protected by the FOIA. The Court held, as a categorical matter under § 552(b)(7)(C), that a third party's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> law <b>enforcement</b> records about a private citizen could reasonably be expected to invade that citizen's privacy, and that when the request sought no official information about the government, the privacy invasion was unwarranted.|$|R
50|$|Heightened racial {{tensions}} and altercations in July 1967 {{were followed by}} two days of sporadic vandalism, looting, and firebombing. At the request of Wilmington mayor John Babiarz, state police were summoned to increase patrols. For his part, Governor Charles L. Terry (a southern-style Democrat) publicly warned of minority violence and conspiracies, placed fifteen hundred National Guardsmen on standby alert at Wilmington’s airport, proposed and signed legislation granting him sole authority to impose martial law and ban the sale of alcohol, and established a riot commission. In addition to the Delaware National Guard, the Governor activated the entire Delaware State Police Department. All days off were canceled, vacations were canceled and all troopers were to report to their assigned Troop. The Delaware State Police who were nearest to the City of Wilmington were sent to Troop 2 located south of the city. Only a skeleton force was left at the Troops located in New Castle County. The Troopers who were assigned to Kent and Sussex counties Troops were sent to Troop 2. Once the lower county Troopers arrived at Troop 2 they were paired with those of New Castle County. Any <b>request</b> <b>for</b> law <b>enforcement</b> assistance from the Wilmington Police Department was sent to Troop 2.|$|R

50|$|Section 319 {{requires}} {{a financial institution}} {{to respond to a}} <b>request</b> <b>for</b> information from a Federal banking agency within 120 hours of the receipt of the request. Federal banking agencies can request information relating to any money-laundering activities — financial institutions must provide documentation for any account opened, maintained, administered or managed by the institution in the U.S. A summons or subpoena may be issued to any representative of a foreign bank that as a corresponding account in the U.S. — they may be required to include records (even those maintained outside the U.S.) that relate to the deposit of funds into the foreign bank. The summons may be issued to a bank with a representative in the U.S. or in foreign countries where the U.S. has a mutual legal assistance treat, a multilateral agreement or where the U.S. can expect that they will respond to a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> international law <b>enforcement</b> assistance. Foreign banks who maintain corresponding accounts must maintain records in the U.S. that will identify the owners' real names and addresses. The banks must be able to provide this information within 7 days of receipt of the request. It is also a requirement that when so ordered by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Treasury (they must consult each other first) the financial institution must terminate any corresponding accounts within 10 days. Corresponding accounts can be ordered to be closed if the foreign bank fails to comply with a summons or subpoena (see above), or has failed to legally contest the summons in the U.S. A financial institution is further protected from liability if they terminate a corresponding relationship in accordance with the section, and in fact the financial institution faces penalties of $US10,000 for each day the account remains open after the 10-day limit has expired.|$|R
