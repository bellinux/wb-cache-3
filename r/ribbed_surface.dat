25|$|Barbecuing {{encompasses}} {{four or five}} distinct {{types of}} cooking techniques. The original technique is cooking using smoke at low temperatures—usually around 240–280°F or 115–145°C—and significantly longer cooking times (several hours), known as smoking. Another technique, known as baking, used a masonry oven or baking oven that uses convection to cook meats and starches with moderate temperatures for an average cooking time of about an hour. Braising combines direct, dry heat charbroiling on a <b>ribbed</b> <b>surface</b> with a broth-filled pot for moist heat. Using this technique, cooking occurs at various speeds, starting fast, slowing down, then speeding up again, lasting for a few hours.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot {{on top of a}} grill. A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising, combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a <b>ribbed</b> <b>surface</b> and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed on top of the grill, covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>surface</b> <b>rib</b> arrangements on particle deposition in two-dimensional ribbed duct air flows by CFD method. The turbulent duct air flows were simulated by Reynolds stress model (RSM) with UDF correction, and the particle motions were solved by discrete particle model (DPM). The <b>surface</b> <b>ribs</b> were arranged in aligned or staggered layouts. The air velocity profiles for both smooth and ribbed duct flows {{as well as the}} particle deposition velocity for smooth duct cases were all in good agreement with the relative literature data. The simulation results showed that the <b>surface</b> <b>ribs</b> with aligned arrangement have better performance on small particle deposition enhancement, compared with staggered <b>surface</b> <b>ribs.</b> Nevertheless, the large particle deposition rates are not enhanced obviously by both kinds of <b>surface</b> <b>ribs.</b> Considering the flow drag increase, the maximum particle deposition enhancement can reach 425 times for particles with 1 μm diameter. Finally, the mechanisms of particle deposition enhancement by aligned and staggered <b>surface</b> <b>ribs</b> were analyzed and discussed from the views of rib interception, deposition area increase, turbulent eddy capture and the flow passage width. <b>Surface</b> <b>ribs</b> with aligned arrangement are recommended to be applied in particle removal and air clean devices.

The Reynolds number for the test conditions was 44, 000 in the 150 mm square duct.

In addition, the associated pressure loss penalty is lower than {{in the presence of the}} roughness elements than in the presence of the <b>ribbed</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This may be attributable to the small dimensionless roughness height of the elements, which results only in a moderate distortion of the #ow structure near the surfaces.

40|$|Background Biomechanical {{research}} {{directed at}} devel-oping customized implant solutions for rib fracture fixation {{is essential to}} reduce the complexity and to increase the reliability of rib osteosynthesis. Without a simple and reliable implant solution, surgical stabilization of rib frac-tures will remain underutilized despite proven benefits for select indications. This article summarizes the research, development, and testing of a specialized and compre-hensive implant solution for rib fracture fixation. Methods An implant system for rib fracture fixation was developed in three phases: first, research on rib biome-chanics was conducted to better define the form and function of ribs. Second, research results were imple-mented to derive an implant system comprising anatomical plates and intramedullary rib splints. Third, the function-ality of anatomic plates and rib splints was evaluated {{in a series of}} biomechanical tests. Results Geometric analysis of the <b>rib</b> <b>surface</b> yielded a set of anatomical rib plates that traced the <b>rib</b> <b>surface</b> over a distance of 13 – 15 cm without the need for plate contour-ing. Structurally, the flexible design of anatomic plates did not increase the native stiffness of ribs while restoring 77 % of the native rib strength. Intramedullary rib splints with a rectangular cross-section provided 48 % stronger fracture fixation than traditional intramedullary fixation with Kirs-chner wires. Conclusion The anatomic plate set can simplify rib fracture fixation by minimizing the need for plate con-touring. Intramedullary fixation with rib splints provides a less-invasive fixation alternative for posterior rib fracture, where access for plating is limited. The combination of anatomic plates and intramedullary splints provides a comprehensive system to manage the wide range of frac-tures encountered in flail chest injuries...|$|R

40|$|The {{repeated}} <b>ribs</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{are known}} for their effective enhancement of heat transfer, which is widely demanded in many scientific and industrial applications. In this paper, further improvements were made by the introduction of a textured asymmetric arc rib structure, on which arrays of secondary micro grooves are superimposed onto a primary asymmetric surface. Numerical simulation has been carried out on the turbulent force convection flow in a single-phase channel with two-dimension (2 D) <b>ribbed</b> internal <b>surface</b> in the range of Reynolds number from 20, 000 to 60, 000. A uniform heat flux is applied on the external surface of channel. In contrast to the conventional optimized symmetric triangular rib, the advanced compound rib could improve the performance of heat transfer while minimizes the pressure drop. These improvements are closely correlated to the promotion of the separated flow which could reattach the channel surface. Since the geometry of the novel compound rib is difficult to fabricate by conventional means, ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM) is used to generate these micro-structures. According to prediction of numerical simulation, the experimental cooling works have been designed and conducted for the considered shaped ribs with the signi ficant dimensionless pitch of 5 and 6. A good agreement was found between the simulation and experimental results. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
