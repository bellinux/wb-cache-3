In recent years the park was the focus of several studies and initiatives, aimed at improving the management of its many-sided ecosystem, significantly influenced by climate change and increase of human activities and tourism, which occurred {{from the end of the}} 1970 s, as well as by practices that are harmful both to human health and to our environment (e. g. burn up kerosene or animal excrements in order to obtain heat). Research work has focused on designing a residential unit that meets population needs, in terms of simplicity of realization, replicability, use of local materials, environmental compatibility and exploitation of available renewable energies. For this purpose a thorough analysis was conducted to identify the housing standard characteristic of reference context and Sherpa people, concerning indoor thermal comfort conditions, construction techniques, availability and skills of local workforce. Data necessary for the design phase were obtained through a collaboration with researchers of Ev-K 2 -CNR center, active at 5, 050 meters a. s. l. in Nepal at the base of Mount Everest with a laboratory/observatory (known as the "Pyramid") for highaltitude meteorological studies since 1989. Climate conditions were registered by specific monitoring stations at certain times (2002 - 2008); during preliminary stage, these values were considered representative of the local context chosen for the project, that is Namche Bazar, a village located within the park, in a central point both from the logistic and altimetric/weather points of view. For the residential unit under investigation, two different constructive approaches were selected and compared: earthbags and straw bales. Both techniques have several advantages, in particular availability of <b>raw</b> material (<b>jute</b> bags, soil, straw), simplicity (e. g. earthbag constructions are realized using the ancient technique of pisé, combined with flexible bags or tubes), durability, insulation performance, costeffectiveness. Through a specific software for calculation of winter/summer thermal loads, different combinations of selections of structure and insulation were examined for both solutions, in order to achieve the optimum for the case study. Furthermore on the base of data monitored on site, a specific assessment was carried out to evaluate the potential of solar and wind resources.

Different sources of contamination have been recognized for vegetable oils: environmental contamination, use of lubricating in the extraction plant, storage and transport of he <b>raw</b> matter in <b>jute</b> bags, transport of the oil in ships previously used to transport mineral oils etc. It is well known that vegetable oils can be contaminated with mineral oils, but almost all published data refers to the analysis of the saturated fraction (MOSH), without checking for the presence of the MOAH. Since MOSH and MOAH have different toxicological relevance, and particularly MOAH are suspected to contain carcinogenic compounds, it is important to quantify them separately. Recently, both on-line liquid chromatography (LC) -GC flame ionization detection (FID) and off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) -GC-FID approaches have been proposed for MOSH and MOAH determination. A comparison between off-line and on-line approaches for the assessment of these contaminants in vegetable oil and fats is presented and discussed. Sample pre treatment and enrichment is important for accurate determination of the contamination and to reach the required sensitivity when analyzing vegetable oils and fats. The possibility to use alternative approaches such as automated solid phase extraction and micro scale saponification for sample enrichment and purification have been explored.

50|$|The jute {{trade is}} centred mainly around Bangladesh and the Indian State of West Bengal. The major {{producing}} country of jute is Bangladesh, {{due to its}} natural fertile soil. Bengal Jute was taken to Europe early in the 17th century by the Dutch and the French and later by the East India Company to Britain. By the 1790s a much larger trade had developed in the Scottish city of Dundee, the European home of jute spinners. Introduced to the British by the East India Company, crude fibre was the bulk still exported from Bengal after 1790, but a thriving trade did not really begin until after 1850 through mechanised processing, to meet rising demand. <b>Raw</b> <b>jute</b> was imported from Bengal by the British East India Company. British Jute Barons grew rich processing jute and selling manufactured products made from jute. Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company began to set up jute mills in Bengal and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade. Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories. More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches during World War I and even more during WWII and also exported to the Americas, especially the United States southern region to bag cotton and coffee. It {{was used in the}} fishing, construction, art and in the arms industry. India, China, Thailand, Myanmar also produce Jute in low quantities. India {{is one of the largest}} importers of Jute in South Asia and also produces processed jute products in the world, while Bangladesh is the largest producer and exporter of <b>raw</b> <b>jute.</b> Therefore, the local price of <b>raw</b> <b>jute</b> in Bangladesh is the international price.

50|$|Radcliffe's line split Bengal, which {{historically}} {{was always}} a single economic zone, single cultural and ethnic (Bengali-Hindu or Bengali-Muslim) zone, into two-halves. The two-halves were intricately connected with each other. The fertile East produced food and raw materials which the West consumed and the industrialised West produced manufactured goods which were consumed by the East. This mutually beneficial trade and exchange was severely disrupted by the partition. Rail, road and water communication routes were severed between the two. After partition West Bengal suffered from a substantial food shortage as the fertile rice producing districts of Bengal went to the eastern half. The shortage continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s. By 1959, West Bengal faced an annual food shortage of 950,000 tones. Hunger marches became a common sight in Kolkata.Jute was the largest industry in Bengal {{at the time of}} partition. Radcliffe's line left every single jute mill in West Bengal but four fifth of the jute producing land in East Bengal. The best quality fibre yielding breeds of jute were cultivated mostly in East Bengal. India and Pakistan initially went into a trade agreement to import <b>raw</b> <b>jute</b> from East Bengal for West Bengal's mills. However, Pakistan had plans to set up its own mills and put restrictions on <b>raw</b> <b>jute</b> export to India. West Bengal's mills faced acute shortage. The industry faced a crisis. On the other hand, jute farmers in East Bengal was now without a market to sell their produce. Jute export to West Bengal suddenly became an anti-national act for Pakistan. Smuggling of <b>raw</b> <b>jute</b> shot up across the border. However West Bengal rapidly increased jute production and by mid-to-late 1950s became largely self-sufficient in jute. West Bengal's mills became less dependent on East Bengal for raw material. Pakistan also set up new factories to process its local produce instead of exporting to India. The following table shows jute production details in two countries in 1961.West Bengal's paper and leather industry faced similar problems. The paper mills used East Bengal's Bamboo and the tanneries consumed leather, also mainly produced in East Bengal. Like jute, lack of raw material pushed these two industries into decline.|$|E

50|$|It took {{pressure}} from chief minister Mamata Banerjee of West Bengal to force JCI to purchase jute direct from farmers {{rather than from}} middlemen. In October 2011 farmers demonstrated against the low prices offered for their produce in Bechimari, Darrang, Assam, blocking off a road and then attacking vehicles. The police fired, killing four jute farmers. The farmers' complaint was that a cartel of buyers was keeping prices artificially low.

There is no absolute evidence of an old trading center or market place, though {{with the advent of}} industries newer market places came into existence. Post independence, the town has witnessed many economic ups and downs due to the economic changes in the industries it houses. The downfall of Jute mills across the Ganges post Partition of India, which had flourished during the late 19th Century and once unseated Scotland Jute mills at Dundee, preceded the economic drain from West Bengal and the Ganges Jute Mill at Tribeni was no exception. The annual demand for Indian Jute mills of 6 million <b>raw</b> <b>Jute</b> bales during 1947-48 mostly lay unfulfilled, due to 80% of the cultivable lands for Jute falling in East Pakistan now Bangladesh, and could only meet 1.7 million bales during that period. The following three five year plans by the Government of India helped increase the production but by then the foreign demand for Indian jute started to drop, which led the jute mills to limit production, if not stop it completely. There could be few reasons attributed to such a downfall, viz., the monopolistic structure and control of the industry and methods applied to increase profitability by restricting production so as to reduce the demand and price of <b>raw</b> <b>jute,</b> the paucity of funds post independence and lack of research and development, the cheaper alternatives available and sluggish Indian market to Jute products.|$|E

The authors examine these fluctuations and analyze policies that might reduce them. They find that price fluctuations for <b>raw</b> <b>jute</b> reduce farmers'welfare only slightly because farmers'activities are typically diversified and jute's share in total income is small. Although stocking operations by the parastatals contribute to stability in prices and real income, they have been extremely costly and have crowded out private stocking. The authors contend that if the parastatals had refrained from ad hoc stocking and if the private sector had stocked efficiently, jute prices and incomes would have been just as stable - and at no cost. They argue that the Bangladeshi jute market should be free of government intervention and that a a market-based credit system that allows efficient stockholding behavior by the private sector should be established. They also found that improving the flow of market information to farmers and greater price responsiveness by jute mills to <b>raw</b> <b>jute</b> purchases would significantly improve the stability of <b>raw</b> <b>jute</b> prices and incomes.

C), T 2 (field sanitation with rouging), T 3 (Hanging of polythene strips), T 4 (extra dose of nitrogen) and T 5 (control) were assigned randomly having four replications. T 2 and T 4 showed best performance on all the parameters including leaf mosaic of jute. However, the highest yield of <b>raw</b> <b>jute</b> 3091. 5 kg ha - 1 and stick 5709. 6 ha - 1 was obtained from T 4 and the second highest 2541. 6 kg ha - 1 of <b>raw</b> <b>jute</b> and 5039. 1 kg ha - 1 of stick were obtained in T 2. A combination of collection and use of seeds from healthy plants, one insecticidal spray around 30 days after emergence (DAE), combined with field sanitation with rouging several times in the growth period and application of an extra booster dose of nitrogen at around 45 DAE may be prescribed to farmers of Mymensingh region of Bangladesh...|$|E
