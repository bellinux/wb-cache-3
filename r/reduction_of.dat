5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a {{secondary}} role in olfaction, which {{may account for the}} size <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft {{in the middle of the}} wet nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth.

We prove analogous generic exchange theorems for minimal <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> an ideal, minimal complete <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> a set of ideals, and minimal complete <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> multigraded k-algebras. Finally, we unify all these results into a common axiomatic framework by introducing a new topological-combinatorial structure we call a generic matroid, which is a common generalization of a topological space and a matroid...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} for deriving truss structures with reduced part count from the octahedral-tetrahedral (octet) truss by removal of struts and nodes is described. The technique {{is based on}} an understanding of the geometry and symmetry of the octet truss. Six example reduced-part-count structures are analyzed and compared with the parent octet truss with regard to part count, redundancy, mass, and free-free fundamental frequency. Part count <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> 12 to 37 percent, mass <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> 7 to 33 percent, and fundamental frequency <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> 18 to 30 percent are demonstrated. Increases in strut cross-sectional area and truss depth are considered for the purpose of increasing the stiffness of the reduced structures...|$|R
40|$|Complimentary {{geometric}} and non-geometric consistent <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> IIB supergravity are studied.

Examples of such compactifications are considered and the symmetry breaking in each case is analysed. Complimentary to the reductions on X are the nine-dimensional S-duality twisted reductions considered {{in the second half of}} the paper. The general reduced theory is given and symmetry breaking is investigated. The non-geometric S-duality twisted reductions and their relation to geometric <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> F-Theory on X is briefly discussed...|$|R
5|$|Some of {{the causes}} of {{deliberate}} self-poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included bereavement and harsh discipline by parents. The coping mechanisms are being spread in local communities as people are surrounded by others who have previously deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide. One way of reducing self-harm would be to limit access to poisons; however many cases involve pesticides or yellow oleander seeds, and the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> access to these agents would be difficult. Great potential for the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> self-harm lies in education and prevention, but limited resources in the developing world make these methods challenging.|$|E

The withdrawal programme intensified after boundary changes on the Southern Region placed the lines west of Salisbury under Western Region control in 1963. Class members based at Exmouth Junction shed were withdrawn in 1964, whilst the Southern Region's allocation was gradually replaced by Bulleid's Light Pacifics. The last operational members of the class were Nos.31405 and31408; both were withdrawn in June 1966.|$|E
