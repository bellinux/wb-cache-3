5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, {{who says that}} Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines {{what it would be like}} if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the Coast Guard cutter Chase took over, escorting the KD II to San Diego. Along {{the way the}} {{investigation}} continued. The Coast Guard reported that the four-man crew was cooperative with {{the investigation}}, largely sitting back and watching television in the lounge. Since they claimed not to have finned the sharks themselves, they believed they had not done anything wrong. Ship's records revealed that the KD II had met fishing vessels, primarily Korean longline fishing boats, at prearranged locations {{on the high seas}} near the Fiji and Solomon Islands and bought fins from them for a total of $250,000. On an earlier voyage that summer, the ship had made $6 million from shark fins obtained the same way. Korean-language records from a broker on board indicated an ongoing operation, giving the names of other ships involved. The <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> on board had broken before the ship had left Honolulu, and the fins were out on deck in an attempt to dry them out and reduce the odor.|$|E

Only four of these vehicles were ever made, but they included swiveling seats, a sofa, and even a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit,</b> with an overall sleek-looking design.

25|$|The new {{refrigerating}} technology {{first met}} with widespread industrial {{use as a}} means to freeze meat supplies for transport by sea in reefer ships from the British Dominions and other countries to the British Isles. The first to achieve this breakthrough was an entrepreneur who had emigrated to New Zealand. William Soltau Davidson thought that Britain's rising population and meat demand could mitigate the slump in world wool markets that was heavily affecting New Zealand. After extensive research, he commissioned the Dunedin to be refitted with a compression <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> for meat shipment in 1881. On February 15, 1882, the Dunedin sailed for London with what was to be the first commercially successful refrigerated shipping voyage, and the foundation of the refrigerated meat industry.|$|E
25|$|Sea Shepherd's Coronado and David Howitt {{flew into}} Reykjavík in October 1986. Howitt {{has also been}} named as David Howard, Nick Taylor or Martin Braidley. The pair stayed at a youth hostel and began covertly {{investigating}} the local whaling industry {{and it has been}} reported that they posed as tourists and took jobs at a fish factory. On 8 November, they traveled 50miles to the nation's only whale processing station in Hvalfjörður, where they broke in at 8:00pm. Sledgehammers, wrenches, and other common tools were used to systematically destroy computers, power generators, machinery, and windows. The large <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> used to freeze the season's catch was destroyed beyond repair and documentation at the facility was doused with acid. The main factory and two smaller buildings were left inoperable.|$|E
500|$|The venue has a {{floor area}} of [...] and {{a volume of}} [...] The hall has a spectator {{capacity}} of 10,600 people, of which 2,000 can be seated. During the Olympics, this included 250 VIP seats, 250 press seats and 100 commentator seats. Access to the inner ring can be provided via an underpass. Lighting is provided at 1,400 lux, while the venue has a ventilation system capable of both heating and cooling, as well as de-moisturizing, and both re-use and circulation of air. The <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> uses an ammonia and saline solution, which is transported in pipes within the concrete, which allows for an ice temperature of between −5.5and −6.5degrees Celsius (22and 20°F). The heat from the refrigerating unit can be reused.|$|E

500|$|A log is kept with {{information}} about the core, including its length and the depth it was retrieved from, and the core may be marked to show its orientation. [...] It is usually cut into shorter sections, the standard length in the US being one metre. [...] The cores are then stored on site, usually in a space below snow level to simplify temperature maintenance, though additional refrigeration can be used. [...] If more drilling fluid must be removed, air may be blown over the cores. [...] Any samples needed for preliminary analysis are taken. [...] The core is then bagged, often in polythene, and stored for shipment. [...] Additional packing, including padding material, is added. [...] When the cores are flown from the drilling site, the aircraft's flight deck is unheated to help maintain a low temperature; when they are transported by ship they must be kept in a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, the Northern Pacific Railroad {{ordered a}} number of {{modified}} covered hopper cars from American Car and Foundry for transporting perishable food in bulk. The -long [...] cars were blanketed {{with a layer of}} insulation, equipped with roof hatches for loading, and had centerflow openings along the bottom for fast discharge.

2500|$|Refrigeration is {{the process}} of {{removing}} heat from an enclosed space, or from a substance, and moving it to a place where it is unobjectionable. The primary purpose of refrigeration is lowering the temperature of the enclosed space or substance and then maintaining that lower temperature. The American inventor Oliver Evans, acclaimed as the [...] "father of refrigeration", invented the vapor-compression refrigeration machine in 1805. Heat would be removed from the environment by recycling vaporized refrigerant, where it would move through a compressor and condenser, where it would eventually revert to a liquid form in order to repeat the refrigeration process over again. However, no such <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> was built by Evans. In 1834, Jacob Perkins modified Evans' original design, building the world's first refrigerator and filing the first legal patent for refrigeration using vapor-compression. John Gorrie, an American doctor from Florida, invented the first mechanical <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> in 1841, based on Evans' original invention to make ice in order to cool the air for yellow fever patients. Gorrie's mechanical <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> was issued a patent in 1851. American professor Alexander C. Twining of Cleveland, Ohio patented an early vapor-compression refrigerator in 1853 that was fully capable of producing a ton of ice per day. In 1913, refrigerators for home and domestic use were invented by Fred W. Wolf of Fort Wayne, Indiana with models consisting of a unit that was mounted on top of an ice box. A self-contained refrigerator, with a compressor {{on the bottom of the}} cabinet was invented by Alfred Mellowes in 1916. Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but was bought out by William C. Durant in 1918, who started the Frigidaire Company in order to begin the first mass-production of refrigerators.|$|E

2500|$|General Electric (GE) {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{companies}} to overcome these challenges. In 1911 GE released a household <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> that was powered by gas. The use of gas eliminated the need for an electric compressor motor and decreased the size of the refrigerator. However, electric companies that were customers of GE did not benefit from a gas-powered unit. [...] Thus, GE invested in developing an electric model. In 1927, GE released the Monitor Top, the first refrigerator to run on electricity.|$|E

It was claimed in 2002 that, if animals were being transported, temperatures on the Tube would break European Commission animal welfare laws. A 2000 study reported that air quality was seventy-three times worse than at street level, with a passenger breathing the same mass of particulates during a twenty-minute journey on the Northern line as when smoking a cigarette. The main purpose of the London Underground's ventilation fans is to extract hot air from the tunnels, and fans across the network are being refurbished, although complaints of noise from local residents preclude their use at full power at night.|$|E
