5|$|Land mine: Textual {{evidence}} suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (huo pao) to kill Mongol soldiers invading Guangxi in 1277. However, the first detailed description of the land mine was given in the Huolongjing text written by Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the late Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) and early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of cast iron, and their fuses ignited by a <b>mechanism</b> <b>tripped</b> by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this <b>trip</b> <b>mechanism</b> in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground weights to fall and spin a chord around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a flint to spark a train of fuses.|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of multiphase steels assisted by transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP steels) undergoing low cycle, fully-reversed strain-controlled deformations is studied {{by means of}} numerical simulations based on micromechanical models. The ferritic phase is simulated using a single-crystal elasto-plasticity model for BCC crystals whereas the austenitic phase, which may transform into martensite, is simulated by a crystallographic phase transformation model coupled to a single-crystal elasto-plasticity model for FCC crystals. The influence of the <b>TRIP</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the overall {{behavior of}} the steel is investigated for selected variations of microstructural properties such as phase morphology, local carbon concentration in the austenite and austenitic grain size. The results of the simulations show a strong initial hardening associated to the martensitic transformation in accordance with experimental results. The simulations indicate an asymmetric hardening behavior under extension and contraction, particularly for large austenitic volume fractions and lower carbon concentrations. © 2010 Elsevier B.

50|$|Four {{different}} {{mechanisms of}} pollen release are known in papilionaceous flowers, which are respectively {{known as the}} explosive, valvular, piston and brush mechanisms. In the explosive or <b>tripping</b> <b>mechanism</b> (cf. alfalfa, common broom, ox-eye bean) all pollen is instantly released when pressure on the staminal column is permanently released (usually by an insect) causing it to snap against the standard petal. In the valvular mechanism pollen is released repeatedly when pollinators unseal the upper rim of the keel petals, and force them downwards. In the piston mechanism (cf. scorpion senna) pollen is released repeatedly when the keel tip is moved by an insect so as to release pollen {{through a hole in}} the tip. The brush mechanism employs a pistil which is longer than the stamens, so as to avoid self-pollination. When a pollinator presses against the standard and wing petals, a brush on the temporarily lifted pistil brushes pollen onto the pollinator, while the stigma receives external pollen.|$|R
50|$|The {{first problem}} is {{resolved}} {{by the use of}} circuit breakers—devices that can be reset after they have broken current flow. In modern systems that use less than about 10 kW, miniature circuit breakers are typically used. These devices combine the mechanism that initiates the trip (by sensing excess current) as well as the mechanism that breaks the current flow in a single unit. Some miniature circuit breakers operate {{solely on the basis of}} electromagnetism. In these miniature circuit breakers, the current is run through a solenoid, and, in the event of excess current flow, the magnetic pull of the solenoid is sufficient to force open the circuit breaker's contacts (often indirectly through a <b>tripping</b> <b>mechanism).</b> A better design however arises by inserting a bimetallic strip before the solenoid—this means that instead of always producing a magnetic force, the solenoid only produces a magnetic force when the current is strong enough to deform the bimetallic strip and complete the solenoid's circuit.|$|R
50|$|In the 1840s and 50s, {{there were}} {{attempts}} {{to overcome this}} problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate, variable cutoff expansion valve riding {{on the back of}} the main slide valve; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff. The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by <b>trip</b> <b>mechanisms</b> or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|Single-revolution {{clutches}} {{were developed}} in the 19th century to power machinery such as shears or presses where a single pull of the operating lever or (later) press of a button would <b>trip</b> the <b>mechanism,</b> engaging the clutch between the power source and the machine's crankshaft for exactly one revolution before disengaging the clutch. When the clutch is disengaged and the driven member is stationary. Early designs were typically dog clutches with a cam on the driven member used to disengage the dogs at the appropriate point.|$|R

25|$|Once a {{fault is}} detected, the circuit breaker {{contacts}} must open {{to interrupt the}} circuit; This is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the contacts. Circuit breakers may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, such as thermal expansion or a magnetic field. Small circuit breakers typically have a manual control lever to switch off the load or reset a tripped breaker, while larger units use solenoids to <b>trip</b> the <b>mechanism,</b> and electric motors to restore energy to the springs.|$|R
40|$|Apios (Apios americana; “apios”), a {{tuberous}} perennial legume in the Phaseoleae tribe, {{was widely}} {{used as a}} food by Native Americans. Work in the last 40 years has led to several improved breeding lines. Aspects of the pollination biology (complex floral structure and <b>tripping</b> <b>mechanism)</b> have made controlled crosses difficult, and the previous reports indicated that the plant is likely primarily an outcrosser. We used a pseudo-testcross strategy to construct a genetic map specific to the maternal parent. The map was built using single-nucleotide polymorphism markers identified by comparing the expressed sequences of individuals in the mapping population against a de novo maternal reference transcriptome assembly. The apios map consists of 11 linkage groups and 1121 recombinationally distinct loci, covering ~ 938. 6 cM. By sequencing the transcriptomes of all potential pollen parents, {{we were able to}} identify the probable pollen donors and to discover new aspects of the pollination biology in apios. No selfing was observed, but multiple pollen parents were seen within individual pods. Comparisons with genome sequences in other species in the Phaseoleae showed extended synteny for most apios linkage groups. This synteny supports the robustness of the map, and also sheds light {{on the history of the}} Phaseoleae, as apios is relatively early diverging in this tribe. We detected a translocation event that separates apios and two Vigna species from Phaseolus vulgaris and Glycine max.
