Arriving in the region after the ceasefire of the Gulf War, Merrill became the flagship for the coalition minesweeping forces in the Persian Gulf and was the second warship to visit the liberated port of Kuwait City after the Iraqi invasion. 1992 found Merrill underway on a counter-narcotics deployment in the Central America area of operations. In September 1992 Merrill was sent to Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul which lasted into late 1993. This overhaul consisted of upgrades to the control panels of the radar systems, an entire level added to the ship to contain previously installed CIWS control computers, and most importantly, <b>RAM</b> (Radar Absorbent <b>Material)</b> {{was added to the}} entire ship, a first for a destroyer. Upon receiving notice of the planned closure of Long Beach, The USS Merrill relocated to San Diego Naval Base in 1994 and spent the next few months as a test platform in deployment for the <b>RAM</b> <b>material,</b> which was designed to make the ship appear as small as a tug boat on radars.|$|R

The humidity buffering potential of stabilised <b>rammed</b> earth <b>materials</b> is investigated based on the moisture buffer value concept. The moisture buffer value is (a) measured experimentally, (b) calculated from an analytical solution of the mass transfer and (c) simulated using a numerical solution of the combined heat and mass transfer. The numerical solution to the equations is described, as well as the modelling tool termed ‘CHAMP’ (coupled heat and mass transport in porous media). The results show that stabilised rammed earth can be a ‘good’ moisture buffering material under the Nordtest classification scheme. They also show that the moisture buffer value of stabilised <b>rammed</b> earth <b>materials</b> could be optimised or maximised by controlling the grading and mineralogy of the sub-soil and the manufacturing techniques. Sensitivity analysis of the moisture buffer value to the moisture transfer resistance at the surface is explored through numerical simulation and the need to control the experimental measurement carefully is explored...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the pathological effects of experimental trypanosomosis on the semen collection reaction time and spermatozoa morphology of Yankasa <b>rams.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: Twelve apparently healthy Yankasa rams aging 24 - 30 months and weighing 22 - 25 Kg were randomly selected and were distributed into four (4) groups. Groups I and II were challenged with experimental Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Federe strain) and T. evansi (Sokoto strain) respectively, while group III was challenged with both T. brucei brucei and T. evansi parasites. Group IV was left as uninfected control. Each infected ram received 2 mL of the infected blood containing 2 x 106 trypomastigotes via the jugular vein. The animals were examined for clinical observations, reaction time for semen collection and abnormalities in the morphology of the spermatozoa. Results: Infection of rams with trypanosomes showed scrotal edema, scrotal atrophy, loss of libido, increased semen collection reaction time, and significant increase of spermatozoa morphological abnormalities in all the infected rams. The rams especially in groups I and III were all deemed unfit for breeding {{by the end of the}} 98 days post infection, while the uninfected rams remained as healthy and had normal values of sperm morphology throughout the study period. Conclusion: Single or mixed interaction with T. brucei brucei or T. evansi is capable of causing infertility and reproductive failure in Yankasa rams.

40|$|In {{a modern}} battlefield, Radar {{has emerged as}} an {{important}} sensor for the detection and targeting of enemy military assets. In order to survive and maintain military effectiveness over a sustained period, {{it is crucial to}} ensure low-observability and camouflage of own war fighting resources. The frequency band of operation for most of the present day radar sensors is 8 to 18 GHz, though millimeter wave radars are also likely to emerge in the near future. Traditionally, the camouflage against radar sensor is achieved through the use of radar absorbing <b>materials</b> (<b>RAM).</b> These <b>materials</b> absorb most of the incident radar energy thereby minimizing the reflected signal, and thus avoiding radar detection. Another technique for achieving the same end result is through the use of radar reflective materials. The idea is to randomly scatter the incident radar energy in different directions and minimize backscatter, thus avoiding detection. The paper investigates the radar reflective approach for achieving low-observability and camouflage. A series of experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of this approach. The experimental results indicate greater than 10 dB radar signal attenuation, which corresponds to an RCS reduction of more than 90 %. In addition to the radar reflective properties, the camouflage material can also be coated with low emissivity paints having different colour schemes. This can result into a unified multi-spectral camouflage against Radar, IR, Thermal and Optical sensors...|$|R
