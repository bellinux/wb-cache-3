5|$|The {{tinamous}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the <b>rheas,</b> emus, and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger {{created a}} new family for the genus Didus. He named the family Inepti, and in it {{included}} only Didus ineptus, now a synonym of Raphus cucullatus. Illiger concluded that the dodo was related to ostriches and <b>rheas,</b> and so placed Inepti in the order Rasores, as the sister family to Gallinacei, Epollicati (a defunct group including Turnix and Syrrhaptes), Columbini , and Crypturi.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{can suffer}} from both {{external}} and internal parasites, but under farmed conditions are more parasite-free than ostriches or <b>rheas.</b> External parasites include the louse Dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other lice, ticks, mites and flies. Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu {{as well as a}} wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; Syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and Cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.|$|E

5|$|The Beagle now {{sailed to}} {{southern}} Patagonia, and on 19 April an expedition including FitzRoy and Darwin {{set off to}} take boats {{as far as possible}} up the Santa Cruz river, with all involved taking turn in teams dragging the boats upstream. The river cut through a series of rises then plateaux forming wide plains covered with shells and shingle, and Darwin discussed with FitzRoy his interpretation that these terraces had been shores that had gradually raised in accordance with Lyell's theories. Several of the smaller <b>rheas</b> were seen in the distance, but were too elusive to catch. The expedition approached the Andes but had to turn back.|$|E
25|$|The natural predators {{of adult}} greater <b>rheas</b> {{are limited to}} the cougar (Puma concolor), which are found in most areas {{inhabited}} by greater <b>rheas</b> and are certain to be their leading predator, and the jaguar (Panthera onca), which are found with greater <b>rheas</b> and opportunistically hunt them in the Paraguayan chaco, central Bolivia and the Brazilian cerrado. Feral dogs are known to kill younger birds, and the southern caracara (Caracara plancus) is suspected to prey on hatchlings. Armadillos sometimes feed on greater rhea eggs; nests have been found which had been undermined by a six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus) or a big hairy armadillo (Chaetophractus villosus) and the rhea eggs were broken apart. Predation on young <b>rheas</b> has also been reportedly committed by greater grisons (Galictis vittata).|$|E
25|$|Greater <b>rheas</b> have a fluffy, tattered-looking plumage, that is gray or brown, {{with high}} {{individual}} variation, The head, neck, rump, and thighs are feathered. In general, males are darker than females. Even in the wildparticularly in Argentinaleucistic individuals (with white body plumage and blue eyes) {{as well as}} albinos occur. Hatchling greater <b>rheas</b> are grey with dark lengthwise stripes.|$|E

40|$|In Streptomyces albus, Hsp 18, {{a protein}} {{belonging}} {{to the family of}} small heat-shock proteins, can be detected only at high temperature. Disruption of orfY, located upstream and in the opposite orientation to hsp 18, resulted in an elevated level of hsp 18 mRNA at low temperature. Genetic and biochemical experiments indicated that the product of orfY, now called <b>RheA</b> (Repressor of hsp eighteen), directly represses hsp 18. In Escherichia coli, an hsp 18 H–bgaB transcriptional fusion was repressed in a strain expressing S. albus <b>RheA.</b> DNA-binding experiments with crude extracts of E. coli overproducing <b>RheA</b> indicated that <b>RheA</b> interacts specifically with the hsp 18 promoter. Transcription analysis of <b>rheA</b> in the S. albus wild-type and in <b>rheA</b> mutant strains suggested that <b>RheA</b> represses transcription not only of hsp 18 but also of <b>rheA</b> itself...|$|R

25|$|Farmers {{sometimes}} {{consider the}} greater rhea pests, {{because they will}} eat broad-leaved crop plants, such as cabbage, chard and bok choy. Where they occur as pests, farmers tend to hunt and kill greater <b>rheas.</b> The burning of crops in South America has also contributed to their decline.|$|E
25|$|The common ostrich {{belongs to}} the ratite order Struthioniformes. Other members include <b>rheas,</b> emus, cassowaries, moa, kiwi and the largest known bird ever, the now-extinct {{elephant}} bird (Aepyornis). However, the classification of the ratites as a single order has always been questioned, with the alternative classification restricting the Struthioniformes to the ostrich lineage and elevating the other groups.|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} farmed in North America and Europe {{similar to the}} emu and ostrich. The main {{products}} are meat and eggs, but rhea oil is used for cosmetics and soaps and rhea leather is also traded in quantity. Male greater <b>rheas</b> are very territorial during the breeding season. The infant chicks have high mortality in typical confinement farming situations, but under optimum free-range conditions chicks will reach adult size by their fifth month.|$|E

25|$|The tinamou {{family has}} been shown to be monophyletic. Phylogenomic studies have placed it as the sister group to Australasian and Oceanian ratites (i.e. the cassowaries, emus, and kiwis), thus {{locating}} it well within the ratite phylogenetic tree, with the South American <b>rheas</b> and African ostriches as successive outgroups. Research published starting in 2010 has found that tinamous are the sister group to the extinct moa of New Zealand; moa are more distantly related to emus and cassowaries than had been thought previously. These findings imply that evolution of flightlessness occurred independently multiple times in ratite evolution.|$|E
25|$|The guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the cougar, the Patagonian fox (Lycalopex griseus), the Patagonian hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus humboldtii), and the Magellanic {{tuco-tuco}} (Ctenomys magellanicus; a subterranean rodent) are {{the most}} characteristic mammals of the Patagonian plains. The Patagonian steppe {{is one of the}} last strongholds of the guanaco and Darwin's <b>rheas</b> (Rhea pennata), which had been hunted for their skins by the Tehuelches, on foot using boleadoras, before the diffusion of firearms and horses; they were formerly the chief means of subsistence for the natives, who hunted them on horseback with dogs and bolas. Vizcachas (Lagidum spp.) and the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum) are also characteristic of the steppe and the Pampas to the north.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous are {{exclusively}} neotropical and all 47 species live in South America, Mexico, and Central America. The {{range of}} the northernmost species extends to Mexico but not much further north than the Tropic of Cancer. Chilean tinamous have been introduced to Easter Island. The greatest concentration of species is in the tropics, {{and in particular the}} Amazon Basin. In the north, they tend to be forest or woodland birds, while in the south they prefer open habitats. Tinamous form the dominant group of terrestrial birds in South America, where they largely replace the Galliformes ecologically, with no other bird family there having comparable diversity, distribution, or suite of habitat adaptations. <b>Rheas</b> are only found in open country, curassows and guans are generally limited to forests, and the pheasant family is only represented by a few species in the north of the region.|$|E

However, Martin still loves <b>Rhea</b> and declines her offer. Desperate to make Martin happy, <b>Rhea</b> next arranges for him to catch her faking a fondness for Wesley. Taken in by the ruse, Martin finally agrees to a divorce. Maysie then moves in to take over Martin's household, and <b>Rhea,</b> instead of taking up with Wesley, moves to a sanitarium, where she falls {{deeper and deeper into}} depression. Realizing that <b>Rhea</b> is fast losing the will to live, her doctor finds her an orphaned infant to care for, and the baby gives <b>Rhea</b> new meaning to her life. Martin meanwhile stumbles across <b>Rhea's</b> diary at his house and learns from it that she never really cared for Wesley Strange and that when he saw them together it was all a ruse to get him to agree to a divorce.

25|$|In {{fields and}} {{plantations}} of plants {{they do not}} like to eat, e.g., cereals or eucalyptus, the greater rhea can be a species quite beneficial to farmers. It will eat any large invertebrate it can catch; its food includes locusts and grasshoppers, true bugs, cockroaches, and other pest insects. Juveniles eat more animal matter than adults. In mixed cerrado and agricultural land in Minas Gerais (Brazil), R. a. americana was noted to be particularly fond of beetles. It is not clear whether this applies to the species in general but for example in pampas habitat, beetle consumption is probably lower simply due to availability while Orthoptera might be more important. The greater rhea is able to eat Hymenoptera in quantity. These insects contain among them many who can give painful stings, though the birds do not seem to mind. Sometimes, greater <b>rheas</b> will gather at carrion to feed on flies; they are also known to eat dead or dying fish in the dry season, but as vertebrate prey in general not in large quantities.|$|E
500|$|By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his Red Notebook on the {{possibility}} that [...] "one species does change into another" [...] to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the <b>rheas,</b> and extinct ones such as the strange Macrauchenia, which resembled a giant guanaco.
