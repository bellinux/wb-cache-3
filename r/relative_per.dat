In this study we analysed how the same <b>relative</b> spaces <b>per</b> player, obtained through manipulations of player numbers and field dimensions, influenced inter-individual coordination. The positional data (GPS, 10 Hz) of 24 U- 15 yrs performing in three different <b>relative</b> spaces <b>per</b> player (118, 133 and 152 m 2) was used. Inter-individual behavioural measures included: (i) effective <b>relative</b> space <b>per</b> player, (ii) radius of free movement; (iii) numerical relations inside each player’s <b>relative</b> space <b>per</b> player; and (iv) players’ spatial distribution variability. Magnitude-based inferences were used to analyse the practical significance of the selected variables. Results showed that manipulations of player numbers elicited more free space {{in the vicinity of}} each player. However, more advantageous numerical relations adjacent to each individual player and broader individual spatial distributions on field were observed during manipulations of field dimensions. These findings highlight the complex nature of performance behaviours captured by the co-adaptation of players to surrounding spatial constraints.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the validity of}} stochastic convergence hypothesis in <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita CO 2 emissions in OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries for the period 1960 - 2013. In other words, it is aimed to reveal the nature of shocks to <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita CO 2 emissions. As such, divergence holds if shocks are permanent, whereas convergence holds if shocks are temporary. To that aim, the two-break LM (Lagrange multiplier) and three-step RALS-LM (residual augmented least squares Lagrange multiplier) unit root tests are employed. The results mostly provide evidence of convergence in case of two breaks. However, when structural breaks are not taken into consideration, divergence gains empirical validity. From the viewpoint of government policy, {{these results indicate that}} energy usage or environmental protection policies of OECD countries have not long-run impacts on the <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita emissions series of the sample countries. Concerning the break dates, the first breaks mostly cumulated around the two energy crises period, whereas the second breaks generally occurred in the 1990...|$|E
40|$|There are {{currently}} {{two ways of}} estimating relative levels of per capita income back to the nineteenth century. The most commonly adopted approach, popularized in particular by Angus Maddison and labeled "long-span" estimates by Marianne Ward and John Devereux, is to use time-series projection from a recent benchmark. (1) The alternative procedure, labeled "direct estimates" by Ward and Devereux, is to use direct benchmark estimates for earlier years. Ward and Devereux provide some new "direct estimates" which they claim over-turn the conventional chronology of U. K. /U. S. <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita income levels for the period 1870 - 1990, derived using "long-span" projections. One important purpose of this note is to dispute the new estimates, and hence to reassert the conventional chronology. Along the way, however, I wish also to make a more general methodological point {{about the use of}} time series projections and direct benchmark estimates of <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita income levels. In my view, it is unsatisfactory for researchers to note a large discrepancy and simply claim the superiority of one type of evidence over the other. Rather, a satisfactory account of the evolution of <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita incomes over a long period should be able to encompass both sorts of evidence...|$|E
40|$|Economists {{have long}} {{investigated}} theoretically and empirically {{the relationship between}} government spending and equilibrium real exchange rates. As Frenkel and Razin (1996) summarize for a small open economy, government expenditures (financed by lump-sum taxes) influence real exchange rates via a resource-withdrawal channel and a consumption-tilting channel. Recent theoretical and empirical studies, such as Froot and Rogoff (1991), Rogoff (1992), De Gregorio, Giovannini, and Krueger (1994), De Gregorio, Giovannini, and Wolf (1994), De Gregorio and Wolf (1994), and Chinn and Johnston (1996), have focused only upon the effects of government spending through the resource-withdrawal channel. Extending Frenkel and Razin (1996), this paper generates closed-form theoretical solutions for the relationships among the real exchange rate, <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita private consumption, <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita government consumption, and <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita tradables and nontradables production in a two-country general equilibrium model. Using relative price level, private and government per capita consumption, and relative productivity data from the Summers and Heston (1991) Penn World Tables and OECD (1 996) data for a sample of OECD countries relative to the United States, we estimate the model 2 ̆ 7 s structural equations. The results suggest that government expenditures influence equilibrium real exchange rates approximately equally via the resource-withdrawal and consumption-tilting channels. Moreover, the results imply that government spending and private consumption are complements in utility...|$|E

40|$|Respiration {{measurements}} of whole tree {{plants have been}} reported that give evidence that the <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> volume/mass unit respiration decreases with increase of tree body size. In this study, based on the available data published a question was explored if the <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> area unit respiration in trees can be a constant, independent of the surface area size. There is a definite gap in the published data when the allometric studies of tree body structure do not intercept with studies on trees respiration. Thus the question was studied {{with the help of}} indirect comparison between various data. The comparison showed that the scaling exponents, volume vs. surface area and respiration vs. stem volume, are slightly larger than they should be for the hypothesis of the relative respiration constancy to hold. The data studied give evidence that the <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> area unit respiration slightly increases with the increase in tree surface area. Possible explanations of the relationship include a different distribution of metabolically active parts of stem and higher nitrogen content in larger trees. Also, the published datasets might include large fast growing trees, which imply that larger trees grow faster and hence have higher per unit surface area growth respiration. A crucial experiment is required in which the respiration measurements were performed for the same data as the {{measurements of}} scaling between stem volume and surface area.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} stochastic convergence hypothesis of per capita carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions is supported {{in countries with}} {{the same level of}} development – that is, are shocks to <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita CO 2 emissions temporary in industrialized countries? We respond to this question by utilizing the recently developed Lagrange Multiplier (LM) unit root test that endogenously determines structural breaks in level and trend as proposed by Lee and Strazicich (2003, 2004). Our empirical findings provide significant evidence that <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita CO 2 emissions for 21 OECD countries stochastically converge when we control for breaks in the period 1960 – 2000. Structural breaks are identified in each country, and overall we find that most breakpoints occur around the two energy crises and in the 1990 s. The robust test clearly also indicates that most original per capita CO 2 emissions and average series are stationary. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{an article}} in the Wall Street Journal, Arthur Laffer argued that, since 1960, the {{introduction}} of state income taxes reduced the relative size of a state’s gross state product and its <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita personal income. This paper criticizes Laffer’s conclusions on a number of grounds. 1. He uses incorrect figures for per capita income. In fact, <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita income rose in a majority of states that introduced an income tax since 1960. 2. The results are not clear when a state’s data is compared to other states in its region, rather than to the United States as a whole. Since many of the states that introduced an income tax were hard-hit by the decline in the economy (such as Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia), the comparison to the United States as a whole is misleading. 3. Even if the data were accurate, the argument for causation would be quite weak because so many other factors affect a state’s economic health...|$|E

40|$|Most Latin American {{countries}} experienced {{their last}} peak in output per capita {{relative to the}} United States ’ between 1971 and 1982. Prior to this peak per capita output was rapidly catching up to the developed world. Twenty years after the peak the average country’s <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita output was 68 % of its peak level. A growth accounting exercise shows that between 1960 and 1985 the contribution of physical capital to growth, at 74 %, was {{more than twice the}} world’s average. There is an investment/productivity puzzle since capital accumulation was {{among the highest in the}} world and productivity growth one of the lowest. Import Substitution Industrialization and targeted investment subsidies may be the key to understanding Latin America’s lack of development. The theory of economic growth predicts that poor countries should grow faster than richer ones so that their living standards converge. In the last half of the twentieth century, many market economies in different regions of the world (such as Western and Southern Europe and East Asia) have indeed enjoyed remarkable growth experiences significantly reducing their development gap. Latin American countries on the other hand have stagnated relative to the productive frontier represented by the US until the 1970 ’s. Thereafter, their economies collapsed. This paper is about Latin America’s growth performance in the last fifty years. Its goal is modest as it only seeks to describe Latin America’s development patterns in this period. Explaining the facts described here is a challenge faced by Latin American social scientists. This study of Latin America’s development experience is based on a com-parative analysis of <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita income across the world over the period following 1950 and a subsequent growth accounting exercise that relates the evolution of <b>relative</b> <b>per</b> capita income to that of the accumulation of human and physical capital, as well as to the rate of growth of total factor productivity.
