A separate cancer institute is also operated in Varanasi. The Varanasi Hospital, established in 1964 by Dr. Baijnath Prasad. The hospital, which in 2012 had 66 beds, serves Varanasi and surrounding districts and states, many of which <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> for surgery. Although the hospital suffers {{from a lack of}} funding, it has facilities such as x-ray, ultrasonography, echocardiography and a pathology lab. The urban portion of Varanasi District had an infant mortality rate of 70 per 1,000 live births in 2010–2011.|$|E
5|$|The Arab {{army was}} well-provisioned, with Arab {{accounts}} reporting high mounds of supplies {{piled up in}} their camp, and had even brought along wheat to sow and harvest the next year. The failure of the Arab navy to blockade the city, however, meant that the Byzantines too could ferry in provisions. In addition, the Arab army had already devastated the Thracian countryside during its march and could not <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> for foraging. The Arab fleet and the second Arab army, which operated in the Asian suburbs of Constantinople, were able to bring in limited supplies to Maslama's army. As the siege drew into winter, negotiations opened between the two sides, extensively reported by Arab sources but ignored by Byzantine historians. According to the Arab accounts, Leo continued to play a double game with the Arabs. One version claims that he tricked Maslama into handing over most of his grain supplies, while another claims that the Arab general was persuaded to burn them altogether, so as to show {{the inhabitants of the}} city that they faced an imminent assault and induce them to surrender. The winter of 718 was extremely harsh; snow covered the ground for over three months. As the supplies in the Arab camp ran out, a terrible famine broke out: the soldiers ate their horses, camels, and other livestock, and the bark, leaves and roots of trees. They swept the snow of the fields they had sown to eat the green shoots, and reportedly resorted to cannibalism and eating their own excrement. Consequently, the Arab army was ravaged by epidemics; with great exaggeration, the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon put the number of their dead of hunger and disease at 300,000.|$|E

25|$|Since cotton is {{somewhat}} salt and drought tolerant, {{this makes it}} an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As water resources get tighter around the world, economies that <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> face difficulties and conflict, as well as potential environmental problems. For example, improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan, where cotton is a major export. In {{the days of the}} Soviet Union, the Aral Sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation, largely of cotton, and now salination is widespread.|$|E
25|$|Digestive systems {{take many}} forms. There is a {{fundamental}} distinction between internal and external digestion. External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history, and most fungi still <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> In this process, enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, {{and some of the}} products diffuse back to the organism. Animals have a tube (gastrointestinal tract) in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled.|$|E

25|$|The Aleppo Codex, {{now known}} in Hebrew as Keter Aram Tsoba, {{is the oldest}} and most famous {{manuscript}} of the Bible. Written in Tiberias in the year 920, and annotated by Aaron ben Asher, it has become the most authoritative Biblical text in Jewish culture. The most famous halachic authority to <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> was Maimonides, in his exposition of the laws governing the writing of Torah scrolls in his codification of Jewish law (Mishneh Torah). After its completion, the Codex was brought to Jerusalem. Toward the end of the 11th century, it was stolen and taken to Egypt, where it was redeemed by the Jewish community of Cairo. At the end of the 14th century the Codex was taken to Aleppo, Syria (called by the Jews Aram Zobah, the biblical name of part of Syria)—this is the origin of the manuscript's modern name.|$|E
25|$|All {{species are}} found in a {{majority}} of sub-Saharan Africa in various woodland habitats such as rainforests, swamps, open savannahs, mountains, and sub-deserts. With {{the exception of the}} eland and sitatunga, spiral-horned antelopes are all browswers. All species forage on green foliage as well as rely on them for cover. During the dry seasons their diet consists mostly foliage from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs and herbs. They also supplement fruit, flowers, and fresh grass when the rainy season arrives. In response to living in dense cover, spiral-horned antelopes are able to move through the thickett by bounding, rushing, and dodging through the vegetation. Most species are water dependent though kudus and elands do not <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> as they live in more arid environments. Unlike most species of bovids, spiral-horned antelopes are primarily nocturnal though some species {{can be seen in the}} early morning and late afternoon. As with all species of antelope, spiral-horned antelopes (especially the young, the old and the weak) are susceptible to some of Africa's major predators, such as lions, leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs.|$|E
25|$|Among those {{targeted}} for recruitment by the Nanjing Nationalist Government and Japanese were former warlord {{officers of the}} 1911–1928 period. Due to the personal loyalty of Chinese troops to their commanders, several Nationalist Chinese generals that defected brought their armies over with them. Many Nationalist units defected on orders of Chiang Kai-shek {{in order to preserve}} them for the later war against the Chinese Communists that he knew he would fight after Japan's defeat. As a result, the Nanjing Army was never fully trusted due to its suspect loyalties and therefore received limited heavy weapons, but the worsening war situation for Japan meant that they had to <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> more often and thus Nanjing units were granted better equipment. These troops were mostly used for defending important locations and for combating Communist partisans. In addition, many local irregular units were raised as well, including militias, volunteer and rural guards, which were mainly formed in order to counter guerrilla fighters. However, their quality was very low due to their limited training and lack of arms, and they were regarded as unreliable.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{pilot-operated}} relief valve indicator light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve solenoid, thus implying that the pilot-operated relief valve was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> However, when things went wrong and the main relief valve stuck open, the unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving {{as they would have}} if the pilot-operated relief valve were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, the {{agricultural}} {{sector of the economy}} has been steadily shrinking but it remains {{an important part of the}} state's economy, as there are still a significant number of communities that <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Just under 20% of the working population of the state is involved in farming, ranching, fish farming or forestry. Land available for human exploitation outside of populated areas is divided between agriculture/grazing (45%) and forestry (55%). Agricultural and forestry lands are further subdivided by climate and the type of forest (conifer vs. rainforest). Roughly 70% of the state has a subtropical climate, providing ideal conditions for agriculture, in particular sugar cane, and most farming is done in the warmer areas. Sugar cane has been an important crop since colonial times and still is important today, although the percentage of land dedicated to it has decreased since the 1960s. Another important crop is rice. The production of rice in the state has fallen drastically, from a height of 100,000 tons annually to only 21,000 tons due to the reduction in cultivation areas and the high costs of production. The state still ranks sixth in its production. However, despite price and market protections, foreign rice is competing with Mexican grown rice, including rice produced in the state. Sorghum has replaced lost yields of sugar cane and rice to a certain extent, which has been encouraged by the government. One way the state tries to sell its more expensive products such as rice has been the registration of a trademark calledTradición Agrícola de Morelos (Morelos Agricultural Tradition) to identify products produced in the state on store shelves.|$|E

500|$|Under U.S. law {{and with}} rare exceptions, people (whether {{criminal}} suspects or defendants or not) {{have the right}} to remain silent as part of their right not to incriminate themselves under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

500|$|Although {{volunteer}} enthusiasm {{was essential}} to the Association's plans in the Harvest Campaign, it did not <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> at the higher levels; the state chairs were compensated, both by salary and commission. J.W.

Local volunteers organized Chamber of Commerce luncheons to sell coins throughout the South; chapters of the UDC purchased pieces to present to surviving Civil War veterans. [...] The quota for Florida was 175,000 coins, with each town and city apportioned its share. [...] Often, Kiwanis or Rotary groups underwrote local quotas. Mrs. N. Burton Bass of Atlanta {{was reported to be}} the leading seller, once disposing of 233 coins in an afternoon. A series of dance balls honored the UDC members who sold large numbers of pieces. [...] Nevertheless, Hyder and Colbert suggested that there was [...] "a general lack of more ladies such as Mrs. Bass"; many municipalities had trouble finding local chairs. Outside the South, sales were promoted by three professional publicists hired by the Association. To keep public interest high, the Association released Lukeman's conceptions for Stone Mountain, which were on a smaller scale than Borglum's. [...] Lukeman conceived a scaled-down concept, of the three Confederate leaders on horseback. Despite the campaign, sales were slower than expected. In late 1925, the Association offered Northern banks a commission of seven cents a coin; it is uncertain if any took up the offer.
