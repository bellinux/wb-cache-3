For this purpose, the thermometer housing is modelled as a full cylindrical element (with no inner hole), divided into four control volumes. Using the control volume method, the heat balance equations can be written {{for each of the}} nodes for each of the control volumes. Thus, for a known temperature {{in the middle of the}} cylindrical element, the distribution of temperature in three nodes and heat flux at the outer surface were obtained. For a known value of the heat transfer coefficient the temperature of the fluid can be calculated using the boundary condition. Additionally, results of experimental research are presented.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. One {{of the problems of}} natural gas pressure reduction stations (City Gate Stations; CGS) is blocking the gas passage due to reduction of temperature in the regulator. In order to prevent this problem, gas is heated in a gas heater before pressure dropping. The gas heater includes, gas passage pipes, intermediate fluid and hot fluid passage pipes. Hot fluid is combustion products of an atmospheric burner and has high thermal energy. Since utilizing of porous media technology has many advantages in combustion systems, the idea of applying this type of burners instead of conventional burners has been widely considered. In this study, replacing of an atmospheric burner with a porous burner in the gas heater of a CGS has been studied numerically. First, by modelling the gas heater with an atmospheric burner, the values of produced heat fluxes at the different equivalence ratios have been studied. The results of these simulations determine the condition which leads to maximum efficiency of combustion in the atmospheric burner. The results indicate that maximum thermal efficiency of the atmospheric burner is obtained in 60 percent of the primary air. In the next step, by modelling the gas heater with a porous burner at various sizes and various equivalence ratios, produced heat fluxes were calculated and compared with those of the atmospheric burner. According to the results, although the gas heater of the pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>station</b> has not been designed for a porous burner, but utilizing a porous burner instead of the atmospheric burner, causes the thermal performance of the heater to increase. The increase of thennal performance at lean equivalence ratios is higher. ej 201...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In most gas {{pressure}} <b>reduction</b> <b>stations,</b> natural {{gas pressure}} is reduced through the throttle valve. In regulators {{due to the}} Joule-Thompson effect, pressure drop causes temperature reduction. To refuse obstruction of pipelines, indirect water bath heaters warm flow natural gas before passing through regulator. In this paper Mahshahr CGS elected {{as a case study}} and thermal efficiency of heater installed in this station computed briefly. Results illustrate that heat losses from stack is the main factor in low efficient heater. To use the thermal energy of flue gases, a shell and tube heat exchanger is proposed to preheat inlet natural gas to heater. The specification of heater is calculated by considering some assumptions at first. Then the effect of using heat exchanger on fuel consumption in atmospheric burner of heater is studied. Results shows that using a heat exchanger can reduce total thermal needed energy from hater 1. 3 MJ in a year. This means that more than 141000 m 3 fuel is saved and it causes a significant economic saving and environmental pollution decreasing. Payback period of this proposal is 1. 2 years and net present value with interest rate of 14 % is positive after 2 years. Therefore by using a simple heat exchanger the efficiency of indirect water bath heater improves 11 %.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} modelling of coupled {{heat transfer}} and electricity generation in a thermoelectric generator designed for reliable island-mode power supply. The considered generator {{is a new}} concept of a low power supply (50 W) whose aim is to provide electricity for remote gas pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>stations</b> with the purpose to maintain the control and automation equipment. This equipment contributes to the system safety and minimizes the risk of unintended methane emissions. The thermoelectric generator is designed for reliable and maintenance-free operation and power supply. Natural gas is burned in a partially premixed burner and the flue gas heats the hot side of the thermoelectric generator. The combustion air cools the cold side of the thermoelectric generator, providing the temperature difference required for electricity generation occurring based on the Seebeck effect. The flow of air and flue gas through the system is driven by chimney draft. The developed model couples the heat transfer on the hot and the cold side, {{as well as the}} generation of electrical energy inside the thermoelectric modules. The model takes into account convection and conduction in the gas flow conduits and in finned heat exchangers of the cold and hot sides. The analysis demonstrates the relevance of design and operational parameters on the boundary temperatures of the thermoelectric modules. The obtained results will be used in further (ongoing) phase leading to the design and construction of a prototype electricity generator dedicated for island-mode supply...|$|R
