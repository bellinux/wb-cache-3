2500|$|... "Resistance" [...] (R) {{proteins}}, encoded by <b>R</b> <b>genes,</b> {{are widely}} present in plants and detect pathogens. These proteins contain domains {{similar to the}} NOD Like Receptors and Toll-like receptors utilized in animal innate immunity.

SAR involves the production of chemical messengers, such as salicylic acid or jasmonic acid. Some of these travel through the plant and signal other cells to produce defensive compounds to protect uninfected parts, e.g., leaves. [...] Salicylic acid itself, although indispensable for expression of SAR, is not the translocated signal responsible for the systemic response. Recent evidence indicates a role for jasmonates in transmission of the signal to distal portions of the plant. RNA silencing mechanisms are also important in the plant systemic response, as they can block virus replication. The jasmonic acid response, is stimulated in leaves damaged by insects, and involves the production of methyl jasmonate.|$|E

Computational analyses of the B 14 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> indicated high conservation in orthopoxviruses but no orthologues outside the Poxviridae. To characterize the B 14 protein, the B 14 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> was expressed in Escherichia coli and recombinant protein was purified and used to generate a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. This antiserum recognized a 15 kDa cytoplasmic protein in mammalian cells that were transfected with the B 14 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> or infected with VACV WR, but not from cells infected with a VACV mutant (vDB 14) from which the B 14 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> was deleted. Compared to wild-type and revertant virus controls, vDB 14 had normal growth kinetics in cell culture. The virulence of vDB 14 was assessed in two in vivo models. Mice infected intranasally with vDB 14 had similar weight loss compared to the controls, but in C 57 BL/ 6 mice infected intradermally vDB 14 induced a smaller lesion size compared with controls. Moreover, intradermal infection with vDB 14 caused an increased infiltration of cells into the infected lesion despite the smaller lesion size. Therefore, B 14 is an intracellular protein that is non-essential for virus replication in cell culture but contributes to virus virulence in vivo and affects the host response to infection...|$|R

A total of 838 subjects {{were included in the}} present study: 453 patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and 385 subjects with no skin cancer. The coding sequence of the human MC 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> was tested using single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis followed by sequencing of unknown variants. Risk of skin cancer dependent on the various MC 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> variants was estimated using the exposure odds ratio. We investigated whether subjects with MC 1 R variant alleles were at increased risk of developing nonmelanoma skin cancer and, if so, whether this increased risk was mediated by fair skin and red hair. A total of 27 MC 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> variants were found. The number of carriers of one, two, or three MC 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> variants was 379 (45. 2 %), 208 (24. 8 %), and 7 (0. 9 %), respectively. A strong association between MC 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> variants and fair skin and red hair was established, especially the variants Arg 151 Cys and Arg 160 Trp (P<. 0001). Carriers of two variant alleles were at increased risk for developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (odds ratio 3. 77; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 11 – 6. 78), nodular basal cell carcinoma (odds ratio 2. 26; 95 % CI 1. 45 – 3. 52), and superficial multifocal basal cell carcinoma (odds ratio 3. 43; 95 % CI 1. 92 – 6. 15), compared with carriers of two wild-type alleles. Carriers of one variant allele had half the risk. The highest relative risks of nonmelanoma skin cancer were found in carriers of the Asp 84 Glu, His 260 Pro, and Asp 294 His variant alleles, and the risk was only slightly lower for carriers of the Val 60 Leu, Val 92 Met, Arg 142 His, Arg 151 Cys, and Arg 160 Trp variant alleles. When subjects were stratified by skin type and hair color, analysis showed that these factors did not materially change the relative risks.

40|$|Abstract Background The insulin-like {{growth factor}} I {{receptor}} (IGF 1 R) {{has an important}} effect on growth, carcass, and meat quality traits in many species. However, few studies on associations of the IGF 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> with growth and carcass traits {{have been reported in}} chickens. The objectives of the present study were to study the associations of the IGF 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> with chicken early growth and carcass traits using a neutral test, variation scan of the gene, genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium and association analyses. Results The tree generated from the amino acid sequences of 15 species showed that the IGF 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> was conservative in the whole evolution among the mammalian animals and chickens. In a total of 10, 818 bp of sequence, 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the chicken IGF 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene.</b> The allelic and genotypic frequency distribution, genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium of 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Xinghua and White Recessive Rock chickens showed that six of them were possibly associated with growth traits. Association analyses showed that the A 17299834 G SNP was significantly associated with chicken carcass body weight, eviscerated weight with giblets, eviscerated weight, body weights at 28, 35, and 56 d of age, leg length at 56 d of age, and daily weight gain at 0 – 4 weeks. The haplotypes of the A 17307750 G and A 17307494 G were associated with early growth traits. The haplotypes of the A 17299834 G and C 17293932 T were significantly associated with most of the early growth traits and carcass traits.

The primers were constructed on the Capra hircus MC 4 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> sequence from GenBank (accession No. NM_ 001285591).

These findings suggest that endogenous Akv viruses were acquired by northern Chinese mice and that the Fv- 4 <b>r</b> <b>gene</b> or its related endogenous MuLVs were acquired independently by M. m. castaneus.

The absence of the Fv- 4 r-related endogenous MuLVs in M. m. molossinus may indicate that the ancestral mice of this subspecies either were an ancient type of M. m. castaneus that had acquired the Fv- 4 <b>r</b> <b>gene</b> but had not yet acquired the Fv- 4 r-related endogenous MuLVs or were a rare fraction of a mixed population of M. m. castaneus and northern Chinese mice...|$|R

The {{focus of the}} present study was to determine the role of glucose in the transrepression of hAT 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> transcription and to identify the functional cis-acting response element(s). Serial deletions of the hAT 1 R promoter region indicated that an area between – 1717 and – 1543 base pairs upstream of the 5 � end of the cDNA sequence has a glucose responsive regulatory element (GluRE) to down-regulate the gene expression. Further analysis revealed a putative 29 -bp (5 �-AACTGATTTTTGTATATTGATCTTGTATT- 3 �) repressor element located between – 1582 and � 1610 bp was necessary for transcriptional repression. Removal of this region from promoter construct abolished repression of the hAT 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> transcription in human proximal tubule epithelial cells (hPTECs). Using mobility shift assays, we demonstrated DNA binding activity to the labeled repressor element in hPTEC nuclear extracts. Additional studies demonstrated increased DNA binding activity to the labeled repressor element in nuclear extracts treated with high glucose (25 mM). Southwestern analysis identified two GluRE binding proteins of 34 and 36 kDa in glucose-treated extracts. Glucose-induced activity of the repressor trans-acting factor(s) reached a maximum at 4 h, which correlated with decreased transcriptional activity of the hAT 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene,</b> suggesting that glucose can down-regulate the transcription of the hAT 1 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> through the repressor element.

Here {{we report on the}} construction and characterization of recombinant VVs (rVVs) lacking the B 8 <b>R</b> <b>gene.</b> While the deletion of this gene had no effect on virus replication in vitro, rVVs lacking the B 8 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> were attenuated for mice.

This is a surprising result considering the minimal binding of the B 8 R protein to murine IFN-g and its failure to block the antiviral activity of this cytokine in vitro. Such reduction in virulence could not be determined in rats, since they are considerably more resistant to VV infection than are mice. Finally, deletion of the B 8 <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> had no detectable effects on humoral immune responses.
