40|$|Abstract: This article {{introduces}} {{a system of}} online real-time temperature inspecting, diagnose and alarm of the electric <b>cable</b> <b>interface,</b> which is powerful and advanced. The hardware circuit of this system is composed of collector, host control machine and PC.

5000|$|One {{possible}} disadvantage {{to digital}} cable telephone service {{is similar to}} a disadvantage of cable Internet access, namely that the medium is shared, which could result in occasional delays and drops when high volumes of bandwidth are used or in some cases shared with entire neighborhoods. These delays could be experienced during the [...] "prime time" [...] parts of the day, when heavy Internet usage and Internet streaming devices can make telephone calls on this system difficult. However, by utilizing Cable Lab's Packet <b>Cable</b> <b>interface</b> specifications, <b>cable</b> operators are able to diminish the effects of heavy internet usage on call quality. This is done by way of QoS provisions present in the Packet Cable specifications.|$|R

50|$|Layer 1 is {{implemented}} in the Ethernet PHY on its LAN interface, and a DOCSIS defined cable-specific PHY on its HFC <b>cable</b> <b>interface.</b> The term <b>cable</b> modem refers to this cable-specific PHY. The Network Layer (Layer 3) {{is implemented}} as an IP host in that {{it has its own}} IP address used by the network operator to maintain the device. In the Transport Layer (Layer 4) the cable modem supports UDP in association with its own IP address, and it supports filtering based on TCP and UDP port numbers to, for example, block forwarding of NetBIOS traffic out of the customer's LAN. In the Application Layer (Layer 7), the cable modem supports certain protocols that are used for management and maintenance, notably Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), SNMP, and TFTP.|$|R
