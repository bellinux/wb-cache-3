50|$|The term “argumentative turn” was {{introduced}} by Frank Fischer and John Forester {{in the introduction to}} their edited volume “The argumentative turn in policy analysis and planning”, published in 1993, assembling a group of different approaches towards policy analysis that share an emphasis on the importance of language, meaning, rhetoric and values as key features in the analysis of policy-making and planning. As a shift away from the positivistic and technocratic implications of the dominant empirical approach to problem-solving, the argumentative turn tries to offer an alternative perspective towards policy inquiry. Instead of focusing exclusively on empiricist law-like logical inference and causal explanation, the post-empiricist approach highlights numerous forms of social research practices, thereby not disqualifying the search for empirically valid data, but embedding scientific expertise into a meaningful social context. The argumentative approach therefore rejects the assumption that policy analysis can be a value-free, technical project, since it always involves complex combinations of descriptive and normative elements. As a commitment to deliberative and participatory conceptions of democracy, the argumentative perspective also rejects a top-down understanding of governance, testifying to the dynamic exchange between public and private interests and the important <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> in the complex processes of policy-making. The policy-analyst is no longer concerned with the improvement of political performance, but tries to stimulate the political process of policy deliberation, thereby promoting communicative competences and social learning.|$|E
50|$|In {{his account}} of social constructivism Ernest links the worlds of {{research}} mathematics and that of school and college mathematics. This link is achieved though the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> who as teachers communicate mathematical knowledge to learners and warrant their personal knowledge by means of testing and assessment. As researchers experts both create new mathematical knowledge and warrant the productions of others. Through this linkage the personal knowledge of the experts is developed and itself warranted. Both explicit mathematical knowledge representations and personal mathematical knowledge circulate between the worlds of education and research, which are not themselves wholly disjoint. The personal knowledge cycle is mutually refreshing for both education and research. A criticism of this account is that if mathematical knowledge is socially constructed and accepted it might be accepted purely {{on the basis of}} group agreement. However Ernest argues that mathematical knowledge communication, creation and warranting take place in historical communities that respect traditions of mathematical practice with embedded and partly tacit criteria for acceptability. Such rules include accepted forms of presentation, reasoning, and consistency. Although these are historically contingent they are never arbitrary and in general conserve mathematical concepts, theories and rules of acceptance. Furthermore, the democratic, rational and critical elements of mathematical thinking and mathematical communities mean that errors are eliminated. A criticism of this position is that it conflates the social institution of mathematics with objective mathematical knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|Different [...] "movements", [...] "paradigms", [...] "positions" [...] or [...] "schools" [...] {{in a given}} field tend to have {{different}} cognitive authorities. [...] "Most people, even most academics, {{do not have the}} time, training, or occasion to work through the technical literature on a controversial topic, and so, they must rely on professionals for a disinterested evaluation" [...] (Herrnstein, 1973, pp. 52,53; quoted from Tucker, 1994). Tucker shows, however, that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research blindly accepted Cyril Burt's research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that IQ was hereditary, and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. When a researcher from another field (Leon Kamin) first demonstrated that Burt's results were wrong, he was not considered a cognitive authority. When his criticism was considered unavoidable, the established researchers tried to change history and deprive Kamin of his intellectual credit. This example shows something about how cognitive authority may be ascribed in the real world. [...] The concept of cognitive authority also raises the question of the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts.</b> On the one hand, it is dangerous to blindly believe claims originating from [...] "experts" [...] while on the other hand, [...] "commonsensism" [...] is also a problematic epistemology. John Dewey (1920) discussed this dilemma and worked on improving general education {{in order to make the}} general public less vulnerable to the power of experts.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a series}} of papers from 1995, McHugh began {{considering}} the historiographical properties of legal thought and method and legal process, with Andrew Sharp initiating a debate in New Zealand and Australia that has been continued by other academics and writers such as John Pocock (reproduced in his collection of essays [...] "The discovery of islands" [...] in 2005), W. H. Oliver, Bain Attwood and Giselle Byrnes. The essay collection [...] "Histories Power and Loss" [...] brings this work together, anchored by Pococks essay. A more explicitly historical method appears in his published work from this time with its insistence upon the careful historicisation - the placing in time and place - not only of legal doctrine {{but also of the}} notions of legal obligation and the exercise of public authority at play in that setting. Hickford (2011) and Cadogan (2011) are clear that McHughs position towards the history of common law aboriginal rights is comfortably inside the mainstream of disciplinary practice in the writing of the history of political thought as are important scholars in Australia such as Bain Attwood and Ian Hunter. Whilst uncontroversial and accepted intellectual fare in Australasia, McHughs critique of whiggish historical method in the conduct of contemporary aboriginal claims-making in the courts and the shaping of historical narrative according to the predicates of present-day legal doctrine has become more controversial in Canada Indigenous Rights Litigation, Legal History, and the <b>Role</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> (Kent McNeil) 2014 Saskatchewan Law Review alongside McHughs essay. As a result of recent judicial interpretation of section 35 of the Canada Act (the aboriginal rights provision) First Nations are bringing historical claims before Canadian courts. In New Zealand this type of aboriginal claim is subject to political resolution with limited court intervention whilst in Australia the federal Government does not admit such claims with the Native Title Act 1993 processes being limited to accommodation of existing property and related claims.|$|E

40|$|The {{biotechnology}} sector {{attracts a}} wide range of interested actors with some getting entangled in the development of requisite regulatory systems as experts in the virtue of being knowledge suppliers and innovation drivers. However, questions have arisen as to whether experts enhance or constrain the evolution of regulatory structures for management of biotechnology as part of its broader governance. This has direct impact on biotechnology development based on the roles played by different governance actors. Using a dynamic case study of Kenya in its effort to institute a viable regulatory system to govern biotechnology, this paper explores the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> in regulating innovations. It draws insights from the Kenyan experience with a view of evaluating how the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts,</b> in particular the scientific community can spur positive contributions towards pro-innovation and pro-poor biotechnology policy processes. This recontextualised <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> is explored from the perspective of knowledge use and how it is linked to development. This is because of the tension between undisputed role of biotechnology as an economic driver and the political nature of biotechnology regulation in the African context.
