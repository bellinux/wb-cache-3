5|$|GRB970508 {{was also}} the first burst with an {{observed}} <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> afterglow. By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals, astronomer Dale Frail calculated that the source of the radio waves had expanded almost at the speed of light. This provided strong evidence that GRBs are relativistically expanding explosions.|$|E

In addition to offering the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials, the Woodstock Library houses collections in Chinese and Spanish and employs Chinese-speaking staff.

5|$|The International Telecommunication Union uses {{an internationally}} agreed system for {{classifying}} <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> signals. Each Type of radio emission is classified {{according to its}} bandwidth, method of modulation, nature of the modulating signal, and Type of information transmitted on the carrier signal. It is based on characteristics of the signal, not on the transmitter used.|$|E
50|$|There are {{additional}} legal implications {{related to the}} use of <b>radio</b> <b>frequencies</b> for command and control of FPV aircraft. Licensed amateur radio operators are expressly allowed to use amateur <b>radio</b> <b>frequencies</b> for telecommand of model aircraft. However, the Federal Communications Commission prohibits using amateur <b>radio</b> <b>frequencies</b> for commercial activity (generally any form of economic gain or for-profit activity). The FCC has not yet addressed the issue of creating designated command and control frequencies for commercial unmanned aircraft, and most civilian unmanned aircraft continue to use amateur <b>radio</b> <b>frequencies,</b> even when used for commercial purposes. Though it has not so far pursued any enforcement actions related to use of amateur <b>radio</b> <b>frequencies</b> for commercial unmanned aircraft, the FCC has the authority to levy civil forfeitures and fines into {{the tens of thousands of}} dollars for violations of its regulations.|$|R

5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E

5|$|Kerst {{returned}} to the University of Illinois after the war. From 1953 to 1957 he was technical director of the Midwestern Universities Research Association, where he worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts, most notably the FFAG accelerator. He developed the spiral-sector focusing principle, which {{lies at the heart}} of many spiral ridge cyclotrons that are now in operation around the world. His team devised and analysed beam stacking, a process of <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> acceleration in fixed field machines that led to the development of the colliding beam accelerators.|$|E
5|$|McClelland {{returned}} to the U.S. in July 1942 and was assigned to Headquarters Army Air Forces, Washington, D.C., where he was director of technical services until March 1943. He worked with Fred Terman to determine how best to conduct <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> searches and jamming of enemy communications. After serving {{the next several months}} as deputy assistant chief of Air Staff, operations, Headquarters Army Air Forces, he became the air communications officer in July 1943.|$|E
5|$|The MSR was an S-band passive {{electronically}} scanned array (PESA), {{unlike the}} actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but {{is much less}} expensive to build because a single transmitter and receiver {{is used for the}} entire system. The same antenna array can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is much less cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> switches needed at this level of power.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres {{produces}} 23,000 tyres per day at {{a factory}} in Nokia, Finland, and 200,000 tyres a year under the Bridgestone brand name. The original factory was built in 1904, the current one in 1945; it has expanded several times since then. Nokian Tyres has 27 assembly lines at its Finnish plant. The plant uses <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> devices to monitor the inventory of materials used to manufacture tyres, such as the 100-metre long strips of rubber tread. Shortages of rubber tread can halt production and so keeping an adequate supply of materials increases efficiency. Despite trade journals discussing this technique, Nokian declines to confirm its production methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E

5|$|The {{detonation}} {{was initially}} planned for 04:00 MWT but was postponed because {{of rain and}} lightning from early that morning. It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation. A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04:45, and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by Samuel Allison. By 05:30 the rain had gone. There were some communication problems. The shortwave <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> for communicating with the B-29s was shared with the Voice of America, and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in San Antonio, Texas.|$|E

Phase 2.3 added the Electronic Warfare suite upgrade (Radar Warning Receiver, <b>Radio</b> <b>Frequency</b> Jammer) and phase 2.4 upgraded with the Target Designation System (HTDS). The following support systems will also be either upgraded or replaced, the Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) {{to be replaced by}} the Hornet Aircrew Training System (HACTS), the Integrated Avionics Software Support Facility (IASSF), the Mission Planning System (MPS), Miscellaneous Support Equipment (SE), Computer Based Training System (CBTS), Simulated Aircraft Maintenance Training System (SAMTS) to be replaced by the Integrated Maintenance Training System (IMTS).|$|E
