5|$|Although {{other teams}} {{including}} the Kansas City Royals, Baltimore Orioles, and New York Yankees had vied for a Wild Card spot, the Indians, Rangers, and Rays all remained in contention {{until the end}} of the season. Entering the final day of the scheduled regular season, on which all three teams played, the Indians had a 91–70 record while both the Rangers and Rays had 90–71 records. These were the best non-division-leading records in the American League. Thus, the possibility existed (had the Indians lost and the <b>Rays</b> <b>and</b> Rangers won) for a three-way tie for the two Wild Card spots, which would have required several tie-breaker games to settle. However, all three teams won, leaving the Indians definitively in the Wild Card Game at 92–70 and the <b>Rays</b> <b>and</b> Rangers tied at 91–71 for the second spot.|$|E

5|$|Liquid xenon {{is used in}} calorimeters {{to measure}} gamma <b>rays,</b> <b>and</b> as a {{detector}} of hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus, theory predicts it will impart enough energy to cause ionization and scintillation. Liquid xenon is useful for these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet detector through self-shielding.|$|E
5|$|Manta {{rays are}} members of the order Myliobatiformes which {{consists}} of stingrays and their relatives. The genus Manta is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula devil rays. In 2017, an analysis of DNA—and, to a lesser degree, morphology—found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the manta <b>rays,</b> <b>and</b> they recommended treating Manta as a junior synonym of Mobula.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E

5|$|Technetium {{also has}} {{numerous}} nuclear isomers, which are isotopes {{with one or}} more excited nucleons. Technetium-97m (97mTc; 'm' stands for metastability) is the most stable, with a half-life of 91days (0.0965MeV). This is followed by technetium-95m (half-life: 61days, 0.03MeV), and technetium-99m (half-life: 6.01 hours, 0.142MeV). Technetium-99m emits only gamma <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> decays to technetium-99.|$|E
5|$|The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor {{results show}} that gamma <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> {{antimatter}} particles (positrons) can be generated in powerful thunderstorms. It is suggested that the antimatter positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGF). TGFs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning. The streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays. About 500 TGFs may occur every day worldwide, but mostly go undetected.|$|E

5|$|Adult dusky sharks have a {{broad and}} varied diet, {{consisting}} mostly of bony fishes, sharks and <b>rays,</b> <b>and</b> cephalopods, but also occasionally crustaceans, sea stars, bryozoans, sea turtles, marine mammals, carrion, and garbage. This species is viviparous with a three-year reproductive cycle; females bear litters of 314 young after a gestation period of 2224 months, after {{which there is a}} year of rest before they become pregnant again. Females are capable of storing sperm for long periods, as their encounters with suitable mates may be few and far between due to their nomadic lifestyle and low overall abundance. Dusky sharks are one of the slowest-growing and latest-maturing sharks, not reaching adulthood until around 20 years of age.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{he became}} a {{champion}} of nuclear nonproliferation. He wrote for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, and helped found the Federation of American Scientists and the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies. He {{was one of the}} few ex-communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s, but his research turned away from nuclear physics towards astrophysics. He published papers on cosmic <b>rays,</b> <b>and</b> a 1958 paper of his is considered to mark the birth of gamma ray astronomy.

5|$|Americium-241 {{has been}} used as a {{portable}} source of both gamma <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 59.5409keV gamma ray emissions from 241Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed nuclear density gauges and nuclear densometers. For example, the element has been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass. Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity). Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.|$|E

5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, working in Hanford and Savannah River Sites, Reines and Cowan {{developed}} {{the equipment and}} procedures with which they first detected the supposedly undetectable neutrinos in June 1956.
