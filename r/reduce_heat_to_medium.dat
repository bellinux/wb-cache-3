50|$|Floating discs {{have better}} disc {{centering}} with a fixed caliper. A floating disc also avoids disc warping and <b>reduces</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the wheel hub. Lambretta {{were the first}} manufacturer to use floating discs on a volume production motorcycle.|$|R
50|$|A {{study says}} that odiyal has carbohydrate, fibre, calcium, magnesium, iron, fat and protein in various levels. It has likely {{toxicity}} {{and it can}} be <b>reduced</b> by <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> 80°C for 15 - 20 minutes.|$|R
25|$|A {{ceramic coating}} for the rims is {{available}} which may reduce wear {{and can also}} improve both wet and dry braking. It may also slightly <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> {{the inside of the}} rims because it is a thermal insulator.|$|R
50|$|Reflective {{surfaces}} are surfaces that can deliver high solar reflectance (the ability {{to reflect the}} visible, infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths of the sun, <b>reducing</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the surface) and high thermal emittance (the ability to radiate absorbed, or non-reflected solar energy). Reflective {{surfaces are}} a form of geoengineering.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, {{the botanical}} garden {{received}} 700,000 lei from the Moldovan Ministry of Finance {{and was able}} <b>to</b> change its <b>heating</b> system, <b>reducing</b> <b>heating</b> costs <b>to</b> about 280,000 lei. The director said that the garden would slowly solve most of its problems on its own, refusing to renew the lease with Elat, which expired on July 7, 2005.|$|R
50|$|Mix {{turmeric}} {{powder and}} water in a small a small sauce pan and mix well. Turn the <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> low <b>medium</b> and stir constantly {{until the mixture is}} a thick paste. This does not take long so don’t walk away from the pan. Once it is a paste add pepper and oil.|$|R

5000|$|A {{heat sink}} {{may be used}} on the leads of <b>heat</b> {{sensitive}} components <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the component. This is especially applicable to germanium parts. (Note the heat sink will mean the use of more <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> complete the joint since heat {{taken up by the}} heat sink will not heat the workpieces.) If all metal surfaces have not been properly cleaned (ie, [...] "fluxed") or brought entirely above the melting temperature of the solder used, the result will be an unreliable ("cold solder") joint, even though its appearance may suggest otherwise.|$|R
25|$|At {{low ambient}} {{temperatures}} the common ostrich utilizes feather flattening, which conserves body heat through insulation. The low conductance coefficient of air allows less <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> {{be lost to}} the environment. This flattening behavior compensate for common ostrich's rather poor cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL). These feather heavy {{areas such as the}} body, thighs and wings do not usually vary much from ambient temperatures due to this behavioural controls. This ostrich will also cover its legs <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss <b>to</b> the environment, along with undergoing piloerection and shivering when faced with low ambient temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|Roofing {{systems that}} can deliver high solar {{reflectance}} (the ability {{to reflect the}} visible, infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths of the sun, <b>reducing</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the building) and high thermal emittance (the ability to release {{a large percentage of}} absorbed, or non-reflected solar energy) are called cool roofs. Cool roofs fall into one of these three categories: inherently cool, green planted roofs or coated with a cool material.|$|R
40|$|Pair of grips for tensile and {{compressive}} {{test specimens}} operate at temperatures up to 1, 500 degrees F. Grips include wedges holding specimen inside furnace, where <b>heated</b> <b>to</b> uniform temperature. Hydraulic pistons drive wedges, {{causing them to}} exert clamping force. Hydraulic pistons and hydraulic fluid remain outside furnace, at room temperature. Cooling water flows through parts of grips <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transferred <b>to</b> external components. Advantages over older devices for gripping specimens in high-temperature tests; no need to drill holes in specimens, maintains constant gripping force on specimens, and <b>heated</b> <b>to</b> same temperature as that of specimen without risk of heating hydraulic fluid and acuator components...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} a {{convective}} cooling system for an aluminum alloy airframe was established to verify preliminary weight estimates and to define future development requirements. A water glycol coolant was circulated through a closed loop network of supply and return lines to absorb incident aerodynamic heating from structural skin panels with integral passages and <b>to</b> transfer this <b>heat</b> input <b>to</b> a <b>heat</b> exchanger where it is rejected to the hydrogen fuel. Partial shielding of the aluminum alloy structure <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> loads <b>to</b> levels compatible with engine fuel flow requirements...|$|R
50|$|Of axial-flow {{design with}} 15-stage {{compressor}} and 7-stage turbine, it incorporated many modern features. These included a rigid compressor-turbine rotor assembly carried on {{front and rear}} bearings. There was a single annular combustion chamber, of reverse-flow configuration to shorten the engine, air cooling of the turbine discs and turbine blades with extended roots <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the disc. The annular air intake surrounded a reduction gear for propeller drive takeoff, and the exhaust duct was also annular.|$|R
50|$|Thermally {{developed}} flow {{results in}} <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> transfer compared <b>to</b> developing flow because {{the difference between}} the surface temperature of the pipe and the mean temperature of the flow is greater than the temperature difference between surface temperature of the pipe and the temperature of the fluid near the pipe boundary.|$|R
50|$|A second use of dihelium ion is {{in ambient}} {{ionization}} techniques using low temperature plasma. In this helium atoms are excited, and then combine to yield the dihelium ion. The He2+ {{goes on to}} react with N2 {{in the air to}} make N2+. These ions react with a sample surface to make positive ions that are used in mass spectroscopy. The plasma containing the helium dimer can be as low as 30 °C in temperature, and this <b>reduces</b> <b>heat</b> damage <b>to</b> samples.|$|R

50|$|Chrome plating is a {{relatively}} common variation on surface finish for commercial griddles. The finish is aesthetically pleasing, but offers additional benefits to griddle operators. In its plated form chrome is non-porous, impermeable and non-reactive (inert) with food products, which limits food sticking during the cooking process and facilitates cleaning, as well as reduced flavor transfer between foods. The mirror finish of a chrome finish <b>reduces</b> <b>heat</b> transmission <b>to</b> the environment due to the low surface emissivity, a characteristic common to most highly polished surfaces.|$|R
40|$|The main {{purposes}} to {{be pursued}} in the climatic conception of commercial buildings are <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loads, <b>to</b> allow good exploitation of natural light and ventilation {{in order to be}} able to avoid or reduce the use of air-conditionning. The cooling and daylighting strategies are privileged, as they are natural ways of guaranteeing the conditions of comfort ant well-being required by office work and furthermore as they introduce the dimension of the climate, in all its variations, into the heart of the building...|$|R
50|$|A flex-fuel vehicle will {{experience}} about 76% {{of the fuel}} mileage MPG when using E85 (85% ethanol) products as compared to 100% gasoline.

5000|$|The {{modernization}} also {{replaced the}} original Pratt & Whitney FFT-12 cruise turbines with newer [...] 570-KF engines from Allison. The speed remained the same, as weight had increased to 5,100 tons full load. The original split funnel {{was replaced by}} a simpler single funnel, giving the ship a <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> signature due <b>to</b> cooler engine exhaust.|$|R
5000|$|A vacuum cooker (...) is a {{stainless}} steel vacuum flask. The flasks come in various sizes ranging from 20 to 40 cm in diameter and 25 cm tall. A removable pot, with handle and lid, fits inside the vacuum flask. The pot and contents are <b>heated</b> <b>to</b> cooking temperature, and then sealed in the flask. The flask simply <b>reduces</b> <b>heat</b> loss <b>to</b> a minimum, so that the food remains at cooking temperature for a long time, and cooks without continued heating. Note that the food is not cooked in a vacuum. It is cooked inside a vacuum flask. The hollow evacuated wall of the cooker thermally insulates its contents from the environment, so they remain hot for several hours.|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} of <b>reducing</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> reentry vehicles has led I to {{the consideration of}} both radiative and ablation shields. The paper reviews briefly the heating problems for manned vehicles and the means whereby ablation and radiation afford thermal protection. The principal energy disposal and weight parameters are then presented and their relation to the vehicle and trajectory parameters is discussed. A comparative analysis of three types of ablation shield is made and broad conclusions are drawn as {{to the type of}} shield most appropriate to manned reentry vehicles...|$|R
50|$|Simmering is a food {{preparation}} technique in which foods are cooked in hot liquids kept {{just below the}} boiling point of water (which is 100 °C or 212 °F at average sea level air pressure), but higher than poaching temperature. To keep a pot simmering, one brings it {{to a boil and}} then <b>reduces</b> the <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> a point where the formation of bubbles has almost ceased, typically a water temperature of about 94 °C (200 °F) at sea level.|$|R
40|$|The {{first decade}} of the twenty-first century was characterised by a hiatus in global surface warming. Using ocean model hindcasts and reanalyses we show that heat uptake between the 1990 s and 2000 s {{increased}} by 0. 7 ?±? 0. 3 Wm? 2. Approximately 30 % of the increase is associated with colder sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific. Other basins contribute via <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> loss <b>to</b> the atmosphere, in particular the Southern and subtropical Indian Oceans (30 %), and the subpolar North Atlantic (40 %). A different mechanism is important at longer timescales (1960 s-present) over which the Southern Annular Mode trended upwards. In this period, increased ocean heat uptake has largely arisen from <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> loss associated with reduced winds over the Agulhas Return Current and southward displacement of Southern Ocean westerlies...|$|R

2500|$|Another new {{aspect of}} The Godfather II is the favor system. Players can do favors for {{ordinary}} {{people on the}} street either for money or for information on how to assassinate rival family made men. Like the Corleone family, all of the other families have made men. If the player simply shoots a made man, he will be hospitalized, not killed. To permanently eliminate a made man, the player must meet his [...] "kill condition"; that is, he must be killed in a specific way, such as being thrown from the roof of a building, hit by a car or killed using a certain execution maneuver. The only way the player can learn these kill conditions, and the location of each made man, is by doing favors for {{people on the street}}. The player can also do favors for various influential people, such as police chiefs, politicians, CIA agents, judges and DAs. Doing favors for these people grants the player bonuses which they can cash in at any time. These bonuses include instantly <b>reducing</b> <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> zero, instantly healing hospitalized made men, putting enemy made men in prison for a time, and instantly rebuilding bombed businesses.|$|R
