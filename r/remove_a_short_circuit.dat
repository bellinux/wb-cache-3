5000|$|ARC informs Carl's {{pregnant}} wife Lauren (Teri Austin) and daughter Catherine (Catherine Disher) that Carl has died. In reality, Whyte is keeping Carl's charred {{body in a}} suspension of oxygenating fluid which keeps his brain functioning. Using Carl's space suit and ARC's cutting-edge prosthetics technology, they build Carl a cyborg body and dub him [...] "Project Frankenstein". The rage program is also installed, with a remote control unit acting as a safeguard. The reanimation initially fails, so researcher Gail Vernon (Lynda Mason Green) disassembles the suit. After the remote control unit is <b>removed,</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> causes Carl to suddenly revive. When she tries to reinstall his control unit, he pushes Gail away. She falls onto a control panel, which releases all of the lab monkeys. They attack Gail in a rage and kill her.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{application}} is when DC power {{needs to be}} fed into a transmission line, which {{may be necessary to}} power an active device connected to the line, such as a switching transistor or a varactor diode for instance. An ideal DC voltage source has zero impedance, that is, it presents <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and it is not useful to connect <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> directly across the line. Feeding in the DC via a λ/4 transformer will transform the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> into <b>an</b> open circuit which has no effect on the signals on the line. [...] Likewise, an open circuit can be transformed into <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> inside the superconducting coils of the ATLAS detector after their installation in the casing is mandatory for the mechanical and electrical safety during a fast discharge of the magnet. The {{detection of}} <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> {{by means of}} a capacitor discharge becomes very difficult once the coils are integrated inside the casing, which behaves as a short-circuited turn strongly coupled with the coils.
