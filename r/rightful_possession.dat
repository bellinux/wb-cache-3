Contrary to the Jewish claim that this land was promised only to the descendants of Abraham's younger son Isaac, they argue that the Land of Canaan was promised to what they consider the elder son, Ishmael, from whom Arabs claim descent. Additionally, Muslims also revere many sites holy for Biblical Israelites, such as the Cave of the Patriarchs and the Temple Mount. In the past 1,400 years, Muslims have constructed Islamic landmarks on these ancient Israelite sites, such as the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. This has brought the two groups into conflict over the <b>rightful</b> <b>possession</b> of Jerusalem. Muslim teaching is that Muhammad passed through Jerusalem on his first journey to heaven. Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, claims that all of the land of Palestine (the current Israeli and Palestinian territories) is an Islamic waqf that must be governed by Muslims.|$|E

Our statesmen have become sensible, when too late, of the importance of this measure.

As signatories of the 1998 Washington Agreement, Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. Any failure {{on the part of the}} German government to return the <b>rightful</b> <b>possessions</b> of Cornelius Gurlitt might very well prove to be a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.|$|R
6000|$|If we are {{to believe}} the {{censorious}} Hare, {{the love of the}} hero's countrymen went rather far when the Roman municipality, to please him, tried to change the course of the Tiber in conformity with a scheme of his, and so spoiled the beauty of the Farnesina garden without effecting a too-difficult piece of engineering. The less passionate Murray says merely that [...] "a large slice of this garden was cut off to widen the river for the Tiber embankment," [...] and let us hope that it was no worse. I suppose we must have seen the villa in its glory when we went, in 1864, to see the Raphael frescos in the casino there, but in the touching melancholy of the wasted and neglected grounds we easily accepted the present as an image of the past. For all we remembered, the weed-grown, green-mossed gravel-paths of the sort of bewildered garden that remained, with its quenched fountain, its vases of dead or dying plants, and its dishevelled shrubbery, were what had always been; and it was of such a charm that we were gratefully content with it. The truth is, one cannot do much with beauty in perfect repair; the splendor that belongs to somebody else, unless it belongs also to everybody else, wounds one's vulgar pride and inspires envious doubts of the owner's <b>rightful</b> <b>possession.</b> But when the blight of ruin has fallen upon it, when dilapidation and disintegration have begun their work of atonement and exculpation, then our hearts melt in compassion of the waning magnificence and in a soft pity for the expropriated possessor, to whom we attribute every fine and endearing quality. It is this which makes us such friends of the past and such critics of the present, and enables us to enjoy the adversity of others without a pang of the jealousy which their prosperity excites.|$|E
60|$|Not {{very long}} afterwards, I {{happened}} to be passing the same venerable Cathedral, and heard a clang of joyful bells, and beheld a bridal party coming down the steps towards a carriage and four horses, with a portly coachman and two postilions, that waited at the gate. One parson and one service had amalgamated the wretchedness of a score of paupers; a Bishop and three or four clergymen had combined their spiritual might to forge the golden links of this other marriage-bond. The bridegroom's mien {{had a sort of}} careless and kindly English pride; the bride floated along in her white drapery, a creature, so nice and delicate that it was a luxury to see her, and a pity that her silk slippers should touch anything so grimy as the old stones of the churchyard avenue. The crowd of ragged people, who always cluster to witness what they may of an aristocratic wedding, broke into audible admiration of the bride's beauty and the bridegroom's manliness, and uttered prayers and ejaculations (possibly paid for in alms) for the happiness of both. If the most favorable of earthly conditions could make them happy, they had every prospect of it. They were going to live on their abundance in one of those stately and delightful English homes, such as no other people ever created or inherited, a hall set far and safe within its own private grounds, and surrounded with venerable trees, shaven lawns, rich shrubbery, and trimmest pathways, the whole so artfully contrived and tended that summer rendered it a paradise, and even winter would hardly disrobe it of its beauty; and all this fair property seemed more exclusively and inalienably their own, because of its descent through many forefathers, each of whom had added an improvement or a charm, and thus transmitted it with a stronger stamp of <b>rightful</b> <b>possession</b> to his heir. And is it possible, after all, {{that there may be a}} flaw in the title-deeds? Is, or is not, the system wrong that gives one married pair so immense a superfluity of luxurious home, and shuts out a million others from any home whatever? One day or another, safe as they deem themselves, and safe as the hereditary temper of the people really tends to make them, the gentlemen of England will be compelled to face this question.|$|E

40|$|Benjamin’s {{thinking}} on justice originates from {{a complex of}} early writings on language, mathematics, and history, which were composed around 1916 {{as part of a}} series of conversations and letter exchanges with Gershom Scholem. From the outset, Benjamin is interested in the relation of justice to the genesis of judgment in human language; he begins with the premise that justice has a language but that this language, by which judgment and the law ostensibly communicate justice, is not necessarily coextensive with the idea of justice. Justice per se is thus to be regarded as distinct from its immediately communicable content in any particular legal system or national framework. Moreover, according to the Biblical account of their origination, the judgments comprising the linguistic execution of justice, which purport to discriminate between good and evil, do not derive from a knowledge of things as such but already and only communicate an abstraction. By contrast, mathematics is upheld as having the capacity to designate a non-linguistic residuum of creation, which penetrates through the conditions of our possible representation of things, including our representation of things as our <b>rightful</b> <b>possessions.</b> The notion of justice on which law hinges thus turns out to be wholly incompatible with the teleological, eschatological and epistemological underpinnings of the Christological worldview, {{as well as with the}} occupation of habitable land in physical space...|$|R

[...] But finding that we not only persist in absolute contempt of their reasoning and disbelief in their philosophy, but even {{go so far as}} daringly to defend our property, their patience shall be exhausted, and they shall resort to their superior powers of argument; hunt us with hippogriffs, transfix us with concentrated sunbeams, demolish our cities with moonstones; until having by main force converted us to the true faith, they shall graciously permit us to exist in the torrid deserts of Arabia, or the frozen regions of Lapland, there to enjoy the blessings of civilization and the charms of lunar philosophy, in much the same manner as the reformed and enlightened savages of this country are kindly suffered to inhabit the inhospitable forests of the north, or the impenetrable wilderness of South America.|$|R

5000|$|The {{current form}} of section 117 {{is the result}} of a {{recommendation}} by CONTU, the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works. The U.S. Congress established CONTU to study and make recommendations on modifying the 1976 Copyright Act to deal with new technologies, particularly computer software, that Congress had not addressed when it passed the 1976 Act. CONTU operated from 1975 to 1978, and its principal recommendation to Congress was to revise the wording of section 117. Its report stated:Because the placement of a work into a computer is the preparation of a copy, the law should provide that persons in <b>rightful</b> <b>possession</b> of copies of programs be able to use them freely without fear of exposure to copyright liability. Obviously, creators, lessors, licensors, and vendors of copies of programs intend that they be used by their customers, so that rightful users would but rarely need a legal shield against potential copyright problems. It is easy to imagine, however, a situation in which the copyright owner might desire, for good reason or none at all, to force a lawful owner or possessor of a copy to stop using a particular program. One who rightfully possesses a copy of a program, therefore, should be provided with a legal right to copy it to that extent which will permit its use by that possessor. This would include the right to load it into a computer and to prepare archival copies of it to guard against destruction or damage by mechanical or electrical failure. But this permission would not extend to other copies of the program. Thus, one could not, for example, make archival copies of a program and later sell some while retaining some for use. The sale of a copy of a program by a rightful possessor to another must be of all rights in the program, thus creating a new rightful possessor and destroying that status as regards the seller.The revisions recommended by CONTU were approved with one important change. Instead of [...] "rightful possessor" [...] of a computer program Congress used the word [...] "owner" [...] of a computer program. It is not clear why this change was made. This one change resulted in a state of affairs in which software vendors began to take the position that customers do not own their software but rather only [...] "license" [...] it. The courts have split on whether the assertion in software agreements that the customer does not own the software, and has only a right to use it in accordance with the license agreement, is legally enforceable.|$|E

40|$|In a {{fascinating}} and enigmatic {{passage of the}} Metaphysik der Sitten, Kant produced a definitive methodological change in the justification of the acquisition of what is «mine and thine exterior». This change was introduced {{by means of the}} rational and not empirically verifiable hypothesis of common original acquisition of land: «All men are originally and before any juridical act of will in <b>rightful</b> <b>possession</b> of the soil; that is, {{they have a right to}} be (da Sein) wherever nature or chance has placed them without their will». In this way, the passionate supporter of the acquired -not innate- character of property rights makes room for the only natural right proceeding from the exercise of (external) freedom: the right of mankind to take possession of a place on the Earth's limited spherical surface. A historical and political interpretation of these passages makes possible to assess the revolutionary consequences of an apparently «minor» methodological change. En un pasaje a la vez críptico y fascinante de la Metaphysik der Sitten, Kant generó un cambio metodológico definitivo para justificar la adquisición de «lo mío y lo tuyo exterior», mediante la hipótesis racional y no empíricamente comprobable de la apropiación originaria común del suelo: «Todos los hombres están originariamente (con anterioridad a todo acto jurídico del arbitrio) en posesión legítima del suelo, es decir, tienen derecho a existir (da Sein) ahí donde (al margen de su voluntad) los han situado la naturaleza o el azar». Es así como el apasionado defensor del carácter adquirido -no innato- del derecho de propiedad deja espacio para un único derecho natural emanado del ejercicio de la libertad (externa) : el derecho de todo el género humano a tomar posesión de un lugar en la superficie esférica y no infinita de la tierra. Una interpretación histórica-política de estos pasajes permitiría evaluar las consecuencias revolucionarias de un cambio metodológico aparentemente «menor»...|$|E
