40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to extend the programming language Prolog with a capability to access a <b>relational</b> <b>data</b> <b>base</b> system. Since the data type ‘relation ' is basic in Prolog, and since Prolog is based on interpretation of a subset of predicate calculus, such an interface becomes simpler in Prolog than in most other languages, and the same language, extended Prolog, may be used both for programming and as a very powerful query language. From the Prolog programmers ’ point of view, the approach has the advantages that conventional data bases can be concurrently accessed from Prolog programs, and that the sizes of certain types of Prolog relations are not limited by the primary memory size. A portable pilot implementation has been done, using a Prolog interpreter coded in Lisp, a portable Lisp interpreter, and a portable <b>relational</b> <b>data</b> <b>base</b> system. The implementation and its primitives will be overviewed. The approach presented takes advantage of optimization methods of the underlying <b>relational</b> <b>data</b> <b>base</b> system.
