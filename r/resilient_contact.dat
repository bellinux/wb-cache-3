40|$|We study {{dynamics}} of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate {{where the two}} components are coupled via an optical lattice. In particular, {{we focus on the}} dynamics as one drives the system through a critical point of a first order phase transition characterized by a jump in the internal populations. Solving the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we analyze; breakdown of adiabaticity, impact of non-linear atom-atom scattering, and the role of a harmonic trapping potential. Our findings demonstrate that the phase transition is <b>resilient</b> to both <b>contact</b> interaction between atoms and external trapping confinement. Comment: 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|A new wafer level {{packaging}} technology ELASTec® {{has been}} developed; {{which uses a}} <b>resilient</b> bump <b>contact</b> system. The advantages are twofold; because {{on the one hand}} the elastic contact system simplifies wafer probing {{and on the other hand}} the elastic interconnects allow an increase in board level reliability. Excessive solder bump straining caused by the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients (CTE) between silicon and organic board materials can be avoided because of the compliance of the new contact system, which can take over the main part of the mismatch deformation. Since the electrical connection is made by an electrodeposited copper/nickel redistribution layer (RDL), placed on top of the bump surface, other failures risks than solder fatigue emerge which were avoided by parametric studies using finite element analyses (FEA). The thermomechanical characteristics like stress-strain behavior and fatigue resistance of the RDL metallic films are the most important p arameters for reliability predictions by FEA, discussed in some detail. The FEA based prediction that the fatigue performance of a spiral RDL layout is superior is proven experimentally and other reliability test data is provided...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a charge-extraction layer for perovskite solar cells based on a network of polymer-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). The starting point is the addition of SWNTs as additives to improve the charge trans- port characteristics of a solid-state hole-transporting material - 2, 2, 7, 7 -tetrakis-(N,N-di-p- methoxyphenylamine) 9, 9 -spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). In a double-layer structure this is shown to perform comparably well to devices in which the charge transport of spiro-OMeTAD is enhanced by conventional doping. By means of photo-induced absorption spectroscopy, it could be shown that a significant fraction of photogenerated charges are transferred to the SWNTs. This finding demonstrates that the nanotubes act as charge selective contacts in their own right without requiring the presence of dedicated hole transporter material. In- stead, they can be embedded in a matrix of an inert polymer, which can be chosen according to characteristics related to stability rather than their electronic properties. Such an SWNT- PMMA composite structure is shown to outperform conventional hole-transporter systems during and after thermal stressing cycles. Finally, the issue of hysteresis is addressed. The additive 4 - tert -butylpyridine (tBP) is shown to significantly improve the steady-state performance of devices with the SWNT-PMMA composite structure. In order to understand the mechanism and underlying interactions of the additive, the possible interaction interfaces are investigated one by one, leading to the conclusion that a direct interaction between tBP and the perovskite absorber must be responsible for the observed effect. The work in this thesis opens the avenue for SWNT-based hole transporter systems which provide a chemically stable and mechanically <b>resilient</b> charge-selective <b>contact,</b> and show particular promise for improving the overall stability of perovskite devices. </p...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{changes in}} {{mechanical}} and structural properties {{can be obtained}} by modifying commercial soda-lime-silica glass composition within a narrow range; and this can potentially enable the glass scientists and technologists to produce commercially viable, stronger and lighter soda-lime-silica glass products. In this research, four different series of soda-lime-silica glasses have been produced; MgO and CaO glass series are fabricated by varying the magnesia/silica and calcia/silica ratios respectively; and CaO-MgO and Al 2 O 3 glass series were produced by altering the calcia/magnesia and (alumina + soda) /silica ratios, respectively. Mechanical properties such as Vicker’s hardness and fracture toughness were measured by indentation method; and bending fracture toughness was also obtained by the surface crack in flexure method. Differential thermal analysis was used to determine the glass transition temperatures of these glass series. The variation of mechanical properties of glass series have been interpreted in terms of acquired structural information from 29 Si NMR, Raman and FTIR absorption spectroscopies. It is found that magnesia and calcia act as network modifiers when they are substituted for silica in MgO and CaO glass series, and therefore they reduce connectivity of glass series. However, at fixed silica and soda contents, addition of magnesia at the expense of calcia increases network polymerisation. Indentation experiments showed that magnesia rich soda-lime-silica glasses are more susceptible to stress-corrosion than calcia rich glasses, and that they exhibit large discrepancies between direct and 24 hour indentation toughness values. Raman spectra of MgO and CaO-MgO glass series show that the intensity reduction in the long tail of the low frequency band is less for magnesia rich soda-lime-silica glasses compared to the observed reduction in calcia rich ones, and presumably this is potentially linked to presence of relatively larger membered rings in magnesia rich glasses. And therefore, the potential higher abundance of large membered rings might reduce stress-corrosion resistance of high magnesia containing glasses. No significant trend between bending fracture toughness and indentation fracture toughness could be identified. Moreover, large discrepancies are observed between direct and 24 hours indentation toughness values of MgO glass series. And all these inconsistencies raise the doubts over the accuracy of indentation method which has also been discussed in the literature. Elastic moduli have been measured by acoustic means, and it was found that Young’s moduli of MgO, CaO, CaO-MgO and Al 2 O 3 glass series increase with network depolymerisation; and the significant role of packing density on Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio is obtained. Bending (surface crack in flexure) experiment has been used to minimise the uncertainties associated with indentation method. Contrary to the reports of previous works, the addition of magnesia in place of calcia does not increase fracture toughness. However, substitution of calcia in place of silica or magnesia gives rise to higher fracture toughness values in CaO and CaO-MgO glass series. It was also found that the replacement of alumina by silica can increase fracture toughness of soda-lime-silica glasses, and this increment in fracture toughness can be attributed to reduced stiffness and easier plastic deformation of silicate backbone as a result of removal of alumina that have significantly larger bond strength than that of other conventional oxides used in soda-lime-silica glasses. Furthermore, glasses that are more <b>resilient</b> to sharp <b>contact</b> loading exhibit lower fracture toughness values; whereas, glasses that possess larger packing densities and Poisson’s ratios favour easier shear flow and show larger fracture toughness values. Therefore, increasing alkaline earth oxide content preferably using a less covalent one in place of silica; or removing structural units (i. e. AlO 4) that have very high dissociation energy per unit volume from silicate network can reduce stiffness of backbone of silicate glass and hence can increase plastic deformation capacity and bending fracture toughness of soda-lime-silica glasses. Calcium oxide-rich glasses (i. e. 14 CaO glass) exhibit one of the highest fracture toughness values (0. 95 MN m- 3 / 2) whilst the lower fracture toughness values (0. 78 MN m- 3 / 2) are observed for low calcium oxide containing silicate glasses; and the total increment of fracture toughness is 22...|$|R
