40|$|From {{physical}} {{measurements on}} glaciers and {{experimental studies of}} ice properties a framework of concept and theory is being built which bids fair to place glaciers among the more quantitatively understandable phenomena in the earth sciences. Measurements of flow velocity, deformation and stress, ice thickness and channel configuration, temperature, internal structure of theice, mass and energy balance, and response to meteorological variables all contribute to this understanding, as do still other measurements hardly discussed here, such as electrical properties, <b>radioactive</b> <b>age</b> measurements, and detailed studies of chemical and isotopic composition. The obvious goals of this work—the interpretation {{of past and present}} glacier fluctuations in terms of changes in world climate, and the prediction of glacier behavior—remain elusive, even though a good conceptual groundwork has been laid for dealing with the more tractable aspects of these problems. Intriguing recent discoveries have been made about such matters as the way in which glaciers react dynamically to changing conditions, the inter-relations between thermal regime and ice motion, the structural mechanisms of glacier flow, and the changes produced in ice by flow. One can recognize in these developments the possibility that concepts derived from the study of glacier flow may be applicable to phenomena of solid deformation deep in the earth. In this way glacier geophysics may have a useful impact beyond the study of glaciers themselves...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the second highly r-process-enhanced, extremely metal-poor star, CS 31082 - 001 ([Fe/H] = - 2. 9) has provided a powerful new tool for age determination, {{by virtue of the}} detection and measurement of the radioactive species uranium and thorium. One of the serious limitations of this approach, however, is that predictions of the production ratio of U and Th have not been made {{in the context of a}} realistic astrophysical model of the r-process. We have endeavored to produce such a model, based on the "neutrino winds" that are expected to arise from the nascent neutron star of a core-collapse supernova. The mass-integrated r-process yields, obtained by assuming a simple time evolution of the neutrino luminosity, are compared to the available spectroscopic elemental abundance data of CS 31082 - 001. As a result, the "age" of this star is determined to be 14. 1 ± 2. 5 Gyr, in excellent agreement with lower limits on the age of the universe estimated by other dating techniques, as well as with other stellar <b>radioactive</b> <b>age</b> estimates. Future measurements of Pt and Pb in this star, as well as expansion of searches for additional r-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars (especially those in which both U and Th are measurable), are of special importance to constrain the current astrophysical models for the r-process.

40|$|Rapid neutron-capture (i. e., r-process) {{nucleosynthesis}} calculations, employing internally {{consistent and}} physically realistic nuclear physics input (QRPA beta-decay {{rates and the}} ETFSI-Q nuclear mass model), have been made. These calculations are compared with ground-based and HST observations of neutron-capture elements in the metal poor halo stars CS 22892 [...] 052, HD 115444, HD 122563 and HD 126238. The elemental abundances in all four metal-poor stars {{are consistent with the}} solar r-process elemental distribution for the elements Z >/= 56. These results strongly suggest, at least for those elements, that the relative elemental r-process abundances have not changed over the history of the Galaxy. This further suggests that there is one r-process site in the Galaxy, at least for elements Z >/= 56. Employing the observed stellar abundances of stable elements, in conjunction with the solar r-process abundances to constrain the calculations, predictions for the zero decay-age abundances of the radioactive elements Th and U are made. We compare these (least-squares-fit ETFSI-Q) predictions with newly derived observational values in three very metal-poor halo stars: HD 115444, CS 22892 [...] 052 and HD 122563. Within the observational errors the observed ratio of [Th/Eu] is the same in both CS 22892 [...] 052 and HD 115444. Comparing with the theoretical ratio suggests an average age of these two very metal poor stars to be approximately 13. 0 +/- ~ 5 Gyr, consistent with earlier <b>radioactive</b> <b>age</b> estimates and recent globular and cosmological age estimates...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{and noble}} gas isotope {{analyses}} are reported for bubbling gas {{samples from the}} Tengchong volcanic geothermal area near the Indo-Eurasian suture zone. All samples contain a resolvable component of mantle-derived He- 3. Occurrence of mantle-derived He- 3 coincides with surface volcanism. However, He- 3 occurs over a larger geographic area than do surface volcanics. delta(13) C values for CO 2 and CH 4 vary from - 33. 4 parts per thousand to 1. 6 parts per thousand and from - 52. 8 parts per thousand to - 2. 8 parts per thousand, respectively. He and C isotope systematics indicate that CO 2 and CH 4 in the CO 2 -rich gases originated predominantly from magmatic component mixed with crustal CO 2 produced from carbonate. However, breakdown of organic matter and near-surface processes accounts for the CH 4 and CO 2 in N- 2 -rich gases. He- 3 /He- 4 ratio distribution pattern suggests that mantle-derived He and heat sources of high- temperature system in central Tengchong originate from a hidden magma reservoir at subsurface. CO 2 -rich gases with the highest He- 3 /He- 4 ratio (5. 2 Ra) may {{be representative of the}} Tengchong magmatic component. Compared with MORB, this relative low He- 3 /He- 4 ratio could be fully attributed to either deep crustal contamination, or <b>radioactive</b> <b>aging,</b> or past contamination of the local mantle by U- and Th-rich subducted crustal material. However, a combination of low He- 3 /He- 4, high radiogenic He- 4 /Ar- 40 ratio and identical CO 2 /He- 3 and delta(13) C(CO 2) relative to MORB may suggest addition of prior subductedd crsustal material (ca 1 %- 2 %) to the MORB reservoir around 1. 3 Ga ago, which is essentially compatible with the LIL-elements, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes of volcanic rocks...|$|R
40|$|Plutonium, {{because of}} its <b>radioactive</b> nature, <b>ages</b> from the ''inside out'' by means of self-irradiation damage and thus {{produces}} Frankel-type defects and defect clusters. The defects resulting from the residual lattice damage and helium in-growth could result in microstructural, electronic, and physical property changes. This paper presents volume, density, and electronic property change observed from both naturally and accelerated aged plutonium alloys. Accelerated alloys are plutonium alloys with a fraction of Pu- 238 to accelerate the aging process by approximately 18 {{times the rate of}} unaged weapons-grade plutonium. After thirty-five equivalent years of aging on accelerated alloys, the samples have swelled in volume by approximately 0. 1 % and now exhibit a near linear volume increase due to helium in-growth. We will correlate the physical property changes to the electronic structure of plutonium observed by the resonant photoelectron spectroscopy (RESPES) ...|$|R
50|$|Researchers use {{radioactive}} atoms {{to determine}} the age of materials that were once part of a living organism. The age of such materials can be estimated by measuring the amount of radioactive carbon they contain in a process called radiocarbon dating. Similarly, using other <b>radioactive</b> elements, the <b>age</b> of rocks and other geological features (even some man-made objects) can be determined; this is called Radiometric dating. Environmental scientists use radioactive atoms, known as tracer atoms, to identify the pathways taken by pollutants through the environment.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the most promising molybdenite-rich area on the north coast of Labrador, Cape Makkovik peninsula. The area, although only 6 square miles in size, is part of the Labrador Uranium Province and its geology is similar to the Beaverlodge and Great Bear Lake camps {{in the western part of}} the Canadian Shield. [...] In a reconnaissance along the Labrador coast in 1900, Daly referred to the glaciated peninsula as "a veritable museum of rock types". The map-area is underlain by an assemblage of folded metamorphosed quartzitic and amphibolitic rocks of Precambrian age which have been termed the Aillik Group. The degree of metamorphism has been largely dependent upon the original character of the rock and upon tectonic stresses which prevailed during deformation. A great number and variety of intrusive rocks ranging in composition from "amazonite" pegmatite to lamprophyre have been intruded at different times along major joint sets. [...] After detailed megascopic and microscopic study, parentage has been determined for those metamorphosed and metasomatized (potash-bearing) rocks which have retained some of their primary features. The relative ages of the igneous rocks have been determined and these observations, combined with <b>radioactive</b> <b>age</b> determinations, may possibly be a means of chronological correlation with dyke systems in other parts of Labrador. [...] The thesis is illustrated by figures and plates, and by a coloured geological map on a scale of 1 inch to 500 feet...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{detailed}} abundance analysis of the r-process enhanced giant star, HE 2252 - 4225 ([Fe/H] = - 2. 63, [r/Fe] = 0. 80). Determination of stellar parameters and element abundances was based on analysis of high-quality VLT/UVES spectra. The surface gravity was calculated from the NLTE ionisation balance between Fe I and Fe II. Accurate abundances were determined {{for a total of}} 38 elements, including 22 neutron-capture elements beyond Sr and up to Th. This object is deficient in carbon, as expected for a giant star with Teff < 4800 K. The stellar Na-Zn abundances are well fitted by the yields of a single supernova of 14. 4 Msun. For the neutron-capture elements in the Sr-Ru, Ba-Yb, and Os-Ir regions, the abundance pattern of HE 2252 - 4225 is in excellent agreement with the average abundance pattern of the strongly r-process enhanced stars CS 22892 - 052, CS 31082 - 001, HE 1219 - 0312, and HE 1523 - 091. This suggests a common origin of the first, second, and third r-process peak elements in HE 2252 - 4225 in the classical r-process. We tested the solar r-process pattern based on the most recent s-process calculations of Bisterzo et al. (2014) and found that elements in the range from Ba to Ir match it very well. No firm conclusion can be drawn about the relationship between the fisrt neutron-capture peak elements, Sr to Ru, in HE 2252 - 4225 and the solar r-process, due to the uncertainty in the solar r-process. The investigated star has an anomalously high Th/Eu abundance ratio, so that <b>radioactive</b> <b>age</b> dating results in a stellar age of tau = 1. 5 +- 1. 5 Gyr that is not expected for a very metal-poor halo star.

40|$|Plutonium, {{because of}} its <b>radioactive</b> nature, <b>ages</b> from the 'inside out' by means of self-irradiation damage and thus {{produces}} nanoscale internal defects. The self-irradiation induced defects {{come in the form}} of Frenkel-type defects (vacancies and self-interstitial atoms), helium in-growth, and defect clusters. At present there are neither experimental nor theoretical models describing the changes in the electronic structure caused by the aging in Pu. This fact appears to be associated primarily with the absence of reasonably convincing spectroscopic evidence of the changes. This paper demonstrates that Resonant Photoemission, a variant of Photoelectron Spectroscopy, has strong sensitivity to aging of Pu samples. The spectroscopic results are correlated with an extra-atomic screening model [1], and are shown to be the fingerprint of mesoscopic or nanoscale internal damage in the Pu physical structure. This means that a spectroscopic signature of internal damage due to aging in Pu has been established...|$|R
30|$|Isotope {{hydrology}} {{was born}} {{just after the}} Second World War, mainly as a resultant of the knowledge collected in the monitoring of man-made radioactive nuclide fallout (specifically tritium) and the usage of <b>radioactive</b> isotopes as <b>age</b> estimation tools in geology with the theoretical understanding gained on the fractionation of isotopic species (Aggarwal, et al., 2005). Thus, a field called “Isotope hydrology—the use of isotopic tools {{in the study of}} water cycle” came into existence, and today isotope hydrology is considered as the most promising modern hydrological tools, apart from remote-sensing, for water resources managers and practitioners.|$|R
40|$|The bedrock in the Wildrose area is {{predominantly}} {{a sequence of}} metamorphosed sedimentary and possible volcanic rocks {{that is more than}} 15, 000 feet thick. All the metamorphic rocks are Precambrian in age on stratigraphic evidence. The rocks are divided into three age groups, early Precambrian, later Precambrian, and Precambrian (?), that are separated by unconformities. The early Precambrian Panamint metamorphic complex has been divided into two series that are separated by a profound unconformity. Small stocks and dikes of granitic rocks, which are presumably Cretaceous in age, intrude the metamorphic rocks. Tertiary sedimentary rocks and Quaternary alluvium are also present in the area. The structural features of the area are ascribed to four periods of deformation. The large folds in the early Precambrian rocks and associated minor folds were produced during the first two periods of deformation of early Precambrian age. Low angle faults are evidence of the third deformation which is considered to be Cretaceous in age. The fourth period of deformation produced high angle faults. Movement along the high angle faults began in late Tertiary time and has continued to the present. All the Precambrian rocks of the area have been affected by middle or lower middle grade metamorphism. Even though structural evidence suggests that metamorphism must have accompanied the earlier periods of deformation, the present mineral assemblages reflect the third period of deformation which, on the basis of mineral age measurements, was Cretaceous in age. Narrow contact metamorphic aureoles surround the larger masses of granite. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>ages</b> were measured in five areas in the Death Valley-Mojave Desert region. The rocks are Precambrian in age on stratigraphic evidence in three areas, the Wildrose area of the Panamint Range, the Mountain Pass district, and the Marble Mountains. The rocks in Joshua Tree National Monument and the Kilbeck Hills are presumably Precambrian, but no stratigraphic evidence of their age has been found. The geochronologic studies in the five areas indicate three distinct groups of K - Ar and Rb-Sr ages. Ages of approximately 1650 million years are obtained on metamorphic rocks and associated pegmatite s in the Mountain Pas s district. Younger igneous rocks at Mountain Pass and in the Marble Mountains have age patterns that are interpreted to indicate intrusion in the 1350 to 1450 million year interval. Metamorphic rocks in the Wildrose area, Joshua Tree National Monument, and the Kilbeck Hills have ages in the 75 to 85 million year interval which are interpreted as the age of regional metamorphism related to the Cretaceous Nevadan orogeny. An age of 73 million years was obtained on a post-metamorphic granite. ...|$|R
40|$|Visual cell outer segment renewal was {{studied in}} eyes of mutant Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) and Sprague-Dawley (control) rats by a {{combination}} of microscopy and radioautography with the light and electron microscopes. RCS and control rats were injected with amino acids- 3 H at 11 days of <b>age.</b> <b>Radioactive</b> rod outer segment discs were assembled at the outer segment base from radioactive proteins synthesized in the rod inner segments. In controls, all radioactive discs assembled at 11 days of age were displaced the length of the outer segments, removed from outer segment tips, and phagocytized by the pigment epithelium by 8 days after injection. In the RCS rats, disc assembly and displacement resembled controls for the first 3 days after injection. However, as disc assembly continued for some time thereafter, a layer of labeled, disorganized, lamellar debris accumulated between the outer segment tips and the pigment epithelium. The buildup of debris was accompanied by visual cell death. At no time during the study was there evidence for phagocytic activity by the pigment epithelium. 61 days after injection, the layer of debris was the only heavily radioactive component in the retina.

2500|$|In 1862, the {{physicist}} William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, [...] published calculations that fixed {{the age of}} Earth at between 20 million and 400 million years. He assumed that Earth had formed as a completely molten object, and determined {{the amount of time}} it would take for the near-surface to cool to its present temperature. With the discovery of <b>radioactive</b> decay the <b>age</b> of the Earth was pushed back even further. Arthur Holmes, was a pioneer of geochronology. In 1913 Holmes was on the staff of Imperial College, when he published his famous book The Age of the Earth in which he argued strongly in favour of the use of radioactive dating methods rather than methods based on geological sedimentation or cooling of the earth (many people still clung to Lord Kelvin's calculations of less than 100 million years). Holmes estimated the oldest Archean rocks to be 1,600 million years, but did not speculate about the Earth's age. By this time the discovery of isotopes had complicated the calculations and he spent the next years grappling with these. His promotion of the theory over the next decades earned him the nickname of Father of Modern Geochronology. By 1927 he had revised this figure to 3,000 million years and in the 1940s to 4,500±100 million years, based on measurements of the relative abundance of uranium isotopes established by Alfred O. C. Nier. The general method is now known as the Holmes-Houterman model after Fritz Houtermans who published in the same year, 1946. The established age of the Earth has been refined since then [...] but has not significantly changed.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the 2011 nuclear {{incident}} that occurred at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant, a large number of abandoned dogs and cats were left within the disaster zone. A small number of these animals were rescued and cared for at shelters. Prior to the dispersal of these animals to their owners or fosterers, we evaluated the degree of internal radiocesium contamination using a specially designed whole-body counter. We conducted 863 non-invasive measurements of gamma rays due to internal radioactive cesium for 68 dogs and 120 cats at one shelter. After plotting graphs of 137 Cs density we generated exponential functions of decay from seven dogs and six cats. From the regression formulae, we were able to determine the biological half-lives as 38. 2 days for dogs and 30. 8 days for cats. We found that in dogs there was a correlation between the biological half-life of <b>radioactive</b> cesium and <b>age.</b> Using our data, we estimated whole-body densities for each cat and dog at the time when they were rescued. We found that there were deviations in the data distributions among the different species, likely due to the timing of rescue, or living habits prior to rescue. A significant correlation was found when extracted feline reproductive organs were analyzed; the coefficients for the estimation of whole-body densities were approximately 7 -fold higher than those based on the extracted feline reproductive organs. This {{may be due to the}} fact that majority of the radioactive cesium accumulates within muscular tissue with less distribution in other organs. It is possible to plan the appropriate management period in an animal shelter based on the use of the biological half-life of radioactive cesium calculated in this study. We believe that the correlations we uncovered in this work would be of great use for the management of companion animals in the event of a future nuclear accident...|$|R
