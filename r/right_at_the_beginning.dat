Specifically, the chapter addresses the following questions: (1) Why was the Ethiopian government interested in transforming traditional communal <b>rights</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning?</b> How smooth or how rough was the process of change? (3) What are the outcomes in terms of property rights arrangements and pastoral livelihoods? (4) What factors explain pastoralists’ responses to drought-induced changes?

F-M retained the services of renowned industrial designer Raymond Loewy to create a visually impressive carbody for the Erie-built.

Arrian discreetly draws no conclusions from this, but, according to Thomas R. Martin, by no means does the identification of Alexander and Hephaestion with Achilles and Patroclus equate to their being homosexuals as Homer, author of the Iliad, never suggested that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were homosexual or that they had sexual relations.
