40|$|Graphyne, a novel carbon allotrope, is a {{two-dimensional}} lattice of sp 2 +sp 1 hybridization-type carbon atoms, similar to graphene. The initiation {{and development of}} wrinkles in single-layer graphynes (α-, β-, γ-, and 6, 6, 12 -graphyne) subjected to in-plane circular shearing are investigated. In comparison with graphene, wrinkle pattern and profile characterization in relation to wave number, wavelength and amplitude of graphynes are extensively explored using classic molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike graphene, the wave numbers of graphynes increase with increasing rotational angles; the wavelengths reduce correspondingly. The amplitudes show an increasing trend, with some local drops when the <b>rotational</b> <b>angles</b> increase. The drops occur as {{the positions of the}} wave numbers increase. Graphynes have superior fracture properties to graphene, despite the densities of graphynes being far lower. The fracture <b>rotational</b> <b>angles</b> depend on the percentages of acetylenic linkages in the graphyne structures: the more acetylenic linkages, the larger the fracture <b>rotational</b> <b>angles.</b> Meanwhile, acetylenic linkages also affect the bond length strains of the graphynes during the wrinkling process. The influences of the temperature on the fracture <b>rotational</b> <b>angles</b> are also examined to obtain further insights into the mechanical properties of such kinds of carbon allotropes. The achieved results can be used as guidelines for the wrinkling control and potential applications of graphynes. ...|$|R

40|$|Discrete {{fractional}} Fourier transform (DFrFT) is {{a powerful}} signal processing tool. This paper proposes a method for DFrFT-based image retrieval via Fisher discriminant and 1 -NN classification rule. First, this paper proposes to extend the conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) descriptors to the DFrFT descriptors {{to be used for}} representing the edges of images. The DFrFT descriptors extracted from the training images are employed to construct a dictionary, for which the corresponding optimal <b>rotational</b> <b>angles</b> of the DFrFTs are required to be determined. This dictionary design problem is formulated as an optimization problem, where the Fisher discriminant is the objective function to be minimized. This optimization problem is nonconvex (Guan et al. in IEEE Trans Image Process 20 (7) : 2030 - 2048, 2011; Ho et al. in IEEE Trans Signal Process 58 (8) : 4436 - 4441, 2010). Furthermore, both the intraclass separation and interclass separation of the DFrFT descriptors are independent of the <b>rotational</b> <b>angles</b> if these separations are defined in terms of the 2 -norm operator. To tackle these difficulties, the 1 -norm operator is employed. However, this reformulated optimization problem is nonsmooth. To solve this problem, the nondifferentiable points of the objective function are found. Then, the stationary points between any two consecutive nondifferentiable points are identified. The objective function values are evaluated at these nondifferentiable points and these stationary points. The smallest L objective function values are picked up and the corresponding <b>rotational</b> <b>angles</b> are determined, which are then used to construct the dictionary. Here, L is the total number of the <b>rotational</b> <b>angles</b> of the DFrFTs used to construct the dictionary. Finally, an 1 -NN classification rule is applied to perform the image retrieval. Application examples and experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the conventional DFT approach.

5000|$|As {{the firing}} order on an {{ordinary}} flat-four boxer engine [...] on 'L'eft and 'R'ight banks are LLRR or RRLL with each ignition (and thus exhaust) being 180 degrees apart. By counting two characters (2 x 180 =360) {{to the right}} of each 'L' or 'R', the cylinders that fire with 360 degree crankshaft <b>rotational</b> <b>angle</b> offset are shown to be located on opposite banks. If the exhaust manifold is designed to merge two exhaust ports on a bank into one exit as was common in the designs in the past, the pulse spacing becomes irregular, which causes uneven filling of intake into cylinders and the characteristic 'burble' of exhaust note on older flat-four engines. Subaru developed an [...] "equal lengths, even pulse spacing" [...] exhaust system with exhaust pipes connecting {{the left and the right}} banks for WRC competition in the 1990s, and incorporated this design into production Legacys in 2003, Foresters in 2005 and Imprezas in 2007.

The Impreza WRX and WRX STI still have unequal length exhaust pipes to feed the turbo sitting in the corner of the engine bay, and still have the characteristic burble. This was changed for the 2015 WRX which feeds a centrally mounted turbo, but the STI retained unequal length headers. They are, however, a somewhat popular aftermarket modification.|$|E
