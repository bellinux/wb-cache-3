30|$|Spectrum {{compatibility}} {{problem has}} become a challenging issue for electromagnetic space [1 – 6]. Although higher quality wireless telecommunication and more accurate remote sensing capabilities require sufficient bandwidth [7, 8], the frequency spectrum resource is limited, and special frequency bands with good penetrability [9] or low propagation attenuation are even more fiercely competitive. Hence, the working band of radar has a high opportunity to overlay with that of other electromagnetic radiator systems. Under these circumstances, the spectrum compatibility between radar signals and the surrounding electromagnetic radiators is essentially necessary. So the problem converts to designing the <b>radar</b> <b>sequence</b> that restrains the electromagnetic energy level over the overlapped spectrum.|$|R

This work represents {{contributions to the}} state of the art of radar tomography and SAR in three main areas. First, we develop a SAR measurement and image reconstruction framework for a downlooking, omnidirectional and multistatic SAR system. This framework, a significant generalization of previous work for downlooking monostatic SARs, models the SAR measurement process as a generalized integral transform of a reflectivity function. Secondly, based on this measurement and inversion framework, we resolve the novel question of SAR vehicle trajectory design for the purpose of optimal image quality in the presence of measurement noise. In addition, we introduce the concept of a random-location multistatic trajectory, and show that (for large enough problems) such a strategy is likely to approximate an upper performance bound; therefore a random strategy is likely to perform as well or better than any deterministic trajectory strategy. Finally, we expose connections between the Welti phase-coded <b>radar</b> <b>sequences</b> and the Discrete Wavelet transform. This connection directly yields very simple and natively high-speed implementations of pulse compression filters at the radar receiver. Furthermore, we generalize the idea of zero correlation <b>zone</b> <b>sequences</b> by developing methods to generate transmit waveforms which extend the perfect correlation width of such filter outputs without modifying the simplicity of the receive filters.

40|$|Abstract—A {{fundamental}} task in {{wireless communication}} is channel estimation: Compute the channel parameters a signal undergoes while traveling from a transmitter to a receiver. In {{the case of}} delay-Doppler channel, i. e., a signal undergoes only delay and Doppler shifts, a widely used method to compute the delay-Doppler parameters is thematched filter algorithm. It uses a pseudo-random sequence of length, and, in case of non-trivial relative velocity between transmitter and receiver, its computa-tional complexity is. In this paper we introduce a novel approach of designing sequences that allow faster channel estimation. Using group representation techniques we construct sequences, which enable us to introduce a new algorithm, called the flag method, that significantly improves the matched filter algorithm. The flag method finds delay-Doppler parameters in operations. We discuss applications of the flag method to GPS, and radar systems.

A clear function {{for all of}} these regions has not yet been defined. To evaluate the roles of these <b>sequence</b> <b>zones</b> in protein synthesis, knowledge of their disposition in small ribosomal subunits and in intact ribosomes is essential. Here I report the results of experiments which were undertaken to quantitate {{the extent to which these}} sequences are single stranded and exposed in 30 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes from Escherichia coli D- 10 cells. The approach was based upon the protection from nuclease S 1 digestion of short synthetic DNA oligomers hybridized to target sequences. In Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA nucleotides 520 - 530, 1396 - 1404, 1493 - 1504 and 1533 - 1542 were all found to be single stranded and stoichiometrically unrestricted for hybridization to complementary short (9 - 11 nucleotide) DNA oligomers. The disposition of the sequences in 30 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes varied with each position. To test the hypothesis that blockage of the normally open conserved sequences were essential for inhibition of protein synthesis, a set of novel synthetic short DNA analogs (3 - 6 nucleotides) and normal DNA (10 and 11 nucleotides) complementary to the regions 520 - 530 and between nucleotides 1533 - 1542 in 16 S rRNA were tested for their ability to inhibit protein synthesis.

30|$|Many {{pieces of}} work have {{been devoted to}} design <b>radar</b> <b>sequences</b> which are capable of {{spectrum}} compatibility. For instance, the sequence designing technique proposed by Gerlach [10] can generate sequences with some desired spectral nulls by appending polyphase codes on a stepped frequency modulated pulse. Selesnick and Pillai [11] devote themselves to produce constant modulus waveforms with multiple notches in their frequency spectra (2011). Moreover, some waveform design algorithms are exploited for both spectrum location and auto-correlation function (ACF) requirements. For example, the technique developed by Lindenfeld [12] achieves frequency stop-band suppression and range sidelobe minimization by the joint design of the transmit signal and the receive filter (2004). Stop cyclic algorithm new (SCAN), proposed by He et al. [13], implements the spectrum space operation to consider both the stop-band suppression and the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) suppression (2010). A sparse frequency constant modulus sequence design algorithm, built by Wang and Lu [14], optimizes both the ISL metric and a penalty function which accounts for the sequence frequency allocation (2011). A spectrum-centric sequence design approach, proposed by Patton et al. [15], minimizes the transmitted energy over some frequency bands under the uni-modularity and ACF masking constraint (2012).|$|R
