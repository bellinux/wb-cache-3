25|$|Although {{urban water}} tariffs are high by {{regional}} standards (60 KSh or US$0.60 per m3 on average in 2014), these tariffs only allow the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> operating <b>costs,</b> {{but not the}} <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>costs.</b> Full cost recovery is not achieved due to various reasons, including {{a high level of}} non-revenue water (average of 42%). Based on the unit <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> production, the nationwide losses due to non-revenue water in 2014 were estimated at 5.2 billion KSh, equivalent to US$52 million. Another reason is the need to tap distant water sources at a high cost in some locations. For example, Mombasa is supplied from a source located 220km from the city. Although 16% of Kenyans in urban areas have access to sewerage, there is no sewerage levy in Kenya, making this expensive service essentially free of charge.|$|R

5000|$|Levittown is {{the name}} of seven large {{suburban}} developments created in the United States of America by William Levitt and his company Levitt & Sons. Built after World War II for returning veterans and their new families (though required by Federal Housing Administration (FHA) lenders to be limited to those of [...] "the Caucasian race", as stipulated in housing rent and sales agreements), the communities offered attractive alternatives to cramped central city locations and apartments. He and other builders were guaranteed by the Veterans Administration and the Federal Housing Administration that qualified veterans could receive housing for a fraction of rental costs. Production was modeled in an assembly line manner and thousands of similar or identical homes were produced easily and quickly, allowing rapid <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs.</b> Houses came standard with a white picket fence, greener grasses, and great appliances. Sales of the original Levittown began in March 1947, and 1,400 homes were purchased within the first three hours.|$|E
5000|$|For {{more complex}} cases a process, {{formerly}} called a taxation of costs, {{now known as}} detailed assessment, is used. It is unrelated to [...] "tax" [...] {{in the sense of}} a method of raising government revenue. The successful party must file with the court (unless the other party fails to respond to the notice of assessment) a detailed breakdown of the costs and disbursements incurred, known as a bill of costs which sets out the successful party's claim. The bill is usually prepared by a law costs draftsman, whose skill is often as essential to successful <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> as the skill of a solicitor or barrister is essential to success on the principal issues of the litigation. An officer of the court, Costs Judge or District Judge will then assess the reasonableness of the costs (unless the potential paying party failed to respond to the notice of assessment) with reference to a statutory schedule of limits of entitlements of costs, together with legal precedents, unless the costs can be agreed between the parties. The level of reduction can mean that the bill is reduced in some instances substantially, but in most cases at least 80% of the costs originally sought will be allowed. A court order for costs is enforceable as a debt against the unsuccessful party.|$|E

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{it has been}} usual in the Netherlands for local authorities to acquire land for development, to prepare it for building, and then make building lots available through sale or leasehold.

These land purchases changed the context in which local authorities had to operate in the development of land.

40|$|The {{mainstay}} of the public transport system in Kerala is the private stage carriages (PSC), the economics of operation {{of which is the}} subject of this paper. The long run sustainability of the sector depends on the full <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs.</b> In the presence of fixed costs, there are various approaches to the full <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and Kerala has taken the approach of regular fare revision ostensibly to cover costs based on committee recommendations. Since 1999, fares are being revised on the basis of the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre's price index for stage carriage operations (PISCO) applicable in Kerala, which, it is argued here, is one of the causes of the poor sustainability of the industry. PISCO uses average kilometers run and average concessional load factor in the computation of fares, which leads to a situation of those running above average kilometers, and carrying below average concessional load factor making above average profits and others not covering their costs. The use of weighted load factor raises general fares with the travelling public, and not the society at large, subsidizing the concessional passengers. One of the solutions to this problem lies, firstly in moving over to two - part tariff and secondly to tax financing of student subsidy.
