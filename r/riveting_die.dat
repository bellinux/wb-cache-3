40|$|Abstract. Lightweight materials, such as {{aluminum}} die castings, {{are used}} {{more and more}} for automotive applications. Due to the limited weldability, joining these materials by self-pierce riveting has been established. The challenge {{in this regard is}} that these materials, especially new high strength aluminum die castings, have a limited ductility, while the joining processes locally induce large plastic deformations. Consequently, joining by forming of these materials can be accompanied by cracks, which develop during the forming operation. This paper shows the experimental and numerical investigation of a new die concept for self-pierce riveting materials with limited ductility. At the new tool concept the <b>riveting</b> <b>die</b> is separated and a movable die element is used. This element allows that the parts are superimposed with compressive stresses during the self-pierce riveting process. In the paper it can be shown, that in contrast to the conventional process crack-free joints can be generated by using the new tool concept. Determination of the joining parameters and the die design was supported by simulative investigations. Additionally, the new and the conventional self-pierce riveting process are compared on the basis of results from the experimental investigations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a parametric {{study of the}} mechanical behaviour of self-pierced riveted (SPR) joints of steel sheets in two loading conditions (lap-shear and cross-tension). Higher strength was always observed in lap-shear testing than in cross-tension. In both loading conditions, {{the strength of a}} joint was greatly influenced by the hardness and thickness of sheet materials and die depth. An empirical model was developed to predict the joint strength in cross-tension loading using characteristic joint data determined directly from the SPR process (force-displacement) curve. All predictions of joint strength fell within 10 % of the measured joint strength. Finally, a relationship was established between the joint strength in lap shear and cross-tension with < 8 % error. The developed relationship provides a useful tool for further studies especially for different <b>rivet</b> and <b>die</b> geometry...|$|R
40|$|Self {{piercing}} riveted {{connections are}} increasingly used in steel framed housing in Australia. It involves the joining {{of two or}} more plates by using a rivet to pierce and clinch in a single operation. In order to enhance the use of this efficient connection technology, attempts were made recently to develop a universal rivet type {{that can be used in}} most steel house frame assemblies. This required structural testing of the new rivet type in two and three plate assemblies to determine their strengths and the effects of many influential parameters such as steel thickness and grade, order of joining and the number of plates, <b>rivet</b> and <b>die</b> types. More than 150 standard lap shear tests were undertaken for this purpose. This paper presents the results from this experimental study and the results. 1...|$|R

Published work relating to finite element analysis of SPR joints is reviewed in this paper, in terms of process, static strength, fatigue strength, vibration characteristics and assembly dimensional prediction of the SPR joints. A few important numerical issues are discussed, including material modelling, meshing procedure, failure criteria and friction between substrates and between rivet and Substrate. It is concluded that the finite element analysis of SPR joints will help future applications of SPR by allowing system parameters to be selected to give as large a process window as possible for successful joint manufacture. This will allow many tests to be simulated that would currently take too long to perform or be prohibitively expensive in practice, such as modifications to <b>rivet</b> geometry, <b>die</b> geometry or material properties.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of the self-piercing riveting (SPR) technology {{in recent years has}} broadened the application of the technology in the automobile industry. However, the SPR process currently utilises high-strength steel rivets; and the combination between steel rivets with an aluminium car body makes recycling a challenge. The possibility of replacing a steel self-piercing rivet with an aluminium one has thus been raised as an interesting topic. Within this framework, the objective of the present paper is to provide an experimental database on the riveting process using an aluminium self-piercing rivet. An experimental programme has been carried out, where two similar sheets in aluminium alloy 6060 in three different tempers (temper W, temper T 4, and temper T 6) have been joined by using a self-piercing rivet in three different alloys, i. e. 6082 -T 6, 7108 -T 5, and 7278 -T 6. The influence of the die shape on the SPR of aluminium sheets using aluminium rivets was also considered. Conventional <b>rivets</b> and <b>dies</b> according to the Boellhoff standards were employed. The test results were exploited in terms of the riveting force–displacement curves and cross-sectional geometries of the riveted joints. The test data were also used to validate a 2 D-axisymmetric model, which was originally developed at SIMLab for modelling the riveting process using a steel rivet. Finally, the mechanical behaviour of a riveted connection using an aluminium rivet under quasi-static loading conditions (i. e. combined pure shear and pure opening loads) was experimentally studied and compared with corresponding tests using a steel rivet in terms of force–displacement curves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{self-piercing}} riveting (SPR) {{is a major}} technology used by manufacturers to join aluminium body structures to reduce vehicle weight. Normally, for SPR of one specific stack more than one <b>die,</b> <b>rivet,</b> and velocity combination can be applied. Which parameter combination is chosen is depending on the surrounding joints. In order to increase productivity and {{reduce the number of}} robots used, it is preferred to use the same rivet/die combination for as many joints as possible. This means for the same stack, different die may be used. To see the influence of die profiles on joint quality, a DF die, which would generate severe cracks and a DC die, which would generate no cracks or only small cracks, were used to join two stacks with a high strength aluminium alloy, AA 6008 T 61, as the bottom layer. The joint quality was analyzed, and the static and fatigue strengths of these stacks were studied. Results showed that cracks on joint buttons might reduce static and fatigue lap shear strength but had no obvious influence on static and fatigue T peel strength for the joints studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of alternative materials {{and in particular}} aluminium alloys, for vehicle body applications has impelled {{the development of new}} joining techniques. Traditional joining methods such as spot-welding and arc-welding are being challenged. Self-piercing riveting has attracted considerable interest by the automotive industry and has been used as an alternative to spot-welding in vehicle body assembly. However, self-piercing riveting is a relatively new joining method and as such it is not well understood. The aim of this project was therefore to develop an understanding of the mechanical behaviour of self-piercing riveted joints. The effects of paint-baking, shelf-life, pre-straining and surface condition of the sheet material on the joint quality and behaviour were therefore examined. Aluminium alloy sheet materials, 5754 and AA 6111, were used in this investigation. The project began with a metallographic inspection of cross-sections of samples that were joined under different conditions in order to examine the effect of process variables on the joint quality. This part of the investigation led to the identification of suitable setting parameters that produced joints which, by metallographic inspection, were of good quality. It was also observed that some process variables, such as sheet thickness combination, <b>rivet</b> and <b>die</b> design and setting force, affected the joint quality and therefore needed to be taken into consideration in the choice of the processing parameters. Subsequent work focused on mechanical testing. Lap shear, T-peel, pull-out and fatigue tests were carried out in order to examine the mechanical behaviour and to analyse the failure mechanisms of the joints. The work showed that the strength, the thickness and the surface condition of the riveted sheets affected the strength and the failure mechanisms of the joints. The joint strength was also observed to be dependent on the rivet and anvil design as well as the setting force. In addition, the joint strength and behaviour differed as the specimen geometry thus emphasising the need for a test standard for self-piercing riveted joints. Paint baking led to a marginal and insignificant reduction in the static strength, whilst resulting in a reduction in the fatigue strength of the joints as a consequence of recovery of the 5754 alloy and the removal of the wax-based surface lubricant.

40|$|Regarding {{the use of}} material, modern {{lightweight}} car {{bodies are}} becoming more and more complex than previous constructions. The materials nowadays are used for a more specific field of application and more high strength steels are used and also other materials like aluminium, stainless steel, reinforced polymers are used more frequent. The joining of these materials often requires new or modified joining processes. The aim with this thesis is concerned with the development of simulation models of the joining process as well as mechanical properties of self piercing riveted (SPR) joints and pierce nut joints. In both of these joining methods problems occur when introducing more high strength steel sheets. For SPR, fractures occur in the rivet, and for pierce nut the thread will be damaged. Since both the SPR process and the pierce nut process expose the material for plastic deformation up to 150 %, correct material properties for very large strain and a simulation program that could handle this was required. With the commercial finite element program Deform 2 D an axi-symmetric model has been built for the SPR process and the pierce nut process. Because of the computational time, 3 D simulations were only used where it was necessary. The developed 3 D models use the commercial finite element program ABAQUS-Explicit. All simulation models have been verified with satisfactory agreement to experimental results. For SPR, an axi-symmetric simulation model was used for evaluating and optimising the setting process in the stainless steel sheets EN 1. 4301, HyTens 800 and HyTens 1200. Subsequently, 3 D models were used for predicting the mechanical properties of new SPR joints that have showed reduced risk for rivet cracking. In pierce nut simulations, nuts with hardness 8 and 10 have been set in the high strength steel sheet DP 600. An axi-symmetric simulation model was used for centred nut setting and two different simulation models in 3 D were used to evaluate eccentric nut setting and torque resistance. This work resulted in more knowledge about the fracture risk in the rivet and how to reduce it. The strain and stress, which was used as fracture indicators, were reduced to the half with modifications of the <b>rivet</b> and the <b>die</b> geometry. Mechanical property simulations in shear and peel load resulted in satisfactory results for new SPR joints that have showed reduced fracture risk during <b>rivet</b> setting. New <b>die</b> and <b>rivet</b> designs can be developed effectively by combining the process and mechanical property simulations. For a pierce nut joint in high strength steel sheets (1. 5 mm DP 600), the simulations show that the cutting of the sheet in combination with eccentric setting over the die causes the thread damage. The thread damage can be avoided by changing the dimension of the nut or by increasing the strength of the nut material. The simulation models can also be used to develop new nut and die geometries for future applications. QC 2010111...|$|R
