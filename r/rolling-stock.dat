In May 1999, as THSRC faced {{difficulties in}} raising capital, {{the government of}} Japan promised soft loans if THSRC switched to TSC. Although Eurotrain promised to match TSC's financial offerings, the Eschede train disaster in combination with TSC offered the newer 700 Series Shinkansen, convinced THSRC to reopen core system bid, and ultimately resulting in TSC selected as the preferred <b>rolling-stock</b> supplier in December 1999. Although Eurotrain eventually conceded in the bid, in February 2001 it filed for a US$800 million damage claim against THSRC at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. After a lengthy arbitration process, the court ruled in March 2004 that THSRC should pay a compensation for the US$32.4 million Eurotrain spent on development and US$35.7 million for unjust enrichment. THSRC agreed to pay US$65 million (US$89 million with interest) to Eurotrain in November 2004.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a demand-responsive {{decision}} support system is proposed by integrating the operations of coal shipment, coal stockpiles and coal railing within a whole system. A generic and flexible scheduling optimisation methodology is developed to identify, represent, model, solve and analyse the coal transport problem in a standard and convenient way. As a result, the integrated train-stockpile-ship timetable is created and optimised for improving overall efficiency of coal transport system. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis based on extensive computational experiments is conducted to validate the proposed methodology. The mathematical proposition and proof are concluded as technical and insightful advices for industry practice. The proposed methodology provides better decision making on how to assign rail <b>rolling-stocks</b> and upgrade infrastructure in order to significantly improve capacity utilisation with the best resource-effectiveness ratio. The proposed {{decision support}} system with train-stockpile-ship scheduling optimisation techniques is promising to be applied in railway or mining industry, especially as a useful quantitative decision making tool {{on how to use}} more current <b>rolling-stocks</b> or whether to buy additional <b>rolling-stocks</b> for mining transportation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} {{maintaining}} rolling stock is to perform train service without failure during operation. It {{is not possible}} to prevent failure, however, by using periodic preventive maintenance methods, because new rolling stock is made from many electric components and requires the application of IT skills.

With this approach it is possible to verify the reliability at the operating stage, and RCM (Reliability Centered Maintenance) methods for maintenance have been applied to manufactured rolling stock since the beginning of KTX ser-vice.

Among the possible accidents, fires can induce very problematic evacuation situations and a lot of difficulties for the rescue access and operations. All over the world, important accidents have occurred, with or without victims and they widely justify the research projects such as EUREKA FIRETUN 499 (1) or MEMORIAL TUNNEL (2). Concerning rail tunnels, fires are frequently <b>rolling-stocks</b> fires. Many studies have been conducted on coach fires but few results are published on locomotive fires and their consequences (3). It is true that locomotives have often got security systems for fire detection and extinction and then consequences of these fires are generally reduced to incidents causing only little harm.

6000|$|For {{the time}} being Germany's {{transport}} system {{will be much more}} seriously disordered by the provisions relating to the cession of <b>rolling-stock.</b> Under paragraph 7 of the Armistice conditions Germany was called on to surrender 5000 locomotives and 150,000 wagons, [...] "in good working order, with all necessary spare parts and fittings." [...] Under the Treaty Germany is required to confirm this surrender and to recognize the title of the Allies to the material.[66] She is further required, in the case of railway systems in ceded territory, to hand over these systems complete with their full complement of <b>rolling-stock</b> [...] "in a normal state of upkeep" [...] as shown in the last inventory before November 11, 1918.[67] That is to say, ceded railway systems are not to bear any share in the general depletion and deterioration of the German <b>rolling-stock</b> as a whole.|$|E

A number of locomotives were sent to Winchester along the highroad, drawn by teams of horses. Forty engines and three hundred cars were burned or destroyed, and Jackson then advanced and took up his position on the road to Williamsport, the cavalry camp being a little in advance of him.

Another locomotive whistled, and another train came through at top speed, and another, and another, train after train, train after train, till toward the last the trains were composed of passenger coaches, box-cars, flat-cars, dead engines, cabooses, mail-cars, wrecking appliances, and all the riff-raff of worn-out and abandoned <b>rolling-stock</b> that collects in the yards of great railways.

Pattern-makers to make wooden patterns for castings. Moulders, including loam, dry-sand and green-sand moulders and brass-founders. Dressers to dress the rough edges off the castings when brought from the foundry. Turners in iron and brass. Planers and nibblers, and slotters and drillers. Joiners and sawyers, and coach-builders and painters. Fitters and erecters, to do the rougher and heavier part of fitting the engines together. Boiler-makers, including platers or fitters, caulkers and riveters. Finishers to do the finer part of fitting--details and polishing.

6000|$|There was, of course, {{something}} to be said for the other plan, which was advocated strongly by Sir Charles Warren. The crossing, it was urged, was absolutely safe, being commanded on all sides by our guns, and the enemy could make no opposition except with artillery. Moreover, the army would get on its line of railway and could 'advance along the railroad.' This last was a purely imaginary advantage, to be sure, because the railway had no <b>rolling-stock,</b> and was disconnected from the rest of the line by the destruction of the Tugela bridge. But what weighed with the Commander-in-Chief much more than the representations of his lieutenant was the accumulating evidence that the enemy were in full retreat. The Intelligence reports all pointed to this situation. Boers had ridden off in all directions. Waggons were seen trekking along every road to the north and west. The camps between us and Ladysmith began to break up. Everyone said, 'This is the result of Lord Roberts's advance: the Boers find themselves now too weak to hold us off. They have raised the siege.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{even when}} coal can be got and grain harvested, the {{breakdown}} of the European railway system prevents their carriage; and even when goods can be manufactured, {{the breakdown of}} the European currency system prevents their sale. I have already described the losses, by war and under the Armistice surrenders, to the transport system of Germany. But even so, Germany's position, taking account of her power of replacement by manufacture, is probably not so serious as that of some of her neighbors. In Russia (about which, however, we have very little exact or accurate information) the condition of the <b>rolling-stock</b> is believed to be altogether desperate, {{and one of the most}} fundamental factors in her existing economic disorder. And in Poland, Roumania, and Hungary the position is not much better. Yet modern industrial life essentially depends on efficient transport facilities, and the population which secured its livelihood by these means cannot continue to live without them. The breakdown of currency, and the distrust in its purchasing value, is an aggravation of these evils which must be discussed in a little more detail in connection with foreign trade.|$|E
