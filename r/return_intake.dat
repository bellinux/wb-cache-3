40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{clinical}} characteristics of an adult chemical ingestion population and examine the course of <b>return</b> to oral <b>intake</b> post injury and speech-language pathologist (SLP) involvement during the initial acute-care admission. A retrospective chart review of adults admitted to a quaternary hospital {{for the treatment of}} an acute chemical ingestion injury between 2008 and 2012 was conducted. Forty-four adults (23 men, 21 women) were identified as receiving treatment for ingestion injury, of whom 18 (40. 91 %) required altered oral intake. Of those requiring altered oral intake, 50 % were referred to SLPs. Individuals requiring altered oral intake were significantly (p <. 05) older, more likely to be men, and present with more severe injuries requiring longer ICU and hospital admissions following intentional chemical ingestions than those who were able to commence a normal oral diet without any alteration or nonoral supplementation. By discharge, 15. 91 % (n = 7) of the total cohort had not resumed normal oral <b>intake.</b> <b>Return</b> to oral <b>intake</b> post chemical ingestion injury can be protracted and complex. Referrals to SLPs were limited. These data may aid prognostic insight as well as provide (a) collateral information to assist discharge planning and follow-up and (b) background for evaluating the potential for SLP involvement...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{patterns}} of swallowing resolution and outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in an acute care setting and document the risk factors or predictors of resolution of swallowing function. Participants: 117 consecutive TBI patients who had received speech pathology intervention for dysphagia during acute postinjury care. Main outcome measure: Temporal measures relating to pattern of resolution of dysphagia postinjury. Results: 75 % of patients were assessed by 2 weeks postinjury, commenced oral intake by 17 days, and ceased supplementation by 3 weeks. By an average of 22 days after admission, 47 % had progressed to normal-consistency diet and fluids. Duration to the first swallowing assessment was a predictor for achieving total oral <b>intake</b> and <b>returning</b> to normal <b>intake.</b> There was some preliminary support for severity of CT data and presence/absence of a tracheostomy as predictors for <b>return</b> to normal <b>intake.</b> Conclusion: The current data document {{the natural history of}} swallowing resolution and proposes prognostic factors for patients with impaired swallowing following TBI. Establishing clinical parameters that can help predict patterns of swallowing resolution over the course of acute care admission may greatly assist inpatient management and discharge/rehabilitation planning...|$|R

40|$|Liver fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a {{regulatory}} enzyme in gluconeogenesis that is elevated by obesity and dietary fat intake. Whether FBPase functions only to regulate glucose or has other metabolic consequences is not clear; therefore, {{the aim of}} this study was to determine the importance of liver FBPase in body weight regulation. To this end we performed comprehensive physiologic and biochemical assessments of energy balance in liver-specific transgenic FBPase mice and negative control littermates of both sexes. In addition, hepatic branch vagotomies and pharmacologic inhibition studies were performed to confirm the role of FBPase. Compared with negative littermates, liver-specific FBPase transgenic mice had 50 % less adiposity and ate 15 % less food but did not have altered energy expenditure. The reduced food consumption was associated with increased circulating leptin and cholecystokinin, elevated fatty acid oxidation, and 3 -beta-hydroxybutyrate ketone levels, and reduced appetite-stimulating neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y and Agouti-related peptide. Hepatic branch vagotomy and direct pharmacologic inhibition of FBPase in transgenic mice both <b>returned</b> food <b>intake</b> and body weight to the negative littermates. This is the first study to identify liver FBPase as a previously unknown regulator of appetite and adiposity and describes a novel process by which the liver participates in body weight regulation.

5000|$|... #Caption: Working {{mechanism}} of a valveless pulse jet engine. The basic {{idea is that}} the column of air in the long exhaust pipe functions like the piston of a reciprocating engine. From another point of view, the engine is an acoustic resonator internally excited by resonating combustions in the chamber. The chamber acts as a pressure antinode which is compressed by the <b>returning</b> wave. The <b>intake</b> pipe acts as a kinematic antinode which sucks and exhausts gas. Note the longer length of the exhaust pipe—this is important as it prevents oxygen from entering the wrong way and igniting the system the wrong way. It does this because when the pulse ignites, there is still some exhaust gas in the exhaust pipe. That is sucked in before any additional oxygen is sucked in. Of course, the air intake pipe has already supplied the oxygen by that point and the pulse reignites.|$|R
40|$|In poor {{societies}} where {{nutrition and}} health status is very low, consumption of basic needs amounts to investment. It enhances labour productivity and reduces morbidity. In this paper it is shown that inequality can persist in rural Ethiopia {{due to the}} existence the low nutrition- low productivity trap. It is done mainly by establishing the link between nutrition and health {{on the one hand}} and labour productivity on the other. Using a panel data from rural Ethiopian households, farm production functions as well as earnings functions are estimated. In both cases, calorie intakes do affect the labour productivity of farm households. However, the effect of the stock of nutrition on productivity is observed only in the earnings function. For workers employed in social safety nets such as food for work programs, the productivity effect of nutrition is minimal. Moreover our estimates indicate that the <b>returns</b> to calorie <b>intakes</b> are much larger than that of chemical fertilizers. ...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol {{deprivation}} effect (ADE), {{defined as}} a temporary increase in voluntary alcohol intake following a period of alcohol abstinence, was evaluated in selectively bred Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats. Alcohol was initially offered in free choice with water for 35 consecutive days (predeprivation phase). Subsequently, one group of rats was deprived of alcohol for 1, 3, 7, 15, 30, 90 or 180 consecutive days, while the second group had continuous access to alcohol (deprivation phase). Once alcohol was re-presented, alcohol intake in alcohol-deprived rats was recorded 1 and 24 h after alcohol re-presentation and compared to that monitored in alcohol-nondeprived rats over the same time periods (postdeprivation phase). Alcohol deprivation for 3 to 30 days resulted in {{a significant increase in}} voluntary alcohol intake only in the first hour of re-access. These results demonstrate the development of ADE in sP rats. However, the rapid <b>return</b> of alcohol <b>intake</b> to control levels is discussed as evidence in favor of a set-point mechanism capable of regulating alcohol-drinking behavior in sP rats.

40|$|Mature male Polish rabbits were {{subjected}} to varying gravitational fields in an animal centrifuge in order to evaluate the effects of acceleration and deacceleration on body mass, body composition, and food intake. The acceleration field intensity was increased by 0. 25 -G increments {{to a maximum of}} 2. 5 G at intervals which permitted physiological adaptation at each field. Control animals of the same age were maintained at earth gravity under identical conditions of constant-light environment at a room temperature of 23 + or - 5 C. It is shown that increasing the acceleration-field intensity leads to a decrease in body mass. The regulated nature of this decreased body mass is tested by the response to an additional three-day fasting of animals adapted physiologically to 2. 5 G. Ad libitum food intake per kg body mass per day tends to increase in chronically accelerated animals above 1. 75 G. Increase in water content in centrifuged animals after physiological adaptation to 2. 5 G is the result of decreasing body fat.

40|$|ObjectiveWe present our {{experience}} with laparoscopic adrenalectomy for benign adrenal diseases and compare clinical outcomes with the conventional open approach. MethodsBetween 1990 and 2001, two consecutive series {{of patients who}} underwent adrenal-ectomy for small, benign adrenal diseases were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with large tumours (> 7 cm), cancer and phaeochromocytoma were excluded. Fifty-eight patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy and 48 patients had open surgery for benign adrenal diseases. Perioperative and postoperative records of both approaches were reviewed. ResultsThe two groups were comparable in terms of patient age, sex, weight and side of lesion. The common indications for surgery were Conn's syndrome and Cushing's syndrome. The sizes of tumour were comparable between the laparoscopic and open groups (mean, 2. 1 cm vs 2. 4 cm). Despite the longer operating time (mean, 128 minutes vs 87 minutes), thepostoperative morbidity, parenteral analgesic requirement and length of postoperative hospital stay (3. 2 days vs 7. 2 days) were less in patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Patients also enjoyed earlier <b>return</b> to oral <b>intake</b> and ambulation. There were fewer complications in the laparoscopic group. There was no conversion to open surgery.

30|$|The {{three cases}} {{described}} herein suggest that SEMS placement {{can be a}} good strategy as a BTS for LBO associated with a good response to NAT. In general, three treatment options are available for LBO: an emergency operation, transanal decompression tube placement, and SEMS placement. SEMS placement as a BTS is a widely accepted alternative intervention for malignant LBO because its short-term outcomes and preoperative quality of life are better than those of emergency surgery and transanal decompression tube placement [12, 13]. Preoperative worse nutritional and immunological status is well known to be a risk of postoperative complications after colorectal cancer surgery [14, 15]. Therefore, a plausible contributing factor for better short-term outcomes of BTS strategy using SEMS is a quick and sufficient preoperative recovery of general and intestinal conditions after SEMS placement compared with other treatment choices [13]. However, the feasibility and effectiveness of SEMS placement for LBO induced by effective NAT has not been evaluated. Incidentally, for patients with esophageal cancer who develop stenosis after radiotherapy and chemotherapy, stent therapy is clinically recommended to achieve a <b>return</b> to oral <b>intake</b> according to the Japanese guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of esophageal carcinoma [16]. A previous study showed that polyflex stent placement to treat malignant dysphagia in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer during NAT such as neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy is safe and allows oral feeding [17].|$|R

Animals were divided into treated and control groups. Vanadyl sulphate {{was added to the}} drinking water of the treated animals at a concentration of 1 mg mL - 1 up to three months. Two months after vanadyl sulphate withdrawal animals were killed. Ultrastructure of islet beta cells were studied by transmission electron microscope.

Lymphocyte filteration, nuclear picnosis, cytoplasmic vacuolization were found frequently in the islet beta cells of untreated diabetic rats. In conclusion as was evident in thin sections of panceatic islet beta cells of treated diabetic rats in this study, vanadyl sulphate through preserving islet beta cells structure and ultrastructure contributes in reversing diabetic signs and symptoms in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats...|$|R

In LMTK cells transfected with the human NPY Y 5 receptor, CGP 71683 A was without intrinsic activity and antagonized NPY-induced Ca 2 + transients. CGP 71683 A was given intraperitoneally (dose range 1 - 100 mg/kg) {{to a series of}} animal models of high hypothalamic NPY levels. In lean satiated rats CGP 71683 A significantly antagonized the increase in food intake induced by intracerebroventricular injection of NPY. In 24 -h fasted and streptozotocin diabetic rats CGP 71683 A dose-dependently inhibited food intake. During the dark phase, CGP 71683 A dose-dependently inhibited food intake in free-feeding lean rats without affecting the normal pattern of food intake or inducing taste aversion. In free-feeding lean rats, intraperitoneal administration of CGP 71683 A for 28 d inhibited food intake dose-dependently with a maximum reduction observed on days 3 and 4. Despite the <b>return</b> of food <b>intake</b> to control levels, body weight and the peripheral fat mass remained significantly reduced. The data demonstrate that the NPY Y 5 receptor subtype plays a role in NPY-induced food intake, but also suggest that, with chronic blockade, counterregulatory mechanisms are induced to restore appetite...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} autumn vitamin D intake and status in 7 -year-old Icelanders, fitting BMI and cardiorespiratory fitness as predictors. Three-day food records and fasting blood samples were collected evenly from September to November, and cardiorespiratory fitness was measured with an ergometer bike. Food and nutrient intakes were calculated, and serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (s- 25 (OH) D) and serum parathyroid hormone were analysed. Suboptimal vitamin D status was defined s- 25 (OH) D < 50 nmol/l, and deficient status as s- 25 (OH) D < 25 nmol/l. School-based study in Reykjavik, Iceland in 2006. Of the 7 -year-olds studied (n 265), 165 <b>returned</b> valid <b>intake</b> information (62 %), 158 gave blood samples (60 %) and 120 gave both (45 %). Recommended vitamin D intake (10 μg/d) was reached by 22 · 4 % {{of the children and}} 65 · 2 % had s- 25 (OH) D < 50 nmol/l. Median s- 25 (OH) D was higher for children taking vitamin D supplements (49 · 2 nmol/l v. 43 · 2 nmol/l, respectively; P < 0 · 0 0 1). Median s- 25 (OH) D was lower in November (36 · 7 nmol/l) than in September (59 · 9 nmol/l; P < 0 · 001). The regression model showed that week of autumn accounted for 18 · 9 % of the variance in s- 25 (OH) D (P < 0 · 001), vitamin D intake 5 · 2 % (P < 0 · 004) and cardiorespiratory fitness 4 · 6 % (P < 0 · 005). A minority of children followed the vitamin D recommendations and 65 % had suboptimal vitamin D status during the autumn. Week of autumn was more strongly associated with vitamin D status than diet or cardiorespiratory fitness, which associated with vitamin D status to a similar extent. These results demonstrate the importance of sunlight exposure during summer to prevent suboptimal vitamin D status in young schoolchildren during autumn in northern countries. An increased effort is needed for enabling adherence to the vitamin D recommendations and increasing outdoor activities for sunlight exposure...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: A prospective, randomized, {{double-blind}} study was completed comparing intraoperative chemical splanchnicectomy with 50 % alcohol versus a placebo injection of saline {{in patients with}} histologically proven unresectable pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Standardized assessment of pain, mood, and disability due to pain was completed preoperatively and at 2 -month intervals until death. Chemical splanchnicectomy with alcohol was performed in 65 patients, whereas 72 patients received the placebo. The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex, location, and stage of tumor, operation performed, the use of postoperative chemo- and radiation therapy, and initial assessment scores for pain, mood, and disability. RESULTS: No differences in hospital mortality or complications, <b>return</b> to oral <b>intake,</b> or length of hospital stay were observed. Mean pain scores were significantly lower in the alcohol group at 2 -, 4 -, and 6 -month follow-up and at the final assessment (p < 0. 05). To further {{determine the effect of}} chemical splanchnicectomy, patients were stratified into those with and without preoperative pain. In patients without preoperative pain, alcohol significantly reduced pain scores and delayed or prevented the subsequent onset of pain (p < 0. 05). In patients with significant preoperative pain, alcohol significantly reduced existing pain (p < 0. 05). Furthermore, patients with preexisting pain who received alcohol showed a significant improvement in survival when compared with controls (p < 0. 0001).

Methods: Patients who underwent BMG harvest for urethroplasty were randomized into 2 groups; in group 1 donor site was closed and in group 2 it was left open. Self made questionnaires {{were used to assess}} post-operative pain, limitation to mouth opening, loss of sensation at graft site. The time to resumption of liquid and solid diet were also noted. Results: Fifty patients were studied, 25 in each group from July 2003 to July 2005. BMG was harvested from single cheek in most of the patients. Mean post operative pain score was 4. 20 and 3. 08 at day 1 in group 1 and group 2, respectively (P < 0. 05). <b>Return</b> to oral <b>intake</b> in terms of liquid and solid diet was comparable between the groups. Difficulty with mouth opening was maximal during the first week with no difference among the two groups. Two patients in group 1 and one in group 2 had persistent peri-oral numbness at 6 months.

The effects of 3 days of dehydration and 2 days of rehydration on body weight (BW), blood constituents and urine excretion were monitored. The daily feed intake was significantly decreased by water deprivation. The feed <b>intake</b> <b>returned</b> to control level within 2 days after rehydration. The mean (BW) decreased significantly (20. 2 %) in dehydrated animals. The loss in (BW) was recovered immediately after drinking. Water deprivation resulted in a significant increase in rectal temperature (Tr), it returned to normal level after drinking. There was marked significant increase in packed cell volume (PCV) in dehydrated animals, the (PCV) returned to normal level after rehydration. Water deprivation was associated with significant increases in serum concentrations of total protein, albumin, urea and creatinine, after rehydration, these parameters returned to the control level, except albumin. Water deprivation and rehydration had no significant effect on plasma glucose and serum sodium (Na) and potassium (K) levels. Serum osmolality increased progressively and significantly during water deprivation and returned to normal level on the second day of rehydration. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urine volume decreased significantly during dehydration and returned to normal level in the second day of rehydration.

40|$|Amphetamines are {{frequently}} used as anorexigenic drugs to facilitate fasting and weight loss, although some side effects are known. The {{objective of the}} study was to study the effects of fasting induced by amphetamine administration as compared to food restriction alone on skeletal muscle. Twelve male Wistar rats were assigned to three groups: One group (AMPH) received d-amphetamine sulphate during 14 days (20 mg/Kg/day, s. c.); group FRES was the pair-fed, food restricted control receiving each day the same quantity of food consumed by the AMPH group the day before; a control group (CONT) was fed ad libitum. Food intake and body weights were controlled daily. After 14 days the animals were sacrificed and the soleus muscles were removed for light and electron microscopical evaluation and muscle fiber morphometry. Towards the end of the experimental period, food <b>intake</b> <b>returned</b> to normal in the AMPH group due to amphetamine tolerance. The AMPH and FRES animals experienced a comparable weight loss of about 15 %. The muscles fibers of the AMPH and FRES group showed a slightly (n. s.) higher incidence of central nuclei than the CONT group. Their muscle fibers atrophied by about 25 %. Signs of degeneration and regeneration were observed at the ultrastructural level in both experimental groups. It is concluded that the deleterious effects on skeletal muscle are rather the common result of the alimentary restriction than the particular effect of amphetamine.

Histologic examination of the engrafted tumors revealed a well encapsulated tumor with no evidence of metastatic disease. The transplanted insulinomas maintained well differentiated histologic features without evidence of necrosis. Immunopathologic studies failed to reveal any evidence of either humoral or cell mediated immunity directed toward the allograft. Each animal was successfully transplanted with a 1 mm tumor explant. A single rodent tumor donor provided adequate material for engraftment for five recipients. The transplanted insulinomas maintained full functional and enzymatic capabilities. Similar studies utilizing the hamster insulinoma engrafted into the athymic nude mouse showed amelioration of the same diabetic symptomatology.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} concomitant infections with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae on growth performance, serum metabolite concentrations, and serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in growing pigs. Twenty-two barrows (10 weeks of age) were treated with either an intranasal administration of PRRSV and an intratracheal infusion of M. hyopneumoniae (treatment; n = 8) or a sham inoculation with medium (sham; n = 8), or were not treated (control; n = 6). The sham pigs were matched by body weight and pair-wise fed with treatment pigs. Pigs were weighed {{on the day of}} inoculation (day 0) and at 4 weeks postinoculation (day 28). Blood samples were collected prior to inoculation and at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. Pigs in the treatment group exhibited clinical signs consistent with PRRSV infection and M. hyopneumoniae pneumonia. Diagnostic procedures confirmed that treatment pigs were inoculated with PRRSV and M. hyopneumoniae and that sham and control pigs remained free of both pathogens. Average daily gain and feed conversion did not differ among the 3 groups. The IGF-I levels differed (P < 0. 05) between control and treatment pigs, even after feed <b>intake</b> <b>returned</b> to similar levels among groups. At day 7, IGF-I concentrations were greater in sham pigs compared with treatment pigs, despite similar feed intake. Sham inoculation and decreased feed intake in sham pigs did not alter serum IGF-I concentrations. Evidently, IGF-I status of pigs affected with disease is influenced by nutritional and nonnutritional factors during the disease process...|$|R
40|$|Objectives : To {{provide a}} {{preliminary}} clinical {{profile of the}} resolution and outcomes of oral-motor impairment and swallowing function {{in a group of}} paediatric dysphagia patients post-traumatic brain injury (TBI). To document the level of cognitive impairment parallel to the <b>return</b> to oral <b>intake,</b> and to investigate the correlation between the resolution of impaired swallow function versus the resolution of oral-motor impairment and cognitive impairment. Participants : Thirteen children admitted to an acute care setting for TBI. Main outcome measures : A series of oral-motor (Verbal Motor Production Assessment for Children, Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment, Schedule for Oral Motor Assessment) and swallowing (Paramatta Hospital 2 ̆ 7 s Assessment for Dysphagia) assessments, an outcome measure for swallowing (Royal Brisbane Hospital 2 ̆ 7 s Outcome Measure for Swallowing), and a cognitive rating scale (Rancho Level of Cognitive Functioning Scale). Results : Across the patient group, oral-motor deficits resolved to normal status between 3 and 11 weeks post-referral (and at an average of 12 weeks post-injury) and swallowing function and resolution to normal diet status were achieved by 3 - 11 weeks post-referral (and at an average of 12 weeks post-injury). The resolution of dysphagia and the resolution of oral-motor impairment and cognitive impairment were all highly correlated. Conclusion : The provision of a preliminary profile of oral-motor functioning and dysphagia resolution, and data on the linear relationship between swallowing impairment and cognition, will provide baseline information on the course of rehabilitation of dysphagia in the paediatric population post-TBI. Such data will contribute to more informed service provision and rehabilitation planning for paediatric patients post-TBI...|$|R
40|$|Of all the laparoscopic {{surgical}} {{techniques that}} have been developed in recent years, laparoscopic adrenalectomy {{has become one of the}} most preferred methods for excising adrenal lesions. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the results of 2 different approaches to adrenalectomy-retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy and open adrenalectomy-through a retrospective review of case reports for 53 patients. Thirty-two retroperitoneal and 21 open laparoscopic adrenalectomies were performed between June 1999 and December 2006. The groups were matched for age (in years; p= 0. 516) and body mass index (in kg/m 2; p= 0. 269). The mean tumor sizes were 54. 0 mm (16 ∼ 130) and 45. 4 mm (13 ∼ 80) in the retroperitoneal laparoscopic and open adrenalectomy groups, respectively (p= 0. 086). The affected adrenal glands were successfully removed. An open surgical procedure became necessary in one of the retroperitoneal laparoscopic patients because of severe adhesion to retroperitoneal fat. Retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy was found to be better than open adrenalectomy in terms of estimated blood loss (141 vs. 202 ml; p= 0. 039), duration of postoperative hospitalization (6. 2 vs. 8. 8 days; p= 0. 001), time to <b>return</b> to oral <b>intake</b> (1. 2 vs. 1. 7 days; p= 0. 005), time to ambulation (1. 2 vs. 1. 4 days; p= 0. 013), and time to drain removal (3. 7 vs. 4. 7 days; p= 0. 001). No statistically significant difference in operative time (115 vs. 128 minutes; p= 0. 61) was observed. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was safe and effective fo...|$|R
40|$|With an {{increase}} in gravity load induced by centrifugation or upon return to Earth following spaceflight, there {{is a period of}} adjustment in fluid balance in rats. With centrifugation there is a reduced fluid intake with maintenance of the rate of urine excretion. Following spaceflight there is {{an increase}} in urine output and maintenance of fluid intake. The initial period of acclimation to hypergravity is associated with a net loss of fluids. In the present study in response to centrifugation at 2. 0 G this period of acclimation is present in mature rats {{for a longer period of}} time, about 24 hours. Following this initial response a period of over compensation has previously been reported. In the present study this was not observed. The net effect of these alterations in water intake and output in response to centrifugation for 14 days was slight increase in the percent total body water, with effective compensation seen in both young and mature rats. Older rats have been shown to have a reduced relative thirst and compensatory renal function in response to hypohydration, hyperosmolality and pharmacological stimuli. Responsiveness to these stimuli are delayed and/or attenuated in older animals. Similar findings were noted in the present study in the initial response to centrifugation. The older animal had a delayed <b>return</b> of fluid <b>intake</b> to control levels. The delay of one day did not appear to effect long-term fluid homeostasis, as there was difference in the response of percent total body water at the end of 14 days of centrifugation with both age groups having a slight but significant increase. This increase has been attributed to the increase in lean body mass induced by centrifugation...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Lately, {{the main}} {{technical}} innovations {{in the field}} of colorectal surgery have been the introduction of laparoscopic and robotic techniques; the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the results and the advantages of these two surgical approaches. METHODS: Twenty-two studies including 1652 laparoscopic and 1120 robotic-assisted resections were analyzed and categorized into right, left, and pelvic resections of the middle/low rectum, aiming to the following outcomes: operating time, blood loss, bowel function recovery, <b>return</b> to oral <b>intake,</b> morbidity, hospital stay, and costs. RESULTS: The vast majority of the studies were non-randomized investigations (19 / 22 studies) enrolling small cohorts of patients (median 55. 0 laparoscopic and 34. 5 robotic-assisted group) with a mean age of 62. 2 - 61. 0 years. Funnel plot analysis documented heterogeneity in studies which combined cancers and benign diseases. Our meta-analysis demonstrated a significant difference in favor of laparoscopic procedures regarding costs and operating time (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0. 686 and 0. 493) and in favor of robotic surgery concerning morbidity rate (odds ratio (OR) 0. 763), although no benefits were documented when analyzing exclusively randomized trials. When we differentiated approaches by side of resections, a significant difference was found in favor of the laparoscopic group when analyzing operating time in left-sided and pelvic procedures (SMD 0. 609 and 0. 529) and blood loss in pelvic resections (SMD 0. 339). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic techniques were documented as the shorter procedures, which provided lower blood loss in pelvic resections, while morbidity rate was more favorable in robotic surgery. However, these results could not be confirmed when we focused the analysis on randomized trials only...|$|R
40|$|C 75 is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of fatty acid synthase that acts centrally to reduce food intake and body weight in mice; a single dose causes a rapid (> 90 %) decrease of food intake. These effects are associated with inhibition of fasting-induced up-regulation and down-regulation, respectively, of the expression of orexigenic (NPY and AgRP) and anorexigenic (POMC and CART) neuropeptide messages in the hypothalamus. Repeated administration of C 75 at a submaximal level, however, differentially affected food intake of lean and obese mice. With lean mice, C 75 suppressed food intake by ≈ 50 % and, with obese mice (ob/ob and dietary-induced obesity), by 85 – 95 % during {{the first day of}} treatment. Lean mice, however, became tolerant/resistant to C 75 over the next 2 – 5 days of treatment, with food <b>intake</b> <b>returning</b> to near normal and rebound hyperphagia occurring on cessation of treatment. In contrast, ob/ob obese mice responded to C 75 with a > 90 % suppression of food intake throughout the same period with incipient tolerance becoming evident only after substantial weight loss had occurred. Dietary-induced obese mice exhibited intermediate behavior. In all cases, a substantial loss of body weight resulted. Pair-fed controls lost 24 – 50 % less body weight than C 75 -treated mice, indicating that, in addition to suppressing food intake, C 75 may increase energy expenditure. The decrease in body weight by ob/ob mice was due primarily to loss of body fat. In contrast to the short-term effects of C 75 on “fasting-induced” changes of hypothalamic orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptide mRNAs, repeated administration of C 75 either had the inverse or no effect as tolerance developed...|$|R
40|$|The Biggest Loser {{television}} show is watched {{by millions of}} people worldwide. Obesity experts have criticized its portrayal of an unrealistic intervention that raises false expectations for weight loss. Here, I quantify the diet and exercise intervention using a validated computational model of metabolism to integrate data on energy expenditure, body weight and body fat collected during The Biggest Loser competition. Participant age, body mass index, weight, and percent body fat at baseline were 33 ± 11 y, 48. 7 ± 10. 1 kg/m 2, 144. 9 ± 39. 4 kg, and 49 ± 6 % (mean ± SD), respectively. During {{the first phase of}} the competition when the contestants were isolated in a boot camp environment, the average rate of weight loss was 0. 4 ± 0. 1 kg/d which decreased to 0. 19 ± 0. 1 kg/d after returning home for the final phase. The total weight loss was 58. 2 ± 26 kg with 81. 6 ± 8. 4 % coming from body fat. The computer simulations closely matched the data and calculated that average energy intake during the first phase was 1300 kcal/d while participating in 3. 1 h/d of vigorous exercise. After <b>returning</b> home, energy <b>intake</b> increased to 1900 kcal/d and vigorous exercise decreased to 1. 1 h/d. Simulation of diet alone resulted in 34 kg of weight loss with 65 % coming from body fat, whereas exercise alone resulted in a loss of 27 kg with 102 % from fat. Simulated weight loss maintenance could be achieved with a modest 20 min/d of vigorous exercise and a 3000 kcal/d diet...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Aims: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effects of stress on alcohol {{drinking}} behaviour in male and female mice with a genetic predisposition toward high alcohol preference (HAP 2 line). Methods: Alcohol-naı̈ve male (n = 22) and female (n = 23) HAP 2 mice were assigned to a restraint stress or no stress control group. Stress was initially applied for 2 h per day on 10 consecutive days. All mice were then given daily 2 h limited-access to a 10 % v/v alcohol solution or water, with food freely avail-able, for 21 days. Over the next 20 days, 2 h restraint stress was applied every other day immediately prior to 2 h access to alcohol and water. On intervening days, all mice received 2 h access to alcohol and water in the absence of stress. Following this phase of the study, the effects of restraint stress on acoustic startle reactivity was assessed in all mice. Finally, all mice were given continuous access to alcohol and water for 8 days. Results: Ten days of prior stress exposure did not significantly alter the acquisition of limited-access alco-hol drinking. Subsequent exposures to intermittent restraint stress produced subtle but consistent effects on alcohol intake that differed in males vs females: stress increased alcohol intake in males and decreased alcohol intake in females. Restraint stress did not alter acous-tic startle reactivity. Under continuous-access conditions after stress termination, the stress-induced increase in alcohol intake in males became more robust; however, in females, alcohol <b>intake</b> <b>returned</b> to the control group level. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the effects of stress on alcohol drinking in mice with a genetic predisposition toward high alcohol preference depend on sex...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Pain flare {{occurs in}} over one-third of {{patients}} receiving palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases. A single dose of dexamethasone can decrease {{the incidence of}} pain flare during the first 2 days immediately after radiotherapy. We conducted a phase II prospective study to investigate the prophylactic role of prolonged dexamethasone. Materials and methods: Patients with bone metastases treated with a single 8 Gy were prescribed 8 mg dexamethasone just before palliative radiotherapy and for 3 consecutive days after treatment. Worst pain score and analgesic consumption data were collected at baseline and daily for 10 days after treatment. Analgesic consumption was converted into a total daily oral morphine equivalent dose in the analysis. Pain flare was defined (a priori) as a two-point increase in worst pain on an 11 -point numeric rating scale compared with baseline with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25 % increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain score. To distinguish pain flare from progressive disease, we required that the worst pain score and analgesic <b>intake</b> <b>returned</b> to baseline levels after the increase/flare. Results: Forty-one patients were evaluable (32 men, nine women). Their median age was 67 years. The overall incidence of pain flare was 9 / 41 (22 %) within 10 days {{after the completion of}} radiotherapy. Most (55 %) of these pain flares occurred on day 5. Absence of pain flare was 34 / 41 (83 %) and 39 / 41 (95 %) for days 1 - 5 and 6 - 10 after the completion of radiotherapy, respectively. Conclusion: Dexamethasone is effective in the prophylaxis of radiotherapy-induced pain flare after palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases. Randomised studies are needed to confirm this finding...|$|R
40|$|Approximately {{two million}} sheep are {{exported}} from Australia annually, worth {{in excess of}} 170 million to the Australian economy. With the live export industry facing increasing scrutiny {{it is essential that}} the industry take steps to optimise the welfare of those animals involved. Infectious ovine keratoconjunctivitis (IOK) is a significant, infectious eye disease of sheep and is the reason for the rejection of many sheep from the live export chain. Establishing a practical and effective treatment protocol has the potential to reduce economic losses associated with rejected stock and to improve the welfare of those animals presenting with clinical disease. Injectable oxytetracycline (OTC) {{has been used as a}} treatment worldwide and has been shown to be effective. However, in pre-embarkation feedlots the number of animals is so large that such individual treatment is not feasible. This research investigated the clinical efficacy and impact on animal health of OTC given in-feed or in-water. Oxytetracycline is absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract following oral administration in feed or water. This research showed that oral administration of OTC results in changes to the rumen microflora population. Although the change in rumen microflora corresponded with reduced feed <b>intakes,</b> feed <b>intakes</b> <b>returned</b> to normal following cessation of treatment, indicating that any changes to the ruminal microbiome are transient. Oxytetracycline given in-feed for five days results in a significant clinical improvement in IOK. In-water OTC caused a persistent decrease in feed and water intake rendering it an unsuitable treatment. Mild cases of IOK can be successfully treated with in-feed OTC for a five-day period at a dose of 20 mg/kg bodyweight. Sheep with more severe IOK can be successfully treated with two intramuscular injections of OTC at 20 mg/kg bodyweight four days apart...|$|R
