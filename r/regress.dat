5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite <b>regress,</b> cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite <b>regress.</b>|$|E
5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} sleep {{of children with}} autism and developmental regression and the possible relationship with epilepsy and epileptiform abnormalities. Participants were 104 children with autism (70 non-regressed, 34 <b>regressed)</b> and 162 typically developing children (TD). Results suggested that the <b>regressed</b> group had higher incidence of circadian rhythm disorders than non-regressed children. The <b>regressed</b> group showed higher Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire Bedtime Resistance, Sleep Onset Delay, Sleep Duration and Night-Wakings scores. Epilepsy and frequent epileptiform EEG abnormalities were more frequent in <b>regressed</b> children.

This study is an initial step in better understanding sleep problems in <b>regressed</b> children with autism, further studies are necessary to better investigate these aspects...|$|R
40|$|The <b>regressing</b> and {{conventional}} strains of Friend virus were compared by neutralization assays, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and tryptic peptide mapping {{of the individual}} viral components. Neutralization rates of the two viruses differed {{in the presence of}} monospecific anti-gp 70 antiserum and sera from <b>regressed</b> or immunized mice. Neutralization of <b>regressing</b> Friend virus, but not conventional Friend virus, occurred when the viruses were incubated with anti-p 15 (E) and complement. Human serum inactivated conventional Friend virus more rapidly than <b>regressing</b> Friend virus, probably as a result of virolysis induced by the reaction of viral p 15 (E) with human complement component C 1. Structural differences between the viruses were detected in their gp 70 viral glycoproteins and p 15 (E) and p 12 proteins. Analysis of different stocks and clonal isolates of the viruses showed that the differences between the gp 70 and p 15 (E), but not the p 12 proteins, were associated with the <b>regressing</b> phenotype of the <b>regressing</b> strain of Friend virus...|$|R

Study participants were classified as either fixated or <b>regressed</b> according to age at onset of offending, quality of {{the relationship with the}} victim, lifestyle issues, stress, and drug use. There were no differences in the frequency with which fixated or <b>regressed</b> offenders experienced an abstinence violation effect (AVE), although five out of the seven of those experiencing this reaction at the point of lapsing, were <b>regressed</b> offenders, as were twelve out of eighteen at relapse. Fixated offenders reported more positive emotions (interest and joy) and less negative emotions (sadness, anger, disgust, hostility, fear, shame, shyness, and guilt) than <b>regressed</b> offenders. In addition, fixated participants perceived the cause of their offending behavior as being more stable than did <b>regressed</b> offenders. For men experiencing the AVE at relapse, those classified as fixated saw the cause of the relapse as more stable than did <b>regressed</b> cases. Fixated offenders who experienced an AVE at relapse saw its cause as more stable and global than the remaining fixated men, while <b>regressed</b> offenders showing an AVE reported no differences in their perception of cause from the remaining <b>regressed</b> cases.

40|$|Though many past {{works have}} tried to cluster {{expressive}} timing within a phrase, {{there have been few}} attempts to cluster features of expressive timing with constant dimensions regardless of phrase lengths. For example, used as a way to represent expressive timing, tempo curves can be <b>regressed</b> by a polynomial function such that the number of <b>regressed</b> polynomial coefficients remains constant with a given order regardless of phrase lengths. In this paper, clustering the <b>regressed</b> polynomial coefficients is proposed for expressive timing analysis. A model selection test is presented to compare Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) fitting <b>regressed</b> polynomial coefficients and fitting expressive timing directly. As there are no expected results of clustering expressive timing, the proposed method is demonstrated by how well the expressive timing are approximated by the centroids of GMMs. The results show that GMMs fitting the <b>regressed</b> polynomial coefficients outperform GMMs fitting expressive timing directly. This conclusion suggests {{that it is possible to}} use <b>regressed</b> polynomial coefficients to represent expressive timing within a phrase and cluster expressive timing within phrases of different lengths...|$|R

50|$|The {{eyes are}} <b>regressed,</b> but retain {{sensitivity}} to light. They lie deep below the dermis {{of the skin}} and are rarely visible except in some younger adults. Larvae have normal eyes, but development soon stops and they start <b>regressing,</b> finally atrophying after four months of development. The pineal body also has photoreceptive cells which, though <b>regressed,</b> retain visual pigment like the photoreceptive cells of the <b>regressed</b> eye. The pineal gland in Proteus probably possesses some control over the physiological processes. Behavioral experiments revealed that the skin itself is also sensitive to light. Photosensitivity of the integument {{is due to the}} pigment melanopsin inside specialized cells called melanophores. Preliminary immunocytochemical analyses support the existence of photosensitive pigment also in the animal's integument.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-Malignant melanomas {{have been}} shown to contain high levels of monophenol monooxygenase (tyrosinase) enzyme activity; the enzyme is {{responsible}} for melanin synthesis. The melanoma of Sinclair miniature swine has a high incidence of spontaneous regression and thus provides a unique system for analyzing changes in tyrosinase activity at various tumor stages. Three tumor stages (progressively growing tumors. partially <b>regressed</b> tumors. and fully <b>regressed</b> tumors) were analyzed for tyrosinase activity. The progressing tumors were 34 -fold higher than were the partially <b>regressed</b> lesions and 400 -fold higher than were the fully <b>regressed</b> tumors. Histologically, the decrease in enzyme activity correlated with a loss of tumor cells. Sequential biopsies of tumors during the course of tumor development showed a positive correspondence between tumor volume and tyrosinase activity for the early and late stages of tumor growt...|$|R
40|$|The RFV {{strain of}} the Friend virus complex induces an {{erythroleukemia}} that spontaneously <b>regresses.</b> The tropism of <b>regressing</b> Friend virus complex (RFV), which is conferred by its helper MuLV component, MuLV- RF, {{is different from that}} of the conventional virus strain, CFV. RFV is NB-tropic and CFV is N-tropic. Passage of nonregressing CFV through Fv- 1 incompatible Swiss/ICR mice changed the tropism of CFV from N to NB and resulted in a virus strain which induced erythroleukemia that <b>regressed.</b> Passage of NB-tropic CFV back through Fv- 1 compatible mice maintained NB-tropism and regression. Altering the quantity or type of helper MuLV in RFV complex by addition of Ri-MuLV inhibited regression in proportion to the amount of added Ri-MuLV. These studies indicate a relationship between a change in virus tropism to NB by passage in certain hosts (e. g., Swiss/ICR mice) and the ability of Friend virus to induce erythroleukemia that spontaneously <b>regresses.</b> MuLV-RF isolated from the RFV complex induced lymphocytic leukemia in newborn mice which <b>regressed</b> and caused the regression of CFV-induced erythroleukemia. MuLV-RF is NB-tropic, contains no spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) activity and helps SFFV form spleen foci in genetically restrictive mice. Pseudotype viruses were prepared, consisting of MuLV-RF, or other MuLV's, and SFFV derived from FV-B. The pseudotype viruses each acquired the tropism of the MuLV used in rescue. The pseudotype prepared with MuLV-RF or another NB-tropic MuLV-F, but not the virus obtained by rescue with N-tropic MuLV-F, induced erythroleukemia that spontaneously <b>regressed.</b> These studies demonstrate that the ability of RFV to induce erythroleukemia that spontaneously <b>regresses</b> is due to its helper MuLV component...|$|R
5|$|In poor conditions, {{the weight}} of the adrenal gland may {{increase}} up to 200%, and rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated, and in water contaminated with oil, they swim less and their mortality increases. The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5.25Gy and the lethal dose of potassium cyanide is 7.20mg/kg; both values are relatively low for cricetid rodents. In one study, wild rice rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease. Exposure to more daylight and higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats. When the pineal gland is removed or melatonin is administered in male rice rats, the testes are reduced and tend to <b>regress</b> into the body.|$|E
5|$|The young hatch {{after a few}} weeks, and {{typically}} have only three pairs of legs, followed by up to four legless segments. As they grow, they continually moult, adding further segments and legs as they do so. Some species moult within specially prepared chambers of soil or silk, and may also shelter in these during wet weather, and most species eat the discarded exoskeleton after moulting. The adult stage, when individuals become reproductively mature, is generally reached in the final moult stage, which varies between species and orders, although some species continue to moult after adulthood. Furthermore, some species alternate between reproductive and non-reproductive stages after maturity, a phenomenon known as periodomorphosis, in which the reproductive structures <b>regress</b> during non-reproductive stages. Millipedes may live from one to ten years, depending on species.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite <b>regress</b> or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E

5|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the {{ascending}} or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is {{a little less than}} half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly <b>regress.</b> Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the earth and the series ends. Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active. The next solar eclipse will occur on February 15, 2018. It will be a partial solar eclipse visible from Antarctica and south South America.|$|E
5|$|Lung lesions, once identified, {{are usually}} treated to prevent episodes of {{bleeding}} {{and more importantly}} embolism to the brain. This is particularly done in lesions with a feeding blood vessel of 3mm or larger, as {{these are the most}} likely to cause long-term complications unless treated. The most effective current therapy is embolization with detachable metal coils. The procedure involves puncture of a large vein (usually under a general anesthetic), followed by advancing of a catheter through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery, after which radiocontrast is injected to visualize the AVMs (pulmonary angiography). Once the lesion has been identified, coils are deployed that obstruct the blood flow and allow the lesion to <b>regress.</b> In experienced hands, the procedure tends to be very effective and with limited side effects, but lesions may recur and further attempts may be required. CTA scans are repeated to monitor for recurrence. Surgical excision has now essentially been abandoned due to the success of embolotherapy.|$|E

Soviet delegation was led by Nikita Khrushchev and included Anastas Mikoyan, Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Ivan Konev, and others. The negotiations were tense; both Polish and Soviet troops were put on alert, engaged in 'manoeuvres', and were used as thinly veiled threats. The Polish leadership {{made it clear that the}} face of communism had to become more nationalized; no longer could the Soviet Union directly control the Polish people. Here, Khrushchev's speech worked against him. During Stalinism, the Soviet Union had placed Moscow-friendly Poles, or Russians themselves, in important political positions in Poland. After denouncing Stalinism so vehemently in his speech, Khrushchev could not <b>regress</b> to the Stalinist position by forcing more Russians into the Polish leadership. The Poles, in recognizing the cries of the public, needed to keep the Soviets from direct control but could not raise their demands to a point that endangered their relationships in the bloc. Gomułka demanded increased autonomy and permission to carry out some reforms but also reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning communism or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pressured by the Chinese to accommodate the Polish demands and were increasingly distracted by the events in Hungary. Eventually, when Khrushchev was reassured that Gomułka would not alter the basic foundations of Polish communism, he withdrew the invasion threat and agreed to compromise, and Gomułka was confirmed in his new position.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Blood {{was created}} using a ki-shō-ten-ketsu {{structure}} – introduction (ki), development (shō), twist (ten), and resolution (ketsu) – {{along with the}} rule of rising and falling, in which the hero must grow over time {{in relation to their}} starting point {{in the beginning of the}} story, and not stagnate or <b>regress.</b> Araki did however note that due to the weekly format of the series, Jonathan's initial regression when Dio turns Jonathan's happy life into hardships meant that Jonathan's growth remained in the negative for a few weeks after the series' premiere, leading to a negative feeling that Jonathan always loses. Araki implemented a similar growth curve for Dio, although with him rising towards evil. Despite following the rule of the ever-progressing hero, Araki decided to bend the rule and have Jonathan die to save his wife and child: he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go, and called it unthinkable to do such a thing in a shōnen manga, but said that since he wanted to pass down the Joestar family's lineage, he needed Jonathan to die, and for his blood and spirit to be passed to Joseph, the protagonist of Battle Tendency, the second part in the series. While calling it a gamble, he called this passing of the torch a positive that enables the extreme negative of killing the first protagonist.|$|E
