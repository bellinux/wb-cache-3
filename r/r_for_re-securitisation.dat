40|$|Recently, {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MoAb) {{have been}} raised against a family of adhesive membrane receptors (<b>R)</b> <b>for</b> extracellular matrix molecules known as integrins. In order to ascertain whether these adhesive proteins are normally expressed in inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) dermal epidermal junction, we studied the reactivity of MoAb recognizing receptors <b>for</b> VLA- 1 (<b>R</b> <b>for</b> unknown ligand), VLA- 2 (<b>R</b> <b>for</b> collagen), VLA- 3 (<b>R</b> <b>for</b> collagen, laminin, uibronectin), VLA- 4 (<b>R</b> <b>for</b> unknown ligand), VLA- 5 (<b>R</b> <b>for</b> fibronectin), VLA- 6 (<b>R</b> <b>for</b> laminin), VNRα, and VNRβ (<b>R</b> <b>for</b> vitronectin) on cryostat skin sections from EB patients and normal controls and on cytospins of normal epidermal cell suspensions with indirect immunohistochemical methods. Two cases of junctional EB (EBj) (lethal and non-lethal), three cases of dominant dystrophic EB (EBdd), two cases of recessive dystrophic EB (EBdr), and two normal controls skin sections and cell suspensions entered the study. No significant modification {{of the distribution of}} these adhesive receptors was observed in junctional and dystrophic EB skin. Both in normal and EB specimens MoAb against VLA- 2, VLA- 3, and VNRα determinants showed reactivity with the total cytoplasmic membrane of basal keratinocytes and basement membrane zone. Interestingly, anti-VLA- 6 MoAb was characterized by an intense linear staining of the dermal-epidermal junction with the same localization {{on the roof of the}} blisters in EBj, EBdd, and EBdr as bullous pemphigoid (BP) serum. On the basis of these results we suggest that anti-VLA- 6 MoAb could be used instead of BP serum for immunohistochemical detection of the cleavage of blisters inEB...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Here {{we propose}} a new method based on {{projections}} for the approximate solution of eigenvalue problems. For an integral operator {{with a smooth}} kernel, using an interpolatory projection at Gauss points onto the space of (discontinuous) piecewise polynomials of degree ≤ r − 1, we show that theproposedmethodexhibitsanerroroftheorderof 4 <b>r</b> <b>for</b> eigenvalue approximation and {{of the order of}} 3 <b>r</b> <b>for</b> spectral subspace approximation. In the case of a simple eigenvalue, we show that by using an iteration technique, an eigenvector approximation of the order 4 r can be obtained. This improves upon the order 2 <b>r</b> <b>for</b> eigenvalue approximation in the collocation/iterated collocation method and the orders r and 2 <b>r</b> <b>for</b> spectral subspace approximation in the collocation method and the iterated collocation method, respectively. We illustrate this improvement in the order of convergence by numerical examples...|$|R
