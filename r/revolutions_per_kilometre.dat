50|$|The Westlink {{was built}} as a fully tolled, gateless {{motorway}} employing electronic payment, with an initial toll-free period that ended on 15 January 2006. The toll was originally 29.91 cents <b>per</b> <b>kilometre,</b> capped after 20 km at $5.98. On 1 April 2006, this increased to 30.07 cents <b>per</b> <b>kilometre,</b> capped after 20 km at $6.01. , the toll was 38.31 cents <b>per</b> <b>kilometre,</b> capped at $7.66, and adjusted quarterly according to the CPI.|$|R
50|$|Nearly all expressways are toll roads. Tolls {{are roughly}} around CNY 0.5 <b>per</b> <b>kilometre,</b> and minimum rates (e.g. CNY 5) usually apply {{regardless}} of distance. However, {{some are more}} expensive (the Jinji Expressway costs around CNY 0.66 <b>per</b> <b>kilometre)</b> and some are less expensive (the Jingshi Expressway in Beijing costs around CNY 0.33 <b>per</b> <b>kilometre).</b> It is noteworthy that cheaper expressways do not necessarily mean poorer roads or {{a greater risk of}} traffic congestion.|$|R

50|$|There {{has been}} an ongoing {{discussion}} as to economic benefits of Toronto's different rapid transit choices.According to Tess Kalinowski, writing in the Toronto Star, a study co-authored by Andre Sorensen, a University of Toronto professor of Human Geography, SmartTrack's route would average 12 hectares <b>per</b> <b>kilometre</b> available for redevelopment. This was slightly more than the 11.1 hectares <b>per</b> <b>kilometre</b> available if the TTC's heavy rail system were extended from Kennedy Station to Sheppard. But {{it was less than}} the 18.4 hectares <b>per</b> <b>kilometre</b> available on the Sheppard East LRT.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the main}} aims of the system, to achieve a lower cost <b>per</b> <b>kilometre</b> than trams, has failed. Other French tramways achieve a cost <b>per</b> <b>kilometre</b> at least 10% lower than that for the guided bus. Similarly, the cost per person of the {{vehicles}} is also noticeably higher with the guided bus than a tram.|$|R

50|$|Due to France's very {{low-carbon}} power electricity grid, {{the carbon}} dioxide emissions from charging an electric car from the French electricity grid are 12 g <b>per</b> <b>kilometre</b> traveled. This compares favourably to the direct emissions {{of one of the}} most successful Hybrid electric vehicles, the Toyota Prius, which produces carbon dioxide emissions at the higher rate of 105 g <b>per</b> <b>kilometre</b> traveled.|$|R

5000|$|Out of {{the entire}} length of the rail line, 324 km are in Hubei and 53 km in Chongqing Municipality. [...] Owing to the {{difficult}} terrain, the project involves a large number of bridges (including two over the Yangtze River: the Wanzhou Railway Bridge and the Yichang Railway Bridge) and tunnels. Out of the line's total 377 km length, 288 km runs on bridges or in tunnels. This made the line the most difficult and the most expensive (<b>per</b> <b>kilometre)</b> of all China's railways to date. At a cost of U.S. $9.01 million <b>per</b> <b>kilometre,</b> the per-kilometre construction costs were twice as high as those for the Qinghai-Tibet Railway which cost U.S. $4.35 million <b>per</b> <b>kilometre.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{system was}} opened two years behind {{schedule}} on January 1, 2005. The charge <b>per</b> <b>kilometre</b> {{varies according to}} the number of axles and the vehicle's emission category and is between 9 and 14 cents <b>per</b> <b>kilometre.</b> This means, that the road tax for e.g. a Hamburg-Munich-trip (776 km) costs between €69.84 and €108.64. It is payable at toll booths if they do not have electronic units that permit automatic billing.|$|R

The average gradient of the total climb and also the average gradients <b>per</b> <b>kilometre</b> differ slightly, depending on the source of the information. Accurate measurements result in an average gradient for the total climb of 7.43%, based on a horizontal distance of 21,765 metres and an ascent height of 1,617 metres. The actual distance ridden is 21,825 metres.|$|R

50|$|SWER also {{reduces the}} largest {{cost of a}} {{distribution}} network, the number of poles. Conventional 2-wire or 3-wire distribution lines have a higher power transfer capacity, but can require 7 poles <b>per</b> <b>kilometre,</b> with spans of 100 to 150 metres. SWER's high line voltage and low current also permits the use of low-cost galvanized steel wire (historically, No. 8 fence wire). Steel's greater strength permits spans of 400 metres or more, {{reducing the number of}} poles to 2.5 <b>per</b> <b>kilometre.</b>|$|R
