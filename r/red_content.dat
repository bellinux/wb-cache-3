5000|$|Camouflage {{experts have}} noted that the colour may make ships more obvious {{as a result of}} the Purkinje effect. These experts also often complained about {{uncontrolled}} mixing, which could result in mixtures containing more red than intended; such a mixture could be disastrous, as ships with even the slightest red tone attracted more attention than those with an equivalent tone of blue in almost every light level. An Admirality handbook concluded that the paint was [...] "neither more nor less effective in sea-going camouflage than neutral greys of equivalent tone; and, further, that if the <b>red</b> <b>content</b> were high enough for the particular characteristics of red to have any effect, the colour would generally hinder rather than aid concealment".|$|E

Its music video, directed by Aurélio Vasques, features a couple (played by Paulo Pires and Ana Rocha). During {{the first part of}} the video it is shown the way they live at their home. At some point, she, a painter, decides to paint a wall inside their home. Her boyfriend gives her a wine glass, and then she throws its <b>red</b> <b>content</b> to the wall. Rather than using paintbrushes, she uses her hands to expand it through the wall. Her boyfriend starts reading a book, until he falls asleep. Later, over the red canvas, she starts painting with black paint her boyfriend's face. As she finishes painting it, a flashback appears; in it she walks to the wall with a knife on her hand. It is covered with the same red liquid the wall has painted. The video ends with Rocha's character smiling whilst she cleans-up the knife with her fingers. Throughout the video, scenes featuring Moura whilst she sings in front of a black background were added.|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} {{is important}} during tissue culture. However, {{there are still}} technical difficulties in monitoring the internal status of cells or tissues. In this paper, microdialysis is adopted to monitor functional tissue growth in a bioreactor. Explanted bovine caudal intervertebral disc (IVD) {{was used as the}} test tissue. A microdialysis membrane probe of 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off was employed and in situ calibration methods with phenol red and fluorescent 40 kDa dextran were developed to measure the relative recovery of the solute of interest, and membrane fouling, respectively. Tissue metabolism was monitored successfully. At the same time soluble macromolecules were picked up by the probe and were detected and quantified by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) and/or Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). These proteins were believed to be associated with biofunction of engineered tissue. Monitoring of phenol <b>red</b> <b>content</b> in the dialysate indicated that there was no significant fouling of the membrane probe during a 7 -day culture period and the Relative Recovery of macromolecules of interests remained roughly 9 %.

The application of the developed system could be extended to monitor tissue repair in vivo, and the development of the engineered tissue...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Novel sensory inputs for {{the control}} of food intake and {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) function are of increasing interest due to the rapid increase in nutrition-related diseases. The essential amino acid L-lysine was demonstrated to have a selective impact on food intake, gastric emptying, and intestinal transit in rats, thus indicating a potential novel direct sensory input to assess dietary protein content and quality. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess translational aspects of this finding and to investigate the dose-dependent effect of L-lysine on human and rat GI function. METHODS: L-lysine doses from 0 - 800  mg in rats and 0. 5 - 7. 5  g in humans were analyzed for their effect on gastric emptying and GI secretion. Human GI function was assessed non-invasively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), rat data were acquired using standard lethal measurement methods. L-lysine dose dependently delayed gastric emptying and stimulated GI secretion in rats as reflected by residual phenol <b>red</b> <b>content</b> and increased gastric wet weight. KEY RESULTS: The dose-dependent delay in gastric emptying observed in rats was confirmed in humans with an increase in halftime of gastric emptying of 4  min/g L-lysine, p <  0. 01. Moreover, a dose-dependent increase in intestinal fluid accumulation was observed (0. 4  mL/min/g L-lysine, p <  0. 0001). No effect on alkaline tide, glucose concentration, hematocrit, or visceral sensations was detected. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This translational study demonstrates comparable dose-dependent effects of intragastric L-lysine on GI function in humans and rats and suggests a broader role for individual amino acids in the control of GI motility and secretion in vivo...|$|E

In the runners the 2, 3 -DPG <b>red</b> cell <b>content</b> was signficantly higher than in controls, while P 50 values were not significatly different. RBC indices revealed both a significant decrease of RBC count and an increase of MCV in the runner group. Hb, PCV, MCH and MCHC were not significantly different. This aspect may be caused by an increase of the erythropoietic activity compensating for a mild haemolysis. Such events could induce an increase of the number of young RBC with a mean enhancement of some glycolytic substrates, such as 2, 3 -DPG.

40|$|Gastric {{emptying}} and gastric secretion {{are major}} physiological {{functions of the}} stomach. The assessment of these functions in particular in small animals is challenging; no method currently available allows the simultaneous measurement of both functions, and methods used are lethal or invasive and often limited by spatial, temporal or quantitative resolution. Here, we report the establishment and validation of a quantitative non-invasive high-throughput computed tomography based method to measure simultaneously liquid gastric emptying and secretion in rats in vivo. The imaging strategy enables to visualize stomach anatomy, and to quantify stomach volume and stomach contrast agent content. The method was validated {{by comparing the results}} to classical lethal methods (stomach phenol <b>red</b> <b>content,</b> stomach wet weight). Additionally, we showed that the use of a mild anesthetic does not interfere with normal gastric function thereby enabling high-resolution temporal studies within single animals. These combined advantages were applied to reevaluate the impact of cholecystokinin (CCK), histamine and oral glucose on gastric function with high temporal resolution. CCK inhibited gastric emptying for 20 min leading to the accumulation of gastric juice in the stomach. The CCK antagonist devazepide blocked this effect. Histamine stimulated gastric secretion and delayed emptying. Oral glucose solution emptied at a fix rate of 24 - 31 cal/min and stimulated gastric secretion. These results confirm previous observations and add volumetric changes as a new dimension. As computed tomography scanners become broadly available this method is an excellent approach to measure the combined gastric functional readout and to reduce number of animals used...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} experimental {{investigations into}} the propagation of light inside both disordered and ordered complex photonic systems. The experimental results are interpreted using theoretical and numerical models. One of {{the main focus of}} this thesis is to determine experimentally and theoretically the distribution of the energy density inside a scattering medium when the incident wavefront is optimized. As a starting point, we calculated the energy density inside a 2 D waveguide with disorder and decomposed the energy density in terms of the eigenfunctions of the diffusion equation. We found that very few eigenfunctions (e. g M = 1 for an open transmission channel and M = 7 for shaped waves) are remarkably su�fficient to reconstruct the energy densities. The fact that the reconstruction can be accomplished with a few number shows that the energy density inside the scattering is similar to the diffusion eigenfunctions. A rigorous theoretical proof of this similarity is, however, still an open challenge at this time. One approach is to derive the energy density as a function of depth based on the principle of conservation of flux and the known total transmission. We have measured the total stored energy and the depth-dependent energy density inside three-dimensional scattering media. The energy density was probed using fluorescent nanoparticles distributed inside the sample. The experimental data reveal that the total stored energy is enhanced using wavefront shaping in agreement with theoretical prediction and numerical simulations. Our result can be used to control the color of white LED. A white LED has a blue LED that illuminates phosphor particles, which both scatter and absorb blue light and re-emit in the red wavelengths [92]. Optimizing on the blue light will increase the blue content of the white LED as well as the red, since the total energy stored is enhanced. On the other hand, the <b>red</b> <b>content</b> of the white LED can be increase by optimizing on only the red re-emitted...|$|E

40|$|Foram utilizados 36 cordeiros machos inteiros, sendo 24 da raça Santa Inês e 12 da raça Bergamácia, os quais entraram no experimento com 15 kg e foram distribuídos aleatoriamente nos grupos de peso ao abate (GPA) de 15, 25, 35 e 45 kg. O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar o declínio do pH post-mortem, cor (CIE L*a*b*), perda de peso por cozimento (PPC) e força de cisalhamento (FC) nos músculos longissimus dorsi (LD) e semimembranosus (SM). Os parâmetros estudados foram submetidos à análise de regressão. O valor de pH para ambos os músculos foi expresso através de equações de regressão do tipo exponencial, apresentando uma rápida queda nas primeiras horas, seguido de estabilização. No músculo LD foi encontrado que a glicólise desenvolveu-se mais rapidamente com o aumento do peso. A análise dos componentes da cor para ambos os músculos estudados apresentaram o mesmo comportamento. A raça Bergamácia apresentou maior índice de luminosidade (L*), ou seja, maior brilho. O valor de L* diminuiu, o teor de vermelho (a*) aumentou e o teor de amarelo (b*) diminuiu linearmente em relação ao aumento do peso. A análise geral dos componentes da cor indicou que a carne de cordeiro é mais escura com o aumento do peso. Os resultados das análise de PPC e FC foram similares entre as raças e GPA, os valores obtidos para PPC foram de 28, 0 ± 2, 5 % (LD) e 30, 5 ± 4, 1 % (SM), para FC foram de 2, 6 ± 0, 6 kg (LD) e 2, 8 ± 0, 7 kg (SM).

The objective of this work was to evaluate the pH post-mortem decline, color (CIEL* a* b*), cooking weight loss (CWL) and shearing force (SF) in the longissimus dorsi (LD) and semimembranosus (SM) muscles. The examined parameters were submitted to a regression analysis. The value of pH for both muscles was expressed by regression equation of exponential type, presenting a fast fall in the first hours, followed by stabilization. The LD muscle glycolisis rate was found to develop more quickly with an increase in weight. The analysis for color components for both examined muscles presented the same behavior. The breed Bergamacia presented larger index lightness (L*), that is to say, larger brilliance. The value of L* decreased, the <b>red</b> <b>content</b> (a*) increased and the yellow content (b*) linearly decreased as the weight increased.

Palmer ### Abstract The {{detection}} of {{correlations between the}} expression levels or sub-cellular localization of different proteins with specific characteristics of human tumors, such as e. g. grade of malignancy, may give important hints of functional associations. Here we describe the method we use for relative quantification of immunofluorescence staining of tumor tissue sections, which allows us to compare between different samples based on objective data. With this strategy we have quantified, for instance, the amounts of nuclear FOXO 3 a and Beta-Catenin proteins in human colon carcinomas. ### Introduction Tissue immunohistochemistry is widely used in clinical pathology to characterize and classify tissue samples of patients. However, in many cases this procedure relies on subjective qualitative criteria. Here we describe the method we use in our laboratory for relative quantification of immunofluorescence staining of tumor tissue sections, which allow us compare between different samples based on objective data. As an example, we describe the following protocol for the measurement of nuclear protein contents (Protein X and Protein Y) in paraffin embedded tissue sections. ### Reagents - Standard reagents for immunofluorescent staining of histological sections ### Equipment - Standard equipment for immunohistochemistry. - Standard confocal microscope. - Image J Software: MBF “ImageJ for Microscopy” program (www. macbiophotonics. ca) ### Procedure 1. Perform a standard immunofluorescent staining of the samples of choice. Stain for a single protein or carry out double immunofluorescence combining suitable secondary antibodies (e. g. Protein X-red, Protein Y-green) and always stain nuclei with DAPI or Hoechst 33342. - Take standard confocal images (at least fife frames for each sample). - Perform immunofluorescence quantification using ImageJ software as detailed as follows: - Define Regions of Interest (ROI, see Fig. 1) using the Polygon or the Freehand selection tool, delimiting tumor tissue from stroma or adjacent regions. - Split the image into {{the two or three}} color channels (RGB Merge/split function) to obtain one image per channel. - First, to determine the average number of cells present in the previously defined ROI, use the Measure option in the program’s ROI Manager, to assess the integrated density value (IDV) for the blue channel (Hoechst 33342 or DAPI staining). - Using the Elliptical selection tool mark at least ten representative nuclei, covering the different sizes and intensities throughout the ROI. Then determine the IDV for all the selected nuclei and calculate the mean nucleus value. - Divide the blue channel IDV by the mean nucleus value. The resulting value corresponds to the average number of cells present in each respective ROI. - Next, to quantify individual Protein X (<b>red)</b> <b>content</b> per nucleus, open the Image calculator from the Process menu. - Create a merged image combining the red channel image with the blue channel image using the operator AND. The merged picture shows nuclear localized Protein X. - Measure the IDV of the respective ROI in this newly created merged image and divide it by the average number of cells calculated before. This represents the Protein X content per nucleus. - Analogously, repeat this procedure with the green channel image to obtain the Protein Y content per nucleus. - The same way, to get the Protein X and Y colocalization signal value, use the Image calculator and the AND operator with the previously merged images of red/blue and green/blue channels. Then repeat the division between IDV the particular ROI and the average number of cells. - Represent the obtained values in scattered plots representing the level of expression for each protein per cell nucleus analyzed, noted as relative units (r. u.) indicating mean and 95 % confidence interval. - Do suitable statistics, such as the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test that is used to compare three or more groups of unpaired values that did not follow any particular distribution. Thereby, Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test serves to identify the significance (P value) of differences in the sum of ranks between each pair of groups of values. ### Troubleshooting - It is essential for relative quantification to define a good control value to refer to. You may compare values between tumors of different stages or you may choose untreated tissue as a reference. - Make sure to obtain a technically homogenous staining. - In the case of analysis of tumor samples, differentiating tumor tissue from stroma or adjacent tissue is a key step during ROI selection to assure integer results. ### References - Rasband, W.
