Ung Pirat, {{one of the original}} founding members, however, left the organization because its delegates were not appointed to found a new organization and vote on behalf of Ung Pirat in their assembly.

40|$|Companies {{in private}} {{international}} law The topic of this diploma thesis includes questions related to companies in {{private international law}}. The thesis deals especially with changes of the Czech law evoked by the recent recodification of the private law in the Czech Republic.

Following methods were primarily used: analysis, synthesis, description and comparison. The thesis, besides general Introduction and Conclusion, includes seven individual chapters which create coherent total. Chapter One explains basic terms used in the thesis. The following chapter defines the term personal statute of legal person and introduces two basic principles of its determination - the incorporation principle and the seat principle.

40|$|Subject of {{this thesis}} are {{contemporaneous}} possibilities {{for companies to}} transfer their seat outside the state of incorporation. Recently, {{there has been a}} dramatic development in private law as well as in national company laws, mainly because of the judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Corporate mobility comprises the possibility to transfer a company from one state to another. Crucial issue is the transfer of the seat of the company in connection with the freedom of establishment. The Court had already given rulings on the transfer of company's seat in several judgments; however, this thesis concerns particularly the latest judgment - Cartesio. In this case the Court dealt with the question whether the freedom of establishment governed by the European law shall be interpreted broad enough to include the right of companies to transfer their real seat (their head office) or their legal and real seats (their <b>registered</b> <b>seat</b> and head office) from one member state of the EU to another. The key question is, whether the Cartesio judgment contributed to the corporate mobility and if so, the scope of such contribution. For better understanding of corporate mobility, the first part explains particular terms used and hidden implications. First part therefore describes the conflict of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND:Students {{are exposed}} to the first {{systematic}} tasks or activities that a human being carries out in his/her life while at school. In this workplace situation, school furniture is a key factor for the adoption of proper body posture. OBJECTIVE:The aim of this paper was to observe and determine the potential mismatch between school furniture dimensions and anthropometric characteristics of the students from the Valparaíso region of Chile. METHODS:The sample consisted of 3, 078 volunteer participants from 18 schools (public, semi-public, private). Eight anthropometric measures were gathered, together with six furniture dimensions. Mismatch analyses were carried out by using pre-defined mismatch criteria. RESULTS:Many different types of school furniture were presented at the schools. Also, a high level of mismatch was <b>registered</b> for <b>seat</b> height, desk height and seat-to-desk clearance. Finally, the analysis of all considered dimensions together showed that there was a high level of cumulative mismatch. CONCLUSIONS:It can be concluded that there were high levels of mismatch between the school furniture and student anthropometric characteristics and that this mismatch varied within the difference types of schools. This situation may have occurred because furniture acquisition was made without considering any ergonomic criteria. This research was funded by the Fondo Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo en Salud (FONIS) No SA 11 I 2105, Gobierno de Chile (National Fund for Health Research and Development, Chilean Government).

50|$|Discovered in PG 779 was a, as yet, {{unidentified}} object {{referred to}} as the Standard of Ur. The Standard of Ur is a trapezoidal wooden box incorporating lapis lazuli, shell and red limestone into the depiction of various figures on its surface. Its function is debated, although Woolley believed it to be a military standard, explaining this object’s current name. On each side of the standard, the pictorial elements are considered part of a narrative sequence divided formally into 3 registers with all figures on a common ground. The standard uses hierarchy of scale to identify important figures in the compositions. Read from left to right, bottom to top {{on one side of the}} standard, starting with the lowest registers, there are men carrying various goods or leading animals and fish towards the top <b>register</b> where larger <b>seated</b> figures take part in a feast accompanied by musicians and attendants.

40|$|Within this {{experimental}} study, {{we compare}} the anchorage stability of 3 {{state of the}} art press-fit cups to a press-fit design with 6 additional radially arranged, curved fins called Ana. Nova® cup. Method: The 4 types of press-fit cups (Ana. Nova® [ImplanTec], Allofit® [Zimmer], Reflection® [Smith & Nephew], Monoblock [Zimmer]) are pressed into rigid polyurethane foam, a test medium for human cancellous bone produced by Sawbones®. The reaming of the cavity in the foam is performed using a common surgery reamer with required diameter. The cups are pressed into the cavity until they reach the desired seating height of 0 -, 2 - or 4 mm. Afterwards a force is applied vertically {{on the rim of the}} cups until loosening or outbreaking occurs. The required load is recorded and the results are statistically evaluated. Results: The highest primary stability for every tested cup is <b>registered</b> at <b>seating</b> heights of 0 mm and 2 mm. At insufficient seating heights of 4 mm, we find a strongly decreased stability in the process of loosening and outbreaking. The Allofit®-, Reflection®- and Monoblock cups are showing similar patterns of behaviour for loosening at every seating height. The 6 -finned Ana. Nova® cup requires more power for loosening and outbreaking than the regular press-fit cups at every seating height. The maximum difference between the Ana. Nova® cup and the conventional cups occurs during outbreaking at insufficient seating height of 4 mm. The results of this experimental study indicate a high primary stability of the Ana. Nova® cup at regular and insufficient seating heights. The empiric set-up restricts the possibility of statistical interpretation, however there is a potential of an explorative interpretation. Evaluation of results: The design of the Ana. Nova® hybrid cup provides a higher anchorage stability. This may base upon the 6 additional fins. Most likely, these fins intrude the acetabular bone and hence influence the periacetabular structure more than the conventional press-fit cups. This might lead to increased bone loss in comparison to conventional press-fit cups, which is not further discussed throughout this study but could be of interest for future research. Recommendation: It’s possible that the Ana. Nova® cup shows a high primary stability and deep anchoring in the subchondral bone in vivo. Potentially the Ana. Nova® cup offers an alternative in case of reduced bone quality, pathological configured acetabula, the revision of hip joint alloarthroplasty and osteoporotic bone conditions...|$|R
