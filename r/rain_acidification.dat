40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} the science pertaining to all aspects of acidification in the Adirondack Park, updating an earlier review of the science (Cook et al. 2002). The review supports an ongoing social science investigation into the willingness to pay for ecological improvements that would result from reduced acid deposition. This paper builds a bridge between the physical science and social science by providing the background that will allow researchers to accurately summarize the crucial elements of ecological status and improvement in a stated preference survey. acid <b>rain,</b> <b>acidification,</b> stated preference, willingness to pay, benefit estimation...|$|E
40|$|Operation of {{grid power}} plants {{involves}} directly environmental burdens like fossil fuels depletion, global warming, <b>rain</b> <b>acidification,</b> etc. The LCIA (Life Cycle Impact Assessment) of the fuels, and power plants for grid electricity, therefore, is strongly required towards further environmentally friendly technology. In this paper, a newly consolidated LCIA scheme "LCA-NETS " (NETS: Numerical Eco-load Total Standardization) is first {{developed from the}} internationally objective criterion. This scheme is then applied to the fuels of petroleum, coal, LNG and nuclear from overseas and respective fuel-fired power plants {{on the basis of}} widely collected inventory data. Discussion of the analyzed results is made on the LCIA results compared with renewable energy plants and further eco-improvement strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of total iron were determined in the 30 rainwater samples collected at Gdynia station, lo-cated {{in the coastal}} zone of Gulf of Gdansk. The samples were assembled from December 2002 to November 2003. Total iron concentrations were measured using a colorimetric method with bathophenanthroline. The {{concentrations of}} major rain components (Na+, NO 3 -, Cl-, SO 4 2 -) were also determined. Concentrations of Fe tot ranged from 0. 26 μg·dm- 3 to 0. 51 · 10 - 3 μg·dm- 3. The total annual flux of Fe tot was 11. 22 mg·m- 2 yr- 1, which suggests that wet deposition can be one iron source for phytoplankton in the Southern Baltic. Iron in rain came from both terrestrial areas and seawater. Particularly at E&SE winds the swash zone saturated with marigenic aerosols was {{a significant source of}} iron. In these causes an anthropogenic influence on <b>rain</b> <b>acidification</b> was found to be minimal...|$|E

5000|$|Seip {{started his}} work in {{chemistry}} with studies on structural chemistry, later he turned his interests to environmental chemistry. He did several studies, and participated in the scientific debate on acid rain {{and its impact on}} forests and waters, during the 1970s and 1980s. There, he emphasized the impact of acid <b>rain</b> on <b>acidification</b> of waters and on fish mortality. However, he was also open to the effects of changing soil quality and the influence of changes in watershed vegetation. The work within this field started in Norway, but was then extended to Poland and China [...] He has subsequently made major contributions to the effects of pollutants on the human population. He is a spokesperson for the importance of co-benefits, that is, abatement measures for climate will also reduce other types of pollutants, like SO2, NOx and particulates. Most of this work has been in China.|$|R
50|$|Eville Gorham(PhDLlDDScFAAASFRSCMNASFESA)is a Canadian-American {{scientist}} whose {{focus has}} been understanding the chemistry of fresh waters and the ecology and biogeochemistry of peatlands. In the process, Gorham {{made a number of}} practical contributions that included discovering the influence of acid <b>rain</b> in lake <b>acidification,</b> plus the importance of the biological magnification of radioactive fallout isotopes in northern food chains. The former led to legislation and redesign of the power plants of the world to scrub sulfur, and the latter was an early step toward the establishment of an atmospheric nuclear test ban treaty.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} two important aspectsin the complex problem of transboundary airpollution in Europe, namely (i) theinterdependence {{of the problems}} of troposphericozone and acidification and (ii) the dynamicprocesses related to soil acidification. Wedevelop an optimal control model to analyse theinteraction between acidification as a stockpollutant and tropospheric ozone as a flowpollutant for several countries. Using acost-benefit framework an analysis is performedto determine efficient emission paths fornitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and volatileorganic compounds. The model jointly analysesacidification and ozone. The current Europeanreduction plans do not fully take into accountthe multi-pollutants multi-targets nature ofthe problem. In addition, the plans allow fortemporary exceedance of critical loads withoutconsidering the consequences for the temporaldevelopment of the soil quality. This papershows the complex relations and interactionswhich one should deal with while designingpolicies that are efficient with respect to thecross-effects between the differentenvironmental problems. It also shows howdynamic efficient abatement strategies wouldlook if the cross effects and the dynamicprocesses in soil acidification are explicitlyincorporated in the analysis.

40|$|Process-oriented {{models for}} {{prediction}} {{of soil and}} water acidification at the catchment scale require soil chemical and physical data as input parameters. Choice of soil properties characteristic for an entire catchment poses a major dilemma. This report deals with the interpretation of analyses from about 200 soils samples collected 1983 - 86 from the 7 catchments included in the <b>RAIN</b> project (Reversing <b>Acidification</b> In Norway). Various statistical techniques are used to derive characteristic values for key soil parameters such as cation exchange capacity, base saturation, bulk density, and anion absorptio...|$|R
2500|$|While it is {{difficult}} to measure exactly how much land has been transformed by human use, estimates range from 39 to 50%. [...] This includes agricultural land, pastureland, urban areas, and heavily harvested forest systems. An estimated 50% of arable land is already under cultivation. Land transformation has increased rapidly over the last fifty years, and is likely to continue to increase. Beyond direct transformation of land area, humans have impacted the global biogeochemical cycles, leading to human caused change in even the most remote areas. These include addition of nutrients such nitrogen and phosphorus, acid <b>rain,</b> ocean <b>acidification,</b> redistribution of water resources, and increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Humans have also changed species compositions of many landscapes that they do not dominate directly by introducing new species or harvesting native species. This new assemblage of species has been compared to previous mass extinctions and speciation events caused by formation of land bridges and colliding of continents.|$|R
50|$|Human {{influences}} {{have contributed}} to the decline of the sugar maple in many regions. Its role as a species of mature forests has led it to be replaced by more opportunistic species in areas where forests are cut over. The sugar maple also exhibits a greater susceptibility to pollution than other species of maple. Acid <b>rain</b> and soil <b>acidification</b> are some of the primary contributing factors to maple decline. Also, the increased use of salt over the last several decades on streets and roads for deicing purposes has decimated the sugar maple's role as a street tree.|$|R
30|$|Knowing {{the levels}} of {{nitrogen}} and sulfur, {{it is possible to}} estimate the pollution potential and the environmental impact related to the energy use of biomass. It is known that high contents of N and S are undesirable, because they contribute little in the heating value of plant biomass and, during the complete combustion of the material, these elements are almost totally converted into toxic oxides (NOx and SOx) and can promote the formation of acid <b>rain</b> and soil <b>acidification,</b> as well as corrosion of equipment for energy conversion (Demirbas 2004 a; Obernberger et al. 2006; Bilgen and Kaygusuz 2008; Huang et al. 2009; Kumar et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|The <b>RAIN</b> project (Reversing <b>Acidification</b> in Norway) is an {{international}} research project aimed at investigating the effect on water and soil chemistry of changing acid deposition to whole catchment. The results from 1987 represent 4 years of treatment from Sogndal and 3 1 / 2 years at Risdalsheia. The original 5 -year project period will be extended an additional 3 year through June 1991. Sulfate concentration have increased from about 20 - 25 µeg/l to 50 - 57 µeg/l at SOG 2 and 35 - 45 µeg/l at SOG 4. These levels are about 50 % of the expectedsteady-state concentrations. Additions og HNO 3 has caused only minor increases in nitrate in runoff. At Risdalsheia acid-exclution has resulted in lower concentrations of the strong acid anions NO 3 (from 35 to 7 µeg/l) and SO 4 (from 110 to 53 µeg/l) relative to both the roofed control catchment and open catchment. The input-output budgets indicate that the acid exclusion has reversed soil acidification at Risdalsheia. The effect of organic acvids on the pH of runoff has increased in importance as the acid-exclusion experiment has proceeded. Norges Teknisk-Vitenskapelige Forskningsråd (NTNF...|$|R
