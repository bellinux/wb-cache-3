5|$|In August, Admiral Sir Thomas Graves led a fleet from New York {{to attack}} de Grasse's fleet. Graves did not <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> large the French fleet was, {{and neither did}} Cornwallis. The British fleet was {{defeated}} by de Grasse's fleet in the Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5, and forced to fall back to New York. On September 14, Washington arrived in Williamsburg, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
5|$|Custer’s 7th Cavalry {{advance party}} {{attacked}} Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their {{camp on the}} Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic idea}} for the song came at an Easter party where Rasmus Seebach {{considered}} his family and <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> much he loves them, while he was ridden down by guilt. He <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> great {{it was to have}} a mother, sister and brother in his life after losing his father Tommy Seebach because of alcoholism.|$|R

5|$|Located {{south of}} Sopron, {{the small town}} of Kőszeg was only {{a few miles from the}} Austrian border. It was held by a task force {{commanded}} by the Croatian soldier and diplomat Nikola Jurišić. Kőszeg was not considered a place of importance. It was an insubstantial obstacle and many stronger places had yielded without a fight. The Grand Vizier of the Ottomans, Ibrahim Pasha, did not <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> poorly defended Kőszeg was. After taking a few minor places, Suleiman came to join Ibrahim Pasha shortly afterwards, when the siege had already started.|$|E
5|$|Brian {{realizes that}} {{if no one}} cares {{about the lives of}} animals, then he is {{worthless}} to the Griffin family and everyone else. Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Cady, Stanton's father, was a {{prominent}} Federalist attorney who served one term in the United States Congress (1814–1817) and then became both a circuit court judge and, in 1847, a New York Supreme Court justice. Judge Cady introduced his daughter to the law and, together with her brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, planted the early seeds that grew into her legal and social activism. Even as a young girl, she enjoyed reading her father's law books and debating legal issues with his law clerks. It was this early exposure to law that, in part, caused Stanton to <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> disproportionately the law favored men over women, particularly married women. Her realization that married women had virtually no property, income, employment, or even custody rights over their own children, helped set her course toward changing these inequities.|$|E

5|$|Marge forbids Bart and Lisa from {{watching}} the Itchy & Scratchy Halloween special, removing the batteries from the remote control. When Marge leaves, Bart finds plutonium in Homer's toolbox and hammers {{it into the}} remote's battery slot. When they use the remote, the kids enter the world of Itchy and Scratchy. Bart and Lisa are soon hunted by Itchy and Scratchy. Back in the Simpson house, Homer enters {{the living room and}} watches the show. Oblivious to what he sees, Homer decides to change the channel, and Bart, Lisa, Itchy, and Scratchy wind up on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. They end up back at Itchy's house and urge Homer from inside the TV to use the remote to get them out, who eventually succeeds in doing so. Unfortunately, Itchy and Scratchy also escape. At first, the family is scared, but <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> small the two characters are and decide to keep them as pets.|$|E
5|$|Speaking on the {{evolving}} relationship of Clark and Chloe, Mack {{believes that the}} season six introduction of Jimmy Olsen into Chloe's life increased her value to Clark. Before, Chloe would drop anything for Clark, but now that Chloe has other priorities, it makes Clark <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> valuable she is to him. The introduction of Jimmy Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can finally have a romantic relationship with. The relationship is strained when Chloe has to lie to cover up Clark's secret, as well as keeping {{the fact that she}} is meteor-infected hidden. Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe's heart that Clark occupied for so long.|$|E
5|$|Suleiman's {{response}} came in 1532 {{when he led}} {{a massive}} army of over 120,000 troops to besiege Vienna again. Ferdinand withdrew his army, leaving only 700 men with no cannons and a few guns to defend Güns (Koszeg) although Ibrahim Pasha, the Grand Vizier of the Ottomans, did not <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> poorly defended Koszeg was. Suleiman came to join him shortly after the siege had started. For more than 25 days, Croatian captain Nikola Jurišić and his garrison of 800 Croats held out against 19 full-scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the Ottomans. As a result, the city was offered a surrender on favourable terms and, although the offer was rejected, the Ottomans retreated leading to a peace treaty between Ferdinand and Suleiman. John Zápolya was recognized as the King of Hungary by the Habsburgs, although as an Ottoman vassal.|$|E

25|$|Benson served an LDS Church {{mission in}} Britain from 1921 to 1923. It was {{while serving as}} a missionary, {{particularly}} an experience in Sheffield, that caused Benson to <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> central the Book of Mormon was to the Restored Gospel message and converting people to the LDS Church.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the two blossoms, despite red tape from social workers (who ultimately rally to Henry's side). As their day in court approaches, the state forces Punky to stay at Fenster Hall, a shelter for orphaned and abandoned children, which makes her <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> close she has grown to Henry. Finally, their day arrives, and the court approves Henry to become Punky's foster father. Later on, Henry legally adopts her.|$|E

He was replaced on March 2 by Pixar voice actor John Ratzenberger who was partnered with Edyta Sliwinska.|$|E

25|$|While Frederick and his {{reinforcements}} were {{on their}} way back to Pavia to join the main imperial force, the Lombard League placed about 3,500 men near {{the west bank of the}} Olona. The infantry, with the Milanese war cart, the carroccio, stood in a hastily fortified position at Borsano. The Lombards knew that Frederick was about to skirt through their area, but did not <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> close he already was. At dawn on May 29, the Lombard League sent a reconnaissance unit of 700 horsemen to the Seprio area. At the same time, the emperor had crossed the Olona and was marching south from Cairate, five miles northeast of Busto Arsizio.|$|E
25|$|While annual or semi-annual mass antihelminthic {{administration}} {{is a critical}} aspect of any public health intervention, many have begun to <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> unsustainable it is due to aspects such as poverty, high rates of re-infection, and diminished efficacy of drugs with repeated use. Current research, therefore, {{has focused on the}} development of a vaccine that could be integrated into existing control programs. The goal of vaccine development is not necessarily to create a vaccine with sterilizing immunity or complete protection against immunity. A vaccine that reduces the likelihood of vaccinated individuals developing severe infections and thus reduced blood and nutrient levels could still {{have a significant impact on}} the high burden of disease throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Anaximander was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> far from Earth it might be, {{and the first to}} present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a celestial sphere. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the obliquity of the Zodiac as the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder reports in Natural History (II, 8). It is a little early to use the term ecliptic, but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The doxographer and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.|$|E
