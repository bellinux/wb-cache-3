40|$|In {{the context}} of the water {{framework}} directive, management plans have to be set up about water quality in surface and groundwater bodies in the EU. One of the first steps is to evaluate the risk of contamination of these water resources, and particularly the risk posed by contaminated industrial sites. From the perspective of water resource management, each of these sites taken individually does not necessary constitute a major threat. However, in heavily industrialised and urbanised areas, the cumulative effect of multiple contaminant sources is likely to present a risk. In order to propose adequate but still economically reliable measures, the calculated risk should be based on a so-called megasite approaches using criteria reflecting the water quality deterioration, in a cumulative way, at the scale of the whole surface water or groundwater body. A GIS-based regional risk assessment approach is developed here for groundwater bodies using the SEQ-ESO currently used within the Walloon Region as indicator to reflect the quality status of the groundwater body. The approach is applied on the groundwater body RWM 073 “Gravels and alluvial deposits of the Meuse river between Engis and Herstal”, identified at risk of not <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> status by 2015. The different steps of this methodology consist of an inventory of proved or potential contaminating industrial sites, a numerical modelling of pollutants behaviour at the scale of the groundwater body and the application of the SEQ-ESO that finally gives a global quality status of the whole groundwater body. This analysis also serves as basis for a socio-economic approach intending to provide indications on costs and benefits generated by total or partial remediation of the contaminated groundwater bodies according to the different management scenarios...|$|E

40|$|The {{recycling}} of e-waste in general allows {{the recovery of}} valuable materials, which can be reused as secondary raw materials. However this implies, to adopt reliable treatment processes to achieve specific standard characteristics. Actually, the market standards are very strict and strongly affect the economic value of recovered materials. In particular, waste refrigerators recycling allows the recovery of different plastic materials and metallic fractions (ferrous and non ferrous), whose economic value has considerably increased in the last years. Only in Italy, in 2010, approximately 66, 000 tons of waste refrigerators were collected for recycling. An efficient recycling treatment could assure about 85 % of recovery rate. In this paper, a model to control and characterize the materials recovered from mechanical {{recycling of}} carcasses dismantled from waste refrigerators is proposed. The treatment flow sheet consists of various separation and comminution operations. A mathematical model was implemented to determine a partition function, utilizing data obtained from the treatment of 100 waste refrigerator carcasses, carrying out mass balance of recovered materials. The partition function {{was used to determine}} control parameters and assess the quality of the recovered products, and, therefore, of the applied technologies. The results have shown that for waste refrigerator carcasses it has been possible to reach for ferrous metals a recovery rate of 97. 5 % with purity of more than 98 %.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the study of}} the electronic spectrum of the s-tetrazine molecule in the ab initio frame making use of the multireference n-electron Valence State Perturbation Theory (NEVPT 2). The theoretical description of the excited states of this molecule is complex, because of the different computational requirements of the low-lying excited states which must be treated on an equal footing. More than forty electronic excited states of various nature (n → π*, nn → π*π*, π → π*, nπ → π*π*, and Rydberg) are considered here. Various active spaces are used to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> zero order description, needed to avoid unrealistic results in the perturbation treatment. The quasi-degenerate perturbation theory must be used in most of the cases, given the presence of a marked mixing among various states.

While in many cases previous assignments of the experimental features are confirmed, in various cases they are questioned and new assignments are proposed. With the new assignments, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> agreement is found between experiments and NEVPT 2. The comparison with other high level ab initio methods shows that NEVPT 2 performs well, being in general in close agreement with Extended-STEOM-CCSD and CC 3, while the agreement with CASPT 2 and GVVPT 2 is less satisfactory (the CASPT 2 excitation energies being lower than the NEVPT 2 ones by ≃ 0. 4 eV).

Since so many different inputs and processes determine these concentrations, the resulting integrated (physically based) model has an excessively high calculation time. However, when surrogate, conceptual models are calibrated to the different detailed models, the total computational time required can be reduced with a factor 1. 104. This paper demonstrates this approach for the case study of the Molse Nete River in the North-East of Belgium. The resulting integrated conceptual model is used to quantify the impact of Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) on the river water quality and to evaluate the compliance with water quality standards. When the standards based on 90 th percentile threshold exceedances are considered, the impacts of the CSOs {{are found to be}} negligible, whereas the impacts on extreme water quality concentrations (99 th percentile standards) are strong.

40|$|In this work, winery wastes {{generated}} by a cellar producing approximately 300, 000 hL of wine per year was monitored {{for a period of}} one year. On average, 196 L of wastewater, 0. 1 kg of waste activated sludge (dry matter) and 1. 6 kg of wine lees were produced per hectoliter of wine produced. Different winery wastes, deriving from different production steps, namely waste activated sludge from wastewater treatment and wine lees, were co-treated using an anaerobic digestion process. Testing was conducted on a pilot scale for both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The process was stable for a long period at 37 °C, with an average biogas production of 0. 386 m 3 /kg CODfed. On the other hand, for thermophilic conditions, volatile fatty acids accumulated in the reactor and the process failed after one hydraulic retention time (23 days). In order to fix the biological process, trace elements (iron, cobalt and nickel) were added to the feed of the thermophilic reactor. Metals augmentation improved process stability and yields at 55 °C. The pH ranged between 7. 8 and 8. 0, and specific gas production was 0. 450 m 3 /kg CODfed, which corresponded to dry matter and COD removals of 34 % and 88 %, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{includes}} some basic knowledge {{to be considered}} when discussing {{about the quality of}} work in harvesting wood and how to monitor it. This knowledge may aid to form an appropriate view on mechanised logging, environmental issues and trade of forest products. Many forest owners feel today, that leaving <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> of work behind is the most important requirement set for logging machinery in the future. It is possible to present to the forest machine and equipment manufacturers some ideas on how to promote and influence the development of logging machines and equipment. This paper is partly based on a literature study, partly on theme interviews. Recent literature on productivity, machine and method studies on logging was examined from the quality of work point of view. Observations supporting an improvement in the quality of work were recorded. The idea was not to find out the level of the quality of work in practice as such, but to assess the relationships between the methods, machines and equipment used in respect to the quality of work. The interviews were conducted from May 22, 2000 to October 2, 2000 in Finland. The data consisted of six persons responsible for logging in a wood procurement district, six representatives of forest machine manufacturers and five logging contractors. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> of work in logging is characterised by doing it in an agreed way. Indicators for reaching the goals are evaluated by assessing the damages caused to the remaining trees, the rut formation, the strip road spacing and width, the way the thinning regimes are followed and the choice of trees to be cut. The target level is formed as a joint effect e. g. of efficiency in wood production, of credibility of mechanised operations, of considering the environment and of fluency in trade of forest products. Contributing factors to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> of work are the organisation of the logging, the forest machine operator as well as the machine and equipment technique. These factors may get a weighting value. However, the final result is a product of these factors, and all of them have to be considered. When looking at the situation today the human influence in logging, especially the role of the operator, is getting more emphasis. On the other hand, in the long run the possibilities to develop appropriate technologies are dominating, especially the use of new technologies. From {{the point of view of}} logging machinery the main factors affecting the work results, are the mobility of the vehicle, how to operate it and the work environment. In this paper, based on the development needs and possibilities, those aspects are looked at. An assessment of the present state is given and presents a basis for a more precise prediction of realistic targets. Based on a literature review and interviews conducted, it is possible to conclude, that there still is great potential to improve the quality of work in logging. Some direct technical improvements could promote the quality of work, but there are even some other actions, which indirectly through the operator would have a positive effect. An improved quality of work is often also improving the productivity in work. Furthermore it makes the organising of the logging operations easier and makes it possible to operate in a more demanding work environment even year around and 24 hours a day. The following is a list of research and development (R&D) needs concerning forest machinery, where inputs would be justified: •	Better visibility (illumination, no dazzling, visibility) •	Analysis of the CTI-system and eventual construction and testing of a test machine •	The properties of tyres (width, diameter, tread, pressure) and their development •	Control of the crane and its development (e. g. the automatic functions) •	The role of a rotating cab on the operator, his productivity and the work result •	Research into the role of levelling (seat, cabin, whole machine) •	Steering of the machine (turning radius, “cutting” of corners) and possibilities to develop a vehicle with frame-steering and turning wheels •	Research into the possibilities to utilise on-board weighing scales •	Lighter machine construction •	The role of tracks and comparison of different tracks •	The role of a balanced boggie and its comparison with a single wheel •	The role of the size of the harvester head on the operation control, work result and productivity •	Possibilities to increase automation •	Possibilities of work rotation and its effect on a normal logging system •	The effect of a harwarder (harvester-forwarder) on the operator’s work 28 p...|$|R

In this research we introduce a real life Vehicle Routing Problem, inspired by the Gas Delivery industry in the UK. It has various real life attributes which have not been researched in the past, such as demand-dependant service times, light load requirements and allowable overtime coupled with unlimited vehicle fleet. A Mixed Integer formulation of the problem is presented and the problem is solved to optimality, reporting optimal solutions and lower and upper bounds. After solving the real life routing problem, both optimally and heuristically some interesting observations and practical implications are reported, relating to better fleet utilization and better working time utilization.

40|$|Imagery {{acquired}} by the WorldView- 2 (WV 2) sensor is of potential interest for the Control with Remote Sensing (CwRS) Programme of the European Commission and therefore needs to be assessed. In details, the horizontal accuracy of the orthoimages which {{can be derived from}} WV 2 imagery have to be concerned, recalling that in order to qualify WV 2 as a Very High Resolution (VHR) prime sensor (i. e. a sensor suitable for measuring parcel areas to the accuracy requested by the Common Agriculture Policy regulation), the CwRS guidelines requires that the one-dimensional Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (i. e. in the East and North components) estimated on external Check Points (CPs) for any orthoimage should not exceed 2. 5 m. This paper summarizes the results regarding the orientation tests of five totally overlapped WorldView- 2 Panchromatic (WV 2 PAN) images acquired over the Maussane Test Site (Provence, Southern France), two Pan-sharpened (WV 2 PANSHP) images (COSE_MODE_ 1) acquired over Cosenza Test Site (Southern Italy) and nine Pan-sharpened scenes (COSE_MODE_ 3) again acquired over Cosenza Test Site; these tests have been carried out with Geomatica (PCI Geomatics), ERDAS Imagine 2011 and SISAR software, using both rigorous model and Rational Polynomial Functions (RPFs) model with Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs). The Hold-Out-Validation (HOV) accuracy assessment method was considered, computing the RMSE of the residuals between the estimated and the reference positions of the CPs for each horizontal component (East, North), varying the number of the Ground Control Points (GCPs). In addition the Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) method has been used to identify possible outliers. Considering the obtained results, at first the following conclusions as regards the orientation can be summarized: •	the orientation accuracy displays a significant dependence on the off-nadir angle (higher accuracy for lower off-nadir angle) •	the best orientation accuracy is reached with the RPFs model using the RPCs supplied with the imagery metadata and applying a shift refinement even with 4 GCPs •	the orientation accuracy is practically software independent and appears suited for the orthoimages generation with the one-dimensional RMSE below 2. 5 meter in each horizontal component •	concerning Cosenza Test Site, it appears by far more convenient to process the two long strips (up to 28 km) (COSE_MODE_ 1) instead of the corresponding separate nine scenes (COSE_MODE_ 3), since in the former case the achieved orientation accuracy is practically the same whereas the number of the required GCPs is much lower Secondly, as regards the subsequent orthoimages validation, the already mentioned requirement, that is one-dimensional RMSE below 2. 5 meter in each horizontal component, can be <b>reached,</b> provided <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> DSM is used. In details, for Maussane Test Site all the orthoimages satisfy the previous requirement, whereas sincea DSM with appropriate accuracy was not available for Cosenza Test Site, the results were not considered significantly representative of the real potentiality of WV 2 sensor, so that they are not presented. In this last respect, some tests were carried out with the overlapped images of the Maussane Site Test just to evaluate the potentialities of WV 2 stereopairs for DSM generation suited for orthoimages production. The results showed that this could be an effective additional resource in case of lack of <b>an</b> external <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> DSM, when proper stereopairs are available. JRC.

40|$|The European Water Framework Directive imposes on {{member states}} to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> water <b>quality</b> status of all their river bodies by 2015. To asses if this goal will be reached and, if not reached, which {{measures}} can be undertaken to remediate the situation, an integrated hydrological-hydrodynamic-water quality river model is required that can simulate the concentrations of relevant water quality state variables in the river under given boundary conditions and for long term rainfall series. Since so many different inputs and processes determine these concentrations, the resulting integrated (physically based) model has an excessively high calculation time. Calibration of the parameters that govern the water quality transformation processes has serious practical difficulties. However, when the detailed model {{is transformed into a}} conceptual model by placing non-linear reservoirs in series to represent the river, the computational times can be reduced with a factor 5. 103. This approach is applied to the Grote Laak, a river of 13 km situated in the North East of Belgium. To test the robustness of the conceptual model, and thus asses the validity of this global sensitivity analysis approach, 10 random parameter sets are ran both with the detailed and the conceptual model. Comparison of the conceptual with the detailed model results show that the degree of similarity between both models is such that the conceptual model can be used for time consuming processes such as the calibration of model parameters, scenario runs and long term simulations for statistical processing. The resulting conceptual model is used for sensitivity analysis by means of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the most sensitive parameters of the 23 calibratable parameters that define the water quality transformation processes. More specifically, Latin hypercube sampling was used to select 5000 random parameter sets from their probability distribution as determined by expert judgment. The simulated 90 th and 50 th percentile of dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia (NH 4), nitrate (NO 3) and temperature (Temp) is calculated as this value is used to determine compliance to water quality standards. A multiple linear regression is performed on the standardized inputs and outputs of the model to obtain the standardized regression coefficient (SRC) for each of the parameters. The absolute values of these SRC’s allow for a ranking of the parameters. From this analysis {{it is clear that the}} first order BOD decay rate is the most important parameter in the uncertainty of the model result as it ranks in the top three of most influential parameters for both DO, BOD and NH 4 at all locations. The third most important parameter in terms of magnitude of sensitivity is the sedimentation rate of BOD. Both parameters indicate the need for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> knowledge on the composition of the BOD in the river and thus could indicate were additional measurement efforts should be spend on. The global sensitivity analysis indicates that from the 23 model parameters, only 9 have a significant contribution to the uncertainty in the model output result. Further calibrate should thus focus on these 9 parameters while keeping the values of the other parameters constant at the recommended value. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The imagery {{acquired}} by the WorldView- 2 sensor is of potential interest for the Control with Remote Sensing Programme of the European Commission, and therefore, should be assessed. The horizontal accuracy of the ortho-images that {{can be derived from}} WorldView- 2 imagery need to be considered since the Control with Remote Sensing guidelines require that the one-dimensional Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) estimated on the external Check Points for any ortho-image should not exceed 2. 5 m in order to qualify WorldView- 2 as a Very High Resolution prime sensor. This work summarizes the results regarding the orientation tests for five totally overlapping WorldView- 2 Panchromatic images acquired at the Maussane test site (Provence, southern France), two Pan-sharpened images acquired at the Cosenza test site (southern Italy), and nine Pan-sharpened scenes also acquired at the Cosenza test site. Tests were carried out using the Geomatica 10. 2 (PCI Geomatics), the ERDAS Imagine 2011, and the SISAR software using both a rigorous model and Rational Polynomial Functions (RPFs) model with Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs). The Hold-Out-Validation accuracy assessment method was considered by computing the RMSE of the residuals between estimated and reference positions of the Check Points for each horizontal component (East, North) by varying the number of Ground Control Points. In addition, the Leave-One-Out Cross Validation method was used to identify possible outliers. The following conclusions regarding the orientation were drawn. The best orientation accuracy over both sites was reached using the RPFs model with the RPCs supplied by imagery metadata and by applying a shift refinement even with four Ground Control Points. Further, the orientation accuracy was practically software independent but displayed significant dependence on the off-nadir angle (a higher accuracy for the lower off-nadir angle). Concerning the Cosenza test site, it appeared more convenient to process the two long strips (up to 28 km) instead of the corresponding separate nine scenes, since for the former case the achieved orientation accuracy was practically the same, whereas the number of required Ground Control Points was much lower. In regards to the subsequent ortho-image validation, the already mentioned requirement, a one-dimensional RMSE below 2. 5 m for each horizontal component, can be <b>reached</b> provided that <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> Digital Surface Model (DSM) is used. For the Maussane test site all the ortho-images satisfied the previous requirement. Since a DSM with an appropriate accuracy was not available, the results for the Cosenza test site were not considered significantly representative of the real potential of the WorldView- 2 sensor, so are not presented. In order to evaluate the potentialities of WorldView- 2 stereopairs for generating a DSM suitable for ortho-imagery production, tests were carried out using overlapping images from the Maussane Site Test. The results indicated that proper stereopairs could be an effective additional resource {{in the event of a}} lack of external <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> DSMs. 0 2012 Elsevier B. V.
