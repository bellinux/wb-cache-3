50|$|A {{series of}} twelve raised {{concrete}} pads of former huts are {{located at the}} base of the steep western slope of the saddle/ridge. Eleven of these pads are aligned adjacent to a south-east to north-west stone edged track. The first pad is located on the eastern side of the track and at the extreme northern end of the alignment. Each <b>raised</b> <b>pad</b> is of a similar size (5 x 5 m) with a discernable veranda on the south- west side. Depending upon the topography, the veranda has a small set of up to three entry stairs. Only a light scatter of domestic artefacts is found in association with the pads. Artefacts include metal fragments, bottle glass and ceramic fragments.|$|E

5000|$|BKB is contested in a 17 foot {{diameter}} circular surface {{known as}} a [...] "the pit". The pit's area is approximately {{half the size of}} a conventional boxing ring. The small fighting surface is aimed to make fighters confront one another. Referees can deduct one point from a fighter if they intentionally step outside of the pit, that is enclosed by a <b>raised</b> <b>padded</b> area instead of rope.|$|R

50|$|Adjacent to the Palm Island workers' dining hut is a {{concrete}} pad representing an old generator room. In the north-east {{corner of the}} pad is a smaller <b>raised</b> concrete <b>pad</b> with six mounting bolts embedded around the edges and adjacent is {{a concrete}} tank stand base.|$|R
60|$|On many {{of these}} <b>raised</b> and <b>padded</b> platforms, Dot and Tot saw groups of funny-looking Clowns, all dressed in wide, baggy trousers, puffy jackets and soft, pointed caps. Yet in their costumes was an endless variety of colorings and {{combinations}} of colors, making the groups look remarkably bright and pleasing.|$|R
50|$|Balance {{may become}} a {{difficulty}} with free-standing calf raises, especially with one-legged variations. Due to this, {{it is common to}} hang on to something or lean the hand against a wall for stability. They are also performed using Smith machines or using machines specially designed for calf <b>raises</b> with <b>padded</b> anchors for the weight that rest on the shoulders.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to reinforcing buttonholes and preventing cut fabric from raveling, buttonhole stitches {{are used to}} make stems in crewel embroidery, to make sewn eyelets, to attach applique to ground fabric, and as couching stitches. Buttonhole stitch scallops, usually <b>raised</b> or <b>padded</b> by rows of straight or chain stitches, were a popular edging in the 19th century.|$|R
5000|$|The Gigabeat X was {{an update}} to the F series; changes {{included}} the dropping of the 40 GB version for a 30 GB version, and a 16-hour battery life. The X-series has a larger 2.4" [...] 16-bit TFT LCD display, which enables it to display images. It {{also has a}} smaller body (similar to the future Gigabeat S) and <b>raised</b> Plustouch <b>pad.</b> It was sold primarily in Australia and various Asian countries.|$|R
50|$|The main western {{entrance}} has rosette ornamentations and {{is framed}} by two fluted pilasters supporting a plain entablature which rests on pedestals decorated with acanthus leaves. The other two lintels {{are of the}} same classic design which inspired the western front. The surrounding arcades to the north have lost {{the tip of the}} smooth shaft columns on pedestals flanking the cross and crown brackets. The southern end is made up of raised segments with <b>raised</b> <b>padded,</b> bracketed by the remains of a braided columella. It is also trimmed with separate columns along the remainder of the left side, topped with a capital of acanthus leaves. A decorative fascia runs along the lintel, a classical entablature, alternating corrugated eight-petalled rosettes. This fascia also travels outside the transepts and chancel. The vaulted roof, resting on pillars, is topped with fluted fascia capitals. The porch floor is decorated with curlicues. The tower of the church, almost 27 meters high at the western end of the portico is divided into three sections: entrance porch, bell tower and level landing, upon which stands a pavilion topped by an octagonal chamfered cupola.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{discomfort}} of higher weights on a bar, barbells used for seated calf <b>raises</b> are frequently <b>padded</b> or {{wrapped in a}} towel. There are also seated calf raise machines designed using levers that have pads built into them to protect the patella, quadriceps and tendons.|$|R
50|$|On 13 July 2017, the Premier of the Republic of China, Lin Chuan was {{prevented}} from delivering his {{report on the}} budget after a water balloon was thrown towards him. This resulted in him leaving the chamber and causing the session {{to come to a}} halt. In the following day, opposition lawmakers occupied the chamber and <b>raised</b> large <b>padded</b> office chairs above their heads, surrounded the podium and tussled with rival legislators to prevent Mr Lin from presenting the report once more as water balloons were thrown. This resulted in the early suspension of the parliamentary session.|$|R

There he stopped and asked to see Lord Pooley.|$|R
50|$|The People's Alliance for Democracy was re-established in Thailand on March 28, 2008 at Thammasat University auditorium. Several {{issues were}} <b>raised</b> by the <b>PAD,</b> {{including}} the Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej's ties to Thaksin Shinawatra, ties between some People's Power Party {{members and the}} banned-Thai Rak Thai party, alleged interference in the justice system, and attempts to amend the 2007 Constitution.|$|R
50|$|The mine has a ribbed {{plastic case}} which is olive green, brown or sand colored. The mine has a central <b>raised</b> {{pressure}} <b>pad</b> {{on the top}} surface of the mine, but is designed to operate even with the mine upside down. Pressure on the mine forces air through a diaphragm into a small rubber air bag, which inflates. As the bag inflates it pushes a shutter, which in turn removes the striker retaining lug. The striker is free to impact the detonator. The mine requires a constant pressure of approximately 5 to 11 lbs {{for an average of}} 0.11 seconds before the fuze will detonate. This allows the mine to be laid in a high density pattern without the shock of a detonation impacting the nearby mines.|$|R

If the decrypted block contains padding information or bytes used for padding then few more attempts (less than 255) have to be made to resolve this ambiguity.|$|R
5000|$|Primarily a {{scientific}} research station, {{at the start}} of the series, Moonbase Alpha houses 311 personnel including scientists, astronauts, medical personnel, and security officers. It is under the command of John Koenig. Four kilometers wide and up to one kilometer deep, it is a totally self-sustaining facility, with the different areas connected by a series of high speed [...] "travel tubes". Alpha also has a fleet of Eagle Transporter spaceships, used for a variety of purposes throughout the series, which are housed in underground bunkers and then <b>raised</b> on launch <b>pads</b> for take-off.|$|R
50|$|As an {{advanced}} technique {{was required to}} play anything more than simple tunes, {{the vast majority of}} the concert zithers sold never attained more than amateur or (mostly) ornamental use; the playing of Washington Phillips was a rare exception. Manufacturers attempted to simplify the instrument with various keyboard devices attached to the melody strings (Marxophone, dolceola, celestaphone, tremoloa, etc.), but the invention of the autoharp is probably the most successful adaptation. This uses bars (with felt pads attached underneath) placed across and above the strings. Springs <b>raise</b> the <b>pads</b> from all bars free of the strings. Each bar has a button that indicates a chord, with pads arranged so that they mute all strings not in the chord when the player presses the button or bar. Simply depressing the button with one finger stops unwanted strings from sounding as the mutes under the bars contact them. Note, however, that the absence of a fretboard makes the autoharp a closer relative of the chord zither, than of the concert zither. Presence of the concert zither in classical music remains sparse.|$|R
50|$|Evidence of {{the early}} manual {{operation}} of the station survives. The wheel handle valve controls are now gone but marks on the control room floor indicate the locations of their footings. The steel frame within the chamber accommodates the fixings for the shafts that ran down from the wheel handles to the pipes at the basement level. The original Kemp hydraulic controls machine now stands near the roller door. It once stood on the <b>raised</b> concrete <b>pad</b> at the river side of the control room. Associated with this is the lever control mounted on a small pedestal which {{stands in the middle}} of the control room. The lever control opened and shut the valves which when they were too tight had to be manipulated by hand. This hydraulic control mechanism is no longer operational. Dotted lines on the control room floor near the lever pedestal indicate that the river valves are to the southeast and the dam valves to the northwest. Three original pressure gauges are housed in a timber panel below the middle window on the northwest wall. These were connected to the pumps.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a finite}} element sub-modelling method {{is used to}} {{estimate}} the stress distribution and the crack propagation lifetime in Aluminium alloy, Al 7075 -T 6 specimens. Different contact geometries, i. e. cylinder-on-flat and flat-on-flat, and different contact span width's with different pad's compression forces are analysed. It is found that fretting fatigue life for two based cylindrical pads is shorter than that for two based flat pads and in two based flat pads is shorter than that for perfectly flat pads. In the case of two based flat pads, stress distribution in the pad with width of 3. 1 mm is about 14 % higher than that in the pad with the width of 6. 2 mm and about 21 % higher than that in the pad with the width of 9. 3 mm. Similarly, stress in cylindrical pads with width of 3. 1 mm is 36 % higher than that in the pad with width of 6. 2 mm and 130 % higher than that in the pad with width of 9. 3 mm. Stresses increased by 21 % for pad force of 1800 N and around 40 % for pad force 2400 N compared with 1200 N pad force. Also {{it is observed that}} by increasing pad width for both flat and cylindrical pads, crack propagation lifetime increased. Furthermore, fretting fatigue crack growth rate <b>raises</b> when <b>pads</b> compression force increases...|$|R
50|$|The Thiokol {{engineers}} had {{also argued that}} the low overnight temperatures (−8 C the evening prior to launch) would almost certainly result in SRB temperatures below their redline of 4 C. Ice had accumulated all over the launch <b>pad,</b> <b>raising</b> concerns that ice could damage the shuttle upon lift-off. The Kennedy Ice Team inadvertently pointed an infrared camera at the aft field joint of the right SRB and found the temperature to be only −13 C. This {{was believed to be}} the result of supercooled air blowing on the joint from the liquid oxygen tank vent. It was much lower than the air temperature and far below the design specifications for the O-rings. The low reading was later determined to be erroneous, the error caused by not following the temperature probe manufacturer's instructions. Tests and adjusted calculations later confirmed that the temperature of the joint was not substantially different from the ambient temperature.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{fast growing}} public {{ownership}} {{and use of}} mobile personal programmable communication devices (e. g. PDA’s) create new and exciting opportunities for convenient and secure commercial and service providing transactions. The newer generations of these devices incorporate digital cameras and signature <b>pads,</b> <b>raising</b> the possibility of enhancing the security of mobile transactions using biometric-based authentication. However, implementing biometrics-based athentication on devices that are constrained in their memory size and computational power is a tough technological task. This paper is primarily concerned with wavelet techniques for face verification {{as part of a}} multi-modal biometrics-based identity verifier for PDA’s that would include voice and hand-written signature. We shall present preliminary results of comparison of accuracy rates of three face verification schemes: PCA applied in the spatial domain, PCA applied in the low-low subband of wavelet transformed images down to level 5, and wavelet-only feature vectors. Although the experimental sample is relatively small, the results indicate that at level 4 and 5 of wavelet decomposition, the latter two verification schemes perform significantly better than the spatial PCA. The wavelet-only feature vector scheme has the best accuracy rate, and is the most efficient scheme suitable for constrained devices...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundPeripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) {{is often}} associated with risk factors including cigarette smoking, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, and patients have a high risk of future vascular events. Good medical management results in improved outcomes and quality of life, but previous studies have documented sub-optimal treatment of risk factors. We assessed the management of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with PAD referred to specialist vascular clinics. MethodsThis was a prospective, protocol driven registry carried out in UK vascular clinics. Patients who were first-time referrals for evaluation of PAD were eligible if they had claudication plus ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) ≤ 0. 9. Statistical associations between key demographic and treatment variables were explored using a chi-squared test. ResultsWe enrolled 473 patients from 23 sites. Mean age was 68 years (SD 10) and 66 % were male. Mean estimated claudication distance was 100 m, and ABPI was 0. 74. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 155 mmHg, and 42 % had a SBP > 160 mmHg. Forty percent were current smokers and half had tried to give up in the prior 6 months, but {{there was no evidence of}} a systematic method of smoking cessation. Mean total cholesterol was 5. 4 (SD 1. 2) mmol/l and 30 % had levels > 6 mmol/l. Antiplatelet therapy had been given to 70 % and statins to 44 %. Prior CHD was present in 29 % and these patients had significantly higher use of antiplatelet therapy, statins and ACE-inhibitors. ConclusionsIn spite of attempts to <b>raise</b> awareness about <b>PAD</b> as an important marker of cardiovascular risk, patients are still poorly treated prior to referral to a vascular clinic. In particular, the use of evidence-based treatments is sub-optimal, while hypertension and cigarette smoking are poorly managed. More work needs to be done to educate health professionals about the detection and optimal medical management of PAD...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Claudication {{secondary}} to peripheral artery disease (PAD) {{is associated with}} substantial functional impairment. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors {{have been shown to}} increase walking performance in these patients. K- 134 is a selective PDE 3 inhibitor being developed as a potential treatment for claudication. The use of K- 134, as with other PDE 3 inhibitors, in patients with <b>PAD</b> <b>raises</b> important safety and tolerability concerns, including the induction of cardiac ischemia, tachycardia, and hypotension. We describe the design, oversight, and implementation of an adaptive, phase II, dose-finding trial evaluating K- 134 for the treatment of stable, intermittent claudication. Methods The study design was a double-blind, multi-dose (25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg of K- 134), randomized trial with both placebo and active comparator arms conducted in the United States and Russia. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} compare the highest tolerable dose of K- 134 versus placebo using peak walking time after 26 weeks of therapy as the primary outcome. Study visits with intensive safety assessments were included early in the study period to provide data for adaptive decision making. The trial used an adaptive, dose-finding strategy to efficiently identify the highest dose(s) most likely to be safe and well tolerated, based on the side effect profiles observed within the trial, so that less promising doses could be abandoned. Protocol specified criteria for safety and tolerability endpoints were used and modeled prior to the adaptive decision making. The maximum target sample size was 85 subjects in each of the retained treatment arms. Results When 199 subjects had been randomized and 28 -day data were available from 143, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended termination of the lowest dose (25 mg) treatment arm. Safety evaluations performed during 14 - and 28 -day visits which included in-clinic dosing and assessments at peak drug concentrations provided core data for the DMC review. At the time of review, no subject in any of the five treatment arms (placebo, three K- 134 -containing arms, and cilostazol) had met pre-specified definitions for resting tachycardia or ischemic changes on exercise ECG. If, instead of dropping the 25 -mg K- 134 treatment arm, all arms had been continued to full enrollment, then approximately 43 additional research subjects would have been required to complete the trial. Conclusions In this phase II, dose-finding trial of K- 134 in the treatment of stable intermittent claudication, no concerning safety signals were seen at interim analysis, allowing the discontinuation of the lowest-dose-containing arm and the retention of the two highest-dose-containing arms. The adaptive design facilitated safe and efficient evaluation of K- 134 in this high-risk cardiovascular population. Trial registration ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 0078308...|$|R
