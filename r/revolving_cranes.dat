5000|$|Crane {{vessels are}} often used in {{offshore}} construction. The largest <b>revolving</b> <b>cranes</b> {{can be found on}} SSCV Thialf, which has two cranes with a capacity of 7100 t each. For 50 years, the largest such crane was [...] "Herman the German" [...] at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, one of three constructed by Hitler's Germany and captured in the war. The crane was sold to the Panama Canal in 1996 where it is now known as the [...] "Titan." ...|$|E
50|$|The Saipem 7000 has two NOV Lifting and Handling AmClyde model S7000 fully <b>revolving</b> <b>cranes.</b> Each has a 140-metre-long boom {{fitted with}} 4 hooks. Each crane {{is capable of}} lifting up to 7,000 tonnes at 40 m lift radius using the main hook. The {{auxiliary}} hook capacities are 1st Auxiliary 2,500 tonnes at 75 m radius and 2nd Auxiliary 900 tonnes at 115 m. The whip hook has a capacity of 120 tonnes at 150 m. The 2nd Auxiliary hook can be deployed to a water depth of 450 m. The two cranes are capable of a tandem lift of 14,000 tonnes.|$|E
50|$|The Saipem 7000, {{originally}} {{named the}} Micoperi 7000, was conceived {{in the mid-1980s}} by its original owners Micoperi as a multipurpose offshore oil platform installation vessel that {{would be able to}} install very large oil production platform decks (known as integrated decks) as well as the decks' supporting structures (known as jackets) using its two very large fully <b>revolving</b> <b>cranes.</b> It would also be able to support the offshore completion of the platform by providing hotel and workshop facilities for large construction crews. Saturation Diving facilities would support subsea connection work. The vessel's size and semi-submersible form would allow it to operate in worse weather conditions than smaller and conventionally shaped vessels.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, J. Ray McDermott had Derrick Barge Four built, a barge {{that was}} {{outfitted}} with a <b>revolving</b> <b>crane</b> capable of lifting 150 tons. The arrival {{of this type of}} vessel changed the direction of the offshore construction industry. Instead of constructing oil platforms in parts, jackets and decks could be built onshore as modules. For use in the shallow part of the Gulf of Mexico, the cradle of the offshore industry, these barges sufficed.|$|R
50|$|The Marine Boss {{floating}} barge-crane {{was built}} for Murphy Pacific Marine. The barge was assembled by Zidell Explorations from scrapped ship steel in Oregon in 1966 and fitted in San Francisco with a heavy 500-ton <b>revolving</b> <b>crane</b> made by Clyde Iron Works to perform the heavy girder and deck-section lifts for construction of the 1967 San Mateo-Hayward Bridge. At {{the time it was}} the largest barge crane in the western United States.|$|R
500|$|Kearsarge was {{converted}} into a crane ship, and was given hull classification symbol IX-16 on 17 July 1920, but it was changed to AB-1 on 5 August. Her turrets, superstructure, and armor were removed, and were replaced by a large <b>revolving</b> <b>crane</b> with a lifting capacity of 250tons (230tonnes), as well as [...] blisters, which improved her stability. The crane ship was utilized often over the next 20 years, including the raising of [...] in 1939.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} a construction proposal of wall <b>revolving</b> <b>crane.</b> The aim is to suggest main load-bearing constructions. It describes its suggestion including processing of important strength calculations. A proposed crane enables rotation, unloading arm 2 500 mm of maximum weight 1 000 kg. The work also talks about a suitable block and tackle and includes introductory research part of the present topic, choice of different conceptions. An {{important part of the}} thesis is its drawing documentation...|$|R

50|$|Weeks 533 is a 500 ST {{capacity}} Clyde Iron Works model 52 barge-mounted crane {{which is}} the largest <b>revolving</b> floating <b>crane</b> on the East Coast of the United States. It was originally ordered for bridge construction and has since been used in several notable heavy lifts.|$|R

On 6 November 1941, Kearsarge was renamed Crane Ship No. 1, allowing her name {{to be given to}} , and later to [...] She continued her service, however, handling guns, turrets, armor, and other heavy lifts for vessels such as , , , , and [...] She was transferred to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard in 1945, where she participated in the construction of Hornet, , and the re-construction of [...] In 1948, she left the West Coast for the Boston Naval Shipyard. On 22 June 1955, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and she was sold for scrap on 9 August.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} are significant {{members of the}} Crane family excluding Frasier, Martin, Niles, and Daphne Crane. Although most of the series <b>revolves</b> around Frasier <b>Crane</b> and his immediate family, occasionally members of Frasier's extended family appear. These are listed below.|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{construction}} design of <b>revolving</b> column <b>crane</b> which is used for manipulation with metal plates for metal shears and bending bench. The aim is to set main proportions and basic parameters for the designed steel construction via design calculation. Then the thesis deals with checking of strength analysis done by programme I-DEAS NX 11. Suggestion of disposal placement of the crane, choice of hoist, travelling system, auxiliary device and drawing documentation are also parts of the design...|$|R
50|$|The M816 Medium Wrecker {{is part of}} the M809 {{series of}} 5-ton 6x6 {{military}} trucks. It was made by AM General starting in 1970. It has a <b>revolving</b> hydraulic <b>crane</b> with an extending boom that can extend from 10-18 ft with a maximum lift capacity of 20,000 lb with outriggers and boom jacks to the ground. The boom capacity depends on boom extension and placements of truck outriggers and boom jacks. With boom full out and no outriggers, the capacity is only 3000 lb. The boom elevates to 45 degrees, swings 270.|$|R
