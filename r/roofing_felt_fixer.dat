50|$|In modern turf roof construction, bitumen <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> {{combined}} with dimpled plastic drainage membranes are usually used {{in place of}} birch bark. Bitumen <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> is nailed to the sarking and a dimpled cavity drainage membrane is laid over the top (dimples face down) to form a drainage layer. The turf is then laid over this drainage layer. Turf roofs are still widely used on newly built cabins in Norway.|$|R

50|$|<b>Roofing</b> <b>felt</b> is {{manufactured}} in roll format. Rolls of base felt are pulled on rollers through large tanks of bitumen mixes {{until they are}} saturated with the tar-like bitumen mixture, producing rolls of water-resistant but breathable material.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Roofing</b> <b>felts</b> {{are usually}} a 'paper' or fiber {{material}} impregnated in bitumen. As gravel cannot protect tarpaper surfaces where they rise vertically {{from the roof}} such as on parapet walls or upstands, the felts are usually coated with bitumen and protected by sheet metal flashings.|$|R
25|$|The {{primary use}} (70%) of asphalt is in road construction, {{where it is}} used as the glue or binder mixed with {{aggregate}} particles to create asphalt concrete. Its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products, including production of <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> and for sealing flat roofs.|$|R
50|$|A box gutter, {{parallel}} gutter, or trough gutter is a {{rain gutter}} on a roof usually rectangular in shape; {{it may be}} lined with EPDM rubber, metal, asphalt, or <b>roofing</b> <b>felt,</b> and may be concealed behind a parapet or the eaves, or in a roof valley.|$|R

50|$|Bituminous {{waterproofing}} {{systems are}} designed to protect residential and commercial buildings. Bitumen (asphalt or coal-tar pitch) is a mixed substance made up of organic liquids that are highly sticky, viscous, and waterproof. These systems are sometimes used to construct roofs, {{in the form of}} <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> or roll <b>roofing</b> products.|$|R
50|$|A clout is a {{relatively}} short, thick nail with a large, flat head used for attaching sheet material to wooden frames or sheet. A typical use is fixing <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> {{to the top of}} a shed. They are usually made of galvanised mild steel, but copper clouts are also available.|$|R
50|$|Underlay is {{also the}} term for the {{material}} under roofing tiles; this roofing membrane is often made of rubber and is used to seal the roof and prevent leakage. Underlayment used with roofing shingles provides a second layer of water proofing to prevent leaks and is called tar paper, <b>roofing</b> <b>felt,</b> or since the 1990s synthetic underlayment.|$|R
50|$|Further {{acquisitions}} were to come. Permanite, Britain’s biggest <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> manufacturer, and Limmer, a quoted asphalt company, {{were bought}} in 1971, while the 1973 purchase of Mitchell Construction (which had foundered on the Kariba Dam) strengthened the construction division. However, the acquisition {{which was to}} radically change the direction of Tarmac was McLean Homes bought {{at the beginning of}} 1974.|$|R
50|$|This {{used to be}} {{the case}} but in the UK, local {{authorities}} accept clean, dry textiles along with other recyclables. This is both at recycling centres and curb-side collections. Textiles (including tights, pantyhose and stockings) which cannot be re-worn are recycled and turned into things like <b>roofing</b> <b>felt.</b> There are several internet sites which explain ways of reusing pantyhose (laddered or otherwise).|$|R
50|$|Tar {{paper is}} a {{heavy-duty}} paper used in construction. Tar paper {{is made by}} impregnating paper or fiberglass mat with tar, producing a waterproof material useful for roof construction. Tar paper is distinguished from <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> which is impregnated with asphalt instead of tar; but these two products are used the same way, and their names sometimes are used informally as synonyms.|$|R

40|$|A weather sealing band used in {{building}} construction, especially on pitched roofs as an under-tile <b>roofing</b> <b>felt,</b> is novel in comprising a polyamide sheet. Its mean vapour diffusion resistance is expressed as an air layer equivalent diffusion thickness of 0. 1 - 0. 5 m. Preferably the actual sheet thickness is 20 - 250 mu m, especially 50 - 150 mu m. The polyamide is PA 6 or PA 6. 6. It is thermally stabilised {{and may be}} mixed with a copolymer. UV stabilisation is included, together with fibre reinforcement. USE -Used as a nylon weather sealing band for external use, especially as an under-tile <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> on pitched <b>roofs.</b> ADVANTAGE - The band has improved water (vapour) resistance {{under a variety of}} climatic conditions. It can be produced by an extrusion process. Incorporation of a copolymer inhibits tear propagation. The UV inhibitor can be simply carbon black. Glass or plastic fibres are usefully incorporated for reinforcement...|$|R
50|$|The stand's wooden roof, {{covered with}} layers of highly-flammable {{bituminous}} <b>roofing</b> <b>felt,</b> offered no resistance to the flames. Burning timbers and molten materials fell from the roof onto the crowd and seating below, and black smoke enveloped a passageway behind the stand, where many spectators were trying to escape. It took less than four minutes for the entire stand to be engulfed in flames.|$|R
50|$|Solar {{shingles}} are photovoltaic modules, capturing {{sunlight and}} transforming it into electricity. Most solar shingles are 12 x 86 in {{and can be}} stapled directly to the roofing cloth. When applied they have a 5 x 86 in strip of exposed surface. Different models of shingles have different mounting requirements. Some can be applied directly onto <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> intermixed with regular asphalt shingles while others may need special installation.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional {{built up}} roofing (informally called [...] "tar-and-gravel" [...] roofing) {{consists}} of {{multiple layers of}} <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> mopped with layers of hot liquid bitumen, and surfaced with gravel.

50|$|Sometimes it {{is desired}} {{not to put}} an antenna on the roof; in these cases, antennas {{designed}} for outdoor use are often mounted in the attic or loft, although antennas designed for attic use are also available. Putting an antenna indoors significantly decreases its performance due to lower elevation above ground level and intervening walls; however, in strong signal areas reception may be satisfactory. One layer of asphalt shingles, <b>roof</b> <b>felt,</b> and a plywood roof deck is considered to attenuate the signal to about half.|$|R

50|$|To {{avoid the}} expense re-roofing {{a house that}} is simply {{suffering}} from nail fatigue, and to obtain optimum insulation, an 85mm layer of polyurethane foam can be sprayed onto {{the underside of the}} slates or tiles of a pitched roof. This stabilises and weatherproofs the roof by fixing the nails, battens and <b>roofing</b> <b>felt.</b> As the foam is a superior insulant, coupled with just 100mm of insulation at joist level, your roof will also meet the stringent thermal performance standards required for a new home. A typical roof can be insulated using the polyurethane treatment for around half the cost of re-roofing.|$|R

5000|$|Walter Segal (1907-1985) was an {{architect}} who developed {{a system of}} self-build housing, the Segal self-build method. Based on traditional timber frame methods modified to use standard modern materials, his method {{eliminates the need for}} wet trades such as bricklaying and plastering, resulting in a light-weight method which can be built with minimal experience and is ecologically sound. The roofs tend to be flat with many layers of <b>roofing</b> <b>felt,</b> which allows the creation of grass-covered roofs. Foundations are minimal, often just paving slabs, the strength coming from the geometry of their construction. Segal houses have been compared to traditional Japanese houses.|$|R
50|$|The mound is {{supported}} on the outside by a wall of chalk blocks. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch with the <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> covered cap resting of a dead curb of wooden blocks. The four common sails with Van Bussel leading edges and air brakes have a span of 24.6 m. They are carried on a cast-iron windshaft which also carries the brake wheel which drives the wallower {{at the top of}} the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel drives the one pairs of mill stones of 1.50 m diameter via a lantern pinion stone nut.|$|R
50|$|Built in 1865, {{the mill}} was {{originally}} a grain mill. From 1925, a bakery {{was added to}} its operations. In 1921, the mill was modernized with a wind rose and self-adjusting sails and in 1926 a 14 hp Hornsby oil engine was installed. In 1971, the self-adjusting sails were renewed. At that time, the mill was still functional but {{was no longer in}} use. The octagonal tower (circular inside) is built of natural sandstone and the cap is <b>roofed</b> with <b>roofing</b> <b>felt.</b> There is an engine room with a functioning engine. The mill is in a reasonable state of repair. The cap can yaw and the sails can rotate but {{as a result of the}} old age of the owner it is not being properly maintained.|$|R
50|$|A birch-bark roof (in Finnish: malkakatto or tuohikato) is a roof {{construction}} traditional in Finland for farmhouses and farm buildings built from logs. The birch-bark roof was the prevailing roof type in rural Finland {{up until the}} 1860s, when it {{was replaced by the}} use of other materials such as metal sheeting and later <b>roofing</b> <b>felt.</b> The tradition of birch-bark roofs has been revived in recent years as a craft in connection with the restoration of old farm buildings that have been converted into open-air museums. The main reason for using birch bark was that when added in several layers, it acts as an efficient water- and damp-proof course. The birch trees would normally be de-barked, using a knife, during the summer.|$|R
5|$|After Colonel Brigg's {{death in}} 1900, the castle {{passed into the}} hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and from there to the National Coal Board. Due to the {{expansion}} of Sunderland in the 1940s, the castle became surrounded by housing estates including those of Castletown and Hylton Castle. The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, the castle and chapel were taken into the care of the Ministry of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry. The ministry also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead <b>roof</b> with <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> to make the site waterproof.|$|R
