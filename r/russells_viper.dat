40|$|Context: <b>Russells</b> <b>viper</b> is more {{medically}} important {{than any other}} Asian snake, due to number of envenomings and fatalities. <b>Russells</b> <b>viper</b> populations in South India and Sri Lanka (Daboia russelii) cause unique neuromuscular paralysis not seen in other Russells vipers. Objective: To investigate the time course and severity of neuromuscular dysfunction in definite <b>Russells</b> <b>viper</b> bites, including antivenom response. Methodology: We prospectively enrolled all patients (> 16 years) presenting with <b>Russells</b> <b>viper</b> bites over 14 months. Cases were confirmed by snake identification and/or enzyme immunoassay. All patients had serial neurological examinations and in some, single fibre electromyography (sfEMG) of the orbicularis oculi was performed. Results: 245 definite <b>Russells</b> <b>viper</b> bite patients (median age: 41 years; 171 males) presented a median 2. 5 h (interquartile range: 1. 75 - 4. 0 h) post-bite. All but one had local envenoming and 199 (78 %) had systemic envenoming: coagulopathy in 166 (68 %), neurotoxicity in 130 (53 %), and oliguria in 19 (8 %). Neurotoxicity was characterised by ptosis (100 %), blurred vision (93 %), and ophthalmoplegia (90 %) with weak extraocular movements, strabismus, and diplopia. Neurotoxicity developed within 8 h post-bite in all patients. No bulbar, respiratory or limb muscle weakness occurred. Neurotoxicity was associated with bites by larger snakes (p < 0. 0001) and higher peak serum venom concentrations (p = 0. 0025). Antivenom immediately decreased unbound venom in blood. Of 52 patients without neurotoxicity when they received antivenom, 31 developed neurotoxicity. sfEMG in 27 patients with neurotoxicity and 23 without had slightly elevated median jitter on day 1 compared to 29 normal subjects but normalised thereafter. Neurological features resolved in 80 % of patients by day 3 with ptosis and weak eye movements resolving last. No clinical or neurophysiological abnormality was detected at 6 weeks or 6 months. Conclusion: Sri Lankan <b>Russells</b> <b>viper</b> envenoming causes mild neuromuscular dysfunction with no long-term effects. Indian polyvalent antivenom effectively binds free venom in blood but does not reverse neurotoxicity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{describe}} the epidemiology of snake bite {{in the region}} and attempt to compare proven <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> with hump-nosed viper bites. MethodsAll snake bite admissions to the Toxicology Unit of Teaching Hospital Peradeniya over three year from 2006 were included. ResultsOf the 776 snakebites, 665 (86 %) were unidentified and non-envenomed. Hump-nosed <b>viper</b> and <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> accounted for 55 (7 %) and 40 (5 %) bites respectively, of them, incriminated snakes were found in 36 (65 %) and 19 (48 %) cases. The cobra bites- 5, krait bites- 0. The median ages: <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bites- 41 (range 16 - 66), hump-nosed viper bites- 42 (range 15 - 75). The gender incidence, time of bite (> 58 % daytime) were similar. In hump-nosed viper bite; upper limb involved in 13 (36 %), happened at home garden in 22 (61 %), none in paddy fields. In <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bite; 6 (33 %) occurred in paddy fields. Dry bites were similar at 5 %.

40|$|The {{hyaluronidase}} {{activities of}} venoms of snakes indigenous to Southeast Asia were investigated.

40|$|A {{radioimmunoassay}} (RIA) {{has been}} developed {{for the detection of}} <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> venom in body fluids. This is a competitive binding technique using a monoclonal antibody directed against the factor X activator of <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> venom. The sensitivity of the test in urine was 4 ng/ml, in 0. 1 % bovine serum albumin-phosphate buffered saline it was 20 ng/ml and in serum it was 5 micrograms/ml. This was adequate to detect venom in the serum of four patients bitten by <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper.</b> Urine from an isolated kidney preparation perfused with <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> venom contained coagulant activity and was positive using the competitive RIA.

Hypopituitarism following envenoming by <b>Russell's</b> <b>vipers</b> is a well recognized sequel in Burma and parts of India but has been reported only once in Sri Lanka. Hypokalaemia following envenoming by <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> has not been described. Here we describe the association of acute pituitary insufficiency and hypokalaemia following <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> envenoming in Sri Lanka and review the literature in order to understand its pathophysiological basis. A previously healthy 21 -year-old man was envenomed by a <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> and treated with antivenom. Ten hours after the bite, he developed persistent hypotension, which responded promptly to intravenous dexamethasone. His hormone profiles were consistent with hypocortisolism secondary to acute pituitary insufficiency. He also developed hypokalaemia. Analysis of urine and serum electrolytes suggested redistribution of potassium in to the cells rather than renal loss. Hypotension and hypoglycaemic coma are life-threatening manifestations of acute pituitary insufficiency. Therefore prompt steroid administration in these setting is life saving. Awareness of these complications among physicians would help to make prompt diagnosis and initiate immediate life saving treatment...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> (Daboia russelii) is {{responsible}} for 30 - 40 % of all snakebites and the most number of life-threatening bites of any snake in Sri Lanka. The clinical profile of <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bite includes local swelling, coagulopathy, renal dysfunction and neuromuscular paralysis, based on which the syndromic diagnostic tools have been developed. The currently available Indian polyvalent antivenom is not very effective in treating <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bite patients in Sri Lanka and the decision regarding antivenom therapy is primarily driven by clinical and laboratory evidence of envenoming. The non-availability of early predictors of <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> systemic envenoming {{is responsible}} for considerable delay in commencing antivenom. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate abdominal pain as an early feature of systemic envenoming following <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bites. We evaluated the clinical profile of <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bite patients admitted to a tertiary care centre in Sri Lanka. Fifty-five patients were proven <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bite victims who produced the biting snake, while one hundred and fifty-four were suspected to have been bitten by the same snake species. Coagulopathy (159, 76. 1 %), renal dysfunction (39, 18. 7 %), neuromuscular paralysis (146, 69. 9 %) and local envenoming (192, 91. 9 %) were seen in the victims, ranging from mono-systemic involvement to various combinations. Abdominal pain was present in 79. 5 % of these patients, appearing 5 minutes to 4 hours after the bite. The severity of the abdominal pain, assessed using a scoring system, correlated well with the severity of the coagulopathy (p< 0. 001) and the neurotoxicity (p< 0. 001). Its diagnostic validity to predict systemic envenoming is - Sensitivity 81. 6 %, Specificity 82. 4 %, Positive predictive value 91. 2 %.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{enzyme immunoassay}} technique (EIA) {{was used in}} the diagnosis of 311 suspected <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bite cases in Myanmar [Burma], 181 of whom (58 %) had systemic envenoming. <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> venom was detected in the sera of 175 (56. 3 %), cobra or green pit viper venoms in 4 (1. 3 %), and no venom in the remaining 132 (42. 4). Among 175 of these patients who failed to bring the dead snake, EIA achieved a specific diagnosis of <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> envenoming in 101 (58 %). The serum venom antigen concentration was higher in patients with systemic envenoming than in those with local or no envenoming and it increased with the development of coagulopathy.

40|$|<b>Russell's</b> <b>vipers</b> (Daboia russelii and D. siamensis) inhabit 10 South and South East Asian countries. People envenomed {{by these}} snakes suffer coagulopathy, bleeding, shock, neurotoxicity, acute kidney injury and local tissue damage leading to severe {{morbidity}} and mortality. An unusual complication of <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bite envenoming in Burma (D. siamensis) and southern India (D. russelii) is hypopituitarism but until {{now it has}} not been reported elsewhere. Here, we describe the first case of hypopituitarism following <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bite in Sri Lanka, review the literature on this subject and make recommendations for endocrine investigation and management. A 49 -year-old man was bitten and seriously envenomed by D. russelii in 2005. He was treated with antivenom but although he recovered from the acute effects he remained feeling unwell. Hypopituitarism, with deficiencies of gonadal, steroid and thyroid axes, was diagnosed 3 years later. He showed marked improvement after replacement of anterior pituitary hormones. We attribute his hypopituitarism to D. russelii envenoming. <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bite is known to cause acute and chronic hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus, perhaps through deposition of fibrin microthrombi and haemorrhage in the pituitary gland resulting from the action of venom procoagulant enzymes and haemorrhagins. Forty nine cases of hypopituitarism following <b>Russell's</b> <b>viper</b> bite have been described in the English language literature. Patients with acute hypopituitarism may present with hypoglycaemia and hypotension during the acute phase of envenoming. Those with chronic hypopituitarism seem to have recovered from envenoming but present later with features of hypopituitarism. Over 85 % of these patients had suffered acute kidney injury immediately after the bite. Steroid replacement in acute hypopituitarism is life saving. All 11 patients with chronic hypopituitarism in whom the outcome of treatment was reported, showed marked improvement with hormone replacement. Unrecognized acute hypopituitarism is potentially fatal while chronic hypopituitarism can be debilitating. Physicians should therefore be aware of this complication of severe envenoming by <b>Russell's</b> <b>vipers,</b> especially in Burma and South India, so that the diagnosis may be made without delay and replacement started with essential hormones such as hydrocortisone and thyroxine...|$|R

40|$|Venom {{detection}} {{is crucial}} for confirmation of envenomation and snake type in snake-bite patients.

Serum samples underwent dissociation treatment and then <b>Russell’s</b> <b>viper</b> venom or Australian elapid venom measured by EIA. In confirmed <b>Russell’s</b> <b>viper</b> bites with venom detected pre-antivenom (positive controls), no venom was detected in untreated post-antivenom samples, but was after dissociation treatment.
