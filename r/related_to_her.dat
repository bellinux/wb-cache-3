5|$|Tubman {{was busy}} during this time, giving talks to {{abolitionist}} audiences and tending to her relatives. In {{the autumn of}} 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack, Tubman could not be contacted. When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16, Tubman was not present. Some historians believe she was in New York at the time, ill with fever <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> childhood head injury. Others propose {{she may have been}} recruiting more escaped slaves in Ontario, and Kate Clifford Larson suggests she may have been in Maryland, recruiting for Brown's raid or attempting to rescue more family members. Larson also notes that Tubman may have begun sharing Frederick Douglass's doubts about the viability of the plan.|$|E
5|$|At the Carnegie Institution, Rubin {{began work}} <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{controversial}} thesis regarding galaxy clusters with Ford, making hundreds of observations using Ford's image-tube spectrograph. This instrument allowed Rubin to amplify starlight {{seen through the}} telescope so they could view astronomical objects that were previously too dim to see. The Rubin–Ford effect, an apparent anisotropy in {{the expansion of the}} Universe on the scale of 100 million light years, was discovered through studies of spiral galaxies, particularly the Andromeda Galaxy, chosen for its brightness and proximity to Earth. First appearing in journals in 1976, the idea of peculiar motion on this scale in the universe was a highly controversial proposition, dismissed by leading astronomers but ultimately shown to be valid. The effect is now known as large scale streaming. The pair also briefly studied quasars, which had been discovered in 1963 and were a popular topic of research.|$|E

5|$|Félix Trinidad {{was born}} in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to a Puerto Rican family. During his {{childhood}} {{the family moved to}} Cupey Alto, a subdivision of San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he grew up. His future wife, Sharon Santiago, lived in Cupey and first met Trinidad in the home of her neighborhood friend, a classmate of Trinidad's. Trinidad pursued a relationship with Santiago, including an attempt to impress her with his red Ford Mustang. He continued to press for her affection and, with the help of Santiago's neighbor, Trinidad was able to win her over. Early on, Santiago's mother thought that Trinidad was <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> daughter's friend, but she realized the true situation when she visited the friend's house and he acted nervous in her presence. Santiago's father objected to the relationship because Trinidad was an athlete; at the time many athletes had a negative public image. Santiago became rebellious, but Trinidad eventually won her family's trust. The couple was married four years after they began dating and have had four daughters. Trinidad has a fifth daughter, named Alondra Nicole, from another relationship.|$|E

Throughout the process she experiences emotional pain from relationships that lack depth, and learns for herself about the harms of substance dependence.

5|$|Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur (February 18, 1921 – February 16, 1998) was an American {{toxicologist}} {{and public}} health researcher who worked primarily on pollution. She was charged with studying {{the effects of the}} 1948 Donora smog, so she specifically looked into the effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs. Her findings on the respiratory effects related to sulfuric acid led to her being threatened, to her funding being pulled, and to her losing her job at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1953. Undeterred by the setback, she carried on her research in a different role at Harvard, and subsequently at MIT and New York University. Despite the early controversy <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> work, it was used in the creation of standards in air pollution, and towards {{the end of her life}} she received numerous awards and accolades.|$|E

5|$|UB-12s {{activities}} {{over the}} next year are not well documented, and no specific record of her can be found in English-language sources. However, it is known that during this period, she was helmed by four different commanders, with the final officer, Oblt. Ernst Schöller, assuming command in May 1918. Under Schöller's command, UB-12 departed Zeebrugge on 19 August to lay mines in the Downs off the Kentish coast, but never returned. According to one British source, UB-12 was herself mined off Helgoland sometime in August. Author Dwight Messimer considers this unlikely given that Helgoland is nowhere near the route that UB-12 could have taken to get to the Downs. A postwar German study concluded the two most likely fates for UB-12 were that she either struck a British mine or was destroyed by one of her own mines that malfunctioned during deployment. Messimer also considers it possible that UB-12 may have had a diving accident <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> conversion to a minelayer.|$|E
