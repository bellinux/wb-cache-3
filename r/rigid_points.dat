Let the rounded end of a brass rod, 0.3 of an inch or thereabouts in diameter, point downwards in free air; let it be amalgamated, and have a drop of mercury suspended from it; and then let it be powerfully electrized. The mercury will present the phenomenon of glow; a current of air will rush along the rod, and set off from the mercury directly downwards; and the form of the metallic drop will be slightly affected, the convexity at a small part near the middle and lower part becoming greater, whilst it diminishes all round at places a little removed from this spot. The change is from the form of a (fig. 135.) to that of b, and is due almost, if not entirely, to the mechanical force of the current of air sweeping over its surface.|$|E
60|$|Taking his portrait, {{from top}} to toe, the picture of him began with a tall hat, broadly encircled by a {{mourning}} band of crumpled crape. Below the hat was a lean, long, sallow face, deeply pitted with the smallpox, and characterized, very remarkably, by eyes of two different colors--one bilious green, one bilious brown, both sharply intelligent. His hair was iron-gray, carefully brushed round at the temples. His cheeks and chin were in the bluest bloom of smooth shaving; his nose was short Roman; his lips long, thin, and supple, curled up at the corners with a mildly-humorous smile. His white cravat was high, stiff, and dingy; the collar, higher, stiffer, and dingier, projected its <b>rigid</b> <b>points</b> on either side beyond his chin. Lower down, the lithe little figure of the man was arrayed throughout in sober-shabby black. His frock-coat was buttoned tight round the waist, and left to bulge open majestically at the chest. His hands were covered with black cotton gloves neatly darned at the fingers; his umbrella, worn down at the ferule to {{the last quarter of}} an inch, was carefully preserved, nevertheless, in an oilskin case. The front view of him was the view in which he looked oldest; meeting him face to face, he might have been estimated at fifty or more. Walking behind him, his back and shoulders were almost young enough to have passed for five-and-thirty. His manners were distinguished by a grave serenity. When he opened his lips, he spoke in a rich bass voice, with an easy flow of language, and a strict attention to the elocutionary claims of words in more than one syllable. Persuasion distilled from his mildly-curling lips; and, shabby as he was, perennial flowers of courtesy bloomed all over him from head to foot.|$|E

The MRI brain Images were first decomposed using F-transform, then Edge and CP were extracted from F-transform error function, and some proposed rules.

40|$|Abstract. Non-rigid 3 D shape {{recovery}} is an inherently ambiguous problem. Given a specific rigid motion, different non-rigid shapes {{can be found}} that fit the measurements. To solve this ambiguity prior knowledge on the shape and motion {{should be used to}} constrain the solution. This paper is based on the observation that often not all the points on a moving and deforming surface such as a human face are undergoing non-rigid motion. Some of the points are frequently on rigid parts of the structure – for instance the nose – while others lie on deformable areas. First we develop a segmentation algorithm to separate rigid and non-rigid motion. Once this segmentation is available, the <b>rigid</b> <b>points</b> can be used to estimate the overall rigid motion and to constrain the underlying mean shape. We propose two reconstruction algorithms and show that improved reconstructions can be obtained when the priors on the shape are used on synthetic and real data. ...|$|E

This is achieved by initially computing a trifocal tensor using the three most extreme views. The intermediate views are then computed linearly using the trifocal tensor. An iterative algorithm is presented which perturbs the twelve entries of one camera matrix so that the algebraic error along the whole sequence is minimised. 1 Introduction In recent years, the availability of texture mapping graphics hardware has increased, so that most desktop computers are able to display exceedingly realistic three-dimensional scenes.

Using a stereo setup dramatically improves the 3 D model estimation when the observed 3 D shape is mostly deforming without undergoing strong rigid motion. Our approach first calibrates the stereo system automatically and then computes a single metric rigid structure for each frame. Afterwards, these 3 D shapes are aligned to a reference view using a RANSAC method in order to compute the mean shape of the object and to select the subset of points on the object which have remained rigid throughout the sequence without deforming. The selected <b>rigid</b> <b>points</b> are then used to compute frame-wise shape registration and to extract the motion parameters robustly from frame to frame.

40|$|Wet {{processes}} are gaining {{a renewed interest}} for removal of high dose ion implanted photoresist (II-PR) in front-end-of-line semiconductor manufacturing because of their excellent selectivity towards the wafer substrate and gate materials. The selection of wet chemistries is supported by an insight into the resist degradation by ion implantation. In this work, different analytical techniques have been applied for in-depth characterization of the chemical changes in 248 nm DUV PR after arsenic implantation. A radical mechanism of resist degradation is proposed involving cross-linking and chain scission reactions. The cross-linking of the resist is dominant especially for high doses and energies. It leads to significant depletion of hydrogen and formation of carbon macroradicals that recombine to form C-C cross-linked crust. Moreover, formation of ab-unsaturated ketonic and/or quinonoid structures by cross-linking reactions is suggested. In addition, the dopant species may provide <b>rigid</b> <b>points</b> in the PR matrix by chemical bonding with the resist. For higher doses and energies further dehydrogenation occurs, which leads to formation of triple bonds in the crust. Different p-conjugated structures are formed in the crust by cross-linking and dehydrogenation reactions. No presence of amorphous carbon in the crust is revealed.

40|$|The {{perspective}} {{projections of}} n physical points on two views (stereovision) are constrained {{as soon as}} n 8. However, to prove in practice {{the existence of a}} rigid motion between two images, more than 8 point matches are desirable in order to compensate for the limited accuracy of the matches. In this paper, we propose a computational de nition of rigidity and a probabilistic criterion to rate the meaningfulness of a rigid set as a function of both the number of pairs of points (n) and the accuracy of the matches. This criterion yields an objective way to compare, say, precise matches of a few points and approximate matches of a lot of points. It gives a yes/no answer to the question : this <b>rigid</b> <b>points</b> correspondence have occurred by chance ?", since it guarantees that the expected number of meaningful rigid sets found by chance in a random distribution of points is as small as desired. It also yields absolute accuracy requirements for rigidity detection in the case of non-matched points, and optimal values of n, depending on the expected accuracy of the matches and on the proportion of outliers.
