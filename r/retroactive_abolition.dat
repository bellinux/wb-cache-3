50|$|In 2001 the Supreme Court of the United States {{held that}} a Tennessee court's <b>retroactive</b> <b>abolition</b> of the rule was {{constitutional}} in Rogers v. Tennessee.|$|E
50|$|Rogers appealed {{again to}} the Tennessee Supreme Court. The {{court held that the}} common-law year-and-a-day rule survived in Tennessee, but was outmoded. It {{therefore}} abolished the rule. Rogers had also argued that abolishing the rule after he had committed his crime would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I of the U.S. Constitution. The Tennessee Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that although judicial decisions can be ex post facto laws, <b>retroactive</b> <b>abolition</b> in this case would not offend due process principles because the year-and-a-day rule was so outmoded that a reasonable person would not expect it to exist under modern law. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case at Rogers's request.|$|E
