40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effect of temperature and time depolymerization of natural latex rubber using NaNO 2, H 2 O 2 and Ascorbic Acid (0. 4 : 0. 2 : 0. 1) mol at pH about 5 towards its molecular weight reduction, then studied the effect on the quality of adhesives produced. The stages of this research include making concentrated natural rubber latex, its depolymerization, rubber crepe making, rubber compounding and followed by <b>rubber</b> <b>adhesives</b> manufacturing. Depolymerization is conducted by varying the temperature (50, 70 and 90 oC) with the duration (4, 6, 8, and 10 hours). The indication of molecular weight reduction is determined by the mooney viscosity test, while the quality of the <b>rubber</b> <b>adhesives</b> is evaluated from the Brookfield viscosity test and its peel strength. Concentrated Natural Rubber was successfully prepared using 2 % (v / v) ammonium laurate 20 % and 0. 2 % (v / v) 2 % sodium alginate resulted in dry rubber content 49. 36 %, mechanical stability 91 seconds, ammonia 0. 58 % and Viscosity Mooney 193. 80 cp. Chemical depolymerization is able to reduce the viscosity mooney of natural rubber approximately 95 %. The results showed that the greatest molecular weight reduction was depolymerization at 70 ° C for 8 hours indicated by decreasing the mooney viscosity from 193. 80 to 10. 05 cp. From the results of testing the quality of the adhesives, the lower the molecular weight the adhesive power between layers of rubber is higher with lower Viscosity Brookfield. The peel strength of resulted adhesive ranges from 4. 76 - 17. 25 kg / inch 2 with brookfield viscosity between 1966 - 3810 cp. Based on the comparison with the quality of <b>rubber</b> <b>adhesives</b> in the market that has peel strength about 4. 35 kg / inch 2, {{it can be said that}} the <b>rubber</b> <b>adhesives</b> from of this research results have met the market requirements...|$|R
5000|$|The product now {{commonly}} called duct tape {{should not be}} confused with special tapes actually designed for sealing heating and ventilation (HVAC) ducts, though these tapes may also be called [...] "duct tapes." [...] To provide laboratory data about which sealants and tapes last, and which are likely to fail, research was conducted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Environmental Energy Technologies Division. Their major conclusion was that one should not use duct tape to seal ducts (they had defined duct tape as any fabric-based tape with <b>rubber</b> <b>adhesive).</b> The testing done shows that under challenging but realistic conditions, duct tapes become brittle and may fail quickly, at times becoming leaky or falling off completely.|$|E
50|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} combining new plasticizers with the white, flour-like vinyl resin. Finally, in January 1946, inventors Snell, Oace, and Eastwold of 3M {{applied for a}} patent for a vinyl electrical tape with a plasticizer system and non-sulfur-based <b>rubber</b> <b>adhesive</b> that were compatible. The first commercially available version of the tape was sold {{for use as a}} wire-harness wrapping. Interestingly, this original black tape wasn't black at all. Tapes formulated for high-temperature were yellow, and later versions were white. White tape, because of its instability in ultraviolet light, was eventually replaced with black tape, although colored vinyl tapes are still used as identification and marking tapes. Black became the standard industry color for vinyl standard tape, primarily because of its ultraviolet resistance. Thicknesses originally were 4 mil (100 µm), 8 mil (200 µm) and 12 mil (300 µm). These were standardized to 7 mil (180 µm) and 10 mil (250 µm) in 1948.|$|E

40|$|Duct leakage is a {{major source}} of energy loss in {{residential}} buildings. Most duct leakage occurs at the connections to registers, plenums, or branches in the duct system. At each of these connections, a method of sealing the duct system is required. Typical sealing methods include tapes or mastics applied around the joints in the system. Field examinations of duct systems have shown that taped seals tend to fail over extended periods of time. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been testing sealant longevity for several years. The accelerated test method developed by LBNL is being used as a basis for an ASTM Standard under sub-committee E 6. 41. LBNL tests found that typical duct tape (i. e., fabric backed tapes with <b>rubber</b> <b>adhesives)</b> fails more rapidly than all other duct sealants. LBNL has also tested advanced tape products being developed by major manufacturers.

50|$|In the past, the {{greatest}} complaint with prosthetics is not having secure adherence. When prostheses are not adhered securely, satisfaction of prostheses is significantly decreased. In {{a survey conducted}} approximately two years after receiving the prostheses, only 67% of respondents “benefited” and only 39% still used them (Janes S 2005). Adhesion of prostheses depends greatly on the materials and fabrication techniques. Presently common are self-adhering prostheses (mass-produced) which adhere well initially, but the adhesion weakens over a few months. Another common method of adhesion is to apply an organic based pressure sensitive adhesive to the prosthesis for each use. However, removing the adhesive is difficult and can easily tear the thin edges of the prosthesis. Most promising though is a fabrication technique where the silicone prostheses are bonded to {{a thin layer of}} polyurethane. A water-based acrylic <b>rubber</b> <b>adhesive</b> is applied to the polyurethane, and the prostheses could be adhered to the skin for up to two weeks at a time. Removing the adhesive from the prostheses is fairly simple and is done with an alcohol swab. The edges of the prostheses remain thin and durable due to the polyurethane layer. Additionally, the water-based adhesive is gentle on the skin and is indicated for irradiated skin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A micro-pillar based {{silicone}} <b>rubber</b> <b>adhesive</b> {{coated with}} a thin silicone oil layer is investigated in this paper for developing friction-based clamping mechanisms for robotic endoscopic microcapsules. These adhesives are shown to enhance the frictional force between the capsule and the intestinal wall {{by a factor of}} about 7 over the non-patterned flat elastomer material. In this study, tests performed on fresh samples of pig small intestines are used to optimize the diameter of the micro-pillars to maximize the frictional forces. In addition, the effects of other factors such as the oil viscosity and applied normal forces are investigated. It is demonstrated that the proposed micro-pillar pattern based elastomer adhesive exhibits a maximal frictional force when the pillar diameter is 140 µm and coated silicon oil has a very high viscosity (10, 000 cSt). It is also found that the frictional force of the micro patterned adhesive increases nonlinearly in proportion to the applied normal force. These adhesives would be used as a robust attachment material for developing robotic capsule endoscopes inside intestines with clamping capability. Keywords.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the relationship between the peel force required to remove the medical adhesive tapes and the angle of peel. Method : Three kinds of adhesive tapes to fix gauze, 25 mm in width and 125 mm in length (Tape A, B and C) were stuck on a bakelite board for 30 minutes, and then removed while the peel forces were recorded. Peel force measurements were obtained at 30 °, 60 °, 90 °, 120 °, 150 °, and 170 °. Tape A was rayon non-woven fabric coated with an acrylic adhesive. Tape B was poly vinyl chloride tape coated with a <b>rubber</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Tape C was polyethylene film coated with an acrylic adhesive. Results: For all tapes used, the maximal peel force occurred at peel angle 30 °.

40|$|This thesis {{refers to}} a {{simulation}} of an adhesive joint used to bond two metal sheets of {{a component of the}} side skirt bracket implemented in trucks. The adhesive joint must support fatigue and mixed-mode loading. The principal goal is the implementation of a novel material model, which governs the damage produced by a mixed-mode fatigue loading in a <b>rubber</b> <b>adhesive</b> layer. Two approaches to define the material model are implemented: the filament model and the principal strain model. The models are fitted against experiments, which have been performed parallel to the development of this thesis by the Mechanics of Materials (MoM) research group of the University of Skövde. The models incorporate fitting parameters with the aim of adjusting the models against experimental results. Simulations are performed using the Finite Element (FE) software, ABAQUS, and the material models are implemented using UMAT subroutines.
