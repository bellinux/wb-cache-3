40|$|The {{study of}} heavy metals in <b>road</b> <b>shoulder</b> soils is {{critical}} as <b>road</b> <b>shoulder</b> is a recipient for all pollutants associated with runoff resulted from vehicles moving {{on the road}} and this pollutant eventually would end up in the river nearby or shallow groundwater. There was yet research been done to determine the heavy metals in the <b>road</b> <b>shoulder</b> soils in front of Universiti Malaysia Kelantan (UMK) Jeli Campus. Thus, distribution of heavy metals in the rural area <b>road</b> <b>shoulder</b> soils along UMK Jeli Campus is studied. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the type of heavy metals that present in the soil along the highway <b>road</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Apart of that, the study also was to determine the concentration of heavy metals such as Zn, Pb, Mn, Cd and Cu. The data obtained were compared with the standard. The soil samples were collected and analyzed for the concentration of Zn, Pb, Cu, Mn and Cd elements using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The sampling had been done twice along 10 stations. Furthermore, the vehicle traffic count is also done. The results show that the Mn concentration was the highest for the both sampling. On the other hand, Cd concentration was the lowest for the both sampling. All the concentration of heavy metals studied is higher compared to the standard except for Mn. Although Mn had the highest concentration but it falls below the natural range. The values of the heavy metal suggest that vehicle is a major source of heavy metals contamination in the <b>road</b> <b>shoulder</b> soils since there are no industries activities. One-Way ANOVA Test was used to determine significance differences between sampling station and the results showed that, there was no significant different between sampling station. The results of the study not only provide information on the concentration of heavy metals in the <b>road</b> <b>shoulder</b> but also can be use as a basis to develop the standard for Malaysia. ...|$|R

40|$|If {{the idea}} of an {{obstacle}} is broadly interpreted every object which is {{in the way of a}} vehicle can be regarded as an obstacle. According to this definition all road users are also obstacles. In this literature study only exclusive fixed objects along the highway, such as lighting poles and columns for fly overs are considered. All of these have a useful function, but can produce danger for the road users by their position and design. It is established that the presence of obstacles on <b>road</b> <b>shoulders</b> increases the number and severity of collisions with obstacles. A literature review has been carried out on the behaviour in collisions of fixed objects which are on <b>road</b> <b>shoulders.</b> In principle research is focussed on the creation of a safe <b>road</b> <b>shoulder</b> by (1) the construction of safety fences, (2) the protection of the other obstacles by so called obstacle safety devices, (3) the construction of break-aways and base slip-joints, and (4) making the <b>road</b> <b>shoulder</b> free of obstacles. In a second part of the paper tables and figures are presented. See also B 1466...|$|R

40|$|Heavy vehicle are {{wider than}} {{passenger}} car, hence, {{it requires a}} wider space to operate and to park. When heavy vehicle drivers are unable to locate parking they often park on the <b>road</b> lane or <b>shoulder.</b> These vehicles {{should not be allowed}} to park on <b>road</b> lane or <b>shoulder</b> as it obstructs the vision of other drivers, the <b>road</b> lane or <b>shoulder</b> may require constant maintenance and repair; and pedestrian and motorists may be forced onto the streets or onto the wrong side of the streets in order to pass the heavy vehicles. This research was conducted to establish if width of road lane and <b>road</b> <b>shoulders</b> in neighbourhood streets will encourage heavy vehicle parking. Five residential areas in MPJBT were selected as the case study. Selected local and minor collector streets with heavy vehicle parked on it were measured for their actual lane width (ALW) and actual <b>road</b> <b>shoulder</b> width (ASW). The t-test was used to compare the means of ALW and ASW with the recommended JKR and JPBD standard. The t-test rejected the null hypothesis as the sig- value p is less than alpha level (a = 0. 20) at 80 % confidence level. The analysis indicates that almost all (80 %) of ALW and ASW do not follow the recommended JKR and JPBD standard. The mean of ALW for both local and minor collector roads are oversized (p = 0. 000). Comparisons of ALW for minor collector road also show a lower p value than the alpha level (p = 0. 0002). The results further suggest that oversized lane will encourage heavy vehicles to be parked on it. The t-test also proved that the mean of ASW for both local (p = 0. 000) and minor collector (p = 0. 001) streets do not follow the recommended JKR standard. It is concluded that oversized lane and <b>road</b> <b>shoulders</b> widths provides an opportunity for heavy vehicle drivers to misuse the space...|$|R
