40|$|From {{the results}} {{presented}} in Part 2 {{it is supposed}} that the reticulocyte ripening substances in the bovine liver found by the author may be protein belonging to a globulin fraction or a substance attached to some particles of the cytoplasm, {{which can not be}} precipitated by the general centrifugation. The supernatant obtained from the saline extract by centrifuging at a low speed was again put to ultra-centrigu-gation at 40, 000 r. p. m., thus splitting fraction into two, soluble fractions and microsome or mitochondrial fractions. Ripening test on reticulocytes proved that the effective substance had been transfered to the soluble fraction. The globulin fraction obtained from the saline exfract by the half saturation with ammonium sulfate also proved to be effective. Electro-paper chromatography of the protein obtained from the saline extract revealed that it contained a fraction of γ-globulin which was found to be lacking in the water extract. Thus the <b>ripening</b> <b>substance</b> of reticulocyte has been prove to be a protein belonging to the γ-globulin fraction originated from the hyaloplasm...|$|E
40|$|The attempt {{has been}} made to extract the {{reticulocyte}} <b>ripening</b> <b>substances</b> from bovine liver with distilled water, a 2 % saline solution, ethanol and ether.

40|$|According to {{the method}} deviced by Seno and orthers {{the mode of}} {{maturation}} of reticulocytes of anemic rabbits have been observed in vitro with or without addition of the emulsion of bovine liver. The observations prove that the supernatant of the liver emulsion {{has the ability to}} accelerate the maturation of the reticulocytes showing complete maturation by about two hours in the oxygenated blood where the supernatant is added, while it takes about 9 hours under the same condition without addition of the suppernatant. Intravenous introduction of a large dose of the supernatant into the anemic rabbits results in a temporary and rapid derease of reticulocytes in circulating blood. These observations indicate that the <b>ripening</b> <b>substances</b> like that in guinea pig liver found by Seno and others likewise exist in the bovine liver...|$|R
