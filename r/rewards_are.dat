5|$|In May 2007, YouTube {{launched}} its Partner Program, a {{system based on}} AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site. YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader. There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program. According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually no {{more than half of}} eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, {{due to a lack of}} interested advertisers. In 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos. YouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator <b>Rewards,</b> <b>are</b> a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels. The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal and ruby are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million and fifty million views, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Ranked matches {{automatically}} place {{players in}} a match from a chosen category. The matches intend to group players whose ranks are the same or very close together, to make the matches competitive. Ranked matches give the player experience, which will allow the player to move up different ranks. As the player moves up ranks, special <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> unlocked for their character.|$|E

25|$|Umpiring is a thankless sort of task. it is unspectacular, its {{financial}} <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> not great, and {{it calls for}} unwavering concentration during hours of standing, sometimes under a pitless sun, sometimes in a biting wind. To this must be added the fact that decisions like stumpings, run-outs, l.b.w.s and catches at the wicket are frequently the cause of contention, with the umpire invariably coming in for adverse criticism.|$|E
25|$|Promote involvement: Loafing is {{also less}} likely to occur when people are {{involved}} with their work, and when they enjoy working with others in groups. These are people who value both {{the experience of being}} part of a group, as well as achieving results. Also, challenging and difficult tasks reduce social loafing. Social loafing is also reduced when individuals are involved in group work and their <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> received as a team, rather than individually.|$|E
25|$|In multiplayer, {{players can}} {{be a member of}} a guild, a group which shares minions and {{cooperate}} towards achieving goals. Guild Tournaments, in which guilds compete for the rank of Horny's Chosen, are held. Victory stars are awarded based on players' performance in raids. If enough stars are earned, the guild qualifies for the tournament. The first five qualifying guilds enter the Horny's Chosen bracket. The other qualifying guilds enter a standard tournament. Guilds are ranked according to victory stars earned. The Horny's Chosen brackets yield greater Gem rewards than the standard tournament. <b>Rewards</b> <b>are</b> distributed to guild members according to participation. Guilds that do not win enter a lottery for a Gem payout. Another feature is the League of Evil, a ladder system in which players are ranked according to trophies earned. The higher the rank, the greater the resource bonus for performing successful raids. As players promote through the ranks, achievements with Gem <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> unlocked, and players are given all achievements and Gem rewards up to that rank if they already qualify for a higher rank. Another event is Event Raids, in which players build defences to withstand waves of invaders.|$|E

50|$|Selecting the {{appropriate}} <b>rewards</b> <b>is</b> vital to any program's success. The goal in choosing <b>rewards</b> <b>is</b> to select items that will spark the participant’s interest or feelings, {{and support the}} program’s objectives. Effective rewards will both motivate short-term behavior and provide motivation over time. There are several types of rewards.|$|R
5000|$|Culturally, {{intrinsically}} motivated {{acts that}} have no extrinsic <b>reward</b> <b>are</b> praised by society whereas actions that receive a tangible <b>reward</b> <b>are</b> not praised as highly, which would indicate that for actions that have a tangible reward they receive less praise and this undermines their intrinsic motivation to complete the task.|$|R
25|$|Important {{forms of}} {{intangible}} rewards include praise, recognition and rewards. Intangible <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> ones from which an employee does not derive any material gain. Such rewards {{have the greatest}} impact when they soon follow the desired behavior and are {{closely tied to the}} performance. If an organization wants to use praise or other intangible rewards effectively, praise should be offered for a high level of performance and for things that they employee has control over. Some studies have shown that praise can be as effective as tangible rewards.|$|E
25|$|From behaviourists such as B. F. Skinner {{come the}} {{learning}} theories, which state that complex behaviour is learned gradually through the modification of simpler behaviours. Imitation and reinforcement play {{important roles in}} these theories, which state that individuals learn by duplicating behaviours they observe in others and that <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> essential to ensuring the repetition of desirable behaviour. As each simple behaviour is established through imitation and subsequent reinforcement, the complex behaviour develops. When verbal behaviour is established the organism can learn through rule-governed behaviour and thus not all action needs to be contingency shaped.|$|E
25|$|While a Treasury {{order of}} 1886 made {{provision}} {{for the preservation}} of suitable objects in various national museums and payment of rewards to their finders, the Crown is under no legal obligation to offer any rewards for treasure trove objects it has claimed. However, it usually does so, using the objects' market price as a guide. A reward may be withheld or reduced if the finder has inappropriately handled an object, for instance, damaged it by cleaning it or applying waxes and varnishes to it. Finders may elect to waive their rewards. <b>Rewards</b> <b>are</b> not paid for finds occurring during organized fieldwork.|$|E

25|$|The {{similarities}} between China today and New York 150 years ago shouldn't {{come as a}} great surprise. Adulteration on such a scandalous scale occurs in societies with a toxic combination of characteristics: a fast-growing capitalist economy coupled with a government {{unable or unwilling to}} regulate the food supply. In such get-rich-quick societies, there is a huge temptation to tamper with food, particularly when margins are low. The <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> instant, and it's not always easy for consumers to detect the difference between the pure and the doctored—particularly with a substance like milk, which we have been taught to trust implicitly.|$|E
25|$|Expectancy {{theory has}} been shown to have useful {{applications}} in designing a reward system. If policies are consistently, clearly and fairly implemented, then the instrumentality would be high. If the <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> substantial enough to be meaningful to an employee, then the valence would be also considered high. A precursor to motivation is that the employee finds the reward(s) attractive. In some instances, the reward or outcome might inadvertently be unattractive, such as increased workload or demanding travel that may come with a promotion. In such an instance, the valence might be lower for individuals who feel work–life balance is important, for example.|$|E
25|$|Applied {{behavior}} analysis, a research-based science utilizing behavioral {{principles of}} operant conditioning, {{is effective in}} a range of educational settings. For example, teachers can alter student behavior by systematically rewarding students who follow classroom rules with praise, stars, or tokens exchangeable for sundry items. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of awards in changing behavior, their use in education has been criticized by proponents of self-determination theory, who claim that praise and other rewards undermine intrinsic motivation. There is evidence that tangible rewards decrease intrinsic motivation in specific situations, such as when the student already has a high level of intrinsic motivation to perform the goal behavior. But the results showing detrimental effects are counterbalanced by evidence that, in other situations, such as when <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> given for attaining a gradually increasing standard of performance, rewards enhance intrinsic motivation. Many effective therapies have been based on the principles of applied behavior analysis, including pivotal response therapy which is used to treat autism spectrum disorders.|$|E

25|$|Set in the 1960s {{during the}} Cold War, the game's {{campaign}} follows CIA operative Alex Mason as {{he attempts to}} recall certain memories in combat in order to locate a numbers station, {{which is due to}} transmit broadcasts to sleeper agents who are bound to use chemical weapons across the United States. Mason and CIA operative Jason Hudson are the game's main playable characters, as well as Red Army soldier Viktor Reznov in only one mission. Locations featured in the game include Cuba, Russia, United States, Kazakhstan, Hong Kong, Laos, Vietnam, and the Arctic Circle. The multiplayer of Black Ops features multiple objective-based game modes that are playable on 14 different maps included with the game. Improvements to loadout options and killstreak <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> made. A form of virtual currency, COD Points, allows players to purchase weapons and customization options for their in-game character, as well as attachments and customization options for their weapon.|$|E
25|$|Many {{credit card}} {{customers}} receive rewards, such as frequent flyer points, gift certificates, or cash back {{as an incentive}} to use the card. <b>Rewards</b> <b>are</b> generally tied to purchasing an item or service on the card, {{which may or may}} not include balance transfers, cash advances, or other special uses. Depending on the type of card, rewards will generally cost the issuer between 0.25% and 2.0% of the spread. Networks such as Visa or MasterCard have increased their fees to allow issuers to fund their rewards system. Some issuers discourage redemption by forcing the cardholder to call customer service for rewards. On their servicing website, redeeming awards is usually a feature that is very well hidden by the issuers. With a fractured and competitive environment, rewards points cut dramatically into an issuer's bottom line, and rewards points and related incentives must be carefully managed to ensure a profitable portfolio. Unlike unused gift cards, in whose case the breakage in certain US states goes to the state's treasury, unredeemed credit card points are retained by the issuer.|$|E
25|$|The {{band members}} were modeled using motion {{capturing}} performed by actors hired by Harmonix, incorporating video and concert footage to create avatars for each member unique to each venues. The band's support team helped to take {{photographs of the}} band member's tattoos, and identified when they were received so that the Harmonix artists could incorporate them properly into the avatars. All the songs, including the six Green Day songs previously released as downloadable content, feature unique animations tied to each song. This was a different approach than as taken for The Beatles: Rock Band, where they created snippets of framing and animation which could be easily repackaged for other songs, including future downloadable content. Because of the integrated nature of the songs and animations, {{there will be no}} further downloadable content available for the game. The game includes, as reward items, over 100 photographs and 40 minutes of video footage pulled from Warner Bros. Records' archive of the band. The video content has been pared down from over 20 hours of raw footage from concerts and studio records. Some of the live video footage will be used as part of the 21st Century Breakdown venue backdrops. Many of these <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> specific to individual songs, such as photos taken during concert performances of the song, and thus given as rewards for completing these songs.|$|E

500|$|The game's combat puts {{emphasis}} on [...] "flow", a term {{referring to a}} player's ability {{to move on to}} fight against another enemy upon defeating and killing an enemy with few limitations in between.

500|$|Other psychoanalytic {{researchers}} {{describe a}} more nuanced, and less universally positive, view of delayed gratification. David C. Funder and Jack Block theorized that a person's tendency to delay, or not delay, gratification {{is just one}} element of a broader construct called ego control, defined as a person's ability to modulate or control impulses. Ego control [...] "ranges from ego undercontrol at one end to ego overcontrol at the other", according to Funder. These tendencies {{are thought to be}} relatively stable in each individual, such that someone who tends toward undercontrol will [...] "grab whatever <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> immediately available even at the cost of long-term gain" [...] and someone who tends toward overcontrol will [...] "delay or even forgo pleasures even when they can be had without cost". By this view, delay of gratification may be adaptive in certain settings, but inappropriate or even costly in other settings.|$|E
500|$|The {{most recent}} reform came {{into effect in}} July 2010 when President Obama signed [...] "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act". The act covers {{a broad range of}} changes. The {{highlights}} of the legislation are consumer protections with authority and independence, ends too big to fail bail outs, advance warning system, transparency and accountability for exotic instruments, executive compensation and corporate governance, protects investors, and enforces regulations on the books. The legislation also resulted in the Office of the Whistleblower, which was established to administer the SEC's whistleblower program. Congress authorized the SEC to provide monetary awards to whistleblowers who come forward with information that results in a minimum of a $1,000,000 sanction. The <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> between 10% and 30% of the dollar amount collected. Whistleblowers help identify fraud and other unethical behaviors early on. The result is less harm to investors, quickly holding offenders responsible, and to maintain the integrity of the U.S. markets.|$|E
50|$|Lesser changes {{include an}} {{audiovisual}} {{overhaul of the}} game (1.4, 1.5), the ability to choose the default floor type of the game (1.2) {{and the ability to}} create custom game characters (1.2). Four new combo <b>rewards</b> <b>were</b> also introduced: Super!, Fantastic!, Splendid! and No way!, and thresholds of combo length for certain <b>rewards</b> <b>were</b> increased (1.2).|$|R
50|$|Dogecoin's {{implementation}} {{differs from}} Litecoin by several parameters. Dogecoin's block time is 1 minute {{as opposed to}} Litecoin's 2.5 minutes. The difficulty retarget time is once per block and the <b>reward</b> <b>is</b> fixed based on the block schedule listed below. However, when Dogecoin was first introduced, the difficulty retargeting was once every four hours, and the <b>reward</b> <b>was</b> a random number between 0 and a maximum defined by the block schedule. Under the system in which a random number of coins <b>were</b> distributed, <b>rewards</b> <b>were</b> calculated using a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator. While the original implementation of Dogecoin meant {{for there to be}} a fixed number of coins per block from block 600,001 onwards only (providing 10,000 coins per block), the algorithms in Dogecoin were changed beginning from the 145,000th block so that a fixed <b>reward</b> <b>was</b> always given (providing 250,000 coins per block until block 200,001).|$|R
