2500|$|After leaving school, {{following}} a brief stint {{at the local}} town hall where he learned to type, he spent four years working at Park Prewett Mental Hospital in Basingstoke as a <b>records</b> <b>clerk</b> (1930–34). His friend David Rayvern Allen noted that {{it was there that}} [...] "he discovered humanity in often dislocated forms, [...] was fundamental to his personal development." [...] This was followed by twelve years as a policeman (1934–1946) in the Southampton County Borough Police Force, which later amalgamated with the Hampshire Constabulary in 1967. He progressed to the rank of sergeant while stationed at Southampton, and enjoyed the opportunity to watch Hampshire play at the County Ground while on duty at Northland Road. Though his cricket skills were not sufficient to play for the Southampton Police cricket XI, he was called upon at times to utilise the PA-system. He also studied Russian language and military history at the library of Southampton University, wrote reports for his chief constable, gave lectures to students, wrote poetry, and took up boxing, at which he was quite proficient.|$|E
2500|$|Reapers have a {{physical}} body and may {{interact with the}} living and the dead. Besides collecting souls, reapers have powers to remain ageless, heal extremely quickly (George once severed her middle finger, but was able to reattach it by just putting it back in place, while Mason has sustained what should have been fatal damage on multiple occasions, such as being shot and hit by a car), drink alcohol without suffering a hangover (see [...] "Gravelings"), and forcibly pull a soul from a living body and replace it (as seen done by Roxy in Episode 9 [...] "Sunday Mornings"). When seen by the living, reapers' physical appearances are different from when they were alive to those who knew them, except on Halloween when the living see them as they were in life, and fellow reapers always see their original appearances. Although George is seen by her family and Delores as [...] "Millie," [...] Rube's image was recognizable by a <b>records</b> <b>clerk</b> in a wanted poster seen while Rube and the clerk were doing some research into his past life. Laura Boddington portrays lead character George's 'undead' appearance in the TV series, with Jennifer Rae Westley playing her in the later film. Supporting evidence that others can see their [...] "original" [...] faces is upheld by Kiffany, who does not notice any alterations to their appearances on Halloween, and by numerous one off characters who comment on George's physical appearance (brown eyes, etc.) that would not match her 'undead' appearance.|$|E
