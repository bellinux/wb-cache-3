40|$|Abstract: The {{solution}} of motion control system is proposed, researched and developed according to six-pedrail mine rescue robot. According to different motion types, motion analysis of main <b>drive</b> <b>module</b> and armdrive module is analyzed individually. The method of modular design {{is used by}} hardware part and soft part of motion control system of mine res-cue robot. Hardware part includes host computer <b>module,</b> main <b>drive</b> <b>module</b> and arm <b>drive</b> <b>module.</b> The Hall sensors are used by position control or velocity control of main <b>drive</b> <b>module</b> and arm <b>drive</b> <b>module.</b> The soft part includes host com-puter <b>module</b> program, main <b>drive</b> <b>module</b> program and arm <b>drive</b> <b>module</b> program. A series of experiments of motion control system of mine rescue robot is done, and data of experiments is analyzed in the end. The research shows that mo-tion control system developed meets the requirements of mine rescue robot because of good precision and real-time...|$|R

50|$|The Contessa was {{developed}} {{largely from the}} 1947-1961 Renault 4CV powertrain under license to Hino Motors. Offered in both coupe and sedan bodystyles, it replaced the Hino Renault, which was the Renault 4CV manufactured by Hino for Japan. It was adapted into a small pickup truck called the Hino Briska, but used a front engine and <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> powertrain, while the Contessa used a rear engine and <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> setup. The PC series coupé was designed by Giovanni Michelotti, while the second generation was longer and wider in both coupé and sedan bodystyles.|$|R

50|$|The DB design {{resembled the}} T-34 in its hull and turret {{and was also}} to be powered by a diesel engine. It was also <b>driven</b> from the <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> {{sprocket}} with the turret situated forward. The incorporation of a diesel engine promised increased operational range, reduced flammability and allowed for more efficient use of petroleum reserves. Hitler himself considered a diesel engine imperative for the new tank. DB's proposal used an external leaf spring suspension, {{in contrast to the}} MAN proposal of twin torsion bars. Wa Pruef 6's opinion was that the leaf spring suspension was a disadvantage and that using torsion bars would allow greater internal hull width. It also opposed the <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> because of the potential for track fouling. Daimler Benz still preferred the leaf springs over a torsion bar suspension as it resulted in a silhouette about 200 mm shorter and rendered complex shock absorbers unnecessary. The employment of a <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> provided additional crew space and also allowed for a better slope on the front hull, which was considered important in preventing penetration by armour-piercing shells.|$|R
