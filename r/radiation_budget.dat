25|$|Scanner for <b>Radiation</b> <b>Budget</b> (ScaRaB) is a {{scanning}} radiative budget instrument, {{which has}} already been launched twice on Russian satellites. The basic measurements of ScaRaB are the radiances in two wide channels, a solar channel (0.2 - 4µm), and a total channel (0.2 - 200µm), allowing to derive longwave radiances. The resolution at nadir will be 40km from an orbit at 870km. The procedures of calibration and processing of the data in order to derive fluxes from the original radiances {{have been set up}} and tested by CNES and LMD.|$|E

The results show significant differences between the <b>radiation</b> <b>budgets</b> of the two regimes in the MIZ.

40|$|In Part I of this study, the NASA GISS Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5) and post-CMIP 5 (herein called C 5 and P 5, respectively) {{simulated}} cloud properties {{were assessed}} utilizing multiple satellite observations, {{with a particular}} focus on the southern midlatitudes (SMLs). This study applies the knowledge gained from Part I of this series to evaluate the modeled TOA <b>radiation</b> <b>budgets</b> and cloud radiative effects (CREs) globally using CERES EBAF (CE) satellite observations {{and the impact of}} regional cloud properties and water vapor on the TOA <b>radiation</b> <b>budgets.</b> Comparisons revealed that the P 5 - and C 5 -simulated global means of clear-sky and all-sky outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) match well with CE observations, while biases are observed regionally. Negative biases are found in both P 5 - and C 5 -simulated clear-sky OLR. P 5 -simulated all-sky albedo slightly increased over the SMLs due to the increase in low-level cloud fraction from the new planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme. Shortwave, longwave, and net CRE are quantitatively analyzed as well. Regions of strong large-scale atmospheric upwelling/downwelling motion are also defined to compare regional differences across multiple cloud and radiative variables. In general, the P 5 and C 5 simulations agree with the observations better over the downwelling regime than over the upwelling regime. Comparing the results herein with the cloud property comparisons presented in Part I, the modeled TOA <b>radiation</b> <b>budgets</b> and CREs agree well with the CE observations. These results, combined with results in Part I, have quantitatively estimated how much improvement is found in the P 5 -simulated cloud and radiative properties, particularly over the SMLs and tropics, due to the implementation of the new PBL and convection schemes...|$|R

40|$|Problems {{associated}} with the measurement of the Earth radiation balances are addressed. It is demonstrated that {{the knowledge of the}} different <b>radiation</b> <b>budgets</b> with their components is largely dependent on the space time sampling of the radiation field of the Earth atmosphere system. Whichever instrumental approach is adopted (wide angle view of high resolution) it affects the space time integration of the fluxes measured directly or calculated. In this case the necessary knowledge of the reflection pattern depends in addition on the angular sampling of the radiances. A series of questions is considered, the answers of which are a prerequisite to the the organization of a global observation system...|$|R

The diurnal cloud cover variability is shown to affect both the radiation-budget measurements and the estimation of the overall effect of clouds on the net flux. For this data set, the cloud cover causes {{a decrease in the}} net flux from the clear-sky value. Thus, the cloud albedo effect outweights the greenhouse effect {{of the cloud}}s. It is found that the value of the change in the radiation balance is closely related to the amount of incident solar radiation and to the zonal distributions of low, middle, and high cloud cover...|$|R
