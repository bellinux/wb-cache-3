5|$|After the {{publication}} of the improved method of flame spectroscopy by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff and the discovery of caesium and rubidium in the years 1859 to 1860, flame spectroscopy became an approved method to determine the composition of minerals and chemical products. William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy both started to use the new method. William Crookes used it to make spectroscopic determinations for tellurium on selenium compounds deposited in the lead chamber of a sulfuric acid production plant near Tilkerode in the Harz mountains. He had obtained the samples for his research on selenium cyanide from August Hofmann years earlier. By 1862, Crookes was able to isolate small quantities of the new element and determine the properties of a few compounds. Claude-Auguste Lamy used a spectrometer that was similar to Crookes' to determine the composition of a selenium-containing substance which was deposited during the production of sulfuric acid from pyrite. He also noticed the new green line in the spectra and concluded that a new element was present. Lamy had received this material from the sulfuric acid plant of his friend Fréd Kuhlmann and this by-product was available in large quantities. Lamy started to isolate the new element from that source. The fact that Lamy was able to work ample quantities of thallium enabled him to determine the properties of several compounds and in addition he prepared a small ingot of metallic thallium which he prepared by <b>remelting</b> thallium he had obtained by electrolysis of thallium salts.|$|E
25|$|Of course glass {{containers}} {{can also}} be reused, and in developing countries this is common, however {{the environmental impact of}} washing the container as against <b>remelting</b> them is uncertain. Factors to consider here are the chemicals and fresh water used in the washing, and the fact that a single-use container can be made much lighter, using less than half the glass (and therefore energy content) of a multiuse container. Also, a significant factor in the developed world's consideration of reuse are producer concerns over the risk and consequential product liability of using a component (the reused container) of unknown and unqualified safety.|$|E

500|$|In mid-1944, the Ames Project {{was asked}} to produce cerium. This was {{being used by the}} {{laboratories}} at Berkeley and Los Alamos for cerium sulphide, which was used in crucibles to cast plutonium. Again, the bomb method was used, this time to reduce anhydrous cerium chloride with calcium using an iodine booster. A special [...] "dry room" [...] was constructed for drying out the cerium chloride using hydrogen chloride gas. The resulting metal contained calcium and magnesium impurity, so it had to be recast to remove them. The opportunity was taken to make it into [...] diameter rods [...] long, the desired shape. Because cerium is so reactive, the <b>remelting</b> was done in a vacuum, using a calcium oxide or magnesium oxide crucible. The first shipment of cerium metal was made in August 1944.

500|$|The {{reactivity}} of niobium with oxygen requires {{it to be}} worked in a vacuum or inert atmosphere, which significantly increases the cost and difficulty of production. [...] Vacuum arc <b>remelting</b> (VAR) and electron beam melting (EBM), novel processes at the time, enabled the development of niobium and other reactive metals. [...] The project that yielded C-103 began in 1959 {{with as many as}} 256 experimental niobium alloys in the [...] "C-series" [...] (possibly from columbium) that could be melted as buttons and rolled into sheet. [...] Wah Chang had an inventory of hafnium, refined from nuclear-grade zirconium alloys, that it wanted to put to commercial use. [...] The 103rd experimental composition of the C-series alloys, Nb-10Hf-1Ti, had the best combination of formability and high-temperature properties. Wah Chang fabricated the first 500-lb heat of C-103 in 1961, ingot to sheet, using EBM and VAR. The intended applications included turbine engines and liquid metal heat exchangers. [...] Competing niobium alloys from that era included FS85 (Nb-10W-28Ta-1Zr) from Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., Cb129Y (Nb-10W-10Hf-0.2Y) from Wah Chang and Boeing, Cb752 (Nb-10W-2.5Zr) from Union Carbide, and Nb1Zr from Superior Tube Co.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} are the four steps in traditional die casting, also known as , these are also the basis {{for any of the}} die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and shakeout. The dies are prepared by spraying the mold cavity with lubricant. The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between [...] Once the mold cavity is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the shakeout involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, sprues and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special trim die in a power press or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by <b>remelting</b> it. The yield is approximately 67%.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In present work, the NiCrAlY {{coatings}} were sprayed {{onto the}} surface of nickel-based superalloy INCONEL 713 LC substrates by means of conventional air plasma spray technique. Subsequently an aluminium sheet was cladded onto the coating surface by means of uniaxial cold pressing. The samples prepared by this way were annealed at the temperatures of 650, 850 and 1000 °C for two hours in argon-flow atmosphere. NiCrAlY coatings were enriched by aluminium and the coating imperfections presented in a coating were eliminated. The <b>remelted</b> NiCrAlY coating specimens were annealed at a temperature of 800 °C for fifty hours in ambient atmosphere. The microstructural changes and phase transformations after short thermal exposure in air of the <b>remelted</b> NiCrAlY plasma sprayed coatings were observed. Generally, a change was observed in the phase composition of <b>remelted</b> coatings from phases rich in aluminium to phases less rich in aluminium owing to thermal exposure in air. The increase in the microhardness of the whole <b>remelted</b> coating after thermal exposure was caused by the increase in the amount of Al 3 Ni 2 intermetallic phase in the <b>remelted</b> coating...|$|R
40|$|The {{variation}} of track geometry during multi-track laser cladding of stellite 6 on mild steel starting with different geometry profiles {{and levels of}} dilution in the singletrack clad was examined. In transverse cross-section of the multi-track clad, the total area in each track includes the areas of melted powder (clad area), <b>remelted</b> previous track (<b>remelted</b> area) and melted substrate. Both clad area and total area increase with track number and finally reach constant values, but the increase of total area {{is much greater than}} that of clad area. The <b>remelted</b> area of previous track increases with the level of dilution of the single-track clad and reaches its maximum value when the dilution of single-track clad is over 20 %. The percentage of the maximum <b>remelted</b> area of the previous track equals the percentage of the track overlap. The inter-track porosity will appear when the difference of the total area and the <b>remelted</b> area of the previous track is closer to or smaller than the clad area because there is not enough laser energy to melt the powder captured by the melt pool...|$|R

2500|$|Two {{types of}} glass solders are used: vitreous, and devitrifying. Vitreous solders retain their {{amorphous}} structure during <b>remelting,</b> can be reworked repeatedly, and are relatively transparent. Devitrifying solders undergo partial crystallization during solidifying, forming a glass-ceramic, {{a composite of}} glassy and crystalline phases. Devitrifying solders usually create a stronger mechanical bond, but are more temperature-sensitive and the seal {{is more likely to}} be leaky; due to their polycrystalline structure they tend to be translucent or opaque. Devitrifying solders are frequently [...] "thermosetting", as their melting temperature after recrystallization becomes significantly higher; this allows soldering the parts together at lower temperature than the subsequent bake-out without <b>remelting</b> the joint afterwards. Devitrifying solders frequently contain up to 25% zinc oxide. In production of cathode ray tubes, devitrifying solders based on PbO-B2O3-ZnO are used.|$|E
