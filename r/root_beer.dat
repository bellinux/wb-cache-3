50|$|On January 16, 1919, the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution {{was enacted}} into law, {{creating}} the Prohibition era, wherein the production, sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages was made illegal. All legal American brewing {{came to a}} halt when prohibition was imposed, though the earlier temperance movement had already reduced the number of breweries significantly. Only a few breweries, mainly the largest, were able to stay in business by manufacturing near beer, malt syrup, or other non-alcohol grain products, in addition to soft drinks such as colas and <b>root</b> <b>beers.</b> Production and shipping of alcohol was largely confined to illegal operations that could deliver compact distilled beverages—smuggled rum and domestic moonshine—more efficiently and reliably than bulkier products such as beer.|$|R

5000|$|In September 2011, {{the state}} of Texas {{abolished}} all special last-meal requests after condemned prisoner Lawrence Russell Brewer requested a huge last meal and did not eat any of it, saying he was not hungry. His last-meal request was for a plate of two chicken-fried steaks with gravy and sliced onions, a triple-patty bacon cheeseburger, a cheese omelet with ground beef, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, jalapeños, a bowl of fried okra with ketchup, a pound of barbecued meat with half of a loaf of white bread, a portion of three fajitas, a meat-lover's pizza (topped with pepperoni, ham, beef, bacon, and sausage), a pint of Blue Bell, a serving of ice cream, a slab of peanut-butter fudge with crushed peanuts, and a serving equivalent to three <b>root</b> <b>beers.</b> The abolition followed a complaint by a Texas Senator, John Whitmire (Democrat, of Houston), who called the meal [...] "inappropriate".

5|$|While {{the key to}} Albany's {{economic}} prosperity in the 19th century was transportation, industry and business also played a role. Largely thanks to the city's Dutch and German <b>roots,</b> <b>beer</b> was one of its biggest commodities. Beverwyck Brewery, originally known as Quinn and Nolan (Nolan being mayor of Albany 1878–1883), was the last remaining brewer from that time when it closed in 1972. The city's location at {{the east end of}} the Erie Canal gave it unparalleled access to both raw products and a captive customer base in the west. Albany was known for its publishing houses, and to some extent, still is. Albany was second only to Boston in the number of books produced for most of the 19th century. Iron foundries in both the north and south ends of the city brought thousands of immigrants to the city. To this day, one can see many intricate wrought-iron details on older buildings. The iron industry waned by the 1890s due to increased costs associated with a newly unionized workforce and the opening of mines in the Mesabi Range in Minnesota.|$|R

25|$|Following World War II, Sonic founder Troy N. Smith Sr. {{returned}} to his hometown of Seminole, Oklahoma, where he became employed as a milkman. He decided to work delivering bread because bread was not as heavy as milk. Soon afterwards, Smith purchased the Cottage Cafe, a little diner in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Before long, he sold it and opened a fast food restaurant, Troy's Pan Full of Chicken, {{on the edge of}} town. In 1953, Smith went in with a business partner to purchase a five-acre parcel of land that had a log house and a walk-up <b>root</b> <b>beer</b> stand, already named the Top Hat. The two men continued with the operation of the <b>root</b> <b>beer</b> stand and converted the log house into a steak restaurant. After realizing that the stand was averaging $700 a week in the sale of <b>root</b> <b>beer,</b> hamburgers, and hot dogs, Smith decided to focus on the more-profitable <b>root</b> <b>beer</b> stand. He also bought out his business partner.|$|E

In the episode [...] "Sam for Town Council," [...] Hesseman has an {{exchange}} with Emmett Clark (Paul Hartman), {{who is running}} for town council against Sam Jones played by Ken Berry. Hesseman plays a character named Harry seen preparing fishing tackle outside a sporting goods store and complaining to Emmett how poor the fishing has been at a nearby fishing spot. Emmett promises to stock the pond with big perch in exchange for Harry's vote. Harry agrees and wears a campaign button supporting Emmett in the race. In the episode [...] "Goober Goes to an Auto Show", Hesseman, also credited as Don Sturdy, plays the Counterboy, serving hot dogs and <b>root</b> <b>beers</b> to Goober and his old trade school rival Roy Swanson, played by Noam Pitlik. Hesseman made several appearances as Mr. Plager, a member of the group therapy ensemble on The Bob Newhart Show, who was later revealed to be gay. He became a playwright in the sixth season of the show, writing a play about the characters in the group. In several other episodes of the show, Hesseman's voice can be heard as a TV announcer. In 1969, he appeared uncredited with The Committee (though at the time using the name Don Sturdy) in several sketches on The Dick Cavett Show, and appeared in one sketch with guest Janis Joplin.|$|R

50|$|William and Mary Menger {{opened the}} Menger hotel in 1859 in San Antonio’s Alamo Plaza. The {{plans for the}} hotel arose through the {{popularity}} of William Menger’s brewery. The Mengers sold the property in 1881 to the Kampmann family. William Menger had emigrated from Germany to America in 1847. Menger settled in San Antonio and resumed his previous trade as a cooper and brewer. With his German <b>roots</b> Menger brought <b>beer</b> to San Antonio. He opened the Menger Brewery in 1855 on the battle-grounds of the Alamo (now known as the Alamo Plaza). In 1858 the Mengers hired an architect, John M. Fries, who would complete the two-story fifty-room hotel. Up until this point most businesses in San Antonio were boarding houses and there were few breweries. The Menger hotel opened in February 1859 and became an overnight success.|$|R

25|$|An {{ice cream}} soda is a {{beverage}} {{that consists of}} one or more scoops of ice cream in either a soft drink or a mixture of flavored syrup and carbonated water. Variations of the ice cream soda are as countless as the varieties of soda and flavors of ice cream. An example of ice cream soda is the <b>root</b> <b>beer</b> float. In 1874, the ice cream soda was invented by Robert M. Green of Philadelphia.

40|$|This work {{examines}} the global movement of craft brewing {{as a case}} of transition design towards a multi-local society, where design {{is seen as an}} iterative search for quality. Industrialisation over the last two centuries has brought about enormous changes socially, environmentally and economically. The beer industry {{is one of the most}} globalised of all, and serves as a strong example of the effects of global industry. Moreover, we can trace the <b>roots</b> of <b>beer</b> back to the dawn of civilisation—even argue that beer was a cause of the shift to an agrarian society. The rise of craft beer, which is displaying enormous growth in a declining market, is an example of a shift away from centralised production and monocultures, back to a more local, hands-on, personal approach to production. As one aspect of the role of the expert designer within the realm of design for social innovation is that of giving visibility to promising cases, this thesis asks What qualities can be distinguished within craft brewing? What kinds of narratives can be conceptualised based on these qualities and the practices of craft brewers? The work {{examines the}} concepts of social innovation, Design for Social Innovation, narrowing down to Manzini’s concept of the multi-local society. This is then compared with concepts of Transition and Sustainment, and the fundamental ideas underlying each of these is examined. The concept of Quality is introduced to help relate these concepts and apply them to the case. The case elaborates the historical role of beer in society, and describes the changes as production of beer shifted from household to global corporation. The phenomenon of craft beer is introduced, the difficulty of defining it is described. Craft brewing is examined in light of the theoretical framework, and a tentative reworking of the concept is offered...|$|R
40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Beer foam is a {{major source}} of waste in most bars today. An average bar will lose close to 10, 000 a year due to beer waste. Automated Beverage Dispensers attempt to {{eliminate}} this waste, however most fail due to the inability to prevent excess amounts of beer foam during pouring of a <b>beer.</b> The <b>root</b> cause of <b>beer</b> foam is best described by Henry???s Law which describes the relationship between the solubility of a gas in a liquid due to temperature and pressure. 	Automated Beverage Dispensers currently regulate pressure however they do not control the beverage temperature; this must be regulated in order to eliminate beer foam. The beverage temperature can be regulated by an Automated Beverage Dispenser {{through the use of a}} custom computer controlled heat exchanging system. This heat exchanging system combines hardware, software, and mechanical components in a way that is energy efficient, environmentally safe, and cost effective. In the context of an Automated Beverage Dispenser this integrated solution holds temperature and pressure constant thus eliminating beer waste due to foam. Computer Engineerin...|$|R
25|$|An {{inexpensive}} pale lager {{or light}} beer of 3.2–5% ABV is sometimes preferred {{because of the}} large quantities consumed during the course of several games.

Several railroad cars were lifted and blown over as the tornado passed over a moving Penn Central freight train in the center of town. It toppled headstones in Cherry Grove Cemetery, then moved through the length of the downtown business district, passing west of the courthouse (which sustained some exterior damage). Numerous businesses in downtown Xenia were heavily damaged or destroyed, and several people were killed at the A <b>Root</b> <b>Beer</b> stand as the building was flattened.

[...] Via the holding company King Aviation, Hensley also owns and operates Cessna Citation Excel aircraft. [...] Over half the beer sold in the Phoenix area is from Anheuser-Busch, making it one of their better markets nationally. [...] Both companies benefit when major sports events are held in the area, such as Super Bowl XLIX. [...] The beer distribution business and the Phoenix market for it are very competitive; some Anheuser-Busch distributors eventually ended their exclusive arrangements with the beer maker, while for a while Hensley had no plans to do so. [...] However in 2009 it did so, in part this being associated with Hensley's move into selling craft beers, an emerging force in the market.
