5|$|The Columbia {{report also}} found a failure in journalistic {{standards}} by either not making contact with the people they were publishing derogatory information about, or when they did, by not providing enough context {{for people to be}} able to offer a meaningful response. The report also states that the article misled <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> quotes where attribution was unclear and used pseudonyms inappropriately as a way to address these shortcomings.|$|E

5|$|Blyton {{felt she}} had a {{responsibility}} to provide her <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> a strong moral framework, so she encouraged them to support worthy causes.

5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
