40|$|I have {{clarified}} each of {{the following}} points in regard to the “sea-going vessels” that composed the basis of sea activity and cultural interaction in the Ryukyu Kingdom during the Old Ryukyu period. (1) The first <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> of Ryukyu were the Jigo-sen vessel(s) with identifi cation numbers that were built and registered during the Ming Dynasty. It can be said that the growth that is visible in the scale of the <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> {{in the middle of the}} 15 th century and then their miniaturization in the first part of the 16 th century are phenomena that both indicate the uniqueness of Ryukyu. (2) The Han’ in Kango tally that was issued along with the dispatch of Ryukyu <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> is something that runs through the East Asian sea region during that age. Furthermore, by tracing back those numbers, I have presented the concrete circumstances behind the dispatch of Ryukyu <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels.</b> (3) Ryukyu <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> were named in the respective fashions of China, Japan, and Ryukyu and their operating organizations were diverted to the Hiki land-based organizations, which had a major influence on the establishment of the system of governance in the Ryukyu Kingdom...|$|R

50|$|Black Sea Shipping {{company was}} the biggest {{company in the world}} in 1980-es years as per {{quantity}} of <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels.</b> The company had more than 250 sea-going ship during the best times.|$|R
50|$|Much {{river traffic}} takes place along the Selintan River, which can {{accommodate}} {{all but the}} largest <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> from the Nyr Dyv and Woolly Bay. Smaller vessels ply the Ery and Neen rivers.|$|R
50|$|There are sea {{ports in}} Bremerhaven, Bremen, Cuxhaven and Bützfleth. Inland {{shipping}} {{is able to}} use the rivers Aller, Oste and several canals; the Weser and Elbe can also be used by <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1841 the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway {{opened its}} line. At {{the time the}} River Clyde was heavily used by boats, but it was impassable for <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels,</b> {{involving}} transshipment at Greenock, and transfer of passengers.|$|R

50|$|The 1971 OILPOL {{amendments}} imposed irrevocable oceanic jurisdictions for the Great Barrier Reef {{located in}} the Coral Sea.

50|$|The MNR had {{the only}} {{dockside}} track on the railway system, allowing direct transfer between the railway and <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels.</b> This line, at Ramsey, opened in 1883 and closed in 1952.

50|$|It {{forms an}} easy {{communication}} route {{and as well}} as roads, the Caledonian Canal was constructed along it by linking natural lochs with canal sections.

40|$|Air {{quality policy}} has {{focussed}} on land-based emissions for decades. In recent years, {{it has become}} increasingly clear that emissions from <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> can no longer be ignored. There is a growing need for detailed emission inventories to evaluate the impact of this transport mode on air quality and health. In this paper we present MOPSEA, an activity-based emission model to determine emissions from <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels.</b> The model considers shipping activities of <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> on Belgian territory, combined with individual vessel characteristics. We apply this model to study the effects of recent international efforts to reduce emissions from <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> in Belgian territorial waters for the current fleet and for two scenarios up to 2010. The emission model for Belgium, based on different vessel operating areas, reveals that most maritime emissions from the main engines will increase. CO 2 emissions will increase by 2 – 9 % over the 2004 – 2010 period due to an increase in shipping activity. NO X emissions are projected to rise between 1 % and 8 % because the increase in activity offsets the reductions from the international maritime organisation (IMO) and European regulations. In contrast, SO 2 emissions will decrease by at least 50 % in 6 years time. The switch of auxiliaries from heavy fuel oil to diesel oil at berth results in a large emission reduction (33 %) for PM and small reductions for CO 2, NO X, CO and HC (4 – 5 %). The choice between a bottom-up versus top-down approach can have important implications for the allocation of maritime emissions. The MOPSEA bottom-up model allocates only 0. 7  Mton CO 2 to Belgium, compared to 24. 2  Mton CO 2 based on bunker fuel inventories...|$|R
50|$|European practice, {{particularly}} on the Clyde, favoured Napier's steeple engine instead of the square engine. These were more complicated to construct and used more ironwork, but they placed the cylinder beneath the crankshaft and so were more stable in a narrow hull. Neither form was popular for <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Liskeard and Caradon Railway {{was opened}} on 28 November 1844 from {{quarries}} on the moors north of Liskeard to Moorswater where goods were transshipped to the Liskeard and Looe Union Canal. At Looe they {{could then be}} transhipped again to <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> for transport further around the coast.|$|R

50|$|The Surrey Iron Railway {{had been}} opened in 1806 between Wandsworth and Croydon; {{it was a}} plateway {{operating}} on the toll principle, in which carriers could move wagons with their own horses.

50|$|The Forth and Clyde Canal {{opened in}} 1790, {{connecting}} the River Clyde at Bowling with the Firth of Forth at Grangemouth. As well {{as having a}} basin at Grangemouth, the canal company constructed facilities for transshipping from canal boats to <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> at Grangemouth. Much of the traffic was minerals and manufactured goods for export, including coastwise trade.|$|R

50|$|The depth {{throughout}} {{the system was}} targeted at 4.5 m, allowing passage of not only river craft but many <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> including warships and even nuclear submarines. However, at present time, the depth is mostly guaranteed at the lesser 4 m, except the even shallower sections like Gorodets-Nizhny Novgorod at 2.5 m, Kochetovsky hydro-system-stanitsa Bagayevskaya at 3.2 m, and others. There are plans to increase depth of these sections to 4 m.|$|R

60|$|A {{few weeks}} {{previously}} to the Sunday in question, a <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessel,</b> inward bound, had {{brought up in}} Gardiner's Bay, which is a usual anchorage {{for all sorts of}} craft. A worn-out and battered seaman had been put ashore on Oyster Pond, by a boat from this vessel, which sailed to the westward soon after, proceeding most probably to New York. The stranger was not only well advanced in life, but he was obviously wasting away with disease.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the demise}} of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the {{creation}} of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS), Austria-Hungary transferred the vessels of the former Austro-Hungarian Navy to the new nation. The Kingdom of Italy was unhappy with this, and convinced the Allies to share the Austro-Hungarian ships among the victorious powers. As a result, the only modern <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> left to the KSCS were 12 torpedo boats, and they had to build their naval forces almost from scratch.|$|R
