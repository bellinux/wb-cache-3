Technology of road-building materials compaction can be improved by developing and using the rheological approach in the describing and studying changes in physical and mechanical parameters of materials, when the rheological properties of compacted material is closely connected {{to the nature of}} a force action applied to it. Results. The principles of designing rheological models of soil subgrade and road asphalt mixtures are formulated, based on which a model is suggested of the creep process of <b>road</b> <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> using the theory of hereditary creep of elastic-visco-plastic materials.

5000|$|In a CFB combustor, coal {{or other}} fuels, air, and crushed {{limestone}} or other sorbents are {{injected into the}} lower portion of the combustor for initial burning of the fuel. The combustion actually occurs in a bed of fuel, sorbent, and ash particles that are fluidized by air nozzles {{in the bottom of}} the combustor. The air expands the bed, creates turbulence for enhanced mixing, and provides most of the oxygen necessary for combustion of the fuel. As the fuel particles decrease in size through combustion and breakage, they are transported higher in the combustor where additional air is injected. As the particles continue to decrease in size, unreacted fuel, ash, and fine limestone particles are swept out of the combustor, collected in a particle separator (also called a cyclone), and recycled to the lower portion of the combustor. This is the [...] "circulating" [...] nature of the combustor. Drains {{in the bottom of the}} combustor remove a fraction of the bed composed primarily of ash while new fuel and sorbent are added.

The essence of the activation technology for materials lies in an intensive increase of physical and chemical activity of their components in the interphase boundaries that is realized in various technological conversions. It has been established that being chemically passive under normal conditions all the materials, irrespective of their nature and aggregate state, can be chemically active under specific conditions.

The case of a towed wheel is considered. An approxi-mate analytic approach premised on a three-dimensional bearing capacity formulation is presented for indentation and steady-state rolling of rigid wheels. The finite element code ABAQUS is used to perform three-dimensional simulation and validate the analytic approach.

Two RCA types were selected as study materials: (1) high-grade RCA (HRCA), a quality RCA manufactured from relatively high-strength concrete structures; and (2) road base RCA (RBRCA), a high-grade RCA blend combined with brick and general clean rubble (road base material). Laboratory tests were performed to obtain the unconfined compressive strength, indirect tension dynamic modulus, and resilient modulus of the test samples to examine their hardening characteristics when subjected to varying curing periods. These tests were performed in conjunction with microstructure analyses from X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques. The HRCA samples, which were prepared and subjected to varying curing conditions, transformed from an initially unbound material into a bound (fully stabilized) material. The results of XRD and SEM analyses clearly demonstrate that secondary hydration occurred. The RBRCA samples were able to maintain their unbound granular properties, with nonsignificant self-cementing, thus supporting {{the hypothesis that the}} mixing of nonactive materials such as bricks and clean rubble into RCA will lessen the tendency of RCA toward self-cementing...|$|E
