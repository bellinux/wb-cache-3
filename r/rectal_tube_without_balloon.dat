40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} topical lidocaine gel and intrauterine lidocaine infusion administered prior to saline contrast sonohysterography (SCSH) in reducing pain level during the procedure. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. We recruited 120 women scheduled to undergo SCSH and randomized them into one of three groups according to administration of gel and intrauterine infusion immediately prior to the procedure: (1) the 'lidocaine gel' group received 3 mL 2 % lidocaine gel applied to the cervix and intrauterine infusion, using an infant feeding <b>tube</b> <b>without</b> <b>balloon,</b> of 5 mL normal saline; (2) the 'lidocaine infusion' group received 3 mL gel lubricant applied to the cervix and intrauterine infusion of 5 mL 2 % lidocaine; (3) the placebo group received 3 mL gel lubricant applied to the cervix and intrauterine infusion of 5 mL normal saline. The tube was left {{in place for the}} SCSH procedure. The primary outcome measure was the overall pain level (on a scale of 0 - 100) reported by the women during the SCSH procedure. Women also rated their pain levels at various other time points and an observer assessed visible signs of the women's discomfort during the procedure, producing a distress score. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the three groups in baseline characteristics, volume of saline solution infused, tenaculum use and duration and difficulty level of the SCSH procedure. The median (range) pain scores during normal saline infusion for the SCSH procedure were 0 (0 - 65) in the placebo group, 2. 5 (0 - 80) in the lidocaine gel group, and 0 (0 - 70) in the lidocaine infusion group. The pain scores at other time points, the overall pain score and the distress score were also comparable for the three groups. No significant adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: SCSH performed with an infant feeding <b>tube</b> <b>without</b> <b>balloon</b> is associated with very low pain levels. Topical lidocaine gel application and intrauterine lidocaine infusion do not further reduce pain levels during SCSH. Copyright (c) 2015 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Background. Postcolonoscopy {{abdominal}} discomfort and bloating are common. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate whether rectal decompression improved distension-induced abdominal symptoms and influenced anorectal physiology. Methods. In 15 healthy subjects, rectal distension was achieved by direct air inflation into the rectum by colonoscopy. Placement of <b>rectal</b> and sham <b>tube</b> was then performed in each subject on a separate occasion. The anorectal parameters and distension-induced abdominal symptoms were recorded. Results. Anorectal parameters were similar between placements of <b>rectal</b> <b>tube</b> and sham tube except for greater rectal compliance with <b>rectal</b> <b>tube</b> than with sham tube (P< 0. 05). Abdominal pain and bloating were significantly reduced by <b>rectal</b> <b>tube</b> and sham tube at 1 minute (both P< 0. 05) and 3 minutes (both P< 0. 05). After placement of <b>rectal</b> <b>tube,</b> abdominal pain at 3 minutes correlated positively with first sensation (r= 0. 53, P= 0. 04), and bloating at 3 minutes also correlated positively with urge sensation (r= 0. 55, P= 0. 03). Conclusions. Rectal decompression with either <b>rectal</b> or sham <b>tube</b> improved distension-induced abdominal symptoms. Our study indicates that the mechanisms that improved abdominal symptoms by rectal decompression might be mediated by a central pathway instead of a peripheral mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a learning-based method for the {{detection}} and segmentation of 3 D free-form tubular structures, such as the <b>rectal</b> <b>tubes</b> in CT colonoscopy. This method {{can be used to}} reduce the false alarms introduced by <b>rectal</b> <b>tubes</b> in current polyp detection algorithms. The method is hierarchical, detecting parts of the tube in increasing order of complexity, from tube cross sections and tube segments to the whole flexible tube. To increase the speed of the algorithm, candidate parts are generated using a voting strategy. The detected tube segments are combined into a flexible tube using a dynamic programming algorithm. Testing the algorithm on 210 unseen datasets resulted in a tube detection rate of 94. 7 % and 0. 12 false alarms per volume. The method can be easily retrained to detect and segment other tubular 3 D structures. ...|$|R

40|$|A stent is {{a device}} {{that is used to}} support {{arterial}} walls to alleviate the blockage of arteries by plaque. The slotted tube stent {{is one of the most}} common stent designs being widely used in many patients today. The amount of stent implantations is growing each year and for this it is becoming increasingly important in interventional cardiology. One of the reasons is that the use of stents has proved more effective in the therapy of coronary stenosis. However, it is evidenced that the success of the stent implantation is limited by re-stenosis, which is discussed almost entirely in terms of medical and biological reasons. This work is concerned with investigating the deformation mechanism with variable conditions during slotted tube expansion processes using numerical simulation. The simulations were run and analysed using commercial finite element software. A nonlinear explicit solution method was used in each case. The processes chosen for simulation were: slotted <b>tube</b> expansion <b>without</b> <b>balloon</b> catheter, slotted <b>tube</b> expansion with balloon catheter, scaling the stent size, stent production defect and slotted tube expansion with the presence of artery and plaque. A number of process parameters were varied for balloon catheter (i. e. balloon length, thickness and friction factor) and the subsequent effects on the process were identified. Some trial experimental tests were carried out to verify the finite element results from the computer simulations. From the results obtained it was concluded that higher rate of pressure increase results in higher stresses in stent for similar levels of expansion. Deployment of higher magnitude pressure might increase the expansion in radial direction but it does not necessarily increase the uniformity of the slotted tube. Appropriate balloon length has to be chosen to obtain a uniform expansion. Friction could reduce the foreshortening of the stent. When scaling down the stent, displacement deceases proportionally for similar deployment pressure and stent geometry. It was found from the simulations that the tubular stent is not very sensitive to imperfections. Altering sent strut configuration and number has practical effects on the clinical use of vascular stents, as the magnitude of expansion will change. The deformation characteristic of the slotted tube during deployment is affected by the presence of artery and plaque...|$|R

To determine if local periadventitial delivery of dexamethasone decreases neointimal proliferation after balloon vascular injury, in three groups of Sprague-Dawley rats, 5 % dexamethasone, 0. 5 % dexamethasone, and placebo silicone polymers were implanted around the left common carotid artery after balloon injury. In a fourth group, placebo polymers were implanted <b>without</b> <b>balloon</b> injury. Dexamethasone serum and tissue levels after polymer implantation were significantly higher in the 5 % dexamethasone group compared with the 0. 5 % dexamethasone group. There was no neointima formation in any of the arterial segments covered with placebo polymers for 3 wk, but <b>without</b> <b>balloon</b> injury. In the arterial segments covered by the 5 and 0. 5 % dexamethasone polymers, there was a 76 and 75 % reduction in intima/media ratios, respectively, compared with the placebo group (5 % dexamethasone, 0. 26 +/- 0. 04; 0. 5 % dexamethasone, 0. 27 +/- 0. 03; placebo, 1. 09 +/- 0. 16, respectively; P < 0. 0001).
