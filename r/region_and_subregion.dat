Nevertheless I commenced to work with a view towards a future realization of the idea. It seemed to me above all necessary to visit every faunistic <b>region</b> <b>and</b> <b>subregion,</b> as far as it might be possible, and consequently after leaving Australia in November 1887 and having collected in South America, especially Brazil (1888-89), I went to India and China (1890), visited Japan (1891-92) and Anterior India (1892) and finally collected on several tours in Africa. I paid also special attention to the fauna of islands and made collections on the Cape Verde Islands, the Canaries, Madeira, Kangaroo Island, and various islands of the Indian and Chinese seas."

40|$|Seeds play an {{integral}} {{role in the}} global food supply and {{account for more than}} 70 % of the calories that we consume on a daily basis. To meet the demands of an increasing population, scientists are turning to seed genomics research to find new and innovative ways to increase food production. Seed genomics is evolving rapidly, and the information produced from seed genomics research has exploded over the past two decades. Advances in modern sequencing strategies that profile every molecule in every cell, tissue and organ of model and the emergence of new model systems has provided the tools necessary to understand all of the biological processes underlying seed development. Despite these advances, the analyses and mining of existing seed genomics data remain a monumental task for plant biologists. This review summarizes seed <b>region</b> <b>and</b> <b>subregion</b> genomic data that are currently available for existing and emerging oilseed models.

40|$|The zoogeographical {{distribution}} of 42 cicadellid subfamilies and their assigned tribes and genera is compiled with distributional maps and proposed dispersal pathways of genera that are shared interzoogeographically. Possible {{origin of the}} subfamilies and tribes is proposed in an ancestral context from which the more modern extant groups evolved whereas origin of genera is in a more modern context. Notwithstanding their complex biogeography, the distributional data of the higher groups indicate {{that all of the}} cosmopolitan and near cosmopolitan subfamilies arose during early Cretaceous or possibly the late Jurassic period (140 - 116 m. y. a.) when continental drift was in its early stages. Nearly all of the New World and some Old World subfamilies are considered of more recent origin (late Cretaceous-Tertiary). Ninety percent of the known genera (2, 126) are endemic to their respective zoogeographical <b>region</b> <b>and</b> <b>subregion,</b> thus indicating relatively high host specificity and low rate of dispersal. The majority (76 %) of known extant genera are pantropical in origin, suggesting early or possible Gondwanaland origin of their ancestors. Dispersal pathways of genera shared by more than one zoogeographical region were generally south to north (Neotropical/Nearctic, Oriental/Palaearctic) or west to east (Palaearctic/Nearctic, Oriental/Australian), from regions of high diversity to regions of low diversity and from warmer climates to cooler climates. The most diverse and richest leafhopper fauna are present in the Neotropical and Ethiopian regions although taxal affinities between them are poorest. The most depauperate fauna are in the Nearctic region and in Australia, reflecting the impact of isolating and ecological factors on distribution and radiation. Ecological barriers were more evident between the Ethiopian and Oriental fauna than between any other zoogeographical combination. Taxal affinities appeared to be correlated with close continental proximities. Vicariance (physical) was the principal event that appealed to explain the {{distribution of}} many subfamilies and tribes whereas dispersal accounted for distribution of the majority of interzoogeographical genera...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present novel {{approaches}} {{for the computer}} aided diagnosis of leukoplakia on the vocal folds based on video endoscopic images of the larynx. The approaches applied for the classification of the vocal fold surface tissue are texture analysis methods, which have been enhanced to use spatial information as well as color information in one combined color texture approach. The multispectral approaches used are based on sum- and difference histograms as well as statistical geometrical features. These novel features are applied on manually segmented <b>and</b> preclassified <b>regions</b> <b>and</b> <b>subregions</b> of the vocal folds.
