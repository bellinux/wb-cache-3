2500|$|The {{section of}} I-81 between {{the village of}} Adams {{and the city of}} Watertown was {{constructed}} in the late 1950s.

In 1965, the New York State Department of Transportation began looking at ways to eliminate the turn and grade crossing at <b>Rices.</b> The results of the study led the state to develop a project moving NY232 onto a new, more southerly alignment that bypassed the turn at <b>Rices</b> and crossed the rail line on an overpass.

5|$|Historically, the Mangalorean Catholic diet was {{completely}} vegetarian. This changed during the 20th century, when {{with the advent}} of Westernisation, meat came to be consumed increasingly in the community, especially amongst the elite.

Rosachi Kadi (Ros Curry), a fish curry made with coconut milk (ros), is a traditional curry served during the Ros ceremony. Patrode, a dish of colocasia leaves stuffed with <b>rice,</b> dal, jaggery, coconut, and spices is popular.

5|$|<b>Rice</b> cultivation: In 2002, a Chinese and Japanese group {{reported}} the discovery in eastern China of fossilised phytoliths of domesticated <b>rice</b> apparently {{dating back to}} 11,900 BC or earlier.

5|$|The {{economy of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom was based mainly on agriculture. The main {{agricultural}} product was <b>rice,</b> the cultivation of which was supported by an intricate irrigation network. <b>Rice</b> cultivation began around the Malvatu oya, Deduru oya and Mahaweli river and spread throughout the country. Shifting cultivation was also done during the rainy seasons. <b>Rice</b> was produced in two main seasons named Yala and Maha. Due to the extensive production of <b>rice,</b> the country was mostly self-sufficient. Cotton was grown extensively {{to meet the requirements}} of cloth. Sugarcane and Sesame were also grown and there are frequent references in classical literature to these agricultural products. Finger millet was grown as a substitute for <b>rice,</b> particularly in the dry zone of the country. Surpluses of these products, mainly <b>rice,</b> were exported.|$|E

5|$|The marsh <b>rice</b> rat is {{the primary}} host of the Bayou virus (BAYV), the second-most common agent of {{hantavirus}} infections in the United States. About 16% of animals are infected and the virus is most prevalent in old, heavy males. The virus may be transmitted among <b>rice</b> rats through bites inflicted during fights. It is also present in <b>rice</b> rat saliva and urine, and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta. Two related hantaviruses, Catacama virus and Playa de Oro virus, are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively. An arenavirus normally associated with woodrats (Neotoma) has also been found in Florida marsh <b>rice</b> rats.

5|$|In 2010, Delton Hanson {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study of}} the relationships among populations of Oryzomys on the basis of data from three genes—the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (Cytb) and two nuclear markers, exon 1 of the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein gene (Rbp3) and intron 2 of alcohol dehydrogenase gene 1 (Adh1-I2). The Cytb data placed all marsh <b>rice</b> rats studied sister to a clade containing various populations of O.couesi; the mean genetic distance between the two groups was 11.30%. The marsh <b>rice</b> rats fell into two main groups, differing on average by 6.05%, one containing animals from Mississippi, southwestern Tennessee, and further west, and the other including specimens from Alabama and further east. Within the eastern group, variation was only about 0.65%, though examples of the putative subspecies O. p. palustris, O. p. coloratus, O. p. sanibeli, and O. p. planirostris were all included. Data from both of the slower-evolving nuclear markers Rbp3 and Adh1-I2 also placed examples of Oryzomys in two main clades, but did not recover the western and eastern groups of the marsh <b>rice</b> rat as separate clades. In addition, Adh1-I2 placed a Costa Rican population within the marsh <b>rice</b> rat clade and some other southern Oryzomys specimens closer to the marsh <b>rice</b> rat than to the O.couesi group. The combined data supported the western and eastern clades within the marsh <b>rice</b> rat and placed the Costa Rican population marginally closer to the marsh <b>rice</b> rat than to O.couesi. Using the genetic species concept, the authors suggested that the western populations of the marsh <b>rice</b> rat be recognized as a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. They recommended further research in the Mississippi–Alabama–Tennessee region, where the ranges of the two meet.|$|E
