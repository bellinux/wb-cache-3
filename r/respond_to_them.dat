5|$|In its {{broadest}} definition, mimicry {{can include}} non-living models. The specific terms masquerade and mimesis are sometimes used when the models are inanimate. For example, {{animals such as}} flower mantises, planthoppers and geometer moth caterpillars resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers. Many animals bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to resemble the eyes of larger animals. They may not resemble any specific organism's eyes, {{and whether or not}} animals <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as eyes is also unclear. Nonetheless, eyespots are the subject of a rich contemporary literature.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{the use of}} placebos is a {{standard}} control component of most clinical trials, which attempt to {{make some sort of}} quantitative assessment of the efficacy of medicinal drugs or treatments. Such a test or clinical trial is called a placebo-controlled study, and its control is of the negative type. A study whose control is a previously tested treatment, rather than no treatment, is called a positive-control study, because its control is of the positive type. Government regulatory agencies approve new drugs only after tests establish not only that patients <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but also that their effect is greater than that of a placebo (by way of affecting more patients, by affecting responders more strongly, or both).|$|E

25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} is a mother's {{ability to}} perceive and infer the meaning behind her infant's behavioural signals, and to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> promptly and appropriately. Maternal sensitivity affects child development at all stages through life, from infancy, {{all the way}} to adulthood. In general, more sensitive mothers have healthier, more socially and cognitively developed children than those who are not as sensitive. Also, maternal sensitivity has been found to affect the person psychologically even as an adult. Adults who experienced high maternal sensitivity during their childhood were found to be more secure than those who experienced less sensitive mothers. Once the adult becomes a parent themselves, their own understanding of maternal sensitivity will affect their own children's development. Some research suggests that adult mothers display more maternal sensitivity than adolescent mothers who may in turn have children with a lower IQ and reading level than children of adult mothers.|$|E
25|$|If Charlie {{is uncomfortable}} with Nancy and her desires, he has bigger {{problems}} with the lizards. At first, he insists {{that they are a}} death hallucination caused by rotten liver paste sandwiches. While the creatures intrigue Nancy, Charlie continually acts with fear and resistance. He follows his wife's lead on posing submissively when the creatures first approach, but he will not <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> until she orders him to. Even after the ice has been broken, Charlie remains uncertain about the creatures and their intentions. Leslie and Sarah's ignorance on many things (emotions, anatomy, etc.) adds to Charlie's negative attitude. When he has to explain these ideas to them, he is easily frustrated and often condescending. He drives Leslie to beat and choke him. Yet at the end, Charlie agrees with Nancy that the lizards have to stay on land and not go back into the water. Though he helps because Nancy will do it whether or not he agrees, Charlie does offer to take them by the hand.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{experiments}} which {{have been shown to}} increase the maximum life span of laboratory animals, thereby achieving life extension. A few experimental methods such as replacing hormones to youthful levels have had considerable success in partially rejuvenating laboratory animals and humans. A recent experiment involved breeding genetically manipulated mice that lacked an enzyme called telomerase, causing the mice to age prematurely and suffer ailments. When the mice were given injections to reactivate the enzyme, it repaired the damaged tissues and reversed the signs of aging. There are at least eight important hormones that decline with age: 1. human growth hormone (HGH); 2. the sexual hormones: testosterone or oestrogen/progesterone; 3. erythropoietin (EPO); 4. insulin; 5. DHEA; 6. melatonin; 7. thyroid; 8. pregnenolone. In theory, if all or some of these hormones are replaced, the body will <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as it did when it was younger, thus repairing and restoring many body functions. In line with this, recent experiments show that heterochronic parabiosis, i.e. connecting the circulatory systems of young and old animal, leads to the rejuvenation of the old animal, including restoration of proper stem cell function. Similar experiments show that grafting old muscles into young hosts leads to their complete restoration, whereas grafting young muscles into old hosts does not. These experiments show that aging is mediated by systemic environment, rather than being an intrinsic cell property. Clinical trials based on transfusion of young blood were scheduled to begin in 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Many of Winnicott's {{writings}} {{show his}} efforts to understand what helps {{people to be able}} to play, and on the other hand what blocks some people from playing. Babies can be playful when they're cared for by people who <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> warmly and playfully, like a mother who smiles and says, [...] "Peek-a-boo!" [...] when she sees her baby playfully peeking out from behind his hands. If the mother never responded playfully, sooner or later the baby would stop trying to elicit play from her. [...] Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that [...] "Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure". [...] "Potential space" [...] was Winnicott's term for a sense of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).|$|E
2500|$|With each major {{earthquake}} comes {{new understanding}} {{of the way in}} which buildings <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Advances in the technology associated with testing systems, design and seismic modeling software, structural connections, structural forms, and seismic force resisting systems have accelerated dramatically since Northridge. There is an array of building forms and systems that are no longer legal to build. [...] An example is the previously popular [...] "soft-story" [...] multifamily apartments. These buildings typically look like a three-story box on a narrow lot, where the upper two floors overhang the lower floor and are supported on pipe columns so cars can be parked underneath. Because the ground level is soft relative to the upper floors, the upper portion can sway and fall onto the carport below. Today, no wood floors are allowed to extend more than an additional 15% beyond the shear wall or other lateral-load resisting element of the floor below. This typically results in overhangs not exceeding three or four feet, compared to the 20 to 40 feet that were previously built. If an architect still wants this type of design, the structural engineer may specify that the previously used pipe column design be replaced with a laterally stiff steel [...] "moment frame". This can also mitigate the problem of the soft-story structure by stiffening the soft ground floor.|$|E

60|$|Their {{languages}} are paralleled by their whole life. A {{lack of any}} fanciful ideas {{is one of the}} most salient traits of all Far Eastern races, if indeed a sad dearth of anything can properly be spoken of as salient. Indirectly their want of imagination betrays itself in their every-day sayings and doings, and more directly in every branch of thought. Originality is not their strong point. Their utter ignorance of science shows this, and paradoxical as it may seem, their art, in spite of its merit and its universality, does the same. That art and imagination are necessarily bound together receives no very forcible confirmation from a land where, nationally speaking, at any rate, the first is easily first and the last easily last, as nations go. It is to quite another quality that their artistic excellence must be ascribed. That the Chinese and later the Japanese have accomplished results at which the rest of the world will yet live to marvel, is due to their--taste. But taste or delicacy of perception has absolutely nothing to do with imagination. That certain of the senses of Far Orientals are wonderfully keen, as also those parts of the brain that directly <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> is beyond question; but such sensitiveness does not in the least involve the less earth-tied portions of the intellect. A peculiar responsiveness to natural beauty, a sort of mental agreement with its earthly environment, is a marked feature of the Japanese mind. But appreciation, however intimate, is a very different thing from originality. The one is commonly the handmaid of the other, but the other by no means always accompanies the one.|$|E
