Finite element model of closed ring rolling high-neck flange was established, the effect of process parameters on rolling force and its reasons are analyzed. The results show that, the higher feeding speed is, the larger the amplification of rolling force will be, in addition, rolling force will be reduced slightly with the increase of rotational <b>speed</b> of driving <b>roller,</b> and the influence on the rolling force of compressing <b>roller’s</b> feeding <b>speed</b> is much larger than driving <b>roller’s</b> rotational <b>speed...</b>|$|R

40|$|Web {{traction}} over rollers {{is known}} to deteriorate due to air entrainment at high web speeds. In this paper, a general model is presented to predict the traction capability of an impermeable web over a smooth roller. The model considers {{the effects of the}} web and <b>roller</b> <b>speeds,</b> <b>roller</b> radius, combined roughness of the two surfaces, web tension and thickness, friction coefficient, and compressible air bearing. The change of tension N∆ due to mechanical slip between the roller and the web is calculated by a simultaneous solution of the in-plane and out-of-plane equilibrium of the web. The problem is non-dimensionalized and the effects of nine of the eleven non-dimensional parameters on traction are investigated for a range of values. Formulas involving the non-dimensional parameters for the traction capability are presented in two variable polynomial forms. Traction Between a Web and a Smooth Roller 10 / 15 / 02...|$|R
