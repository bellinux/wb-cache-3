40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} plant functioning, plant community composition and terrestrial biogeochemistry it is decisive to study standing root biomass, (fine) root dynamics and interactions below ground. While most plant taxa can be identified by visual criteria above ground, roots show less distinctive features. Furthermore, root systems of neighbouring plants are rarely spatially segregated; thus, most soil horizons and samples hold roots {{of more than one}} species necessitating <b>root</b> <b>sorting</b> according to taxa. In the last decades, various approaches, ranging from anatomical and morphological analyses to differences in chemical composition and DNA sequencing were applied to discern species’ identity and biomass below ground. Among those methods, a variety of spectroscopic methods was used to detect differences in the chemical composition of roots. In this review, spectroscopic methods used to study root systems of herbaceous and woody species in excised samples or in situ will be discussed. In detail, techniques will be reviewed according to their usability to discern root taxa, to determine root vitality, and to quantify root biomass non-destructively or in soil cores holding mixtures of plant roots. In addition, spectroscopic methods which may be able to play an increasing role in future studies on root biomass and related traits are highlighted...|$|E

Twelve distinct molecular types were identified. Analysis of similarity showed that ECM fungal assemblages shifted significantly in composition across the soil moisture gradient. Taxa within the genus Tuber and the family Thelephoraceae were largely responsible for the changes in fungal assemblages.

The production and decomposition of these different diameter classes varied significantly with soil variables including soil temperature, moisture, calcium and ammonium concentration but the strength of these interactions varied dependent on diameter class. The very fine roots had a faster decomposition ratio than larger fine roots due to the lower N content, higher C/N ratio and higher sensitivity to soil environmental factors.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to volumetrically evaluate root resorption using cone beam computed tomography(CBCT) after mini-screw implant intrusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1. The volumes of 32 teeth were measured using CBCT and laser scanning to verify the accuracy of CBCT. 2. Twelve overerupted molars from adult patients were investigated in this study. After mini-screw implants were inserted into the buccal and palatal alveolar bones, 150 g of force was applied to the mini-screw implants on each side to intrude the molars. CBCT images of all patients were taken immediately prior to intrusion and after intrusion. The volumes of the roots were calculated using the Mimics software program. The differences between the pre-intrusion and post-intrusion root volumes were statistically evaluated with a paired-samples t-test. In addition, the losses of the roots were statistically compared with each other using one-way analysis of variance at the P 0. 05). The overerupted molars were significantly intruded (P< 0. 05), and the average intrusion was 3. 30 ± 1. 60 mm.

Bio-pesticide has been increasingly important in both scale commercial agriculture and small plot, subsistence farming.

The study was carried out to investigate the appropriate processing parameters with the aimed to acquire high yield of rotenone (mg) and concentration (mg/mL) of the exhaustive extraction process by evaluating the kinetics of the normal soaking extraction (NSE) method. The raw plants were collected from Kota Johor Lama, Johor and sorted to collect the root.

The rapidly growing human population will also face shortage of food, particularly in developing world where agricultural productivity is generally low. The taungya system – an age-old agroforestry practice involving intercropping of crops with trees on the same unit of land – is opined as a win-win strategy {{to meet the needs of}} wood products and food at the same time. In recent years, the taungya system has gained increasing attention by big forest companies as a tool and an opportunity to contribute to the social well-being of the local community. Stora Enso Lao Co, Ltd is one of these forest companies that adopted the taungya system in its commercial Eucalyptus plantations in Laos. The tree spacing commonly used is 9 × 1 m, and 5 × 2 m on a trial basis. Eucalyptus camaldulensis was intercropped with rice and cassava, and stands were established in 2007 (7 -yr old) and in 2012 (2 -yr old). The main objective of this thesis was to examine whether the intercropping has an effect on the root system of trees; thereby generating knowledge that supports evidence-based plantation management decisions involving taungya system. The key research questions were: (a) Does intercropping of rice/cassava with Eucalyptus influence the horizontal and vertical distributions of root biomass of trees compared with monoculture plantation of different spacing? (b) Does spacing (5 × 2 m versus 9 × 1 m) influence the horizontal and vertical distributions of root biomass of trees intercropped with rice? (c) Does root biomass differ between young (2 -yr old) and mature (7 -yr old) intercropped stands with 9 × 1 m spacing compared with monoculture plantation? If so, does the effect vary in relation to distance from the tree and soil depth? To characterize the root system architecture, trenches were made on six young trees in both pure monoculture and intercropped stands. To quantitatively estimate root biomass, a total of 324 soil cores (6 stands × 6 trees × 3 distances × 3 soil depths) was collected, <b>roots</b> <b>sorted</b> and dried to constant mass in an oven at 60 °C for 48 hours. The root dry mass data were subjected to analysis of variance to examine significant effects of intercropping, spacing and stand age. The results show that (1) the root system of E. camaldulensis is mainly confined to shallow depth but well elongated horizontally in both pure and intercropped stands with 4 - 6 thick lateral roots; (2) Intercropping of rice/cassava with Eucalyptus has no effect on total root dry mass of the tree component (p > 0. 05) irrespective of the plantation models (5 × 2 m or 9 × 1 m); however root biomass decreases with increasing horizontal distance from the tree base and in deeper soil layer; particularly for trees in young stands; (3) The effects of spacing design, narrow (5 × 2 m) versus wide (9 × 1 m), on root dry mass are dependent on horizontal and vertical distribution of the root system; and root biomass appears to be higher at 40 cm soil depth for the stand with narrow spacing between trees and crops than stands with wider spacing; (4) Root biomass was larger for older than younger trees in both monoculture and intercropped stands; suggesting lack of carry-over effect of intercropping on root biomass. As root biomass varies with horizontal distribution, further research is recommended to test buffer zones between trees and crops other than 1 m (which is currently used) ...|$|R

When roots were girdled in the apical part of the elongation zone gravitropic curvature occurred apical to the girdle but not basal to the girdle. Filling the girdle with agar allowed curvature basal to the girdle to occur. Shallow girdles, in which only two or three cell layers (epidermis plus one or two cortical cell layers) were removed, prevented or greatly delayed gravitropic curvature basal to the girdle. The results indicate that the gravitropic signal moves basipetally through the outermost cell layers, perhaps through the epidermis itself...|$|R
40|$|Methods of data {{collection}} are unavoidably <b>rooted</b> in some <b>sort</b> of theoretical paradigm, and are inextricably tied to an implicit agenda or broad problem framing. These prior orientations are not always explicit, but they matter for what data is collected {{and how it is}} used. They also structure opportunities for asking new questions, for linking or bridging between existing data sets and they matter even more when data is re-purposed for uses not initially anticipated. In this paper we provide an historical and comparative review of the changing categories used in organising and collecting data on mobility/travel and time use as part of ongoing work to understand, conceptualise and describe the changing patterns of domestic and mobility related energy demand within UK society. This exercise reveals systematic differences of method and approach, for instance in units of measurement, in how issues of time/duration and periodicity are handled, and how these strategies relate to the questions such data is routinely used to address. It also points to more fundamental differences in how traditions of research into mobility, domestic energy and time use have developed. We end with a discussion of the practical implications of these diverse histories for understanding and analysing changing patterns of energy/mobility demand at different scale...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{possibilities}} {{and limitations of}} studying primary metabolism in intact plants, with special focus on heavy isotope labelling and mass spectrometry methodology. In paper I, a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking one or both genes of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (mMDH characterised) were characterised. We found that mMDH has a complex respiration-controlling role. In paper II, we continued to study one of the single mutants, mmdh 1. We developed a method using ¹³CO₂ to label whole plants and analyse their metabolic profiles by gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC- and LC-MS). The results show that mmdh 1 had a metabolic phenotype that revealed an altered flux through photorespiration, especially under low CO₂ conditions. Combining incorporation data with metabolite pool size deepened our understanding regarding the role of mMDH in photorespiration, respiration, and cellular redox balance. The practical and theoretical aspects of ¹³C-labelling of plants learned from this study were used for designing the experimental setup of paper III, a labelling study of developing wood in hybrid aspen. The labelling strategy, time resolution, and sampling had to be adapted to suit woody plants. Two months old trees were labelled with ¹³CO₂ in a 4 h burst and then sampling of source leaves, stem phloem, and developing wood continued over 24 hours. Since sucrose is the main carbon transporter the analysis was concentrated around this metabolite. We found previously unrecognised temporal patterns in wood biosynthesis and {{an indication that the}} diurnal cycle serves as a cue in the regulation of carbon allocation in developing wood. To study systems with complex structures such as plants, it is informative to study specific cell types rather than whole plants or whole organs. In paper IV, a method was developed for analysis of metabolite profiles in cell type specific cells. Isolated protoplast from Arabidopsis <b>roots</b> were <b>sorted</b> by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and their metabolite profiles were analysed by GC-MS. The method is fast, robust and reliable for analysis of cell type specific metabolic profiling and a beginning to meet the call for new metabolite analysis techniques with a high spatial resolution...|$|R
40|$|Roots play a {{major role}} in plant development. Their study in field {{conditions}} is important to identify suitable soil management practices for sustainable crop productions. Soil coring, which is a common method in root production measurement, is limited in sampling frequency due to the hand‐sorting step. This step, needed to <b>sort</b> <b>roots</b> from other elements extracted from soil cores like crop residues, is time consuming, tedious, and vulnerable to operator ability and subjectivity. To get rid of the cumbersome hand‐sorting step, avoid confusion between these elements, and reduce the time needed to quantify roots, a new procedure, based on near‐infrared hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy and chemometrics, has been proposed. It was tested to discriminate roots of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from crop residues and soil particles. Two algorithms (support vector machine and partial least squares discriminant analysis) have been compared for discrimination analysis. Models constructed with both algorithms allowed the discrimination of roots from other elements, but the best results were reached with models based on support vector machine. The ways to validate models, with selected spectra or with hyperspectral images, provided different kinds of information but were complementary. This new procedure of root discrimination is a first step before root quantification in soil samples with near‐infrared hyperspectral imaging. The results indicate that the methodology could be an interesting tool to improve the understanding of the effect of tillage or fertilization, for example, on root system development.
