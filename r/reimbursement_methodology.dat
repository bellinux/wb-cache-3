40|$|Background/Methods: Readmission {{prevention}} is {{a marker of}} patient care quality and requires comprehensive, early discharge planning for safe hospital transitions. Effectively performed, this process supports patient satisfaction, efficient resource utilization, and care integration. This study developed/tested the utility of a predictive early discharge risk assessment with 366 elective orthopedic/cardiovascular surgery patients. Quality improvement cycles were undertaken for the design and to inform analytic plan. An 8 -item questionnaire, which includes patient self-reported health, was integrated into care managers’ telephonic pre-admission assessments during a 12 -month period. Results: Regression models found the questionnaire to be predictive of readmission (p ≤. 005; R 2 =. 334) and length-of-stay (p ≤. 001; RR 2 =. 314). Independent variables of “lives-alone” and “self-rated health” were statistically significant for increased readmission odds, as was “self-rated health” for increased length-of-stay. Quality measures, patient experience and increased rates of discharges-to-home further supported the benefit of embedding these questions into the pro-active planning process. Conclusion: The pilot discharge risk assessment was predictive of readmission risk and length-of-stay for elective orthopedic/cardiovascular patients. Given the usability of the questionnaire in advance of elective admissions, it can facilitate pro-active discharge planning essential for producing quality outcomes and addressing new <b>reimbursement</b> <b>methodologies</b> for continuum-based episodes of care...|$|R

40|$|Changes to {{reimbursement}} {{levels and}} <b>reimbursement</b> <b>methodology</b> {{have become increasingly}} common as public health insurance programs seek to slow the rate of cost growth. Despite the fact that Medicaid is a major public health insurance program, {{little is known about}} how hospitals respond to price cuts by Medicaid. On the other hand, existing research on hospital response to a commonly used payment method (prospective payment) by Medicaid is largely based on policy changes from the 1980 s. In this dissertation, I study 1) how hospitals in California responded to a 10 % payment reduction by Medicaid in 2008, and 2) how hospitals in California responded to the 2013 introduction of a prospective payment system by Medicaid. For both analyses, I make use of hospital and emergency department discharge records from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, and study outcomes related to access to hospital care and intensity of care. I find little response to the 10 % payment cut along these margins; suggesting that hospitals may have responded along other margins. In the analysis of hospital response to prospective payment, I find results consistent with theoretical predictions as well as the existing literature. Hospitals responded to prospective payment by reducing average inpatient length of stay. Furthermore, this response was driven primarily by hospitals with the strongest incentives [...] -those previously paid on a per diem basis. These results suggest that hospitals may not respond strongly to across-the-board payment cuts {{in the way that they}} treat patients. On the other hand, hospitals had a strong, immediate, and predictable response to a change in the payment methodology, suggesting that perhaps this is a more effective policy tool. ...|$|E

There remains today a belief that expenditures of elderly, dual beneficiaries electing to age-in-place for supported self-care expend less than that of elderly, dual beneficiaries electing traditional institutional LTC. Of forty-one peer reviewed periodicals, there is one that supports that belief, all other literature supports a counter-intuitive reality that LTC is less costly. In, Q 4 of 2013 Florida’s Medicaid agency, the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) in collaboration with the state’s Department of Elder Affairs (DOEA) consolidated its six aging/elderly programs[1] into their new Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) -Long-Term Care (LTC) program. AHCA outsourced these programs through competitive procurement to managed care organizations. Compared to previous studies this study has three unique distinctions: Composition of expenditure categories–Nine of the eleven other studies compared only LTC costs directly to only HCBS costs. This study includes seven expenditure categories: Ancillary; Institutional–Acute; Institutional–Other; LTSS; Miscellaneous; Pharmaceutical; and, Professional.

40|$|Healthcare {{delivery}} in the United States {{has undergone a}} complete transformation in the past 75 years. Dramatic changes have occurred in critical functional areas such as medical technology, <b>reimbursement</b> <b>methodologies,</b> employment arrangements, and other important administrative and clinical areas. Despite the influx of changes, one particular structural aspect has not changed. The adversarial relationship between the medical provider community and healthcare managers has {{continued to be a}} normal part of the daily functioning in healthcare environments. Healthcare industry participants would suggest that the dysfunctional relationships between doctors and mangers have intensified with each passing decade. With the United States’ recent recognition that the current system of health care is trending towards an unsustainable financial future, along with the recent passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the primary goal of all new healthcare public policy has been to increase access and improve quality. By achieving ACA’s primary goals, cost reductions become a secondary positive outcome. These objectives can be accomplished only by means of a systems thinking approach in which healthcare providers and healthcare managers work in tandem. This essay explores the origins of the adversarial relationships between medical providers and healthcare managers. Conclusions are drawn that place current emphasis on the inability of providers and mangers to engage in effective communication due to structural roadblocks. Systemic structural barriers enmeshed in long-standing institutional systems of education, in addition to a healthcare system that is inherently structurally flawed, create multiple opportunities for conflict between providers and managers. Strategies including alternative dispute resolution and the use of communication tools will be explored as methods to reduce conflict. Understanding the conflicts between healthcare managers and physicians highlights the importance of resolving these conflicts within the new framework of healthcare {{delivery in}} the United States. A continuation of the current adversarial relationship between doctors and managers has direct impact on public health. This issue has public health relevance {{due to the fact that}} if left unsolved it will work in opposition to the basic tenets of the Affordable Care Act leading directly to more costly health care and contributing to poor health outcomes for all healthcare consumers...|$|R

Participating community health centers were randomly assigned to capitated intervention group (n = 10) or traditional FFS payment control group (n = 10). The capitated and FFS groups received $ 470 per patient per quarter and $ 94 per visit, respectively. Patients were risk stratified and clinic visits were documented over 10 months. 	Patient health data was obtained by trained healthcare providers at each clinic through electronic data registries while billing data was acquired from email communication. OSHPD 2006 annual utilization data was available online. Chronic Care Model Assessment (CCMA) scores, which are structural measures of quality, were self-assessed and reported by the clinics using the CCMA tool. Results from provider interviews and patient satisfaction and knowledge surveys were also described in this report. Select health outcome measures (HbA 1 c, LDL, and blood pressure) were analyzed using SAS version 9. 3 to assess improvements in patient care and health. Evaluation of the equivalence between treatment groups utilized t-test to compare means and z-scores to compare proportions. Study groups' median CCMA scores did not differ significantly although the intervention clinics reported better CCMA scores in October of 2007 and this difference approached statistical significance (p = 0. 0562). There was no evidence of harmful health effects to enrolling patients in capitated group clinics, at least under the conditions prevailing in this pilot study. Patients in both groups appeared comparably satisfied with different dimensions of their care. However, intervention group patients showed markedly higher level of satisfaction in the time clinics took to return their phone calls and in their ability to schedule medical appointments for their diabetes when they needed one. In terms of knowledge, patients from both study groups did not show marked difference except that more patients in the intervention group knew what their HbA 1 c level should be...|$|R
40|$|California’s elderly {{population}} over age 85 {{is estimated to}} grow 361 % by the year 2050. Many of these elders are frail and highly dependent on caregivers making them more likely to need nursing home care. A 1998 United States Government Accountability Office report identified poor quality of care in California nursing homes. This report spurred multiple Assembly Bills in California designed to increase nursing home nurse staffing, change the state’s Medi-Cal <b>reimbursement</b> <b>methodology,</b> or both. The legislation culminated in Assembly Bill (AB) 1629, signed into law in September 2004, which included the Long-Term Care Reimbursement Act. This legislation changed the state’s Medi-Cal reimbursement from a prospective, flat rate to a prospective, cost-based methodology and was designed in part to increase nursing home nurse staffing. It is estimated that this methodology change moved California from the bottom 10 % of Medicaid nursing home reimbursement rates nationwide to the top 25 %. This study analyzed the effect of AB 1629 on a panel of 567 free-standing nursing homes that were in continuous operation between the years 2002 – 2007. Resource Dependence Theory was used to construct the conceptual framework. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and first differencing with instrumental variable estimation procedures were used to test five hypotheses concerning Medi-Cal resource dependence, bed size, competition (including assisted living facilities and home health agencies), resource munificence, and slack resources. Both a 15 and 25 mile fixed radius were used as alternative market definitions instead of counties. The OLS results supported that case-mix adjusted licensed vocational nurse (LVN) and total nurse staffing hours per resident day increased overall. Nursing homes with the highest Medi-Cal dependence increased only increased NA staffing more than nursing homes with the lowest Medi-Cal dependence post AB 1629. The fixed effects with instrumental variable estimation procedure provided marginal support that nursing homes with more home health agency competition, in a 15 mile market, had higher LVN staffing. This estimation procedure also supported that nursing homes with more slack resources (post AB 1629) increased nurse aide and total nurse staffing while nursing homes located in markets with {{a greater percentage of}} residents over the age of 85 had more nurse aide staffing...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine the relative profitability of the firm within the nursing facility industry in Texas. An examination is made of the variables expected to affect profitability and of importance to the design and implementation of regulatory policy. To facilitate this inquiry, specific questions addressed are: (1) Do differences in ownership form affect profitability (defined as operating income before fixed costs) ? (2) What impact does regional location have on profitability? (3) Do patient case-mix and access to care by Medicaid patients differ between proprietary and non-profit firms and facilities located in urban versus rural regions, and what association exists between these variables and profitability? (4) Are economies of scale present in the nursing home industry? (5) Do nursing facilities operate in a competitive output market characterized by the inability of a single firm to exhibit influence over market price?^ Prior studies have principally employed a cost function to assess efficiency differences between classifications of nursing facilities. The inherent weakness in this approach is that it only considers technical efficiency. Not both technical and price efficiency which are the two components of overall economic efficiency. One firm is more technically efficient compared to another if it is able to produce a given quantity of output at the least possible costs. Price efficiency means that scarce resources are being directed towards their most valued use. Assuming similar prices in both input and output markets, differences in overall economic efficiency between firm classes are assessed through profitability, hence a profit function. ^ Using the framework of the profit function, data from 1990 Medicaid Costs Reports for Texas, and the analytic technique of Ordinary Least Squares Regression, the findings of the study indicated (1) similar profitability between nursing facilities organized as for-profit versus non-profit and located in urban versus rural regions, (2) an inverse association between both payor-mix and patient case-mix with profitability, (3) strong evidence for the presence of scale economies, and (4) existence of a competitive market structure.

While the analysis of organizational variables indicated some diversity of the population in number of beds, clinic visits, etc., there appeared to be much commonality in accounts receivable needs expression, personnel assigned to the evaluation and even in most of the organizational variables. ^ This commonality allowed the guide to be constructed with preselection of elements, as 90 and 30 percent of the population indicated those elements which are 2 ̆ 2 important 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 not important 2 ̆ 2 respectively, to have within a system.

40|$|Cell- based {{regenerative}} therapies {{are presented}} as being able to cure the diseases of the XXI century, especially those coming from the degeneration of the aging human body. But their specific nature based on biological materials raises particular challenging issues on how regulation should frame biomedical innovation for society’s benefit regarding public health. The European Union (EU) supports the development of cell- based regenerative therapies that are medicinal products with a specific regulation providing their wide access to the European market for European patients. However, once these medicinal products have obtained a European marketing authorisation, they are still far away from being fully accessible to European patients in all EU Member States. Whereas there is much written on the EU regulatory system for new biotechnologies, there is no systematic legal study comparing the insurance provisions in two EU countries. Focusing {{on the situation in}} the United Kingdom and France that are based on two different healthcare systems, this paper is based on a comparative methodological approach. It raises the question of regulatory reimbursement mechanisms that determine access to innovative treatments, and their consequences for social protection systems in the general context of public health. After having compared the French and English regulations of cell- based regenerative therapy regarding pricing and reimbursement, this papers analyses how England and France are addressing two main challenges of cell- based regenerative therapy, to take into account their long- term benefit through their potential curative nature and their high up front cost, towards their adoption within the English and French healthcare systems. It concludes that England and France have different general legal frameworks that are not specific to the reimbursement of cell- based regenerative therapy although their two current and respective trends would bring more convergence between the two systems while addressing the main challenges for the reimbursement of these therapies. Nevertheless, despite their current differences neither the English nor the French national healthcare systems have yet approved the reimbursement of cell- based regenerative therapies. The paper highlights where both systems could be learning from each other experiences to favour the adoption of cell- based regenerative therapies through the adaptation of their <b>reimbursement</b> <b>methodologies.</b> It also emphasizes the gap between market access and patients’ access and, it calls for research and discussions through reflexive agencies such as Regenerative Medicine Expert Group in the UK...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{value of}} new cancer drugs is maximized {{when they are}} used for the right patient {{in the right way}} in {{clinical}} practice. Clinical trials conducted during drug development are the most important source of information to predict value at the time a drug is introduced in practice. Regulatory approval is an indication of value, which lately has been complemented with an assessment of clinical value for decisions about <b>reimbursement,</b> using the <b>methodology</b> of health technology assessment (HTA). Formal cost-effectiveness studies {{are an important part of}} this methodology, aiming to assist decisions about value for money in health care spending. The question is if the addition of a complementary HTA and cost-effectiveness study increases the value realized by the drug in practice compared to how it would be used without these assessments. We review the issues involved in providing an answer by using the introduction of new targeted therapies for metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC). Specifically, we examine the link between clinical trial data and estimations of cost-effectiveness at drug launch, reimbursement decisions, uptake and use in different countries and evidence about impact on outcome in patient populations for which the new drugs are indicated. We conclude that there is a weak link between the assessments used at drug launch and the value created in clinical practice. We suggest measures that are necessary for the achievement of evidence-based and cost-effective cancer care in clinical practice...|$|R
