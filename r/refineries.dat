5|$|An oil tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to <b>refineries.</b> For example, moving crude oil from oil wells in Nigeria to the <b>refineries</b> on the coast of the United States. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from <b>refineries</b> to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from <b>refineries</b> in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|E

5|$|As Galveston's {{traditional}} economy declined, Texas' {{oil boom}} began in 1901, with oil wells and <b>refineries</b> constructed throughout the state.

Nevertheless, wealth {{brought on by the}} boom transformed nearby Houston, Texas City, Goose Creek (modern Baytown), and other communities. Houston in particular became home to a large community of wealthy businessmen and investors. Galveston became even more tourism-focused as the city sought to attract these nearby nouveau riche. Still, in the first two decades after the 1900 storm, the city's economy struggled to recover.|$|E
