5|$|From {{the summer}} of 1940, the Committee became {{increasingly}} divided between the members keen for closer collaboration with the Germans, led by Victor Leemans, and those who wished to remain strictly within the proscribed Belgian legal framework, led by Ernst de Bunswyck. In October 1940, the Germans were able to pass fundamental changes to the system of regional Burgomasters in the country though the Committee without resistance. The Committee had announced in October 1940 that it would refuse to enforce anti-Jewish legislation, but did not resist their implementation by the military government. The Committee's ambivalent stance meant that Belgian policemen and civil servants were not instructed to refuse to participate in <b>rounding-up</b> of Jews {{as part of the}} Final Solution from 1942. Tensions grew between the Germans and the committee in December 1940, and in early 1941 the Germans reshuffled the committee; appointing more pro-Nazi members. From March 1941, {{it became clear that the}} Committee would no longer be able to resist German demands, even those clearly violating the Hague Convention.|$|E

6000|$|At {{a church}} club meeting a paper was read by a {{minister}} entitled, [...] "Why the Masses Do not Attend the Churches." [...] This good and pious {{man was not}} ashamed to account for it {{by the fact that}} there is no Sunday law, and [...] "the masses" [...] can find recreation elsewhere, even in the drinking saloons. It is frank of him to admit that he and his professional brethren have not brains enough to make religious services more attractive than shaking dice for cigars or playing cards for drink; but if it is a fact he must not expect the local government to assist in spreading the gospel by <b>rounding-up</b> the people and corralling them in the churches. The truth is, and this gentleman suspects it, that [...] "the masses" [...] stay out of hearing of his pulpit because he talks nonsense of the most fatiguing kind; they would rather do any one of a thousand other things than go to hear it. These parsons are like a scolding wife who grieves because her husband will not pass his evenings with her. The more she grieves, the more she scolds and the more diligently he keeps away from her. I don't think Jack Satan is conspicuously wise, but he is in the main a good entertainer, with a right pretty knack at making people come again; but the really reprehensible part of his performance is not the part that attracts them. The parsons might study his methods with great advantage to religion and morality.|$|E
5000|$|Such roundups as Poland's łapanka {{were carried}} out by the Germans in other {{occupied}} countries as well, particularly in northern France, although not as extensively as in Poland. The French term for this practice was rafle, applied primarily to the <b>rounding-up</b> of French Jews. In Denmark and the Netherlands, a Nazi roundup was called razzia.|$|E

This occurs when the wind overpowers the ability of the rudder to maintain a straight course.|$|E
50|$|The Germans began a {{systematic}} <b>rounding-up</b> of French Jews and refugees from Nice and Marseille. Many thousands {{were taken to}} concentration camps, and few survived. A large quarter around the port of Marseille was emptied of inhabitants and dynamited, so it would not serve {{as a base for}} the resistance. Nonetheless, the resistance grew stronger; the leader of the pro-German militia, the Milice, in Marseille was assassinated in April 1943.|$|E
50|$|In Nazi Germany, the German {{equivalent}} term, 'Schutzhaft', {{was used}} as a euphemism for the extra- or para-legal <b>rounding-up</b> of political opponents and especially Jews, sometimes officially defended as being necessary to protect them from the 'righteous' wrath of the German population. Schutzhaft did not provide for a judicial warrant, in fact the detainee would most probably never have seen a judge. The victims were then sent to concentration camps such as Dachau concentration camp or Buchenwald concentration camp.|$|E
50|$|Quantrill's guerrillas, as a group, did not {{maintain}} operations in winters along the border. Quantrill would lead {{his men to}} Tyler, Texas, over winter and offer his services to the Confederacy. Their assignments included attacking teamsters who supplied the Union, repelling Union and Jayhawker raids into northern Texas, warding off Indian attacks and policing and <b>rounding-up</b> deserters roaming in Texas and Oklahoma. The guerrillas were rowdy, undisciplined and dangerous. Quantrill lost his control {{of the men in}} the winter of 1863-64.|$|E
50|$|Other Germans began {{systematically}} <b>rounding-up</b> French civilians {{suspected of}} assisting US troops. A total of forty-four villagers were rounded up, interrogated by the Germans as suspected collaborators with the Americans, and were then shot dead. Other SS men dragged Father Leblastier and Father Lebarbanchon from the rectory {{into the courtyard}} outside, and shot them both dead. The Germans then discovered Madeleine Pezeril and eighty-year-old Eugénie Dujardin and shot them both dead in their beds. Thereafter, the SS men ransacked the village for any valuables they could steal.|$|E

50|$|The {{practice}} of sending poor or orphaned children to English and later British settler colonies, to help alleviate {{the shortage of}} labour, began in 1618, with the <b>rounding-up</b> and transportation of one hundred English vagrant children to the Virginia Colony. In the 18th century labour shortages in the overseas colonies also encouraged the transportation of children for work in the Americas, and large numbers of children were forced to migrate, most of them from Scotland. This practice continued until it was exposed in 1757, following a civil action against Aberdeen merchants and magistrates for their involvement in the trade.|$|E
50|$|Price {{suffered}} relegation {{during his}} first season with Colchester, and following manager Neil Franklin's departure coupled {{with the arrival of}} Dick Graham, Price found his first-team chances fewer and further between. After making 35 league starts for the club during the 1967-68 season, his involvement with the first-team in his second season was reduced, making 19 starts and coming on from the bench twice. In total, Price played 56 league games for the United, scoring five times, the last of these goals <b>rounding-up</b> the scoring in a 3-0 win against Workington on 4 November 1968. He played his final game for the club on 21 April 1969 in a goalless draw with Halifax Town at Layer Road.|$|E

Nevertheless, he passed his final exams in the following year. He participated in the resistance movement against the German occupants. In 1942, he was arrested; stays in prison and camps followed until he was deported to Vienna in 1943. A year later, he was arrested again and put into [...] "protective custody" [...] (a euphemism used by the Nazis for the <b>rounding-up</b> of political opponents).|$|E
5000|$|The villagers collectively {{decided not}} to bury the bodies {{immediately}} (as demanded by Muslim tradition), but to instead keep the victims' bodies inside homes so their deaths could be documented. Following the massacre, Russian forces returned to Aldi on numerous occasions to loot and to threaten residents with reprisals should they speak out about what they witnessed. While there was some plunder on February 5, systematic pillage {{on a massive scale}} first took place during the following week, including on February 10 when OMON returned to Aldi in large numbers and began <b>rounding-up</b> any Chechen males they could find, taking away 16 of them along with whole truckloads of looted items.

The breakaway was absorbed shortly afterwards and no one tried to escape the bunch from that point on. In a very fast finish, Wouter Wippert (...) launched a long sprint and Sagan jumped onto his wheel. Cavendish opened his own sprint {{on the right side of}} the road and Sagan popped out of Wippert's wheel on the left. As both the Slovakian and the Manx Missile crossed the line at high speeds, none of the two raised their hands, as they were unsure who had just won. It was later determined that Cavendish had met victory in his second stage in a row, with the involuntary lead-out man Wippert <b>rounding-up</b> the podium.|$|E

50|$|The Janeirada {{was planned}} {{by members of}} the Portuguese Republican Party, their enforcers, the Formiga Branca, {{elements}} of the Progressive Dissidency Party and the Carbonária, the latter two providing financing, men and arms. In addition to António José de Almeida, there was support from the shadows from Luz de Almeida, the chief of the Carbonária Lusitana, Machado Santos and António Maria da Silva. The decision to murder the King, was not clear, but these instructions were passed on to Costa's group, as part of the coup plans. But, the plans were shelved immediately when, tipped-off by police, João Franco's government began <b>rounding-up</b> the usual suspects in militant republican circles. Those that could escape, did so, while others congregated around São Julião's Elevator and were rounded-up by the police on mass. In fact, the limits were limited to the higher-echelon members and leaders of the anti-monarchist movement, while lower level dissidents and thugs were limited to attacks in the Rato, in Alcântara, in the Campo de Santana, and along the Rua da Escola Politécnica (where one officer was killed).|$|E

While in a street outside, they were both caught in a łapanka, a random <b>rounding-up</b> of Polish hostages in re&shy;pri&shy;sal for what the Nazi prop&shy;a&shy;gan&shy;da portrayed as anti-German events of the so-called Bloody Sunday of 3 September 1939, six days earlier.

Szarek was killed together with his younger companion, Stanisław Wiórek who had just obtained a doctorate in Rome. Szarek was 31-years' old.|$|E
50|$|After Norway was invaded, the Nazis {{took control}} of the {{government}} and the true government went into exile. Power was given to the German Reichskommissar Josef Terboven and the Norwegian Fascist Party leader Vidkun Quisling. Quisling had attempted to establish himself as the leader of occupied Norway, but the Nazis only used him as leader of a puppet government. The Nazis, as well as some Norwegian police units, managed to round up over 750 Jews, of a total of about 1,800. However, the Nazis and their collaborators were very unpopular in Norway, causing a strong resistance movement, so the German government's aims for Norway were never fulfilled. Many Jews and other people were saved by the actions of Norwegians, including Norwegian police. Still, detailed lists of Jews existed {{at the time of the}} occupation. This caused the <b>rounding-up</b> of Jews in Norway to be much more efficient than in Denmark. Quisling and other Norwegians, who collaborated with the Nazis, were executed as traitors after the war, at least partly due to their involvement in the Holocaust. Also, 245 Sinti and Roma were deported to the Nazi extermination camps, of whom 190 were murdered.|$|E
5000|$|The {{practice}} of sending poor or orphaned {{children to the}} English settler colonies, to help alleviate the shortage of labour, began in England in 1618, with the <b>rounding-up</b> and transportation of 100 vagrant children to the Virginia Colony. Prior to {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, the Home Children programme was seen as a way to move impoverished children to a [...] "better life" [...] in Australia, Canada and elsewhere, also providing good [...] "white stock" [...] to former colonies. The children and parents were not consulted, and often siblings were separated. In total 130,000 children were sent from the United Kingdom to Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and Australia. Often children were lied to about their parents being dead and many faced abuse in their new homes. In February 2010 British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown issued an official apology for the 'shameful' child resettlement programme and announced a £6 million fund designed to compensate the families affected by the [...] "misguided" [...] programme. The Child Migrants Trust has since set up the Family Restoration Fund in order to use this money to help reunite former child migrants with their families as part of the British government's package of support to former child migrants and their families.|$|E

5000|$|In August 1942 the Vichy {{authorities}} began arresting Jews in France's unoccupied southern zone. Lesage learnt on 16 August of {{a large-scale}} [...] "ramassage" [...] or <b>rounding-up</b> planned {{and decided to}} warn Jewish and other rescue organizations of the impending raid. In particular he warned Édouard Simon who ran the children's home of the Éclaireurs israélites de France at Moissac. A few days later, assisted by Amitiés chrétiennes, Dr [...] of the Œuvre de secours aux enfants (OSE) and [...] (Abbé Glasberg), Lesage was personally {{able to make a}} case for exemption for more than 400 Jews at a camp in a disused barracks at Vénissieux near Lyon and thus save them from deportation. Now that exemption from deportation of {{children under the age of}} 18 had been cancelled, Lesage decided to go by an official directive of a few days earlier that stated that [...] "when interested parties do not request to take their children with them, the latter shall be put in the care of the Social Department for Aliens". On the night of 28 August, Lesage and various social bodies attempted to persuade parents at the camp to entrust them with their children. In this way he was able to save 104 Jewish children, who were safely taken to the premises of the Éclaireurs israélites at Lyon. The same method was used in other camps where Jews were concentrated; near Clermont-Ferrand, Limoges, Macon and Montluçon.|$|E

[...] Zach Baron, writing in The Village Voice added [...] "NSFW isn't exactly the word. More like art film? We can think of no goofier political allegory than the persecution, abuse, and murder of redheads, but then again, M.I.A.'s politics have never been of the kind you read about in the New York Times." [...] James Montgomery of MTV described it as [...] "unflinchingly, unapologetically real" [...] depicting [...] "the kind of things that most nations — including the U.S., which is portrayed as the aggressor in the clip — often pretend don't happen: the <b>rounding-up</b> of ethnic minorities, the trampling of personal liberties, the bullying of the powerless by those with authority." [...] Ann Powers wrote in the Los Angeles Times that the video [...] "concentrated fully" [...] on the physical horror of gun butts and bullets hitting flesh, with the scenes giving added poignancy to the lyrical themes of the song. Interpreted as {{a comment on}} desensitised attitudes towards violence, others found that the video stressed that genocide still exists and violent repression remains commonplace. Some critics described the film as [...] "sensationalist". Neda Ulaby of NPR described the video as intended for [...] "shock value" [...] in the service of nudging people into considering real issues that can be hard to talk about. Haddow wrote further in The Guardian that particularly notable about the video was its use of red headed individuals as a proxy for anyone who has felt the brunt of a jackboot. The effect of this was that the viewer was [...] "expected to empathise with the victim, rather than the aggressor." [...] Haddow stated that this sat in [...] "stark contrast" [...] to the bulk of recent films {{on the subject of the}} Afghan and Iraq wars such as Katheryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker (2009), Oren Moverman's The Messenger (2009) and Green Zone (2010) written by Brian Helgeland and directed by Paul Greengrass, where focus was almost entirely on the psychological experiences of military personnel, continuing [...] "Rarely do we ever catch a glimpse of the locals, whom we are supposed to be helping, unless they are being blown up or used as plot devices to heighten the suspense." [...] Other critics also pointed to differences between [...] "Born Free" [...] and Bigelow's The Hurt Locker but similarities between the video and Peter Watkins' Punishment Park (1971).|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the role of}} metacognitive monitoring in strategic behavior during arithmetic problem solving, {{a process that is}} expected to shed light on age-related differences in strategy selection. Young and older adults accomplished better strategy-judgment, better strategy-selection, and strategy-execution tasks. Data showed that participants made better strategy judgments when problems were problems with homogeneous unit digits (i. e., problems with both unit digits smaller or larger than 5; 31 x 62) relative to problems with heterogeneous unit digits (i. e., problems with one unit digit smaller or larger than 5; 31 x 67) and when the better strategy was cued on <b>rounding-up</b> problems (e. g., 68 x 23) compared to rounding-down problems (e. g., 36 x 53). Results also indicated higher rates of better strategy judgment in young than in older adults. These aging effects differed across problem types. Older adults made more accurate judgments on <b>rounding-up</b> problems than on rounding-down problems when the cued strategy was <b>rounding-up,</b> while young adults did not show such problem-related differences. Moreover, strategy selection correlated with strategy judgment, and even more so in older adults than in young adults. To discuss the implications of these findings, we propose a theoretical framework of how strategy judgments occur in young and older adults and discuss how this framework enables to understand relationships between metacognitive monitoring and strategic behaviors when participants solve arithmetic problems.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} age-related differences in children’s within-item strategy switching. Third, fifth, and seventh graders performed a computational estimation task {{in which they}} had to provide the better estimates to two-digit addition problems (e. g., 34 + 57) while using the rounding-down (e. g., 30 + 50) or the <b>rounding-up</b> strategy (e. g., 40 + 60). After having executing the cued strategy (e. g., 30 + 50) during 1, 000 ms, participants were given the opportunity to switch to another better strategy (e. g., 40 + 60) or to repeat the same strategy. The results showed that children switched strategies within items, and were able to switch more often when the addition problems were cued with the poorer strategy than when cued with the better strategy. As they grew up, children based their decisions to switch strategies more often on whether the 1, 000 -ms strategy execution concerned the better strategy or a resource-consuming strategy (i. e., the <b>rounding-up</b> strategy). These findings have important implications to further understand mechanisms underlying within-item strategy switching as well as strategic variations in children...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} a {{new phenomenon}} that sheds light on age-related differences in strategy selection: the strategy repetition phenomenon (i. e., tendency to repeat the same strategy over consecutive items). Young and older adults had {{to provide the best}} estimates of multiplication problems like 47 x 86. They had to select the best of 2 rounding strategies on each problem, the rounding-down strategy (i. e., doing 40 x 80 = 3, 200) or the <b>rounding-up</b> strategy (i. e., doing 50 x 90 = 4, 500). Data showed that both young and older adults repeated the same strategy over consecutive problems more often than chance and repeated strategies more often in the 2 -prime condition (i. e., after executing one strategy to solve the 2 immediately preceding problems) than in the 1 -prime condition (i. e., after executing a strategy on one immediately preceding problem). Moreover, this strategy repetition phenomenon increased with age, especially in the most difficult condition (e. g., when participants solved <b>rounding-up</b> problems in the 2 -prime condition). Our findings have important theoretical and empirical implications for computational models of strategy selection and for furthering our understanding of strategic development during adulthood...|$|E

In real microgravity conditions, the human epidermoid cell line A 431 exhibits specific changes in the actin cytoskeleton resulting ultimately in the <b>rounding-up</b> of cells. This rounding of A 431 cells was studied in detail during exposure to Random Positioning Machine (RPM) rotation and magnetic levitation. Random rotation and magnetic levitation induced similar changes in the actin morphology of A 431 cells that were also described in real microgravity. A transient process of cell rounding and renewed spreading was observed in time, illustrated by a changing actin cytoskeleton and variation {{in the presence of}} focal adhesions. However, side effects of both methods easily can lead to false linking of cellular responses to simulated microgravity. Therefore further characterization of both methods is required...|$|E

When I rely on the very popular brand-name proxy (i. e.

40|$|International audienceObjective: Consistent with Uittenhove and Lemaire (2012), we {{expected}} that strategy execution would be slower following execution of a difficult strategy than after an easy strategy (strategy sequential difficulty, SSD, effects). Moreover, {{we expected}} larger SSD effects in older adults than in young adults, and especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, a population with marked cognitive impairments. Method: A total of 25 young and older (41 AD and 25 healthy) adults were asked to execute rounding strategies to solve arithmetic problems (e. g., solving 43 + 68 by rounding operands down or up, e. g., 40 + 70 = 110). We measured solution latencies and percentage errors with a strategy {{as a function of}} the difficulty of the just-executed strategy. Results: Solution latencies were significantly shorter following the easier rounding-down strategy than following the harder <b>rounding-up</b> strategy, F(2, 156) = 35. 8. Moreover, this effect was significantly larger in AD patients, F(1, 78) = 117. 4. Conclusions: We found comparable SSD effects in young and healthy older adults but dramatically increased SSD effects in AD patients. This has implications to further our understanding of strategic aspects underlying decreased cognitive functioning in AD patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{aqueous extract}} of Plinia edulis leaves (AEP) was {{evaluated}} for its in vitro antioxidant potential and cytotoxicity to MCF- 7 cells, a human breast adenocarcinoma cell-line that express the estrogen receptor α (ER+). AEP exhibited total antioxidant capacity (324. 20 ± 3. 14 mg/g) and strong scavenging activity on DPPH free radical, with maximum effect at 20 μg/mL. AEP and cyclophosphamide (cytotoxic agent) treatment for 24 and 48 h decreased the cell protein content, {{as compared to}} control cells. Morphological analysis, after hematoxylin–eosin staining of cells, showed changes such as cell <b>rounding-up,</b> shrinkage, nuclear condensation and reduction of colony and cell diameter (p< 0. 01), thereby indicating that AEP is cytotoxic to MCF- 7 cells. AEP treatment also induced cell death, with a maximum effect at 5 μg/mL, and its mechanism of action seems to include the induction of apoptosis, as a DNA ladder-pattern was obtained in the DNA analysis. Oxidative stress is supposed {{to play an important}} role in cancer initiation and progression. Considering that AEP showed to be antioxidant and cytotoxic, the extract seems to be a chemopreventive agent and a good candidate for antineoplastic drug development...|$|E
