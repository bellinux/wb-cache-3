25|$|Tramadol has {{inhibitory}} {{actions on}} the 5-HT2C receptor. Antagonism of 5-HT2C could be partially responsible for tramadol's <b>reducing</b> <b>effect</b> on depressive and obsessive–compulsive symptoms in patients with pain and co-morbid neurological illnesses. 5-HT2C blockade may also account for its lowering of the seizure threshold, as 5-HT2C knockout mice display significantly increased vulnerability to epileptic seizures, sometimes resulting in spontaneous death. However, the reduction of seizure threshold {{could be attributed to}} tramadol's putative inhibition of GABAA receptors at high doses (significant inhibition at 100μM). In addition, desmetramadol is a high-affinity ligand of the DOR, and activation of this receptor could be involved in tramadol's ability to provoke seizures in some individuals, as DOR agonists are well-known for inducing seizures.|$|E

The aforementioned 2011 study found that abdominal exercise does not reduce abdominal fat; to achieve that, a deficit in energy expenditure and caloric intake must be created—abdominal exercises alone are not enough to reduce abdominal fat and the girth of the abdomen. Early results from a 2006 study found that walking exercise (not abdominal exercise specifically) reduced the size of subcutaneous abdominal fat cells; cell size predicts type 2 diabetes according to a lead author. Moderate exercise reduced cell size by about 18% in 45 obese women over a 20-week period; diet alone {{did not appear to}} affect cell size.|$|E

40|$|Recent vector {{autoregression}} (VAR) {{studies have}} shown that monetary policy shocks have had a <b>reduced</b> <b>effect</b> on the economy {{since the beginning of the}} 1980 s. This paper investigates the causes of this change. First, we estimate an identified VAR over the pre- and post- 1980 periods, and corroborate the existing results suggesting a stronger systematic response of monetary policy to the economy in the later period. Second, we present and estimate a fully specified model that replicates well the dynamic response of output, inflation, and the federal funds rate to monetary policy shocks in both periods. Using the estimated structural model, we perform counterfactual experiments to quantify the relative importance of changes in monetary policy and changes in the private sector in explaining the <b>reduced</b> <b>effect</b> of monetary policy shocks. The main finding is that changes in the systematic elements of monetary policy are consistent with a more stabilizing monetary policy in the post- 1980 period and largely account for the <b>reduced</b> <b>effect</b> of unexpected exogenous interest rate shocks. Consequently, there is little evidence that monetary policy has become less powerful. Monetary policy; Business cycles; Time-series analysis...|$|R
50|$|In {{experimental}} studies, {{the appetite}} <b>reducing</b> <b>effect</b> of modafinil {{appears to be}} similar to that of substituted amphetamines, but, unlike substituted amphetamines, the dose of modafinil that is effective at decreasing food intake does not significantly increase heart rate.

After three years, his weight stabilized at a 50-pound weight loss (29.59 BMI). The authors conclude that placebo controlled studies should be conducted on using modafinil as a weight loss agent. Conversely, a US patent (#6,455,588) on using modafinil as an appetite stimulating agent has been filed by Cephalon in 2000.|$|E
