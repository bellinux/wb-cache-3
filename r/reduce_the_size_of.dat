The Quebec government also changed the Electoral Act so that voters would need to show a Canadian passport, Quebec drivers' licence or Quebec provincial health care card at the polling station for identification purposes in future elections.|$|E

5|$|The {{pollution}} {{issue is}} a main concern of citizens of Calhoun County, and has attracted demonstrations against industry in Point Comfort. However, Alcoa has worked with state and federal officials, spending $110million to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the superfund site, {{as part of a}} 2005 settlement. Cooperation aims to create 70 additional acres of salt marsh and 11 acres of oyster reef habitat.|$|E

5|$|Many {{bird species}} migrate to take {{advantage}} of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> some of their organs.|$|E
5|$|Members of the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} superspecies excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the entrance hole and seal up cracks with mud. The {{red-breasted nuthatch}} makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside {{and the female}} inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, {{and it has been}} suggested that the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E
5|$|The King Charles Spaniel and {{the other}} types of toy spaniels were {{crossbred}} with the Pug in the early 19th century to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the nose, as was {{the style of the}} day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a flat head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and {{the signing}} of the CFE Treaty gave rise to a {{requirement}} for Germany to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> its armed forces, including the number of combat aircraft. To meet this need, one of the Marinefliegers Tornado wings was disbanded on 1 January 1994; its aircraft replaced the Phantoms of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance wing. The second wing was enlarged and continued in the anti-shipping, reconnaissance and anti-radar roles until it was disbanded in 2005 with its aircraft and duties passed on to the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{role in the}} Pacific War {{declined}} from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> {{the armed forces to}} boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there. In May 1945, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued {{until the end of the}} war. These campaigns contributed little to Japan's defeat and remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|By 1901 {{there were}} so few rubber plants left in the {{concession}} that the Free State authorities granted permission for the villagers to cut down the remaining plants and grind their bark to retrieve the rubber. Once this process was completed the rubber tax was abolished. The Abir company merged with the Société Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management of rubber plantations and the gathering of rubber from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> its operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting rubber {{within the confines of}} its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its oil palm concessions into the Maringa company.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{evacuation}} from Gallipoli, {{the regiment}} was reconstituted on 22 February 1916 when all three squadrons assembled at Heliopolis. Under a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel John Royston– {{a veteran of}} the Boer War who had replaced Abbott after the latter had been sent to England– the regiment began to re-form. At the time of re-forming, it had been intended that the 12th would be assigned to the 5th Division as its divisional light horse regiment; however, it was decided to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> divisional light horse components to a squadron, and the 12th were removed from the 5th Division's order of battle. Although other units, such as part of the 4th and all of the 13th Light Horse Regiment, were sent to Europe to fight on the Western Front, the 12th, along with the bulk of the Australian light horse units, were to remain in the Middle East, where they would take part in the Sinai and Palestine campaign. Initially, the regiment was not brigaded and served as a detached unit.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the force's {{reputation}} {{suffered from}} the controversy and complaints persisted that the force was oversized, excessively funded and staffed by political appointees. By the 1890s, a political consensus had emerged in Ottawa that the western provinces should become autonomous and take up {{responsibility for their own}} policing; it was therefore time to plan for the closure of the force, which originally had only been intended to be a temporary organisation. The force was reduced to 850 men in 1893, and to 750 by 1898. The Conservative government stood for reelection in 1896 with plans to further <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the force, reportedly to 500 men, but lost to the Liberal party, led by Wilfrid Laurier. The new Prime Minister had stood for election on a platform of increasing the rights of the provinces to carry out law enforcement. He produced plans to halve the size of the mounted police as a first step towards eliminating the force, and proposed to establish a new militia regiment in the North-West Territories to fulfil any legacy military requirements.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Holroyd scored {{his first}} goal for Chester {{in a competitive}} match in October 2007, scoring a consolation goal in a 4–2 Football League Trophy defeat at Carlisle United. His first Football League goal followed later in the month in Chester's 2–2 draw with Wycombe Wanderers, scoring from eight yards to restore parity in the match. Holroyd scored his second goal {{of the season in}} a 5–3 defeat at Morecambe, as well as twice in a 3–3 draw at Accrington Stanley. He also made a further two assists towards the latter stages of the 2007–08 campaign in victories against Mansfield Town and Darlington respectively. Holroyd played 26 games in all competitions for Chester during the season, scoring five times. In July 2008, he was transfer-listed by the club in an attempt to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> their squad. A day after being transfer-listed, Holroyd left Chester by mutual agreement with a year remaining on his contract, while being linked with a transfer to other clubs. During his time without a club, Holroyd rejected the option of trialling with A.F.C. Bournemouth.|$|E

5|$|The {{implementation}} of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals {{to qualify for}} refugee status prompted {{some of them to}} opt for the voluntary repatriation programme; between 1,000 and 2,000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR. In the early 1990s, as Vietnam began to experience economic growth, the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia dropped. Joint collaborations between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> its Vietnamese refugee populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong refugee camp in November 1991. 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the voluntary repatriation programme, and Malaysia's refugee populace reduced to 6,000 by 1994. Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass the UNHCR screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants. The majority of them expressed their reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam; demonstrations and rioting broke out when news of the camp's impending closure was announced in 1995. Sungei Besi refugee camp was later closed in June 1996. The last refugees returned to Vietnam in 2005.|$|E
5|$|On 21 November, the {{commander}} of the 9th Division, Major General Leslie Morshead, was informed by General Harold Alexander, {{the commander}}-in-chief of the Middle East Command, that a decision had been made to return the division to Australia. Churchill told the Australian Government on 2 December that while he was prepared to recommend to Roosevelt that the 9th Division be returned, the resultant diversion of shipping would <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the build-up of United States military forces in Britain and North Africa by 30,000 men. In the same cable, Churchill also stated that due to a shortage of shipping the 9th Division's heavy equipment would need to remain in the Middle East. On 3 December Roosevelt again wrote to Curtin to suggest that the 9th Division remain in the Middle East until the final defeat of the Axis forces in North Africa. Roosevelt also informed Curtin that the US Army's 25th Infantry Division would be transferred to Australia during December. Following these messages the Australian Government sought advice from Blamey and MacArthur on whether it was necessary for the 9th Division to return with its heavy equipment, and was informed that the necessary supplies could be sourced from American resources once the unit arrived in Australia.|$|E
