[...] Reflecting these principles, the protocol embodies a major structural revision of the convention the so-called [...] "reverse list" [...] approach. Now, instead of prohibiting the dumping of certain (listed) hazardous materials, the parties are obligated to prohibit the dumping of any waste or other matter that is not listed in Annex 1 ("the reverse list") of the 1996 protocol. Dumping of wastes or other matter on this <b>reverse</b> <b>list</b> requires a permit. Parties to the protocol are further obligated to adopt measures {{to ensure that the}} issuance of permits and permit conditions for the dumping of <b>reverse</b> <b>list</b> substances comply with Annex 2 (the Waste Assessment Annex) of the protocol. The substances on the <b>reverse</b> <b>list</b> include dredged material; sewage sludge; industrial fish processing waste; vessels and offshore platforms or other man-made structures at sea; inert, inorganic geological material; organic material of natural origin; and bulky items including iron, steel, concrete and similar materials for which the concern is physical impact, and limited to those circumstances where such wastes are generated at locations with no land-disposal alternatives. In addition, the 1996 protocol prohibits altogether the practice of incineration at sea, except for emergencies, and prohibits the exports of wastes or other matter to non-Parties for the purpose of dumping or incineration at sea.|$|E

40|$|More {{than thirty}} years ago Rod Burstall showed {{how to do a}} proof of a neat little program, shown in a modern {{notation}} in figure 1 (a) [4]. The program, which was well understood by programmers even before Burstall’s efforts, reverses the order of a straight-line linked list of cells in the heap using only three variables and without moving or copying anything in the heap. An algorithm which does copy cells in order to produce a separate <b>reversed</b> <b>list,</b> is shown in figure 1 (b). A copying algorithm which doesn’t use assignment is shown in figure 1 (c). Each of the algorithms has its advantages and disadvantages: reverse by copying means that you don’t disturb the original list and you have a separate copy to play with, but if you don’t need the original again it’s wasteful of time and space; copying without assignment is even more wasteful because it needs a stack of procedure executions, unless you have a compiler clever enough to recognise that it’s equivalent to the with-assignment version. Copying without assignment was historically the first to have a specification and a proof, then copying with assignment and finally in-place list reversal. The in-place reversal problem influenced early developments in separation logic, by showing us so clearly that separation was important [3]. A proof in separation logic i...|$|R
