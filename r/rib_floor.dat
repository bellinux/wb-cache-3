40|$|A {{variety of}} dynamic failure cases with {{regional}} impact were described at a bump symposium held in 1958. These types of events, while rare, {{are of particular}} interest because their ability to impact a large area has disaster potential. These cases can be grouped into two broad classes of events by mechanism. These are (1) slip along steeply dipping faults and (2) fracturing of strong strata above, or below, the coal seam. Both failure modes produce dynamic or shock loads on the perimeter (roof, <b>rib,</b> <b>floor)</b> of mine openings. Special consideration {{should be given to}} these failure modes in planning of deep coal mines since their occurrence is not within the professional experience of many contemporary workers, and their potential is not evaluated by many of the analysis tools commonly used to evaluate hazards in coal mine plans...|$|E

40|$|It is {{described}} a self-tensioning system constituted by a force multiplying device which, {{attached to the}} supports of {{the ends of the}} structural element, is able to convert the vertical resultant from the gravitatonial actions into an effective tensioning action, through the movement that was induced by a set of rods. The self-tensioning system is able to offer a high performance, thanks to the beneficial effect of the opposite deflection generated by the tensioning, in proportion to the increasing of the gravitational action. This allows to design long-span timber <b>ribbed</b> <b>floors</b> using reduced depths. The complexity of calculation due to the non-linearity of the system can be obviated with the methodology of analysis developed in the article.

As in all the sectors, its usage has reached to further levels in the construction technologies. Beginning from the architectural project, all of the related project and calculations are provided through CAD programmes. While deciding upon which construction system is used in the construction at the stage of project, it is an important subject for construction firms that projects are prepared according to different construction systems and the most appropriate cost is obtained by making quantity survey. Through today’s CAD programmes, analyses were made on the same project according to different construction techniques at short notice and their quantity surveys were made in short durations and through which technique with the most appropriate cost, the construction is decided to be built. In this study, IdeCAD Structural ver 7. 020 that is commonly used in Turkey as CAD programmes was used and a project of an education building was prepared in the system of framework and as normal <b>flooring</b> and also <b>ribbed</b> <b>floor</b> slab and separate Reinforced Concrete (RC) Static projects of the building were prepared according to the available regulations.

40|$|The author {{presents}} the results of measurements of total deformations of the space-grid floor in relation to the torsional strain of beams and the rigidity of beams in bending and torsion while monitoring the erection of the floor of a building. Any space grid system is utterly sensitive to changes in relations between the rigidity of elements. No experimental data covering space grid floors or any method of analysis of their stress-strain state are available. The author performed the assessment of interrelations between the rigidity of some beams in the two directions by means of a full-scale loading test (monitoring) of the monolithic space grid floor, beam size 8. 0 × 9. 2 m. The purpose of the assessment was to confirm the bearing capacity and the design patterns based on deflections and stresses of elements to select the operational reinforcement value. Monolithic concrete was used to perform the load test. As a result, the width of concrete ribs was found uneven. In the design of reinforced concrete space <b>rib</b> <b>floors</b> it is advisable to develop detailed models of structures through the employment of the finite element method due to the significant sensitivity of the system to distribution and redistribution of stresses. Large spans of monolithic space <b>rib</b> <b>floors</b> require the monitoring of the stress-strain state and computer simulations to adjust the design pattern {{on the basis of the}} monitoring results.

Camillo Guerra, head of the municipal engineer from 1928 to 1934, was one of the protagonists of this productive period and the construction of the City Hall, entrusted to him, is particularly emblematic for the choices related to the construction techniques and materials. The result is a building with a complex technological interpretation, where the masonry is integrated with concrete beams, iron, bricks of various types, slab <b>ribbed</b> <b>floor,</b> sometimes with elements in glass block which at the time were considered to be particularly innovative.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the large {{displacement}} behaviour of floor slab systems under extreme loading conditions. The analytical model, presented in the companion paper, is verified through comparisons against existing experimental results on both reinforced concrete and composite slabs, with flat or ribbed profiles. The new model incorporates a novel shell element and accounts for material and geometric nonlinearities under ambient as well as elevated temperatures. The verification studies examine the response of reinforced concrete slabs under unrestrained and restrained edge conditions. An assessment of the behaviour of <b>ribbed</b> <b>floor</b> slabs is also undertaken, in addition to simulation of the structural response of a full-scale composite beam-slab floor system under a realistic compartment fire situation. The results show good correlation between the experimental findings and numerical predictions, and demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the proposed analytical model. Additionally, the studies and discussions presented in this investigation provide an insight into the key behavioural aspects of floor slabs under extreme conditions. In particular, the significance of compressive arching and tensile membrane actions, under various boundary conditions, is illustrated. Also, the importance of adopting a realistic representation of the composite slab geometry is highlighted. The proposed analytical model is of particular relevance to developments in performance-based structural fire design, where realistic assessment of the floor slab response is of paramount importance...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{flexural}} and twisting rigidities of orthotropic plates. Asymmetrically stiffened plates are examples of technically orthotropic plates and are found in civil engineering structures such as bridges and <b>ribbed</b> <b>floor</b> slabs. The formulae for the rigidities as {{found in the literature}} are reviewed. The writer has devised an experimental method of determining the rigidities. This involves a bending test using the Moire technique and a twisting test. In the writer's method only one model is needed to determine all the rigidities. This is compared to other methods for which two or three models are needed. Sixteen different models of asymmetrically stiffened plates with ribs running in one direction only were made. The flexural rigidities of eight of these models and the twisting rigidities of all sixteen models were determined. The objective of the tests was to compare the test values with the theoretical values. More specifically the objective can be defined as follows. a) To determine how well an asymmetrically stiffened plate behaves as an orthotropic plate, i. e. how far apart may the ribs be spaced before the plate becomes a system of plate elements and beam elements. b) To determine the influence, if any, on the rigidities Dx, D₁ and Dy of altering the spacing of the ribs of stiffened plates which have the same theoretical values of Dx. c) To determine whether there is any difference between the rigidities D₁₂ and D₂₁, which are the same for a true orthotropic plate and are usually assumed to be the same for an asymmetrically stiffened plate. Conclusions are drawn on these points...|$|R

40|$|A {{year after}} the 1976 remake of the 1933 King Kong, which ended with the giant ape falling to its death from the newly {{completed}} World Trade Center, the Shaw Brothers released a mandarin version, Xing Xing Wang (translated literally as King Kong) set in 1970 s Hong Kong. In a scene reminiscent of the American Kong, Xing Xing too was shot and fell from the newly completed Jardine House. What is significant in the synchronous occurrences in the two cities, is not simply that both skyscrapers were opened in 1973 and tallest {{in the world and}} in Asia respectively, but how they embodied the internationalization of modern architecture and its ideological entanglement with urban development, economy, culture and media. The multi-story reinforced concrete slab building, having traversed over half a century since Le Corbusier’s dom-ino, is unequivocally the universal architecture of technology par excellence. This realization, which provided Koolhaas the premise for his retroactive manifesto for Manhattan is repeatedly invoked in popular culture. Hong Kong’s 1977 King Kong and NBC’s 1988 Noble House foregrounded the fifty-two story Jardine House as the city’s icon of affluence and power manifest through technology and technological thinking. This paper sets out to map the intersecting contexts and visions that produced the city’s speculative urbanism by examining the films and the technologies of the slab complicit in the narration of modern Hong Kong. From the concrete raft plaza sitting on the marine lot of reclaimed land to the repetitious precast <b>ribbed</b> <b>floor</b> slabs and flexible plan to the circular perforated shear external walls and the building’s claim on various “firsts”, the slab extends its technological rationality into the city through a covered pedestrian bridge; and inaugurated the elevated walkway system in the Central financial district...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} coefficients in {{the cooling}} cavities of turbine airfoils are greatly {{enhanced by the}} presence of discrete ribs on the cavity walls. These ribs introduce two heat transfer enhancing features: a significant increase in heat transfer coefficient by promoting turbulence and mixing, and an increase in heat transfer area. Considerable amount of data are reported in open literature for the heat transfer coefficients both on the rib surface and on the floor area between the ribs. Many airfoil cooling design software tools, however, require an overall average heat transfer coefficient on a rib-roughened wall. Dealing with a complex flow circuit in conjunction with 180 ∘ bends, numerous film holes, trailing-edge slots, tip bleeds, crossover impingement, and a conjugate heat transfer problem; these tools are not often able to handle the geometric details of the rib-roughened surfaces or local variations in heat transfer coefficient on a rib-roughened wall. On the other hand, assigning an overall area-weighted average heat transfer coefficient based on the <b>rib</b> and <b>floor</b> area and their corresponding heat transfer coefficients will have the inherent error of assuming a 100 % fin efficiency for the ribs, that is, assuming that rib surface temperature {{is the same as the}} rib base temperature. Depending on the rib geometry, this error could produce an overestimation of up to 10 % in the evaluated rib-roughened wall heat transfer coefficient. In this paper, a correction factor is developed that can be applied to the overall area-weighted average heat transfer coefficient that, when applied to the projected rib-roughened cooling cavity walls, the net heat removal from the airfoil is the same as that of the rib-roughened wall. To develop this correction factor, the experimental results of heat transfer coefficients on the rib and on the surface area between the ribs are combined with about 400 numerical conduction models to determine an overall equivalent heat transfer coefficient that can be used in airfoil cooling design software. A well-known group method of data handling (GMDH) scheme was then utilized to develop a correlation that encompasses most pertinent parameters including the rib geometry, rib fin efficiency, and the <b>rib</b> and <b>floor</b> heat transfer coefficients...|$|R

40|$|Historically, the Crinum mine has {{experienced}} significant falls of ground when longwall production slowed down {{in preparation for}} recovery in weak roof areas. These conditions continue through the recovery process and result in both safety concerns and delays. When mine plans and exploration revealed {{that most of the}} future longwall recoveries were located in weak roof areas, a decision was made to try pre driven recovery roads as a solution to the problem. After completing eight pre-driven recovery roads with varying degrees of success and numerous lessons, Crinum North Mine now utilises a modified Pre-driven Recovery Roadway (PDRR) to improve the longwall take off process in weak roof areas. During mine development a standard roadway is driven where the final recovery location of each longwall is planned.

40|$|Steel angles are {{extensively}} used {{to connect}} concrete floor/roof elements to the supporting beam in typical dry-assembled precast frame structures widely diffused in Europe {{and other parts}} of the world. These connections allow for relative rotation of the floor element in its vertical plane and restrains their relative displacement, avoiding possible loss of support and consequent fall of the floor element when the structure is subjected to lateral load. The diaphragm behaviour of the precast decks relies on these floor-to-beam connections. Their post-addition to unconnected floor-to-beam joints of existing buildings is a typical seismic retrofit intervention. All these applications are often made without an adequate information about the main structural parameters of the connections, due to lack of experimental or theoretical knowledge.

40|$|In This Chapter [Methane {{ignition}} as initiation {{source for}} much larger secondary coal dust explosions Rock dusting requirements to prevent coal dust explosions Dangers of hybrid mixtures of methane and coal dust] Although methane explosions are dangerous, those that involve coal dust {{are even more}} so. If exploding methane disperses and ignites the coal dust that has accumulated on the mine <b>ribs</b> and <b>floor,</b> the burning coal dust immeasurably increases {{the strength of the}} explosion. Such methane-dust explosions are prevented by inerting the coal dust in a way that prevents the exploding methane from igniting it. This chapter discusses the dust hazard and how it is pre-vented in U. S. coal mines. METHANE IGNITION AS INITIATION SOURCE FOR MUCH LARGER SECONDARY COAL DUST EXPLOSIONS The typical scenario for coal mine explosions starts with the ignition of a flammable methane-air atmosphere near the face. The turbulent winds from the primary methane explosion then disperse the coal dust. If there is insufficient rock dust (usually limestone), a secondary coal dust explosion then propagates throughout large sections of the mine. These scenarios have been studied extensively at the Bruceton Experimental Mine (BEM) and the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM) of the NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory. The minimum quantity of methane required to initiate a coal dust explosion was studied in 1930 in the BEM [Rice et al. 1933; Nagy 1981] and then later in the LLEM, whose cross-sectional area (130 ft 2) is over twice that of the BEM [Sapko et al. 1987 a]. Studies conducted in the BEM closely simulated conditions that existed in operating mines in the early 20 th century. The later tests in the 20 -ft-wide entries of the LLEM simulated the geometries of modern mines with advanced roof support technology. The data from the BEM tests show that 13 ft 3 was the minimum quantity of methane at the face that, when ignited, would disperse and ignite coal dust. In the BEM, this amount of methane was mixed with air to form a total flammable volume of about 140 ft 3 of a 9 % methane-in-air mix-ture. In the wider entries of the LLEM, about 37 ft 3 of methane was required to disperse pure coal dust and start a self-sustained coal dust explosion. This amount of methane was mixed wit...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the problem of the {{identification}} of the optimum rib thickness in <b>ribbed</b> R/C <b>floors</b> without shear reinforcements, particularly in those floors that are made by using prefabricated or partly precast elements and industrially produced temporary or permanent shutterings. The rib thickness is an important factor both of the floor weight and of its cost, as the ribbed section makes R/C floors lighter by removing a part of the cracked concrete below the neutral axis. Unfortunately, due to the mass production, in this case the rib thickness is chosen by the manufacturer instead of the R/C floor designer, so that the choice of the rib geometry should be made by the manufacturer by optimizing it. In fact {{it is not possible to}} make R/C floors too much lighter by exceedingly reducing the rib thickness because, close to the floor ends, the moment of resistance and the shear resistance would become too low. In this way, being the ribbed section stopped off close to the floor ends to increase the moment of resistance and the shear resistance, the floor would become heavier at its ends with a solid cross-section so that, due to an eventually too much reduced rib thickness, this heavier part would become too long and the concrete volume removed in the lighter ribbed part of the floor would be recovered in the heavier part at the floor ends. Consequently, the problem is whether it is better to make R/C <b>floors</b> with thicker <b>ribs</b> to reduce the heavier part of the floor at its ends, or to make the floor lighter in the span with thinner ribs but having a long heavier part at the floor ends. Therefore, by using nonlinear programming, we make an analysis at the ultimate limit state to find out the best way to make R/C floors lighter and with thin ribs. Depending on the type of R/C floors, this approach can be used by the designers as well as by the manufacturers which make permanent or removable moulds, partly prefabricated ribs, burnt clay or concrete hollow blocks, partly precast floor panels and, anyway, every industrialised product for R/C floor construction related to the rib thickness; this allows the industry to choose the size of its industrialized products that will determine the rib thickness in a great number of R/C floors...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{rock dusting}} {{practices}} {{have proven to}} be an effective means of preventing coal dust explosions. Rock dust (generally pulverized limestone dust) serves as a heat sink material that prevents or suppresses a propagating coal dust explosion through the absorption of thermal energy from the heated gases and absorption of radiant energy, which reduces the preheating of unburned coal particles ahead of the flame front. Therefore to effectively suppress a coal dust explosion, sufficient quantities of dispersible rock dust must be entrained into the mine entry by the expanding explosion pressure wave to inert the coal dust, also entrained in the entry. The in-mine application of rock dust dates back to the early 1900 s. Since that time, significant technological improvements to rock dust application methods have been implemented along with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and inspections to ensure adequate quantities of rock dust are applied to the roof, <b>ribs,</b> and <b>floor</b> throughout the mine. Even with enhancements to the rock dusting application methods and equipment, coal mining operations still experience compliance issues associated with meeting the current total incombustible content (TIC) requirement of at least 80 % for all mine dust samples. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted general surveys of rock dusting practices at nine underground coal mining operations and met with Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) mine inspectors and District personnel {{to gain a better understanding}} of the rock dusting practices and associated compliance issues during this survey period. These surveys included obtaining the following from each of the nine mines: 1. Mine dust samples to assess the incombustible content (IC) for determining any rock dust deficient areas common to all nine mines, 2. Information and issues related to rock dusting, and 3. Rock dusting sampling practices. This report discusses research that was conducted in the NIOSH laboratories, experimental mine, and in operating mines to evaluate the potential explosion hazard associated with excessive coal dust accumulating on elevated surfaces, the efficacy of wet rock dusting, and the need for mines to develop comprehensive rock dusting programs. Taken as a whole, this report provides proactive approaches to current rock dusting practices that will improve the application of rock dust in all underground areas of a coal mine.

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, {{cooperated with}} Tecrete Industries Pty. Ltd. and BHP Australia Coal in a {{research}} program to evaluate the strength characteristics and air leakage of four seal and two stopping designs for use in underground coal mines. A fundamental safety research area for NIOSH is to eliminate the occurrence of coal mine explosions or to mitigate their effects. One approach {{to achieve this goal}} is to develop new and innovative seal designs that provide increased explosion isolation protection for the mining personnel against ignitions that originate from within the gob or other worked-out areas of the mine. Full-scale seals and stoppings were constructed in the Experimental Mine at Lake Lynn Laboratory near Fairchance, Fayette County, PA. They were air-leakage tested, then subjected to a series of explosions with average pressure pulses ranging from 25 to 500 kPa (3. 5 to 72 psi). Instrumentation measured seal displacement and acceleration as a function of time, providing data to assist in the development of numerical models for future seal design. All three seals designed with Meshblock wire formwork and a monolithic shotcrete core withstood the first explosion test, which generated an average maximum pressure of - 140 kPa (- 20 psi) while maintaining acceptable air leakage rates. These seals ranged from 175 to 325 mm thick. They included a 2. 7 -m-high by 325 -mm-thick seal that was tested 27 hr after completion against this - 140 -kPa explosion pressure, a special requirement of the test program. This seal survived explosions with pressure pulses up to 300 kPa (43 psi). The 2. 3 -m-high by 325 -mm-thick Meshblock seal survived three explosion tests with overpressures up to 455 kPa (66 psi) and satisfied the air leakage criteria. A 1, 200 -mm-thick plug seal was constructed of two Gunmesh formwork walls in-filled with shotcrete and a 3, 450 -kPa (500 -psi) strength Aquablend core. This plug seal survived three explosions with pressure pulses ranging from 150 to 430 kPa (- 22 to 62. 5 psi) with no measurable post explosion air leakage. Two Gunmesh stoppings with thicknesses of 40 and 75 mm withstood explosion overpressures of 23 and 115 kPa, respectively. Anchoring all seal and stopping designs into the roof, <b>ribs,</b> and <b>floor</b> with steel "roofbolts" provided very effective boundary constraint that is critical to the performance of structures subject to explosion overpressures.
