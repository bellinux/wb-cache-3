5|$|Indonesia held {{legislative}} {{elections on}} 5 April 2004 for {{both houses of}} the People's Consultative Assembly, the country's national legislature. This included all 550 seats in the People's <b>Representative</b> <b>Council</b> and 128 seats of the new Regional <b>Representative</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E
5|$|During its 2002 annual session, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) added 14 {{amendments}} to the Constitution of Indonesia. Included in these amendments were measures to reorganize the legislature. Beginning in 2004, the MPR was composed of the existing People's <b>Representative</b> <b>Council</b> (DPR) and a new Regional <b>Representative</b> <b>Council</b> (DPD). Because all {{the seats in the}} MPR were directly elected, this called for removal of the military from the legislature, whose 38 seats in the Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment for direct election of the President and Vice President were major steps for Indonesia on the road towards a full democracy.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the final}} {{allocation}} of seats in the People's <b>Representative</b> <b>Council,</b> Golkar, the Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle, the National Awakening Party, the United Development Party, the Democratic Party, the Prosperous Justice Party, and the National Mandate Party were qualified to submit candidates for the country's first direct presidential election later in the year.|$|E

Ginandjar Kartasasmita was elected the inaugural chairman of the DPD with 72 of 128 votes in a run-off against Irman Gusman on 1 October. The following day, Agung Laksono of Golkar was elected Speaker of the DPR by a vote of 280 to 257. The Chairman of the MPR was not elected until several days later, when Hidayat Nur Wahid of the PKS won the vote 326 to 324 against PDI–P's Sutjipto.|$|E

Christianity-based Prosperous Peace Party (PDS) received 14.8 percent of votes in Christian-dominant North Sulawesi and 13 seats overall in the People's <b>Representative</b> <b>Council.</b> Likewise, Muslims were more likely to vote for the PKS in regions where religious conflict has been historically prevalent.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} results determined which political parties were eligible to submit candidates for Indonesia's first direct presidential election, {{which was held}} on 5 July. Only parties that received {{five percent of the}} popular vote or three percent of seats in the People's <b>Representative</b> <b>Council</b> could submit candidates.

5|$|A {{total of}} 273 {{disputes}} were {{brought before the}} Constitutional Court, the last of which were decided on 21 June.

5|$|Gordimer's {{homage to}} Fischer extends to using {{excerpts}} from his writings and public {{statements in the}} book. Lionel Burger's treason trial speech from the dock is taken from the speech Fischer gave at his own trial in 1966. Fischer {{was the leader of}} the banned SACP who was given a life sentence for furthering the aims of communism and conspiracy to overthrow the government. Quoting people like Fischer was not permitted in South Africa. All Gordimer's quotes from banned sources in Burger's Daughter are unattributed, and also include writings of Joe Slovo, a member of the SACP and the outlawed ANC, and a pamphlet written and distributed by the Soweto Students <b>Representative</b> <b>Council</b> during the Soweto uprising.|$|E
5|$|Results {{showed that}} Golkar, the former ruling {{party of the}} New Order era led by People's <b>Representative</b> <b>Council</b> Speaker Akbar Tanjung, had won {{the largest number of}} seats, {{defeating}} President Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI–P). Golkar received more votes than other parties in twenty-six out of thirty-two provinces. However, these results occurred because of declining PDI–P popularity rather than an increase in Golkar's popularity. Golkar's support in its traditional stronghold of Sulawesi declined due to the performance of medium and small parties in the region. Despite winning the largest share of vote once again in Bali, PDI–P performance there suffered the greatest after the 2002 bombings by terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah devastated the island province's economy.|$|E

5|$|The {{counting}} {{of votes}} took one month, {{and the final}} results were announced on 5 May, one week later than was initially scheduled. Of 148,000,369 registered voters, 124,420,339 ballots (84.06 percent) were submitted. Of these ballots, 113,462,414 were considered valid, and 10,957,925 were declared invalid. In the People's <b>Representative</b> <b>Council,</b> the Party of the Functional Groups (Golkar) received the most number of seats. It had previously lost to the Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle in the 1999 legislative election after being in power since 1970.

5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People's <b>Representative</b> <b>Council,</b> while eight received none. The inconsistency {{in the order of}} parties according to votes received and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven population distribution between Java and other islands. This rule stipulates that the Hare quota values for the provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) received more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but received nearly the same amount of seats. More than half of PKB seats were received in the party's stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four of PAN seats were automatically secured.|$|E

He had been brought up in an anti-apartheid atmosphere; although his parents were not activists, they were opposed to racial discrimination and this was to have a profound influence on his later career. Like many other South African Jews, he chose to become conspicuously active in public life in an effort to oppose or alleviate the worst aspects of apartheid. While he was chairman of {{the university}}'s Students' <b>Representative</b> <b>Council,</b> he campaigned against the exclusion of black students. He also attracted attention from the state security police by having contact with anti-apartheid groups within South Africa, including the African National Congress, which was a banned organisation at the time. On one occasion he secretly tape-recorded a spy sent by the police to infiltrate the anti-apartheid student movement at the university. The recording was later used as evidence in the firing of the national police commissioner.|$|E

5|$|With Jock in {{increasingly}} {{poor health}} after the war, the Smith family briefly considered sending Ian {{to start a}} life in the United States {{with the help of}} Jock's brother Elijah, who had become a prosperous New York businessman. Smith showed little interest in leaving Rhodesia, however, and decided that he would finish at university, then come home and buy his own farm. He returned to Rhodesia in early-1946 to find the campus swamped with veterans like himself—there were 400 of them out of barely 1,000 students. Smith became spokesman for the university's ex-servicemen, senior student of his hall and Chairman of the students' <b>representative</b> <b>council.</b> He turned down the presidency of the rowing club, saying it would be one administrative commitment too many, but agreed to coach the crew. Training the rowers under strict military-style discipline, he led them to victory at the 1946 South African Inter-Varsity Boat Race at the Vaal Dam south of Johannesburg, upstaging the well-fancied Wits crew, and subsequently received national-standard varsity honours for rowing, the first Rhodes student ever to do so. At the end of the year, having passed the exams to gain his commerce degree ("by some miracle", he recalled), he returned to Southern Rhodesia to study farming at Gwebi Agricultural College, near Salisbury.|$|E

Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending his own kinsman, K. D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to come. He took up ballroom dancing, performed in a drama society play about Abraham Lincoln, and gave Bible classes in the local community {{as part of the}} Student Christian Association. Although he had friends connected to the African National Congress (ANC) who wanted South Africa to be independent of the British Empire, Mandela avoided any involvement with the anti-imperialist movement, and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort when the Second World War broke out. He helped to found a first-year students' house committee which challenged the dominance of the second-years, {{and at the end of}} his first year became involved in a Students' <b>Representative</b> <b>Council</b> (SRC) boycott against the quality of food, for which he was suspended from the university; he never returned to complete his degree.|$|E
