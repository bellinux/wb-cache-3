500|$|Rotblat campaigned ceaselessly against nuclear weapons. In an {{interview}} {{shortly before the}} 2004 U.S. presidential election, he expressed his belief that the Russell-Einstein Manifesto still had [...] "great relevance today, after 50 years, particularly {{in connection with the}} election of a president in the United States", and above all, with respect to the potential pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons. Central to his view of the world were the words of the Russell-Einstein Manifesto with which he concluded his acceptance lecture for the Nobel Prize in 1995: [...] "Above all, <b>remember</b> <b>your</b> humanity". He also served as editor-in-chief of the journal Physics in Medicine and Biology from 1960 to 1972. He was the president of several institutions and professional associations and also a co-founder and member of the governing board of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, [...] as well {{as a member of the}} Advisory Committee on Medical Research of the World Health Organization.|$|E

2500|$|Noting {{that his}} own [...] "small people of 12 million inhabitants, without arms, without resources" [...] could never {{withstand}} an attack by a large power such as Italy, with its 42million people and [...] "unlimited quantities of the most death-dealing weapons", he contended that all small states were threatened by the aggression, and that all small states were in effect reduced to vassal states {{in the absence of}} collective action. He admonished the League that [...] "God and history will <b>remember</b> <b>your</b> judgment." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the eve of}} {{the visit}} to India of Edwin Samuel Montagu, Secretary of State for India in the British Cabinet, {{information}} came that the Government did not want to discuss with the Minister the fate of those accused of any implication in the Hindu–German Conspiracy. Immediately, the Jugantar group, then led by Jibanlal Chatterjee, published its declaration in December 1917: [...] "But first and last spread the terror. Make this unholy Government impossible. Hide like invisible shadows of doom and rain death upon the alien bureaucracy. <b>Remember</b> <b>your</b> brothers who are perishing in Jails and rotting in swamps. Remember those who have died or have gone mad. Remember, watch and work." [...] Protesting against the imprisonment of such a number of people without habeas corpus and against the physical and moral torture meted inside the prisons, an eight-page long appeal was written by Jiten Lahiri and Bhupendra Kumar Datta; it was sent to forty-two important personalities to inform the countrymen about the decision of a hunger strike taken by the political prisoners all over India. Transferred to Bilaspur Jail, Bhupen [...] "continued his hunger strike for seventy-eight days, till then the longest ever period of hunger strike in any country.".|$|E
2500|$|Woolf {{was often}} bothered {{by what she}} viewed as Sackville-West's promiscuity, {{charging}} that Sackville-West's need for sex led her to take up with anyone who struck her fancy. [...] Sackville-West had a stronger desire for sex and a greater willingness {{to talk about her}} desires than did Woolf, which caused tensions, though Woolf wrote to Sackville-West in 1928 that [...] "The sound of your loud balmy voice coming across the marshes last night...stirred the embers of my desire". When Nicolson was stationed at the British Embassy in Berlin, Sackville-West followed him to Berlin, which was considered a more livable city for a British woman than Tehran. When Woolf went to Berlin to see Sackville-West, she became seriously ill which led Sackville-West to tell her: [...] "Do you know what I believe it was, apart from the flu? It was SUPPRESSED RANDINESS. So there-you <b>remember</b> <b>your</b> admissions as the searchlight went around and around?" [...] In her 1929 novel A Room Of One's Own, Woolf attacks patriarchal inheritance laws, which was meant to be an implicit criticism of Sackville-West, who keenly resented that she did not inherit Knole, but never questioned the leading social position of the aristocracy to which she belonged, much to Woolf's annoyance, who felt that Sackville-West was unable to critique the system she was both a part of and to a certain extent a victim of.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to <b>remember</b> <b>your</b> past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
