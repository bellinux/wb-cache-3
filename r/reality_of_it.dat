Critics noted that the album was darker and more keyboard-focused than the band's debut. , an EP featuring remixes of three tracks from Free, {{was released}} on October 24, 2006. The band were keen to tour in support of Free, but no live shows materialised. [...] "The <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is in order to [...] the way we would like... and present it the way {{we would want to}} present it... would cost too much money for the kind of fan base that we have right now," [...] Matheos said in 2009. In 2010 he anticipated that OSI will [...] "remain a studio band." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, it was {{announced}} that Stenson had decided to quit the serial to pursue a career in musical theatre. She deemed it [...] "one of the most difficult decisions [...] ever made", stating that Hollyoaks had been her [...] "dream job" [...] and that she would miss her friends in the cast and crew. She made the decision to resign around June 2009, but was convinced by then-producer Lucy Allan to play out a long exit storyline, which concluded filming in September 2010. Before filming her final scenes, Stenson secured her first West End role. Though she had previously felt ready to leave the series, when the time came, she was upset because she felt the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> She called her final scenes [...] "really sad and emotional", and stated that while she had not had any input in Steph's exit, she was happy with it.|$|E

2500|$|The wasted {{resources}} and on-going problems surrounding {{the failure of}} the project were a huge distraction for the police. When it was about to be scrapped, Police Association president Greg O'Connor said [...] "The <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is that the sooner ... the huge distraction that is Incis is gone, the better." [...] Funding wasted on INCIS subsequently led to budget cuts in other areas so that infrastructure such as cars and communications centres were poorly resourced.|$|E
2500|$|This apprenticeship... {{became a}} part of [...] how things were recorded. I started to learn {{microphone}} placements and things like that, what did and what didn't work. I certainly knew what did and didn't work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. The <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a live room... And so bit by bit I was learning really how not to record.|$|E

60|$|Bidwell {{was ruled}} by her clear and {{sensible}} words, and rode {{away into the}} clear dark of the summer's night with a feeling {{that it was all}} a dream--a vision such as he had often had while prospecting in the mountains; but, as day came on and he looked back upon the red hole he had made in the green hillside, the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all came to pinch his heart and make him gasp. His storehouse, his well of golden waters, was unguarded, and open to the view of any one who should chance to look that way. He beat his old mule to a gallop in the frenzy of the moment.|$|E
60|$|Karl Albert, {{now at the}} top-gallant of his hopes: homaged Archduke of Upper Austria, homaged King of Bohemia, {{declared}} Kaiser of the German Nation,--is the highest-titled mortal going: and, poor soul, it is tragical, once more, {{to think}} what the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was for him. Ejection from house and home; into difficulty, poverty, despair; life in furnished lodgings, which he could not pay;--and at last heart-break, no refuge for him but in the grave. All which is mercifully hidden at present; so {{that he seems to}} himself a man at the top-gallant of his wishes; and lives pleasantly, among his friends, with a halo round his head to his own foolish sense and theirs.|$|E
60|$|The {{object of}} {{publishing}} these letters is, therefore, {{to give to}} those who are true-hearted and honest the same agreeable picture of life and manners which met the writer's own, eyes. She had in view a wide circle of friends throughout her own country, between whose hearts and her own there has been an acquaintance and sympathy of years, and who, loving excellence, and feeling the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in themselves, are sincerely pleased to have their sphere of hopefulness and charity enlarged. For such this is written; and if those who are not such begin to read, let them treat the book as a letter not addressed to them, which, having opened by mistake, they close and pass to the true owner.|$|E
25|$|In his {{analysis}} of the new art movement, Apollinaire makes a distinction between four different types of Cubism; scientific, physical, orphic and instinctive. The first, Scientific Cubism, is the art of painting new ensembles with elements borrowed not from the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> vision, but from the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. <b>It</b> is the tendency of 'pure' painting. The painters Apollinaire places in this category are: Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin and Gris.|$|R

6000|$|This {{made new}} {{difficulty}} for Ptolemy's friends. They attempted, at first, to evade this inspired injunction by denying the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> There {{was no such}} passage to be found, they said. It was all an invention of their enemies. This point {{seems to have been}} overruled, and then they attempted to give the passage some other than the obvious interpretation. Finally they maintained that, although it prohibited their furnishing Ptolemy himself with troops, it did not forbid their sending an armed force into Egypt under leaders of their own. That they could certainly do; and then, when the rebellion was suppressed, and Berenice's government overthrown, they could invite Ptolemy to return to his kingdom and resume his crown in a peaceful manner. This, they alleged, would not be [...] "furnishing him with troops," [...] and, of course would not be disobeying the oracle.|$|E
6000|$|This enthusiasm, this stern {{thirst for}} adventure, wilted under the sultry August sun {{and did not}} last above one hour. One poor little hour--and then we were ashamed that we had [...] "gushed" [...] so. The poetry was all in the anticipation--there is none in the reality. Imagine a vast, waveless ocean {{stricken}} dead and turned to ashes; imagine this solemn waste tufted with ash-dusted sage-bushes; imagine the lifeless silence and solitude that belong to such a place; imagine a coach, creeping like a bug through {{the midst of this}} shoreless level, and sending up tumbled volumes of dust {{as if it were a}} bug that went by steam; imagine this aching monotony of toiling and plowing kept up hour after hour, and the shore still as far away as ever, apparently; imagine team, driver, coach and passengers so deeply coated with ashes that they are all one colorless color; imagine ash-drifts roosting above moustaches and eyebrows like snow accumulations on boughs and bushes.

She knew that he knew it, and yet he had endeavoured to {{eradicate}} all show of anger from his face, as all <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> from his heart. He was sure,--was sure,--that the story was an infamous falsehood! His wife, his chosen one, his Cecilia to have been engaged, a year ago, to such a one as Sir Francis Geraldine,--to so base, so mean a creature,--and then to have married him without telling {{a word of it}} all! To have kept him wilfully, carefully, in the dark, with studied premeditation so as to be sure of effecting her own marriage before he should learn it, and that too when he had told her everything as to himself! It certainly could not be, and was not true! ...|$|E

60|$|He used to {{tell his}} story to every {{stranger}} that arrived at Mr. Doolittle's hotel. He was observed, at first, to vary on some points every time he told it, which was, doubtless, owing to his having so recently awaked. It at last settled down precisely to the tale I have related, and not a man, woman, or child in the neighborhood, but knew it by heart. Some always pretended to doubt the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and insisted that Rip had been out of his head, and that this was one point on which he always remained flighty. The old Dutch inhabitants, however, almost universally gave it full credit. Even to this day, they never hear a thunder-storm of a summer afternoon about the Kaatskill, but they say Hendrick Hudson and his crew are at their game of ninepins; and it is a common wish of all henpecked husbands in the neighborhood, when life hangs heavy on their hands, that they might have a quieting draught out of Rip Van Winkle's flagon.|$|E
60|$|And so it went, verses new and old, verses without end, all in {{glorification of}} the {{succulent}} shellfish of Carmel. Saxon's enjoyment was keen, almost ecstatic, {{and she had}} difficulty in convincing herself of the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all. It seemed like some fairy tale or book story come true. Again, it seemed more like a stage, and these the actors, she and Billy having blundered into the scene in some incomprehensible way. Much of wit she sensed which she did not understand. Much she did understand. And she was aware that brains were playing as {{she had never seen}} brains play before. The puritan streak in her training was astonished and shocked by some of the broadness; but she refused to sit in judgment. They SEEMED good, these light-hearted young people; they certainly were not rough or gross as were many of the crowds she had been with on Sunday picnics.

6000|$|But no visions {{have been}} recorded. It {{is true that}} certain stories of alleged visions have been {{circulated}} {{during the last few}} years. One, very pretty and touching, is of a child from the London slums who saw things invisible to others. This was one of the children of the very poor, who are taken in summer and planted all about England in cottages to have a week or a fortnight of country air and sunshine. Taken to Stonehenge, she had a vision of a great gathering of people, and so real did they seem that she believed in the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all, and so beautiful did they appear to her that she was reluctant to leave, and begged to be taken back to see it all again. Unfortunately it is not true. A full and careful inquiry has been made into the story, of which there are several versions, and its origin traced to a little story-telling Wiltshire boy who had read or heard of the white-robed priests of the ancient days at [...] "The Stones," [...] and who just to astonish other little boys naughtily pretended that he had seen it all himself! ...|$|E
