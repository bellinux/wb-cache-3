25|$|Although the {{equivalence}} principle guided {{the development of}} general relativity, {{it is not a}} founding principle of relativity but rather a simple consequence of the geometrical nature of the theory. In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow geodesics of spacetime, and what we perceive as the force of gravity is instead a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> being unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the mechanical resistance of matter prevents us from doing so.|$|E
25|$|Wright however {{does not}} hold the view that good works {{contribute}} to one's salvation but rather that the final judgement is something we {{can look forward to}} as a future vindication of God's present declaration of our righteousness. In other words, our works are a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> salvation and the future judgement will show that. Others tend to place a higher value on the importance of good works than the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives do, taking the view that they causally contribute to the salvation of the individual.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} {{issue is the}} extent to which human behaviours resemble animal communication, or whether all such communication has disappeared as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> linguistic capacity. Some of our bodily features—eyebrows, beards and moustaches, deep adult male voices, perhaps female breasts—strongly resemble adaptations to producing signals. Ethologists such as Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt have argued that facial gestures such as smiling, grimacing, and the eyebrow flash on greeting are universal human communicative signals that can be related to corresponding signals in other primates. Given how recently spoken language has emerged, it is very likely that human body language does include some more or less involuntary responses that have a similar origin to the communication we have.|$|E

30|$|<b>Results</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> {{experiment}} can {{be divided}} into the following groups.|$|R
25|$|At {{least some}} of our {{behaviour}} must be influenced by our genes because behaviour depends on the interaction of molecules and neurons in the brain. These interactions are a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> genes code, however the influence on behaviour cannot go much further than this. Dawkins likened genes to a computer. They have been pre-programmed to build cells, develop cells and make them work together. Like a computer, the hardware is set in stone, but the software can change how they work, just like our environment. Genes indirectly influence our behaviour as the nervous system and our brain is the intermediary in the transaction decision because it reasons and processes all of the gene instructions into one decision, movement or behaviour. The way our neurons connect {{is dependent on the}} environment, learning and experience. This introduces the nurture side of the nature nurture debate.|$|E
25|$|Both ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{put forward a}} new {{conceptualization}} of the self. Some ecofeminists, such as Marti Kheel, argue that self-realization and identification with all nature places {{too much emphasis on}} the whole, {{at the expense of the}} independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of androcentrism rather than anthropocentrism. To others, like Karen J. Warren, the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract individualism and embraces the interconnectedness of the living world; relationships, including our relationship with non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what it means to be human. Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as racism or speciesism, are all forms of discrimination and are no different from sexism. Thus, anthropocentrism is simply another form of discrimination as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> flawed value structure and should be abolished.|$|E

500|$|In his 1959 autobiography, Groucho and Me, Groucho comments, [...] "We {{thought we}} were doing pretty well as comic lawyers, but one day a few Middle East {{countries}} decided they wanted a bigger cut of the oil profits, or else. When this news broke, {{the price of gasoline}} nervously dropped two cents a gallon, and Chico and I, along with the other shows, were dropped from the network." [...] In his 1976 book, The Secret Word Is Groucho, he writes, [...] "Company sales, as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> show, had risen precipitously. Profits doubled in that brief time, and Esso felt guilty taking the money. So Esso dropped us after twenty-six weeks. Those were the days of guilt-edged securities, which don't exist today." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hannah Banana" [...] {{was written}} by series regular Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and {{directed}} by John Holmquist, before {{the conclusion of the}} eighth production season. Commenting on the original development of the episode, series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane stated, [...] " [...] was the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> ongoing desire to let the series stagnate, and kind of evolve things that may have run their course. There's only so many times you can do the Evil Monkey jumping out of that closet, before the joke gets old, and I think often times there's a fear to mess with what works, and change things permanently. [...] We literally retired the Evil Monkey in this episode, and got a great episode out of it, which was worth it, and kind of evolved the series in a way." [...] Singer and actress Candace Marie provided the voice of Miley Cyrus. Marie received the role when her producer alerted her of the audition, and she eventually received a call from the Family Guy casting director a month later. Even though the episode mocked Cyrus, Marie did not think she would upset any of Cyrus' fans. She added that she is a fan herself, and [...] "was very impressed by the way Family Guy developed the episode," [...] and thought it was [...] "a huge compliment for them to refer to Miley as the [...] "perfect popstar."" [...] After voicing Cyrus, Marie was called back to Family Guy to voice Meg's friend Beth for [...] "several upcoming episodes." [...] Marie described Beth as a girl that is [...] "rarely addressed in conversation but loves to chime in whenever she can." [...] The song in the episode sung by Cyrus {{was written by}} Chevapravatdumrong, and composed and performed by Family Guy composer Walter Murphy.|$|E

[...] Speaking about the experience in 2008, Albarn stated:I {{think in this case}} the only reason we went to war was the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> individual apathy in the end. You know, our inability to really express what was I think was a consensus that this was a terrifying idea and a very badly thought-out one.|$|E

Morgan did not turn up at the press conference, but threatened to sue the skeptics for defamation through her lawyers instead. Nevertheless, the MSS {{decided to make the}} Halloween Challenge an annual event and invited any psychic in the UK to take part. When two psychics failed an experiment in October 2012, Marshall remarked: [...] "While the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> experiment doesn't disprove psychic ability, the fact that our mediums couldn't pass what they felt was a very fair and simple test does seem to suggest claims that these abilities exist aren't based in reality." [...] At the Australian Skeptics National Convention 2014 in Sydney, Marsh lectured about pseudoscience and the channeling of spirits.|$|E
2500|$|The IBM {{archives}} of Frequently Asked Questions notes an inquiry {{about whether he}} said in the 1950s that he foresaw a market potential for only five electronic computers. The document says no, but quotes his son and then IBM President Thomas J. Watson, Jr., at the annual IBM stockholders meeting, April 28, 1953, as speaking about the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which it identifies as [...] "the company's first production computer designed for scientific calculations". He said that [...] "IBM had developed a paper plan for such a machine and took this paper plan across the country to some 20 concerns that we thought could use such a machine. I would like {{to tell you that the}} machine rents for between $12,000 and $18,000 a month, so it was not the type of thing that could be sold from place to place. But, as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> trip, on which we expected to get orders for five machines, we came home with orders for 18." [...] Watson, Jr., later gave a slightly different version of the story in his autobiography, where he said the initial market sampling indicated 11 firm takers and 10 more prospective orders.|$|E
2500|$|Common to {{the trilogy}} was a {{somewhat}} morbid {{look at the}} history of the Russian monarchy of the previous three centuries, where, as the author saw it, all the efficient rulers happened to be evil, and all the 'good' ones proved to be inefficient. The three stories of three different historical figures had similarly didactic finales: [...] "God help you, Tsar Ivan, and God forgive us all! That's the fate autocracy deserved! Here's the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> disintegration!" [...] (Zakharyin's words over Ivan the Terrible's dead body), [...] "I am to blame for all of this... Oh God, why did you make me Tsar?!" [...] (Tsar Fyodor), [...] "What Evil spawns is only more evil and nothing else." [...] (Boris Godunov). All three parts of the trilogy, which, according to Nestor Kotlyarevsky, were [...] "united by the idea of tragedy being intrinsic to Tsarist power in Russia," [...] had serious problems with the censorship. The trilogy continued to divide opinion in Russia up until 1917. Not long before the Revolution, in Alexandrinsky Theatre the public reacted to Tsar Boris in an overtly political fashion. Monarchists applauded Boris Godunov's words, the left [...] "supported" [...] boyarin Sitsky, seeing in him a fighter of despotism.|$|E

2500|$|Declaring {{significant}} progress in disrupting al-Qaeda and combatting the Taliban, Obama said on 16 December 2010 that the United States will start withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan in July 2011. Obama said [...] "we are on track to achieve our goals" [...] in the Afghan war and to [...] "start reducing our forces next July." [...] He added the drawdown will [...] "conclude in 2014." [...] Obama appeared before reporters to announce {{the results of the}} Afghanistan war review, which was compiled from reports submitted by military, diplomatic and intelligence officials since mid-October 2010. The president had directed his national security staff to perform a [...] "diagnostic" [...] assessment of the December 2009 West point strategy after one year. They convened eight working-group and deputy-level meetings from 16 Nov. through 1 Dec.. An interagency team also visited Afghanistan and Pakistan from 25 October through 4 November to discuss the situation with key leaders first-hand. The summary document of the review included no specifics as to the potential size or pace of withdrawal, making no assessment as to whether any milestones have been reached and leaving substantial wiggle room for future decisions. [...] "As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> integrated efforts in 2010," [...] the report said, [...] "we are setting the conditions to begin transition to Afghan security lead in early 2011 and to begin a responsible, conditions-based U.S. troop reduction in July 2011." [...] The review concluded that the military surge of 30,000 troops has been a success, saying it [...] "reduced overall Taliban influence and arrested the momentum they had achieved in recent years in key parts of the country."
