6000|$|It {{was in the}} {{afternoon}} that this conversation was held, and these preparations made. The next morning, at nine o'clock, Marco and Forester went into the little study, and Forester gave him his instructions. He took his arithmetic, and explained to him how to perform some examples, {{under one of the}} rules. Forester performed one or two of them himself, explaining very particularly all the steps. He then rubbed out his work, and directed Marco to perform them by himself in the same manner. [...] "If you succeed in doing these right," [...] said he, [...] "you may set yourself some others of the same kind, with different numbers, and perform those too.

6000|$|They {{went up to}} the Central Park by the {{elevated}} railway, and Verena reflected, as they proceeded, that anyway Olive was probably disposing of her somehow at Mrs. Burrage's, and that therefore there wasn't much harm in her just taking this little run on her own responsibility, especially as she should only be out an hour--which would be just the duration of Olive's absence. The beauty of the [...] "elevated" [...] was that it took you up to the Park and brought you back in a few minutes, and you had all the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> to walk about and see the place. It was so pleasant now that one was glad to see it twice over. The long, narrow enclosure, across which the houses in the streets that border it look at each other with their glittering windows, bristled with the raw delicacy of April, and, in spite of its rockwork grottoes and tunnels, its pavilions and statues, its too numerous paths and pavements, lakes too big for the landscape and bridges too big for the lakes, expressed all the fragrance and freshness of the most charming moment of the year. Once Verena was fairly launched the spirit of the day took possession of her; she was glad to have come, she forgot about Olive, enjoyed the sense of wandering in the great city with a remarkable young man who would take beautiful care of her, while {{no one else in the}} world knew where she was. It was very different from her drive yesterday with Mr. Burrage, but it was more free, more intense, more full of amusing incident and opportunity. She could stop and look at everything now, and indulge all her curiosities, even the most childish; she could feel as if she were out for the day, though she was not really--as she had not done since she was a little girl, when in the country, once or twice, when her father and mother had drifted into summer quarters, gone out of town like people of fashion, she had, with a chance companion, strayed far from home, spent hours in the woods and fields, looking for raspberries and playing she was a gipsy. Basil Ransom had begun with proposing, strenuously, that she should come somewhere and have luncheon; he had brought her out half an hour before that meal was served in West Tenth Street, and he maintained that he owed her the compensation of seeing that she was properly fed; he knew a very quiet, luxurious French restaurant, near the top of the Fifth Avenue: he didn't tell her that he knew it through having once lunched there in company with Mrs. Luna. Verena for the present declined his hospitality--said she was going to be out so short a time that it wasn't worth the trouble; she should not be hungry, luncheon to her was nothing, she would eat when she went home. When he pressed her she said she would see later, perhaps, if she should find she wanted something. She would have liked immensely to go with him to an eating-house, and yet, with this, she was afraid, just as she was rather afraid, at bottom, and in the intervals of her quick pulsations of amusement, of the whole expedition, not knowing why she had come, though it made her happy, and reflecting that there was really nothing Mr. Ransom could have to say to her that would concern her closely enough. He knew what he intended about her sharing the noon-day repast with him somehow; it had been part of his plan that she should sit opposite him at a little table, taking her napkin out of its curious folds--sit there smiling back at him while he said to her certain things that hummed, like memories of tunes, in his fancy, and they waited till something extremely good, and a little vague, chosen out of a French carte, was brought them. That was not at all compatible with her going home at the end of half an hour, as she seemed to expect to. They visited the animals in the little zoological garden which forms one of the attractions of the Central Park; they observed the swans in the ornamental water, and they even considered the question of taking a boat for half an hour, Ransom saying that they needed this to make their visit complete. Verena replied that she didn't see why it should be complete, and after having threaded the devious ways of the Ramble, lost themselves in the Maze, and admired all the statues and busts of great men with which the grounds are decorated, they contented themselves with resting on a sequestered bench, where, however, there was a pretty glimpse of the distance and an occasional stroller creaked by on the asphalt walk.|$|E

The Mockingbird/Hunter dynamic is electric, but also light enough to counteract the emotional anchors of FitzSimmons, Ward, and Skye". She praised the guest cast for all being [...] "on-point {{in terms of what they}} bring to the table", the ambiguity created between the Ward brothers, and the development of Coulson into a [...] "stronger, more diligent, and more skillful leader". Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B', calling it [...] "solid", and finding the season to be [...] "starting to settle into a nice groove ... maintaining strong forward momentum while delivering the intrigue, action, and humor fans expect from a Marvel Studios property." [...] He highlighted Palicki, the Morse/Hunter relationship, and the improved fight choreography as well, and was positive of the moral ambiguity established for the Ward brothers, especially for Grant, of whom he said [...] "We don’t know what his intentions are in the final moments of this episode, and that ambiguity makes him a much more captivating character than before." ...|$|E
5000|$|The founder, St. Benedict devotes {{thirteen}} chapters (8-20) of {{his rule}} to regulating the canonical hours for his monks (and nuns).

At Prime on Monday let three Psalms be said, namely Psalms 1, 2 and 6. And so each day at Prime until Sunday let three Psalms be said in numerical order, to Psalm 19, but with Psalms 9 and 17 each divided into two parts. Thus it comes about that the Night Office on Sunday always begins with Psalm 20.At Terce, Sext and None on Monday let the nine remaining sections of Psalm 118 be said, three at each of these Hours.Psalm 118 having been completed, therefore, on two days, Sunday and Monday, let the nine Psalms from Psalm 119 to Psalm 127 be said at Terce, Sext and None, three at each Hour, beginning with Tuesday. And let these same Psalms be repeated every day until Sunday at the same Hours, while the arrangement of hymns, lessons and versesis kept the same on all days; and thus Prime on Sunday will always begin with Psalm 118.Vespers are to be sung with four Psalms every day. These shall begin with Psalm 109 and go on to Psalm 147, omitting those which are set apart for other Hours; that is to say that with the exception of Psalms 117 to 127 and Psalms 133 and 142, all the rest of these are to be said at Vespers. And since there are three Psalms too few, let the longer ones of the above number be divided, namely Psalms 138, 143 and 144. But let Psalm 116 because of its brevity be joined to Psalm 115.The order of the Vesper Psalms being thus settled, let the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hour</b> - lesson, responsory, hymn, verse and canticle - be carried out as we prescribed above.At Compline the same Psalms are to be repeated every day, namely Psalms 4, 90 and 133.The order of psalmody for the day Hours being thus arranged, let all the remaining Psalms be equally distributed among the seven Night Offices by dividing the longer Psalms among them and assigning twelve Psalms to each night.We strongly recommend, however, that if this distribution of the Psalms is displeasing to anyone, he/she should arrange them otherwise, in whatever way she/he considers better, but taking care in any case that the Psalter with its full number of 150 Psalms be chanted every week and begun again every Sunday at the Night Office. For those monastics show themselves too lazy in the service to which they are vowed, who chant less than the Psalter with the customary canticles {{in the course of a}} week, whereas we read that our holy Fathers strenuously fulfilled that task in a single day.

40|$|This is Hofstra’s sixth major {{conference on}} legal ethics. (We {{previously}} held conferences in 1996, 1998, 2001, 2003 and 2005.) By holding these conferences {{once every two}} or three years rather than annually, we can devote greater resources to each conference. This conference differs somewhat from our past conferences in that we have invited many more practicing lawyers to speak than usual because the subject of this year’s conference, lawyering at the edge, is a subject that demands personal experience as much as academic theory. We need to hear stories and advice from people who have personally explored the outer edges of the legal universe and can tell us how they dealt with the challenges they faced on the frontiers. And we need scholarly analysis of these personal stories to put them in perspective and tie them to the larger themes that shape our professional lives. We believe our speakers reflect {{the best of both worlds}} – the raw experience of practicing lawyers and the detached analysis of law professors who study legal ethics. In presenting these outstanding speakers, our approach is to focus intensely on each individual speaker. We do this in three ways. First, we give each speaker free rein to choose a topic. (We do not assign topics.) Within the broad theme of lawyering at the edge, each speaker has chosen a topic of particular personal interest and importance. Second, we bring each speaker to the podium alone, without any co-panelists, for nearly an hour. During the first part of the hour, each speaker will discuss some aspect of lawyering at the edge. During the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> the floor will be open for questions and comments from the audience. (Note that we have standing microphones in the aisles for this purpose.) Third, every session is a plenary session. Therefore, every speaker can address the entire audience, and entire audience can hear every speaker. We hope that the conference will have a lasting impact on the field of legal ethics. The exchange between the speakers and the audience will influence the shape of the formal papers, many of which will be published in a special symposium issue of the Hofstra Law Review next year. We expect these papers to be widely read and to be in demand in hard copy and on Westlaw for years to come. Even more important, we hope that this conference will have a lasting impact on you personally. Whether you teach, practice or use your knowledge of legal ethics in other ways, we hope this conference will provide new ideas that will enhance your professional life. We are delighted that you are here. We thank you for attending, and we thank Hofstra University for supporting this wonderful event. Roy SimonConference Directo...|$|E
