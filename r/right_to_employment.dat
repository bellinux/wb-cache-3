500|$|Noting {{that there}} were [...] "few more polarising {{political}} figures" [...] than Castro, Amnesty International described him as [...] "a progressive but deeply flawed leader". In their view, he should be [...] "applauded" [...] for his regime's [...] "substantial improvements" [...] to healthcare and education, but criticised for its [...] "ruthless suppression of freedom of expression." [...] Human Rights Watch stated that his government constructed a [...] "repressive machinery" [...] which deprived Cubans of their [...] "basic rights". Castro defended his government's record on human rights, stating that the state was forced to limit the freedoms of individuals and imprison those involved in counter-revolutionary activities {{in order to protect}} the rights of the collective populace, such as the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>employment,</b> education, and health care.|$|E

Nay, so long as industrial conditions are such that so pathetic a phenomenon is possible we have not the moral right to disregard that possibility. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>employment</b> being the right to life, its denial is homicide. It should be needless {{to point out the}} advantages of its concession. It would preserve the life and self-respect of him who is needy through misfortune, and supply an infallible means of detection of his criminal imitator, who could then be dealt with as he deserves, widiout the lenity that finds justification in doubt and compassion. It would diminish crime, for an empty stomach has no morals. With a wage rate lower than the commercial, it would disturb no private industries by luring away their workmen, and with nothing made to sell there would be no competition with private products. Properly directed, it would give us highways, bridges and embankments which we shall not otherwise have.|$|E
