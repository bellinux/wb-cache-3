40|$|Today, {{with respect}} to the {{increasing}} growth of demand to get credit from the customers of banks and finance and credit institutions, using an effective and efficient method to decrease the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-repayment</b> of credit given is very necessary. Assessment of customers' credit {{is one of the most}} important and the most essential duties of banks and institutions, and if an error occurs in this field, it would leads to the great losses for banks and institutions. Thus, using the predicting computer systems has been significantly progressed in recent decades. The data that are provided to the credit institutions' managers help them to make a straight decision for giving the credit or not-giving it. In this paper, we will assess the customer credit through a combined classification using artificial neural networks, genetics algorithm and Bayesian probabilities simultaneously, and the results obtained from three methods mentioned above would be used to achieve an appropriate and final result. We use the K_folds cross validation test in order to assess the method and finally, we compare the proposed method with the methods such as Clustering-Launched Classification (CLC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) as well as GA+SVM where the genetics algorithm has been used to improve them.

40|$|Multiple peril crop insurance's (MPCI) im-pact on Central Indiana hog-crop farms was {{analyzed}} under scenarios of alternative debt/ asset ratios, government deficiency payment programs, {{and levels of}} off-farm income and yield variability. MPCI reduced the probability of survival of high-debt farms when yield var-iability was equal to county average yields. More positive effects result from use of MPCI under assumptions of greater available financial resources or higher levels of yield variability. MPCI {{is likely to have}} a more important role in risk management for the medium-debt farm or the high-debt farm with off-farm income than for the other scenarios analyzed. Recent adverse economic conditions in agriculture have created a situation of finan-cial distress for many farmers. Continued low product prices combined with the persistent decline in farmland values have eroded net worths in agriculture. Bankruptcies, partial liquidations and refinancing/workout arrange-ments have become more common. Farmers have attempted to reduce their production costs and capital expenditures to improve cash flows and probabilities of survival in agricul-ture. Some lenders, to reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-repayment</b> of loans, are requiring their low-equity borrowers to carry multiple peril crop insurance (MPCI) as a condition of financing. MPCI usually reduces income variability but also increases a farmer's operating costs and reduces cash flow in an average year. How-ever, the impact of MPCI on long-term sur-vival of diversified farm firms in adverse economic conditions is unclear...|$|E
40|$|Traceability and {{accountability}} of financial flows {{are among the}} main issues faced by credit institutes and long-term aid measures in crisis regions of the so-called Third World, especially {{in the context of}} credit rating and credit evaluation. Databases, data warehouses and business intelligence naturally {{play a key role in}} such situations, but equally important are the cultural adequacy and acceptance of solutions in the regional population, business, and administration. The thesis therefore pursues the key research question how concepts of data warehousing and dataming – originally created in the US and Europe – ca be adapted to the needs of banks and other credit organizations in the Third World, more specifically, in the West-African Franc Zone. Based on a case study in Togo, the problems of credit handling in this region as well as the situation concerning data management and data quality are explored. Subsequently, the thesis evaluates solution concepts from the area of data warehousing, specifically metadata management, semantic modeling, and data quality management, with respect to the given context. Finally, an example data set gained from the case study is used to compare a number of data mining method variants and combinations from the Neural Network area with respect to the question which of them might be best suitable for the situation, where under a given <b>risk</b> acceptance <b>of</b> <b>non-repayment</b> (error <b>of</b> type alpha), you want to reduce the number of credit requests which are rejected wrongly (error of type beta) in order to avoid stifling the economy. Among the investigated variants of basic backpropagation networks, cascade correlation, resilient propagation, pre-optimization with genetic algorithms, and fuzzy classification, the best results were achieved backpropagation networks that have a relatively high number of hidden neurons. The results from problem analysis, literature analysis, and selected experiments with experimental data indicate some conclusions for promising strategies in data warehousing and data mining that could form a foundation for future large-scale field studies in the region...|$|R

These cultures <b>of</b> <b>non-repayment</b> may be owing to factors such as individualistic (as opposed to collectivist) characteristics, attitudes towards the debt and the wealthy, and mistrust of institutions and prior governmental and nongovernmental organization (NGO) interventions involving debt forgiveness. They suggest the use of smaller groups and strengthening ties between members by encouraging them to help each other's business, thus building trust between the members, and a more personalized and closer interaction between the MFIs and the borrowers with business and capacity building activities and transparency to build trust with the MFI, thus distinguishing it from other institutions with whom the borrower may have dealt in the past.|$|R

Universally, commercial banks are facing problem <b>of</b> <b>non-repayment</b> <b>of</b> loans. This problem can be overcome through monitoring the behavior of borrowers. Thus, the idea of establishing Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) was conceived in order to assist banks in determining credit worthiness of their borrowers. CRBs allows for credit information sharing among the financial institutions. This study explores the effect of credit reference bureaus on credit access in Kenya. The sample of 96 respondents was drawn from the employees working in the headquarters of these banks targeting managers within the finance, strategy and business development portfolios/dockets in the 42 commercial banks in Kenya. The study found out that CRB reduces borrowing cost and loan delinquencies to a moderate extent. It further established that CRB has enhanced effective risk identification/monitoring and microcredit extension in Kenya. The study therefore recommends that lenders and CRB should work closely to ensure that there is no information asymmetry and therefore ensure that credit flows to deserving borrowers...|$|R

We find that outstanding LTVs are driven by household characteristics, life-cycle effects and mortgage type characteristics. LTV declines with the time elapsed since mortgage commencement, but its level is consistently higher (by around 10 %) for non-repayment mortgages (such as interest-only or endowment mortgages) than for repayment mortgages (such as linear or annuity mortgages). The difference results from higher debt capacity associated {{with the possibility of}} deferring the principal repayment for non-repayment mortgages.

30|$|Over time, {{recognizing}} {{the need to}} deliver greater access to financial services to farmers, several initiatives have been implemented in Nigeria. A review conducted by the World Bank (2008) on Nigeria’s rural finance summarizes that Nigeria’s history with rural finance provides lessons about the elements of past interventions that have worked and those that have not. The report notes that, on the positive side, Nigeria’s rural finance policies and practices achieved some level of penetration by creating a rural branch network. Nigeria’s experience using public private partnership arrangements between commercial banks and other private sector actors has also helped lower the risk and transaction costs. In terms of the negative legacies, {{the most important one}} is perhaps the culture <b>of</b> <b>non-repayment</b> among some borrowers, which has been fostered by poor repayment methodologies and subsidized interest rates, charged as part of the government agricultural finance initiatives. The following factors were identified to have hindered the expected impact of the efforts to enhance access to financial services in Nigeria: (i) inconsistency of government policies in rural finance; (ii) the financial illiteracy of many rural actors, exacerbating the problem; (iii) the methodology of “credit only” financial service initiatives, which paid insufficient attention to loan applications and omitted a large—and equally important—unmet demand for savings and other financial services; and (iv) the legacy of financial unsustainability and operational inefficiency of most government (and many non-governmental) rural finance institutions and programs.|$|R

In the work are used scientific research methods – analysis and synthesis methods, economic analysis method of enterprises, the special coefficient method and the risk ranking method. The authors had studied the Latvian trade sector in the period from 2004 to 2010. In Latvian trade sector from 2004 to 2006 was observed increment of turnover, but from 2007 was observed decline of turnover. In Latvian trade sector is monopolistic competition. Many enterprises offer a market differentiated trade services. Small and medium companies are merging into trade cooperation and chain stores. The authors had studied average financial indexes of the Latvian trade sector enterprises. Average financial <b>risk</b> coefficient <b>of</b> Latvian trade sector enterprises had increased during the period from 2006 to 2009. The authors have created classification of Latvian trade sector economic and financial <b>risks</b> and classification <b>of</b> the trade technological process risks.

Then, we generated spatially explicit functions <b>of</b> total <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> predation for each prey species (elk [Cervus elaphus] and mule deer [Odocoileus hemionus]) by combining <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> encounter and kill. For both mule deer and elk, topographic and vegetation type effects, along with resource selection by their primary predator (cougars [Puma concolor] and wolves [Canis lupus], respectively), strongly influenced <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> encounter.

Equilibria with odious lending could be eliminated by amending creditor country laws to prevent seizure <b>of</b> assets for <b>non-repayment</b> <b>of</b> odious debt and by restricting foreign aid to countries not repaying odious debt. Shutting down the borrowing capacity of illegitimate regimes is a new form of economic sanction with two advantages over existing sanctions: it helps rather than hurts the population, and it does not create incentives for evasion by third parties. However, an institution empowered to assess regimes might falsely term debt odious if it favored debtors, and if creditors anticipated this, they would not lend to legitimate governments. An institution empowered only to declare that future lending to a particular government is odious would have greater incentives to judge truthfully...|$|R
