5|$|Sonic Colors {{features}} a co-operative two-player mode titled Eggman's Sonic Simulator. In this mode, players control Sonic-modeled robots or their Mii characters {{through a series}} of levels. These levels can be unlocked by collecting special Red Star Rings hidden throughout each act. Completing Sonic Simulator levels rewards the player Chaos Emeralds, and once all seven are collected, Sonic can transform into Super Sonic after collecting 50 rings in normal levels. As Super Sonic, players are invincible and can boost infinitely, though they cannot use Wisps and lose one ring per second, de-transforming when the <b>ring</b> <b>counter</b> hits zero. The game also features online leaderboards, allowing players to upload their scores via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.|$|E
25|$|The master {{frequency}} {{was further}} divided through a scaler, first by five using a <b>ring</b> <b>counter</b> {{to produce a}} 102.4kHz signal. This was then divided by two through 17 successive stages called F1 (51.2kHz) through F17 (0.78125Hz). The F10 stage (100Hz) was fed back into the AGC to increment the real-time clock and other involuntary counters using Pinc (discussed below). The F17 stage was used to intermittently run the AGC when it was operating in the standby mode.|$|E

50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of <b>ring</b> <b>counters</b> {{is that they}} are lower density codes. A binary counter can represent 2^N states, where N is the number of bits in the code, whereas an Overbeck counter can represent only N states and a Johnson counter can represent only 2N states. This may be an important consideration in hardware implementations where registers are more expensive than combinational logic.|$|R
5000|$|Both the ENIAC and ABC used triode vacuum tubes, but the ABC {{computed}} logically using {{a binary}} adder circuits, whereas the ENIAC computed enumeratively using decimal <b>ring</b> <b>counters.</b> (For proponents of Mauchly's {{claims to have}} been influenced not by the ABC but by scaling circuits used to count cosmic rays at Swarthmore College, {{this is a significant}} distinction: if Mauchly derived any work from Atanasoff, why did he not appropriate for the ENIAC Atanasoff's add-subtract mechanism, in principle the most novel and enduring aspect of the ABC?) ...|$|R
5000|$|A Johnson counter (or switch-tail <b>ring</b> <b>counter,</b> twisted <b>ring</b> <b>counter,</b> walking <b>ring</b> <b>counter,</b> or Möbius counter) is a {{modified}} <b>ring</b> <b>counter,</b> where the output {{from the last}} stage is inverted and fed back as input to the first stage. [...] The register cycles through a sequence of bit-patterns, whose length is equal to twice {{the length of the}} shift register, continuing indefinitely. These counters find specialist applications, including those similar to the decade counter, digital-to-analog conversion, etc. They can be implemented easily using D- or JK-type flip-flops.|$|E

For example, in a 4-register counter, with initial register values of 0000, the repeating pattern is: 0000, 1000, 1100, 1110, 1111, 0111, 0011, 0001, 0000...|$|E

50|$|As the {{exchange}} ran on timing pulses, unlike the TXE2 design, {{there was a}} Pulse Generator Rack, which provided them. The generator used a delay line oscillator of 166.7 kHz to produce a basic pulse of six microseconds duration and this was fed to eight <b>ring</b> <b>counters</b> which then multiplied up the basic six microsecond pulses into the various pulse requirements. There were four generators, because of security reasons, and of the vital importance of these pulses. The exchange could still function if one generator was out of service.|$|R
50|$|The 4000 series {{facilitates}} simpler {{circuit design}} through relatively low power consumption, {{a wide range}} of supply voltages, and vastly increased load-driving capability (fanout). This makes the series ideal for use in prototyping LSI designs. While TTL based design is similarly modular, it requires meticulous planning of a circuit's electrical load characteristics. Buffered models can accommodate higher electrical currents, but have a greater risk of introducing unwanted feedback. Many models contain a high level of integration, including fully integrated 7-segment display <b>counters,</b> walking <b>ring</b> <b>counters,</b> and full adders.|$|R

These kinds of nets can model associations between objects {{of the same}} class, bounded files, virtual <b>rings,</b> <b>counters</b> gestion. The algorithms presented here fulfill the main criteria of a good computation for high level nets: the intensive representation of flows, the independance from cardinality domains and the computation of a generative family of flows. New ideas have enabled to obtain these results such as transformation of coloured domains and computation in a quotient polynomial ring. Various significative examples are given with {{the interpretation of the}} computed flows. We are then close to a general algorithm for a very large category of coloured nets and certainly large enough to model a wide range of applications...|$|R

40|$|The deep-sea gorgonian octocoral Primnoa resedaeformis is {{distributed}} throughout the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at depths of 65 - 3200 m. It has a two-part skeleton of calcite and gorgonin. Towards {{the inside of the}} axial skeleton gorgonin and calcite are deposited in concentric growth rings, similar to tree rings. Colonies were collected from the Northeast Channel (northwest Atlantic Ocean, southwest of Nova Scotia, Canada) from depths of 250 - 475 m. Radiocarbon was measured in individual rings isolated from sections of each colony, after dissolution of calcite. Each {Delta}{sup 14 }C measurement was paired with a ring age determined by three amateur <b>ring</b> <b>counters.</b> The precision of ring counts averaged better than {+-} 2 years. Accurate reconstruction of 20 th century bomb-radiocarbon shows that (1) the growth rings are formed annually, (2) the gorgonin is derived from surface particulate organic matter (POM) and (3) useful environmental data are recorded in the organic endoskeletons of deep-sea octocorals.

50|$|Ring {{counters}} {{are used}} in hardware logic design (e.g. ASIC and FPGA design) to create complicated finite state machines. A binary counter will require an adder circuit which is substantially more complex than a <b>ring</b> <b>counter.</b> Additionally, the worst case propagation delay on an adder circuit will be proportional {{to the number of}} bits in the code (due to the carry propagation). The propagation delay of a <b>ring</b> <b>counter</b> will be a constant regardless of the number of bits in the code.
