5|$|CryoSat-2 {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for CryoSat-1, whose Rokot carrier rocket was unable to achieve orbit, resulting in the loss of the satellite. Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater battery capacity and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an interferometric radar <b>range-finder</b> with twin antennas, which measures the height difference between the upper surface of floating ice and surrounding water. This is often known as 'free-board'.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser <b>range-finder</b> and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{defensive}} weapons {{included the}} anti-aircraft artillery piece. The three main types were the 4.5-inch, 3.7-inch and 3-inch guns. The first two were modern, and effective over 8000 metres (26,000 feet). The last was a First World War weapon effective only to 4,250 metres (14,000 feet). Usually batteries were sited in fours, with a <b>range-finder</b> and predictor which measured the speeds and heights of enemy aircraft while {{taking into account}} the time shell took to reach their intended targets, thus calculating when to detonate the fuse in the shell. As with most artillery weapons firing at aircraft, the higher the shell travelled the less effective it became. A shell fired to 1,500 metres (5,000 feet) would only be half as effective at 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) and a quarter as accurate at 4,500 metres (15,000 feet). The German bombers usually tried to fly around heavy concentrations of anti-aircraft guns, and if forced to fly through them, chose to fly at heights of around 4,500 metres (15,000 feet).|$|E

5|$|Both North Carolina and Washington, {{designed}} {{prior to}} radar, were originally fitted with many fire-control and navigational optical <b>range-finders.</b> The former lasted until 1944, {{when it was}} replaced by a Mark 27 microwave radar—though it was supplemented by a Mark 3 main armament fire control radar. The <b>range-finders</b> were removed in favor of additional 20mm guns sometime between the end of 1941 and mid-1942. In addition, the ships were commissioned with two Mark 38 directors and were originally fitted with a CXAM air search, two Mark 3s and three Mark 4 secondary armament.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Sensor-line cameras {{have been}} {{designed}} for space missions in the 1980 s, and are used for various tasks, including panoramic imaging. Laser <b>range-finders</b> are able to generate dense depth maps (of isolated surface points). Panoramic sensor-line cameras and laser <b>range-finders</b> may both be implemented as rotating sensors, and we used them together this way to reconstruct accurately 3 D environments (such as, for example, large buildings). This article reviews related developments, followed by {{a detailed description of}} designed calibration and pose estimation techniques which have been used for both rotating sensors. Related experiments evaluate the accuracy of calibrated sensor parameters and of estimated poses...|$|R

One of the simplest ways is to station two <b>range-finders</b> in the tops, as far away from each other as possible. Each man gets a bead on the enemy with his glasses, and then proceeds to get the angle between the bead and an imaginary line drawn between his station and that taken by the other fellow. The three points--that is, the two <b>range-finders</b> and the enemy--form a triangle, and having one line and the two angles to work on, the working out of the problem gives the distance the gunners are hunting for." ...|$|R

Similar systems are now available in Army helicopters and armored fighting vehicles.|$|E
500|$|In October 1920, the {{battleship}} [...] arrived to replace Marlborough in the Mediterranean Fleet. Marlborough {{then returned to}} Devonport, where she was paid off for a major refit that took place between February 1921 and January 1922. During the refit, range dials were installed, along with another <b>range-finder</b> on the rear superstructure. The aircraft platform was removed from [...] "B" [...] turret. Long-base range-finders were installed on [...] "X" [...] turret. After completing the refit in January 1922, Marlborough was recommissioned and assigned to the Mediterranean, where she replaced Emperor of India. She served as the second command flagship until October. Following the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, the Allied countries withdrew their occupation forces from Turkey; Marlborough was involved in escorting the troop convoys out of Constantinople.|$|E

2500|$|The Buk-M1-2 TELAR {{uses the}} GM-569 chassis {{designed}} and produced by JSC MMZ (Mytishchi). TELAR superstructure is a turret containing the fire control radar {{at the front}} and a launcher with four ready-to-fire missiles on top. Each TELAR is operated by a crew of four and is equipped with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) protection. The radar fitted to each TELAR, {{referred to as the}} 'Fire Dome' by NATO, is a monopulse type radar and can begin tracking at the missile's maximum range (32km/20mi) and can track aircraft flying at between 15m and 22km (50 to 72,000ft) altitudes. It can guide up to three missiles against a single target. The 9K37 system supposedly has much better ECCM characteristics (i.e., is more resistant to ECM and jamming) than the 3M9 Kub system that it replaces. While the early Buk had a day radar tracking system 9Sh38 (similar to that used on Kub, Tor and Osa missile system), its current design can be fitted with a combined optical tracking system with a thermal camera and a laser <b>range-finder</b> for passive tracking of the target. The 9K37 system can also utilise the same 1S91 Straight Flush 25kW G/H band continuous wave radar as the 3M9 [...] "Kub" [...] system.|$|E
2500|$|The turret and glacis are {{protected}} with [...] "Kanchan" [...] ("gold") modular composite armour, which derived {{its name from}} Kanchan Bagh, Hyderabad, where the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) is located. Kanchan is made by sandwiching composite panels between Rolled Homogenous Armour (RHA). This helps in defeating APFDS and HEAT rounds. Trials conducted in 2000, showcased the ability of Kanchan armour to protect the tank, even when hit at point blank range by a T-72. It also demonstrated the capability to defeat HESH and APFSDS rounds, which included the Israeli APFSDS rounds. A new honeycomb design of Non-Explosive and Non-Energetic Reactive Armour (NERA) along with nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection equipment, along with mine sweeps and an automatic fire fighting system are {{set up on the}} Arjun Mark II variant. Electromagnetic-counter mine system can also be installed to disable magnetic mines and disrupts its electronics before the tank reaches them. Signature reduction suite is also available for this design to reduce the probabilities of the object to be detected by Infrared, Thermal, Radar-Thermal, and Radar bands. The planned improvements include Electro-optical/IR [...] "dazzlers", Laser warning receivers, aerosol grenade discharging systems and a computerised control system among few. The tank is fitted with infrared jammer, laser rangefinders and designators are used in navigation (GPS/INS), observation systems and sensors, real-time command and beyond-vision-range target engaging. Advanced Fire Control System (FCS) is linked to a millimetre band radar system, laser <b>range-finder,</b> crosswind sensor and IR and radiometer sensors on board. The millimetre band radar system mounted on the turret is capable of operating as a Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) and also has a Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) and radar jammer. Four all-bearing Laser warning receivers (LWR) for the new fire-control system enables the Arjun is capable of shooting down helicopters. Battle Management System has a panoramic sight with the commander's station equipped with eight periscopes for 360° vision. Commander's independent thermal viewer, weapon station, position navigation equipment, and a full set of controls and displays have been linked by a digital data bus for improved fire control system. The tank is fitted with digital maps, improved cooling system to compensate for heat generated by the additional computer systems, FBCB2 capabilities, New radars, EW Systems, C4ISR Systems, Gun Control System (GCS) Integrated Battlefield Management System (IBMS) and Active protection System.|$|E

50|$|Fire-control {{systems are}} often {{interfaced}} with sensors (such as sonar, radar, infra-red search and track, laser <b>range-finders,</b> anemometers, wind vanes, thermometers, barometers, etc.) {{in order to}} cut down or eliminate {{the amount of information}} that must be manually entered in order to calculate an effective solution. Sonar, radar, IRST and <b>range-finders</b> can give the system the direction to and/or distance of the target. Alternatively, an optical sight can be provided that an operator can simply point at the target, which is easier than having someone input the range using other methods and gives the target less warning that it is being tracked. Typically, weapons fired over long ranges need environmental information—the farther a munition travels, the more the wind, temperature, air density, etc. will affect its trajectory, so having accurate information is essential for a good solution. Sometimes, for very long-range rockets, environmental data has to be obtained at high altitudes or in between the launching point and the target. Often, satellites or balloons are used to gather this information.|$|R
