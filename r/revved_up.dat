The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were <b>revved</b> <b>up</b> to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E

25|$|One more {{test flight}} was {{conducted}} at the Island Grounds in 1914, when J. W. Madley, a water works engineer, tested an aircraft assembled by him. He flew it over the Red Hills reservoir to inspect works and shot a couple of aerial photographs of the reservoir from the aircraft. This incident kindled an interest in flying among prominent residents of the city, resulting in {{the arrival of a}} set of aviators in 1911 to display the flying machines they had brought with them to India as a marketing initiative. The aviators included Baron de Caters and Jules Tyck. On 15 February 1911, Tyck flew in a Blériot aeroplane in front of the public. The aircraft was wheeled out by eight men with Tyck seated inside the craft wearing an oilskin coat and goggles. The men held the plane till its engine <b>revved</b> <b>up</b> and then let go, and the craft darted forward about 20 yards before rising into the air. In the air, the craft made a straight flight only for about three-quarters of the length of the ground and descended due to poor weather. Tyck flew again the next day, this time reaching a height of 2,400feet, which was witnessed by the then Governor of Madras Sir Arthur Lawley. Two days later, on 18 February, another demonstration was given by Baron de Caters, when he flew his aircraft in public.|$|E

Hankinson, who had tepidly called songs [...] "nice" [...] up to this point, shifted gears and said, [...] "Then Santana burns the roof down with a rendition of Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie'.

Benigno opined that [...] "Brittany and Mike Chang handle the moves (extraordinarily well), but the vocals here are what steal it.

Stack was slightly less generous with an [...] "A-", and wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "great song choice for Santana"; he gave [...] "bonus points for the phenomenal Mike/Brittany choreography", while Harper said that their dancing [...] "totally made the song".

Reiter felt the entire song [...] "seemed kind of tacked on", both the dancing and Santana's solo.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} Oxford University in 1995, Beckinsale starred in Cold Comfort Farm as Flora Poste, a newly {{orphaned}} 1930s socialite sent {{to live with}} distant family members in rural England. The John Schlesinger-directed film was an adaptation of Stella Gibbons's novel and also featured Joanna Lumley, Eileen Atkins, Ian McKellen, Rufus Sewell and Stephen Fry. Beckinsale was initially considered too young, but was cast after she wrote a pleading letter to the director. Emanuel Levy of Variety was reminded of [...] "the strength of a young Glenda Jackson and the charm of a young Julie Christie." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times classed the actress as [...] "yet another of those effortlessly skilled British beauties who light up the screen." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times felt she played the role [...] "with the perfect snippy aplomb." [...] The film grossed over $5 million at the US box office. Also in 1995, she appeared in Haunted, a ghost story in which Derek Elley of Variety felt she [...] "holds the screen, with both physical looks and verbal poise." [...] 1995 also saw Beckinsale's first professional stage appearance as Nina in The Seagull at Theatre Royal, Bath. She became romantically involved with co-star Michael Sheen after meeting during play rehearsals. [...] "He was the young lion of the theatre." [...] "I was all <b>revved</b> <b>up</b> to feel very intimidated. It was my first-ever play and my mother had cut out reviews of him in previous productions. And then he walked in ... It was almost like, 'God, well, I'm finished now. That's it, then.'... He's the most outrageously talented person I've ever met." [...] Irving Wardle of The Independent felt that [...] "the casting, including Michael Sheen's volcanic Kostya and Kate Beckinsale's steadily freezing Nina, is mainly spot-on." [...] In early 1996, she starred in two further plays; Sweetheart at the Royal Court Theatre and Clocks and Whistles at the Bush Theatre.|$|E

[...] Hardcore historian Steven Blush states that for West coasters, the first hardcore record was Out of Vogue by the Santa Ana band Middle Class. The band pioneered a shouted, fast version of punk rock which would shape the hardcore sound that would soon emerge. In terms of impact upon the hardcore scene, Black Flag has been deemed the most influential group. Michael Azerrad, author of Our Band Could Be Your Life, calls Black Flag the [...] "godfathers" [...] of hardcore punk and states that even [...] "...more than the flagship band of American hardcore", they were [...] "...required listening for anyone who was interested in underground music." [...] Blush states that Black Flag defined American hardcore {{in the same way that}} the Sex Pistols defined punk. Formed in Hermosa Beach, California by guitarist and lyricist Greg Ginn, they played their first show in December 1977. Originally called Panic, they changed their name to Black Flag in 1978. Black Flag's sound mixed the raw simplicity of the Ramones with atonal guitar solos and frequent tempo shifts.|$|E
