25|$|For Neff's {{office at}} Pacific All Risk, Wilder and set {{designer}} Hal Pereira conspired {{to create a}} little in-house joke, typical of Billy Wilder. In the opening scenes, as Walter Neff stumbles off the elevator {{on his way to}} his office to record his confession, the vast two-tiered office is empty and dark. With the camera following him, Neff lurches towards the balcony railing overlooking <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> uniform corporate desks. Neff turns left, but the camera continues forward until it reaches the brink and stares down for an anxious moment into a colorless American business purgatory. Here, Pereira is said to have copied an existing office: the corporate headquarters of Paramount Pictures in New York City.|$|E

After major cleansing ceremonies, establishing a memorial {{for the lost}} lives, and paying respect to those who left loved ones behind, the people of Kuta look forward to restoring Bali's image through an event named [...] "Kuta Karnival— A Celebration of Life". The community event consists of traditional art performances such as Balinese Sunset Dances, sports on the beach {{as well as in}} the water for young and old plus <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> culinary displays along the one kilometre of sandy beach.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} the sun had quitted {{the face of the}} vast apartment-house on which the day habitually broke, and had gone about its {{business}} of lighting and heating the city roofs and streets, the holiday companions were well on their way up the Third Avenue Elevated toward that region of the Bronx which, in all their New York years, they had never yet visited. They exulted at each stop and start of the train in the long succession of streets which followed so fast upon one another that the guards gave up trying to call them out as a hundred-and-so-many, and simply said Fifty-fifth, and Sixty-sixth, and Seventy-seventh Street. This slight of their duty to the public comported agreeably with the slip-shod effectiveness of the whole apparatus of the New York life: the <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> shops, the <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> flats, the <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> back yards with miles of wash flying in the soft May wind, which, probably, the people in the open car ahead felt almost a gale.|$|E

So she showed the Italian into the sombre drawing-room, with its high black bookshelves with <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> calf-bound volumes, its old red and flowered carpet, its grand piano littered with music. Ciccio put down the things as she directed, and stood with his cap in his hands, looking aside.|$|E
60|$|Behind {{the mill}} door, and {{invisible}} to the mere wayfarer who did not visit the family, were chalked addition and subtraction sums, many of them originally done wrong, and the figures half rubbed out and corrected, noughts being turned into nines, and ones into twos. These were the miller's private calculations. There were also chalked {{in the same place}} <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> strokes like open palings, representing the calculations of the grinder, who in his youthful ciphering studies had not gone so far as Arabic figures.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Parker {{ignored the}} question. He {{was sitting in}} the same {{attitude}} of watchfulness, the revolver resting on his knee. He seemed mistrustful of John's right hand, which was hanging limply at his side. It was from this quarter that he appeared to expect attack. The cab was bowling easily up the broad street, past <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> high houses each looking exactly the same as the last. Occasionally, to the right, through a break in the line of buildings, a glimpse of the river could be seen.|$|E
6000|$|This {{sprinkling}} of people seemed only {{to enhance the}} cool brown emptiness of the church, the <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> empty pews, disengaged prayerbooks and abandoned hassocks. It {{had the effect of}} a preposterous misfit. Johnson consulted with a thin-legged, short-skirted verger about the disposition of the party. The officiating clergy appeared distantly {{in the doorway of the}} vestry, putting on his surplice, and relapsed into a contemplative cheek-scratching that was manifestly habitual. Before the bride arrived Mr. Polly's sense of the church found an outlet in whispered criticisms of ecclesiastical architecture with Johnson. [...] "Early Norman arches, eh?" [...] he said, [...] "or Perpendicular." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as the}} squadrons of the 21st Lancers {{had turned}} the {{shoulder}} of the steep Kerreri Hills, we saw in the distance a yellow-brown pointed dome rising above the blurred horizon. It was the Mahdi's Tomb, standing in the very heart of Omdurman. From the high ground the field-glass disclosed <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> mud houses, making a dark patch on the brown of the plain. To the left the river, steel-grey in the morning light, forked into two channels, and on the tongue of land between them the gleam of a white building showed among the trees. Before us were the ruins of Khartoum and the confluence of the Blue and White Niles.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} agricultural production, Brazil opted {{for the expansion of}} farming areas and the intensive use of mechanization, causing serious damage to soils. At the same time, conservation practices such as no-tillage farming are also in use. Nevertheless, soil density assessments are necessary in both situations. Practical and controversial, the methodology of penetrometry is the most utilized in such assessments. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the vertical stratification of soil resistance to penetration. Data was collected in a Typic Hapludox under no-tillage. Samples were collected in forty points of a 50 x 50 m grid. Soil resistance was evaluated in three different positions in each point: plant rows, between the plant <b>rows,</b> <b>and</b> in the <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> the tractor path. Measurements were taken using a hydraulic-electronic penetrometer. Factorial analysis with orthogonal rotation, a Multivariate Analysis technique, was used to analyze soil resistance of soil layers. Four layers were identified in the plant rows, when more superficial layers had higher relative variance. Three layers were identified in the plant <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> in <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> the tractor path, points of anthropic action; in this case, deeper layers had higher relative variance...|$|R

60|$|When he {{got home}} he hurried upstairs to his bare chamber. He swept his table clear, and then, in an expert fashion, he seized handfuls of coin and piled them in little columns on his board. There was an army of fat pennies, a dozen to a column, along the back, <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> fat brown rank-and-file. In front of these, rows of slim halfpence, like an advance-guard.

And in front of these, and arranged methodically along the edge were <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> little yellow rouleaux--a hundred times more gold than Mr. Ledbetter had seen in all his life before.

The {{smallest}} beasts were nearest the King's rock throne; {{then there were}} wolves and foxes, lynxes and hyenas, and the like; behind them were gathered the monkey tribes, who were hard to keep in order because they teased the other animals and were full of mischievous tricks. Back of the monkeys were the pumas, jaguars, tigers and lions, and their kind; next the bears, all sizes and colors; after them bisons, wild asses, zebras and unicorns; farther on the rhinoceri and hippopotami, and at {{the far edge of}} the forest, close to the trees that shut in the clearing, was a row of thick-skinned elephants, still as statues but with eyes bright and intelligent.|$|E

How great the monster seemed, how swift and steady! It passed quite closely beneath them, driving along silently, a vast spread of wirenetted translucent wings, a thing alive. Graham had a momentary glimpse of the <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> wrapped-up passengers, slung in their little cradles behind wind-screens, of a white-clothed engineer crawling against the gale along a ladder way, of spouting engines beating together, of the whirling wind screw, and of a wide waste of wing.
