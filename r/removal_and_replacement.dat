5|$|On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually {{earthquake}} {{rocked the}} 5th Avenue Theatre. At the time, actors were on stage rehearsing the musical 1776. The theatre suffered minimal damages with no structural {{damage from the}} quake. Earthquake repairs included <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of 72 plaster ceiling supports and the repair of numerous cracks and damaged decorative plaster pieces in the ceiling. Contractors had to install scaffolding tall enough to reach the highest interior crevice in the ceiling eight stories up—the first time that area had been reached in 75 years. The chandeliers had to be lowered for repair and maintenance. As part of the repair work, Turner Construction provided services for seismic upgrades to the Skinner Building.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, {{the track}} has {{received}} considerable maintenance in parts, including complete track and ballast <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement.</b> It was informally thought locally by Network Rail staff that replacement signalling, controlled from Upminster, was planned for Christmas 2010, {{leading to the}} closure of the three signal boxes (staffed 24-hours a day, at least during the working week). However, financial constraints within Network Rail have now delayed this timescale.|$|E
25|$|After awakening, the two crews set {{right to}} work {{preparing}} for the mission's third EVA, which began at 18:01 UTC. The entire spacewalk was devoted to completing the cleaning, lubrication, <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of the trundle bearings assemblies in the starboard SARJ. The final trundle bearing assembly installation was deferred to the fourth EVA, but all other tasks scheduled were accomplished without any issues. Stefanyshyn-Piper's fifth EVA moved her to the twenty-fifth spot in cumulative EVA time with thirty three hours, forty two minutes.|$|E

25|$|Many {{local and}} {{national}} governments have, for political interests, subverted efforts to remove, reduce or upgrade slums into better housing options for the poor. Throughout {{the second half of}} the 19th century, for example, French political parties relied on votes from slum population and had vested interests in maintaining that voting block. <b>Removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of slum created a conflict of interest, and politics prevented efforts to remove, relocate or upgrade the slums into housing projects that are better than the slums. Similar dynamics are cited in favelas of Brazil, slums of India, and shanty towns of Kenya.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} and adobe structure, including new plaster and paint, were repaired in 1983 {{with funding from}} a federal grant while the roof was replaced in 1991. Under {{the benefit of a}} grant of $1,650,847, a major renovation was conducted between 2002 to 2004 as part of the THC's Texas Historic Courthouse Preservation Program. This renovation included new piers structurally reinforcing the foundation in order to support the building's thick adobe walls, a new metal shingle roof, and the <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of exterior stucco. Interior enhancements incorporated electrical, mechanical, and plumbing upgrades along with the installation of an elevator and fully accessible restrooms.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, the Office of Public Works (OPW), in {{association}} with the Gallery, commenced work on the historic complex at Merrion Square to address a critical need for the repair and renovation of the fabric Of the Dargan(1864) and Milltown(1903) wings, together with the provision of much needed additional accommodation. The first phase of the works programme involved the <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of the Dargan Wing roof. The next two phases of the project involved the replacement of the Milltown Wing roof, followed by an extensive upgrade of the fabric and services of the two buildings whilst reclaiming their original period elegance. Refurbishment of the two wings were completed in June 2017.|$|E

Each strand acts independently, allowing for the selective <b>removal,</b> inspection <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of the strands.|$|R
25|$|Following U-175s {{arrival at}} Lorient, the crew {{received}} three weeks leave. In {{order to maintain}} a skeleton crew remaining behind, this was taken in shifts. During this time the boat was in the dry dock within the Scorff Shelter submarine pen. She stayed there for two days while her equipment was tested, then transferred to the Keroman shelter where the more extensive work was undertaken. This involved the <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> {{of one of the}} periscopes, rebuilding the compressors, and overhauling the electric motors. The boat also received a Metox radar detector. By the end of November, the boat conducted short sea trials and was declared ready to undertake its next patrol.|$|E
25|$|It was {{believed}} that the leak was in the crossfeed flange area – a problem with associated seals. On 18 October 2010, after an afternoon review, engineers were asked to double-check the torque on six bolts around the suspected leaky flange fitting and tighten if necessary. Subsequent leak tests showed again signs of seepage, and the task of solving the issue required the draining of {{both the left and}} right OMS tanks of the shuttle and a unique in-situ repair at the pad to avoid a rollback. On 23 October 2010, engineers completed the <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of the two seals on the right OMS crossfeed flange, after the education (a vacuum-related procedure, used to completely clear the plumbing of the toxic MMH) of the plumbing was completed ahead of the schedule by over a day. Later, testing indicated that the new seals were properly seated and holding pressure with no signs of additional seepage. Normal pad operations commenced soon after allowing managers to press forward with the confirmation of a 1 November 2010 target launch date, with fuel reloading into the OMS tanks beginning on the morning of 24 October 2010.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{approach}} to route diagnosis for path-vector routing protocols such as the Internet’s Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Given a sequence of routing updates, our objective is to understand why a previous path was removed, why the specific new path is chosen among all existing alternatives, and whether any of the routers along the path injected false information. We collect necessary topological information for route diagnosis by inferring topological connectivity from routing updates, enhancing the path vector protocol with root cause notification, and using active queries between neighbor routers to learn missing information when necessary. In the absence of false routing updates, our design can reason about route <b>removals</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacements</b> with 100 % accuracy. We also use majority votes among independent information sources, combined with active queries, to identify the source of false routing updates. Simulation results show that, {{in the presence of}} false updates, our design can achieve high detection rate and attacker identification rate with a low overhead. I...|$|R

500|$|Though Brezhnev's time {{in office}} {{would later be}} {{characterized}} as one of stability, early on, Brezhnev oversaw the replacement of half of the regional leaders and Politburo members. This was a typical move for a Soviet leader trying to strengthen his power base. Examples of Politburo members who lost their membership during the Brezhnev Era are Gennady Voronov, Dmitry Polyansky, Alexander Shelepin, Petro Shelest and Podgorny. Polyansky and Voronov lost their membership in the Politburo because they {{were considered to be}} members of the [...] "Kosygin faction."

500|$|Completing {{the fifth}} of the five planned spacewalks, Grunsfeld and Feustel {{successfully}} installed the second battery, removed and replaced the Fine Guidance Sensor number three, and worked so efficiently that they were over an hour ahead of the timeline, giving them time to remove degraded insulation panels from three bays of the telescope, and install three New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs). Beginning the spacewalk at 12:20 UTC, the pair first worked on removing an aging battery module, {{and replaced it with}} a new pack, which combined with the battery replacement performed during the second spacewalk, gave the telescope all new nickel-hydrogen batteries. They then moved on to the <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of the Fine Guidance Sensor unit number three, improving Hubble's focus and stability when imaging. NASA engineers liken the new FGS to being able to keep a laser beam focused on a U.S. dime coin that is [...] away. Both the new batteries, and the FGS passed both aliveness and functional testing. The mission's final EVA concluded at 19:22 UTC, after seven hours and two minutes. The total time spent during the mission in extra-vehicular activity was thirty-six hours, fifty-six minutes. The twenty-third and final spacewalk to service Hubble brought the total time spent in EVA working on the telescope to one hundred and sixty-six hours, six minutes. Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci noted that the final EVA was also the last planned spacewalk from a shuttle airlock. In what was likely his last EVA, Grunsfeld's has accumulated fifty-eight hours and thirty minutes spacewalking, just two minutes less than Jerry L. Ross, who is third on the list of spacewalking time.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{mention of}} a church in Glossop is in the charter of 1157 conferring the manor of Glossop on Basingwerk Abbey. Although the {{dedication}} of the church to All Saints may indicate an Anglo-Saxon origin, no trace of such a church has been found. The first recorded vicar is William, of 1252. At this time the church was probably aisleless. It was altered in the 15th century when the nave was rebuilt with arcades, aisles and a still extant (2008) arch at the east end of the north aisle. In 1554 a new and taller tower with a broach spire was built 3 feet west of the old tower, incorporating the east wall of the previous tower. The nave was completely rebuilt in 1831, with <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of much of the old fabric including the tracery of the aisle windows. The work was carried out by the firm of E. W. Drury of Sheffield, the cost far exceeding the initial estimate of £700. When the nave was rebuilt in 1914 it was discovered that the arch leading to the chancel had been partly made up of plaster, the wall supported by this arch had not been bonded into the existing chancel walls, and the [...] "oak" [...] roof bosses were also plaster. Between the pillars of the nave sleeper walls had been built to a higher level than the pillar bases. These walls appear to have been needed to counteract the effects on the church structure of a combination of excess drainage from the nearby hillside and the numerous burials inside the church. The pillars of the new nave of 1914 were superimposed on the bases of the old pillars, and the floor built up to cover the sleeper walls.|$|E
60|$|These four parallelisms {{will appear}} the more {{significant}} {{the more we}} contemplate them. While the points specified, are points in which societies agree with individual organisms, they are also points in which individual organisms agree with one another, and disagree with all things else. In the course of its existence, every plant and animal increases in mass, in a way not paralleled by inorganic objects: even such inorganic objects as crystals, which arise by growth, show us no such definite relation between growth and existence as organisms do. The orderly progress from simplicity to complexity, displayed by bodies-politic in common with living bodies, is a characteristic which distinguishes living bodies from the inanimate bodies amid which they move. That functional dependence of parts, which is scarcely more manifest in animals than in nations, has no counterpart elsewhere. And in no aggregate except an organic or a social one, is there a perpetual <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of parts, joined with a continued integrity of the whole. Moreover, societies and organisms are not only alike in these peculiarities, {{in which they are}} unlike all other things; but the highest societies, like the highest organisms, exhibit them in the greatest degree. We see that the lowest animals do not increase to anything like the sizes of the higher ones; and, similarly, we see that aboriginal societies are comparatively limited in their growths. In complexity, our large civilized nations as much exceed primitive savage tribes, as a mammal does a zoophyte. Simple communities, like simple creatures, have so little mutual dependence of parts, that mutilation or subdivision causes but little inconvenience; but from complex communities, as from complex creatures, you cannot remove any considerable organ without producing great disturbance or death of the rest. And in societies of low type, as in inferior animals, the life of the aggregate, often cut short by division or dissolution, exceeds in length the lives of the component units, very far less than in civilized communities and superior animals; which outlive many generations of their component units.|$|E
