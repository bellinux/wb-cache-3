The windshaft and the main parts of the winding system {{including}} the wind direction indicator is installed within the cap. The space inside the arches, until 1930, used to have a wooden structure to store the grain, and an open timber staircase to reach the milling floors. This structure was removed to prevent vandalism. The cap of the mill is a shallow dome which used to be covered with lead sheet, but also because of vandalism is now covered with aluminium. Between the cap and the top of the wall is a system of rollers running in a track plate allowing the cap to be rotated easily.

This study reconceptualizes brand authenticity as a second-order formative-reflective construct with four dimensions (i. e., originality, honesty, perceived quality, and admirability). A scale for brand authenticity was proposed based on existing scales, and was then tested on data collected on Goodwill using Mechanical Turk. SmartPLS (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the Hierarchical Component Model by the <b>repeated</b> <b>indicator</b> approach (Mode A). This study found that brand authenticity is formatively comprised of four theorized dimensions and that the brand authenticity scale is valid and reliable. A positive impact of brand authenticity as well as customer-brand identification on support intentions was supported. Customer-brand identification was a partial mediator between brand authenticity and support intentions. The major contribution of this study will be in improving the conceptualization of brand authenticity by unifying the fragmented literature on the topic and also presenting a well-synthesized scale...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{international}} and national focus on quantitatively measuring and improving ocean health {{has increased the}} need for comprehensive, scientific, and <b>repeated</b> <b>indicators</b> to track progress towards achieving policy and societal goals. The Ocean Health Index (OHI) {{is one of the}} few indicators available for this purpose. Here we present results from five years of annual global assessment for 220 countries and territories, evaluating potential drivers and consequences of changes and presenting lessons learned about the challenges of using composite indicators to measure sustainability goals. Globally scores have shown little change, as would be expected. However, individual countries have seen notable increases or declines due in particular to improvements in the harvest and management of wild-caught fisheries, the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), and decreases in natural product harvest. Rapid loss of sea ice and the consequent reduction of coastal protection from that sea ice was also responsible for declines in overall ocean health in many Arctic and sub-Arctic countries. The OHI performed reasonably well at predicting near-term future scores for many of the ten goals measured, but data gaps and limitations hindered these predictions for many other goals. Ultimately, all indicators face the substantial challenge of informing policy for progress toward broad goals and objectives with insufficient monitoring and assessment data. If countries and the global community hope to achieve and maintain healthy oceans, we will need to dedicate significant resources to measuring what we are trying to manage...|$|R

Hence, this research investigated how these indices were {{formed in the}} Australian mobile-services industry. Its primary objective is to advance the knowledge about the formation of these indices, with emphasis towards (1) identification of a manageable suite of pivotal attributes affecting the indices, (2) development of a research model to explore {{the importance of these}} attributes, and (3) improvement of the model’s predictive power by incorporating the moderating effect of customer usage. As to the attribute determination, the relevant Literature was reviewed and thirty customers were interviewed. Afterwards, threshold tests were used to finalise the Principal Categories which, together with additional pivotal categories from the customer discussion, resulted in ten attributes to be built into the research model. Regarding the structural analysis, the model was evaluated with the data surveyed from 440 users using partial least square (PLS). The conceptualisation of perceived service quality (PSQ) as a second-order formative construct was examined, and PSQ was built into the model using the <b>repeated</b> <b>indicator</b> approach with Mode B (RI-B). The comparison of this with the other two models – the model with the first-order quality dimensions, and the model with the first-order reflective PSQ – suggested that all three models provided satisfactory explanatory power and similar path significance. Therefore, the conceptualisation of PSQ should depend on research aims. With respect to the predictive power, the existence of the moderating effect of usage on the links from performance attributes to the indices was studied using a two-step approach. The outcomes confirmed the positive moderating effect of usage on the PSQ-CS link and suggested that, for heavy users, PSQ contributes more strongly to CS. Consequently, this research contributed to the Literature in many ways. First, the conceptualisation of PSQ as a formative hierarchical construct is insightful. Second, the identified moderating effect explains how usage contributes to the formation of the indices. Third, the use of RI-B and the two-stage analysis shows how to unify both approaches and provides a basis for further studies on hierarchical constructs and moderating effects...|$|R

40|$|Consumer {{awareness}} about ethical issues {{has been growing}} over the last decades. Knowledge and {{awareness about}} ethical products has led to businesses responding {{with a variety of}} ethical products for the consumers. The growth in ethical products market has attracted the interest of researchers as evidenced in a growing body of literature on ethical behaviour. Ethical decision-making models in the extant research tend to emphasise social interest values, such as ethical obligation and ethical self-identity, as predictors of ethical behaviour. However, little is known about factors such as self-interest values and motives, crucial in the formation of attitudes and behaviour towards ethical purchases. Furthermore, research evidence, as well as industry reports, highlights that although consumers generally have a positive attitude towards purchasing ethical products, there is a discrepancy between their attitudes, intention and actual purchase behaviour. Whilst the link between intention and behaviour {{has been found to be}} generally tenuous, studies in the domain of consumer research suggest that intention to purchase can be treated as a predictor of behaviour (i. e., an immediate precursor of actual purchase). The determinants of consumers' intention to purchase ethical products, incorporating self-interest values and motives, are the focus of this study. Much of the prior research in ethical buying behaviour has focused on fast moving consumer goods categories, which are considered to be 'low-involvement' purchases. In contrast, involvement is considered to be an important underlying motivation for consumer purchase of other products such as clothing. Therefore, the product category of ethical clothing is chosen for investigation in this study because of the 'high-involvement' nature of fashion purchases. Understanding the determinants of consumer intention towards ethical buying can provide insights on consumers' motivational state (i. e., social interest and self-interest) influencing ethical choices. Specifically, this research examines the role of involvement in consumers' decision-making process to purchase ethical clothing (direct and moderating effects of clothing involvement). The data were collected via online survey instrument from an existing panel of a UK-based market research company. The proposed research model was tested employing the Partial Least Squares-based Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The direct and moderating effects of clothing involvement were tested by using the two-stage approach. The second-order formative measurement model of clothing involvement (hierarchical components model) was estimated using the <b>repeated</b> <b>indicators</b> approach. The results show that ethical self-identity and subjective norm have a significant impact in ethical clothing purchase decisions. Clothing involvement was found to weaken the relationship between ethical obligation and intention towards ethical buying, whilst it strengthened the relationship between ethical self-identity and intention towards ethical buying. This thesis further establishes that consumers' perceived balance between ethical self¬identity (commitment to individual's ethical augmentation) and clothing involvement (social identity and/or fashion identity) is a step towards bridging the ethical purchasing gap. This thesis is considered to make the following contributions to knowledge and theory in the domain of consumer ethical buying behaviour. First, the formulation of the conceptual model incorporating self-interest values and motives is an advancement of the existing ethical decision-making models for predicting consumer intention to purchase high-involvement ethical products. Second, this study reveals that product involvement plays a moderating role in the consumer ethical decision-making process. Finally, this study provides evidence for the mediating role of ethical obligation on the relationship between attitude and intention...|$|R

Three areas are identified as critical to understanding biology: 1) understanding DNA, 2) examining the overall biological function and 3) evaluating these systems in environmental (ie: turbulent) conditions. DNA is investigated for coding structure and redundancy, and a new tandem <b>repeat</b> region, an <b>indicator</b> of a neurodegenerative disease, is discovered.

Then, the way a single-cell mobilizes in response to a chemical gradient, known as chemotaxis, is examined. Inspiration from receptor clustering in chemotaxis combined with a Hebbian learning method is shown to improve a gradient-source (chemical/thermal) localization algorithm. The algorithm is implemented, and its performance is evaluated in diffusive and turbulent environments. We then show that sensor cross-correlation can be used in solving chemical localization in difficult turbulent scenarios. This leads into future techniques which can be designed for gradient source tracking. These techniques pave the way for use of biologically-inspired sensor networks in chemical localization. Ph. D.

40|$|Transportation {{problems}} {{are related to}} the transport of a product from some sources to a number of different destination. In general, the different delivery will produce different shipping cost, therefore the purpose of solving classic transportation problems with the allocation of delivery from the source to destination is to determine the minimum transportation costs. The appropriate allocating in each case will produce an optimal solution for both minimize case and maximize case. TOCM-SUM approach with the indicator distribution is a new method for seeking initial feasible solution of the transportation problem. This method was proposed by Aminur Rahman Khan, Adrian Vilcu, MD. Sharif Uddin and FlorinaUngureanu. The first step is create a table of transportation, the second step is reduce the elements in each row and column with the smallest elements in every row and column, the third case is form the tables of Total Opportunity Cost Matrix (TOCM), the fourth case is calculate the indicators of distribution of each row and column in the TOCM table, and thereafter, the allocation is given to the cell that has the minimum distribution <b>indicator.</b> <b>Repeat</b> the steps until the total allocation of supply and demand is met, for optimal solutions the method of Stepping Stone is being used.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We used MethyLight, a sensitive real-time PCR-based quantitative method, to analyze DNA methylation levels at 15 CpG islands that are frequently methylated in lung adenocarcinoma and that we had flagged as potential markers for non-invasive detection. We also used two <b>repeat</b> probes as <b>indicators</b> of global DNA hypomethylation. We examined DNA methylation in 249 tissue samples from 93 subjects, spanning the putative spectrum of peripheral lung adenocarcinoma development: histologically normal adjacent non-tumor lung, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS, formerly known as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma), and invasive lung adenocarcinoma. Comparison of DNA methylation levels between the lesion types suggests that DNA hypermethylation of distinct loci occurs at different time points during the development of lung adenocarcinoma. DNA methylation at CDKN 2 A ex 2 and PTPRN 2 is already significantly elevated in AAH, while CpG islands at 2 C 35, EYA 4, HOXA 1, HOXA 11, NEUROD 1, NEUROD 2 and TMEFF 2 are significantly hypermethylated in AIS.

40|$|Aberrant DNA {{methylation}} {{is common}} in lung adenocarcinoma, but its timing in the phases of tumor development is largely unknown. Delineating when abnormal DNA methylation arises may {{provide insight into the}} natural history of lung adenocarcinoma and the role that DNA methylation alterations play in tumor formation. We used MethyLight, a sensitive real-time PCR-based quantitative method, to analyze DNA methylation levels at 15 CpG islands that are frequently methylated in lung adenocarcinoma and that we had flagged as potential markers for non-invasive detection. We also used two <b>repeat</b> probes as <b>indicators</b> of global DNA hypomethylation. We examined DNA methylation in 249 tissue samples from 93 subjects, spanning the putative spectrum of peripheral lung adenocarcinoma development: histologically normal adjacent non-tumor lung, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS, formerly known as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma), and invasive lung adenocarcinoma. Comparison of DNA methylation levels between the lesion types suggests that DNA hypermethylation of distinct loci occurs at different time points during the development of lung adenocarcinoma. DNA methylation at CDKN 2 A ex 2 and PTPRN 2 is already significantly elevated in AAH, while CpG islands at 2 C 35, EYA 4, HOXA 1, HOXA 11, NEUROD 1, NEUROD 2 and TMEFF 2 are significantly hypermethylated in AIS. In contrast, hypermethylation at CDH 13, CDX 2, OPCML, RASSF 1, SFRP 1 and TWIST 1 and global DNA hypomethylation appear to be present predominantly in invasive cancer. The gradual increase in DNA methylation seen for numerous loci in progressively more transformed lesions supports the model in which AAH and AIS are sequential stages in the development of lung adenocarcinoma. The demarcation of DNA methylation changes characteristic for AAH, AIS and adenocarcinoma begins to lay out a possible roadmap for aberrant DNA methylation events in tumor development. In addition, it identifies which DNA methylation changes might be used as molecular markers for the detection of preinvasive lesions...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{inactivity}} is {{most commonly}} found in socially vulnerable groups. Dutch policies target these groups through community-based health-enhancing physical activity (CBHEPA) programs. As robust evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} this approach is limited, this study investigated whether CBHEPA programs contribute to an increase in and the maintenance of physical activity in socially vulnerable groups. In four successive cohorts, starting at a six-month interval, 268 participants from 19 groups were monitored for twelve months in seven CBHEPA programs. Data collection was based on <b>repeated</b> questionnaires. Socio-economic <b>indicators,</b> program participation and coping ability were measured at baseline. Physical activity, health-related quality of life and on-going program participation were measured three times. Self-efficacy and enjoyment were measured at baseline and at twelve months. Statistical analyses were based on a quasi-RCT design (independent t-tests), a comparison of participants and dropouts (Mann-Whitney test), and multilevel modelling to assess change in individual physical activity, including group level characteristics. Participants of CBHEPA programs are socially vulnerable in terms of low education (48. 6 %), low income (52. 4 %), non-Dutch origin (64. 6 %) and health-related quality of life outcomes. Physical activity levels were not below the Dutch average. No increase in physical activity levels over time was observed. The multilevel models showed significant positive associations between health-related quality of life, self-efficacy and enjoyment, and leisure-time physical activity over time. Short CBHEPA programs (10 - 13 weeks) with multiple trainers and gender-homogeneous groups were associated with lower physical activity levels over time. At twelve months, dropouts' leisure-time physical activity levels were significantly lower compared to continuing participants, as were health-related quality of life, self-efficacy and enjoyment outcomes. BMI and care consumption scored significantly higher among dropouts. In conclusion, Dutch CBHEPA programs reach socially vulnerable, but not necessarily inactive, groups in terms of socio-economic and health-related quality of life outcomes. Our findings suggest that CBHEPA programs particularly contribute to physical activity maintenance in socially vulnerable groups, rather than to an increase in physical activity behaviour over time...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} an update {{of a number}} of papers that have been {{published}} by the ONS (Osservatorio nazionale screening, National centre for screening monitoring) since 2002. Data for the survey come from several programmes that may have changed over time, and may have different settings of organization and management. During 2011 - 2012, a slight increase in actual extension was recorded compared to the previous years. Currently, all Italian regions have implemented screening programmes. In 2011 - 2012, almost 5, 300, 000 women aged 50 - 69 years were invited to have a screening mammogram, and almost 3, 000, 000 were screened. While potential extension was 94. 4 %, actual extension was 73. 3 %. An imbalance in extension is still present when comparing northern and central Italy, that have an actual screening extension of 94 % and 86 % respectively, to southern Italy, that has less than 40 %. During the last few years, participation rates have been substantially stable, at around 56 %for crude rate, and 60 % for adjusted rate, respectively. Women actually screened during 2011 - 2012 were 38. 9 %of the national target population. Referral rates of 9. 2 %at first screening and 4. 7 %at repeat screening were recorded, showing an increasing trend in recent years. Detection rate was 4. 8 x 1, 000 at first screening and 4. 4 x 1, 000 at repeat screening, while benign to malignant surgical biopsy ratio for first and repeat screening was 0. 2 and 0. 1, respectively. Detection rate of small (≤ 10 mm) invasive cancers was 1. 3 x 1, 000 at first screening and 1. 4 x 1, 000 at repeat screening; the proportion of in situ carcinomas was 13. 3 %and 12. 0 %for first and <b>repeat</b> screening, respectively. <b>Indicators</b> by 5 -year age group confirm greater diagnostic problems at younger ages (50 - 54 years), with higher referral rates and a substantially lower detection rate as compared to older age groups...|$|R
