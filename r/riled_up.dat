In the third test, Aaqib Javed was warned by the umpires for intimidatory bowling at Devon Malcolm, which <b>riled</b> <b>up</b> the Pakistan team. Accusations of ball tampering to produce their reverse swing were levied at Wasim and Waqar through the British press, after they were reported to the ICC Match Referee after a One-day International at Lord's. The accusations led to a high-level inquiry, but ultimately no players had action taken against them and the furore eventually died away.|$|E
500|$|Set in {{the recent}} past, the musical opens {{on a group of}} {{suburban}} youths living unhappily in [...] "Jingletown, USA" [...] and saturated with TV. Fed up with the state of the union, the company explodes in frustration ("American Idiot"). One of the youths, Johnny ("Jesus of Suburbia"), goes to commiserate with his friend Will. A third friend, Tunny, joins the two and they party until they run out of beer, prompting them to pick up more at the local 7-Eleven. Tunny soon exposes the do-nothing go-nowhere quicksand of their lives ("City of the Damned"). They get <b>riled</b> <b>up,</b> and Johnny challenges his friends to engage ("I Don't Care"). Will's girlfriend, Heather, soon makes an appearance. She is pregnant and doesn't know what to do ("Dearly Beloved"). Johnny borrows money and buys bus tickets to the city for the three young men, eager to escape suburbia. Before the boys are able to leave, Heather tells Will of her pregnancy. With no other choice, he stays home ("Tales of Another Broken Home"). Johnny and Tunny depart for the city with a group of other jaded youths ("Holiday").|$|E

[...] In a simultaneous review {{of the episode}}s of The Simpsons and American Dad! that preceded and followed the episode respectively and The Cleveland Show, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

[...] In the conclusion of his review, VanDerWerff rated the episode as a B-, beating only The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Buried Pleasure". In a slightly less positive review, Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode a 7.7 out of 10, and began his assessment of the episode by stating, [...] "This one will certainly get some politically correct Down syndrome advocates all <b>riled</b> <b>up,</b> but Family Guy is nothing without a little controversy." [...] Isler went on to call the plot [...] "uneven in quality," [...] but with [...] "some moments that could be in the Family Guy 'greatest hits' archive."

However, they ended up saying that the song works.

500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys <b>riled</b> <b>up</b> enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E

You have got all our copra on board, and a good stock of native trumperies, and I should recommend you to be off, both for your own sake and ours. Your men have been more or less drunk ever since they came here. I don't mind a drinking bout myself now and again, but it does not do to keep it up. However, it would be no odds to us whether your men were drunk all the time or not if they would but get drunk on board, but they will bring the liquor on shore, and then they get quarrelsome, use their fists on the natives, and meddle with the women.
