The safety of this material is also being called into question due to similarities in material structure. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer removed fiberglass from its list of possible human carcinogens in 2001 and a scientific review article from 2011 claimed epidemiology data was inconsistent and concluded that the IARC's decision to downgrade the carcinogenic potential of fiberglass was valid (however, this study was funded by sponsored <b>research</b> <b>contract</b> from the North American Insulation Manufacturer’s Association).|$|E

500|$|During World War II, the S-1 Section of {{the federal}} Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) {{sponsored}} an intensive research project on plutonium. The <b>research</b> <b>contract</b> was awarded to scientists at the University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory (Met Lab). At the time, plutonium was a rare element that had only recently been isolated in a University of California laboratory. The Met Lab researchers worked on producing chain-reacting [...] "piles" [...] of uranium to convert it to plutonium and finding ways to separate plutonium from uranium. The program was accelerated in 1942, as the United States government became concerned that scientists in Nazi Germany were developing a nuclear weapons program.|$|E
500|$|RTI {{started with}} three divisions: Isotope Development, Operational Sciences and Statistics Research. Its first {{contract}} was a $4,500 statistical study of morbidity data from Tennessee. In RTI's {{first year of}} operation, it had 25 staff and $240,000 in research contracts. Its early work was focused on statistics, but {{within a few years}} expanded into radioisotopes, organic chemistry and polymers. In 1960 the Institute had its first international <b>research</b> <b>contract,</b> for an agricultural census in Nigeria. RTI won contracts with the Department of Education, Defense Department, NASA and the Atomic Energy Commission, growing to $3.4 million in contracts in 1964 and $85 million in 1988.|$|E

President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative resulted in the largest <b>research</b> <b>contract</b> in Georgia Tech's history in 1985. The $21.3 million contract (equivalent to $ million in [...] ) was divided between GTRI and the School of Electrical Engineering. [...] GTRI landed its own largest-ever contract in 1986$14.7 million (equivalent to $ million in [...] ) to create a Soviet surface-to-air missile system simulator. In 1989, as part of a project with the U.S. Army, and using technology it had been developing since the late 1960s, GTRI completed the largest outdoor compact antenna range at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987 Ballard won a {{contract}} with Perry Oceanographics to provide fuel cells for their small submersibles. After some difficulties in developing a stack of the required 2kW size using their then-current" [...] Mark IV" [...] cell design, the system was successfully installed {{and became one of}} the first commercial fuel cell system since the 1960s. An upgrade to the [...] "Mark V" [...] cell design dramatically improved performance, providing 4.1kW from a stack the same size as the original 2kW model. A contract with the Royal Navy soon followed, and although the resulting cells were not used as the Royal Navy decided to go all-nuclear, a <b>research</b> <b>contract</b> allowed the company to continue improving the cells.|$|E
2500|$|The Teamsters {{began to}} expand {{dramatically}} and mature organizationally under Tobin. When {{he was elected}} president, power in the union was held by big-city locals—which handled all <b>research,</b> <b>contract</b> negotiations, legal services, communication and strike activity. [...] Tobin pushed {{for the development of}} [...] "joint councils" [...] to which all local unions were forced to affiliate. [...] Varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction, the joint councils became important incubators for up-and-coming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry. As collective bargaining became the norm throughout the Teamsters, Tobin actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts. Tobin also founded and edited (for a time) the union magazine, the International Teamster.|$|E
