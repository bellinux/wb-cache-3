5000|$|Ember.js is a {{client-side}} JavaScript {{web application}} framework {{based on the}} model-view-controller (MVC) software architectural pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page applications by incorporating common idioms and best practices into a framework that provides a <b>rich</b> <b>object</b> model, declarative two-way data binding, computed properties, automatically-updating templates powered by Handlebars.js, and a router for managing application state.|$|E
5000|$|Applications {{developed}} in Cocoa, the system {{formerly known as}} OpenStep, offer a <b>rich</b> <b>object</b> runtime that can be queried from any other application. This makes implementation of the AEOM considerably easier, dramatically {{reducing the amount of}} code needed in the average application. Additionally the majority of Cocoa applications are constructed primarily from Cocoa-standard objects, all of which were upgraded to offer fairly extensive scriptability. This extends not only to GUI objects as under MacApp, but also to data objects inside them, including text, tables and various list objects. A text file is used to map the internal [...] "object-like" [...] names onto human-readable versions, and in most cases creating this is all that is needed to add fairly substantial scriptability to most programs.|$|E

50|$|The Semantic Web is {{essentially}} a distributed objects framework. Two key technologies in the Semantic Web are the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the Resource Description Framework (RDF).

OWL adds a <b>richer</b> <b>object</b> model, based on set theory, that provides additional modeling capabilities such as multiple inheritance.|$|R
40|$|Object class {{detection}} in {{real world}} images has been a synonym for object localization for the longest time. State-of-the-art detection methods, inspired by renowned detection benchmarks, typically target 2 D bounding box localization of objects. At the same time, due to the rapid technological and scientific advances, high-level vision applications, aiming at understanding the visual world as a whole, are coming into the focus. The diversity of the visual world challenges these applications in terms of representational complexity, robust inference and training data. As objects {{play a central role}} in any vision system, it has been argued that <b>richer</b> <b>object</b> representations, providing higher level of detail than modern detection methods, are a promising direction towards understanding visual scenes. Besides bridging the gap between object class detection and high-level tasks, <b>richer</b> <b>object</b> representations also lead to more natural object descriptions, bringing computer vision closer to human perception. Inspired by these prospects, this thesis explores four different directions towards <b>richer</b> <b>object</b> representations, namely, 3 D object representations, fine-grained representations, occlusion representations, as well as understanding convnet representations. Moreover, this thesis illustrates that <b>richer</b> <b>object</b> representations can facilitate high-level applications, providing detailed and natural object descriptions. In addition, the presented representations attain high performance rates, at least on par or often superior to state-of-the-art methods. Detektion von Objektklassen in natürlichen Bildern war lange Zeit gleichbedeutend mit Lokalisierung von Objekten. Von anerkannten Detektions-Benchmarks inspirierte Detektionsmethoden, die auf dem neuesten Stand der Forschung sind, zielen üblicherweise auf die Lokalisierung von Objekten im Bild. Gleichzeitig werden durch den schnellen technologischen und wissenschaftlichen Fortschritt abstraktere Bildverarbeitungsanwendungen, die ein Verständnis der visuellen Welt als Ganzes anstreben, immer interessanter. Die Diversität der visuellen Welt ist eine Herausforderung für diese Anwendungen hinsichtlich der Komplexität der Darstellung, robuster Inferenz und Trainingsdaten. Da Objekte eine zentrale Rolle in jedem Visionssystem spielen, wurde argumentiert, dass reichhaltige Objektrepräsentationen, die höhere Detailgenauigkeit als gegenwärtige Detektionsmethoden bieten, ein vielversprechender Schritt zum Verständnis visueller Szenen sind. Reichhaltige Objektrepräsentationen schlagen eine Brücke zwischen der Detektion von Objektklassen und abstrakteren Aufgabenstellungen, und sie führen auch zu natürlicheren Objektbeschreibungen, wodurch sie die Bildverarbeitung der menschlichen Wahrnehmung weiter annähern. Aufgrund dieser Perspektiven erforscht die vorliegende Arbeit vier verschiedene Herangehensweisen zu reichhaltigeren Objektrepräsentationen...|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, {{the crown}} was {{discovered}} by a woman from Cedros, who, when she heard that they were searching for it, was suspicious that they were pirates and attempted to hide the crown. She wisely raised her skirt, and placed her leg through the ring-like crown, and passed unbeknownst to the pirates. Realizing {{the value of the}} object, and not wanting her contemporaries to know what she had hidden, she continued to wear the crown around her leg until it began to swell and hurt. In the end she informed the towns-people, who attempted to extricate the woman from the crown, washing her leg in water and ash soap to loosen it, but without success. In the end, the residents had no alternative but to cut the crown and later re-solder it cautiously. In the end the crown remained in the parish of Cedros and over time it was used in the feasts to the Divine Holy Spirit. With the passing of time and fearful of damaging such a symbolic and <b>rich</b> <b>object,</b> a copy of the crown was created, and the original was hidden away and guarded. As the legend ends, the crown continues to be guarded every year at the home of the mordomo of the Holy Spirit feasts, and that the cuts are still visible around the crown. It is unknown whether any part of the above story is more than legend.|$|E

The required visibility information is provided using a custom ray tracing acceleration data structure for multiple frames simultaneously.

40|$|A {{frequent}} {{dilemma in}} programming language design {{is the choice}} between a language with a rich set of notations and a small, simple core language. We address this dilemma by proposing extensible grammars, a syntax-definition formalism for incremental language extensions and restrictions. The translation of programs written in <b>rich</b> <b>object</b> languages into a small core language is defined via syntax-directed patterns. In contrast to macroexpansion and program-rewriting tools, our extensible grammars respect scoping rules. Therefore, we can introduce binding constructs while avoiding problems with unwanted name clashes. We develop extensible grammars and illustrate their use by extending the lambda calculus with let-bindings, conditionals, and constructs from database programming languages, such as SQL query expressions. We then give a formal description of the underlying rules for parsing, transformation, and substitution. Finally, we sketch how these rules are exploited in an implementati [...] ...|$|E
