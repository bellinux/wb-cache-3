40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds on the antioxidative defense system and oxidative stress in rats fed a high fat · high cholesterol diet. Rats were divided into four experimental groups which were composed of high fat · high cholesterol diet group (HF), high fat · high cholesterol diet with 0. 1 % ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented group (HEA), high fat · high cholesterol diet with 0. 2 % ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented group (HEB) and high fat·high cholesterol diet with 0. 5 % ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented group (HEC). Supplementation of ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds groups (HEA, HEB and HEC) resulted in significantly increased activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and catalase. Hepatic superoxide radical contents in microsome and mitochondria were significantly reduced in the groups supplemented with <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds ethanol extracts. Hepatic hydrogen peroxide content in the mitochondria was reduced in ethanol extracts from <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds supplemented groups. TBARS values in the liver were reduced in <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds ethanol extracts supplemented groups. Especially, HEB and HEC groups were significantly decreased compared to the HF group. Hepatic carbonyl values were significantly reduced in mitochondria in these supplemented groups. These results suggest that <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds ethanol extracts may reduce oxidative damage, by activation of antioxidative defense system in rats fed high fat · high cholesterol diets...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds powder on lipid metabolism in rats fed high fatㆍhigh cholesterol diet.

The serum triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol contents, and LDL-cholesterol and atherogenic index (AI) of the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seed powder supplemented groups were significantly decreased compared to the HF group. The serum HDL-cholesterol contents of the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seed powder supplemented groups were increased compared to the HF group. However, there was no significant difference in the serum HDL-cholesterol among all experimental groups. The hepatic TG and cholesterol contents of the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seed powder supplemented groups were sig-nificantly decreased compared to the HF group. The fecal total cholesterol and triglyceride contents of the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> seeds powder supplemented groups were significantly increased compared to the HF group.

Each diet was fed to three replicate batteries of hens with each battery consisting of a row of five cages of hens with two hens per cage (n = 3). In Exp. 2, 180, thirty-wk old, Hyline Brown laying hens, housed similarly to those in Exp. 1, were fed an unsupplemented basal diet as well as treatments in which the basal diet was supplemented with 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed in a laboratory blender to an average particle size of 300 μm, 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed as a super fine powder with a vibrational mill (44 μm) and finally 0. 8 % <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder processed as a super fine powder with a vibrational mill but mixed with 5 % Na 2 CO 3 either before or after grinding. A diet supplemented with 0. 3 ppm carophyll red pigment was also included (n = 3). In both experiments, hens were fed the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder or pigment for 14 days. After feeding of the powder or pigment was terminated, all hens were fed the basal diet for eight more days to determine if the dietary treatments had any residual effects. In Exp. 1, there were no differences in egg-laying performance, feed consumption or feed conversion ratio due to inclusion of <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> pigment in the diet. Average egg weight was higher (p 0. 05). However, compared with the control group, supplementation with all of the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder treatments increased egg weight (p< 0. 05). All the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> powder treatments also increased (p< 0. 05) the yolk color score compared with the control.

Anti-obesity effects of <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> and Zanthoxylum schinifolium ethanol extract were investigated with mice fed high fat diet for 8 weeks. Sixty mice were classified to 6 groups of ND (normal diet), HFD (high fat diet), RP (high fat diet+red pepper (0. 1 g/ 60 kg)), CP (high fat diet+Chinese pepper (0. 1 g/ 60 kg)), RCP (high fat diet+red pepper: Chinese pepper= 1 : 1 (0. 1 g/ 60 kg)), HCA (high fat diet+HCA (0. 1 g/ 60 kg)) experiments. This research showed that final weight, weight gain, food efficiency ratio, and river weight were decreased {{by the addition of}} <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> and Zanthoxylum schinifolium ethanol extract comparing to those of HFD group.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the response}} of producer, wholesale, retail, and international trade prices to shocks in prices in upstream or downstream stages in the Dutch onion and <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> supply chains. The analysis allows for asymmetric adjustment among food prices when the wholesale or retail stages exert oligopoly power. The study provides a theoretical underpinning {{of the relationship between}} domestic and international prices. Asymmetries in price transmission are examined using the Houck as well as the error-correction approaches. The impulse response analyses show that <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> prices return to their long-term equilibria relatively quickly, whereas onion prices settle at a new equilibrium after a price shock. Market power in the wholesale sector affects the responses of onion prices but has little or no effect on the responses of <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> prices. Market power in the retail sector does not affect the onion prices or the <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> prices. Analysis of weekly price data over the period from 2005 to 2008 suggests asymmetric adjustment in producer-wholesale and international-producer prices in the Dutch onion supply chain.
