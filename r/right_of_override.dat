As a general rule, non-historic civilian shipwrecks are considered fair game for salvage. Under international maritime law, for shipwrecks of a certain age, the original owner may have lost all claim to the cargo. Anyone who finds the wreck can then file a salvage claim on it and place a lien on the vessel, and subsequently mount a salvage operation (see Finders, keepers).

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} dystopian and utopian science fiction novels {{in order to}} {{highlight}} and discuss the conflict between personal freedom and happiness in society. The chosen primary texts are studied with supporting evidence from ethical philosophy to analyse changing views on freewill and identity. It becomes clear through comparison of these texts that the individual’s perception of freedom is largely dependent on the form of oppression they are exposed to. These utopian and dystopian fictions are not only analysed as social commentaries but as works of philosophy {{in their own right}} as each text reveals inherent issues in communal living and provides insight into possible solutions. These issues revolve around conflict between the individual and the community, specifically when the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the group <b>override</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the individual. The concluding argument theorizes that freedom and happiness are unable to exist together in society based on the philosophical and fictional evidence, which highlights freedom as detrimental to happiness...|$|R

International assistance with regard to the public provision of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) has been closely associated with this shift, resulting in a new hope for the widespread treatment of AIDS. ARV drugs themselves have also undergone substantial technical development. Simpler, combined dosage formats and a greater range of suitable medications provide more options for short-course interventions (to prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child) and for long-term treatment of AIDS with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the relevance of the signals generated by a computerized drug–drug inter-action detection system and to design a classification <b>of</b> <b>overridden</b> drug–drug interaction alerts. Study Design. Prospective study over two months. Setting. Five hundred and ten-bed university paediatric hospital. Main Outcome Measures. In Robert Debre ́ Hospital physicians generate drug orders online using a computerized physician order entry system that also detects drug–drug interactions in real time. We analysed the relevance of a sample of alerts over-ridden by physicians. Results. We analysed a sample <b>of</b> 613 <b>overridden</b> alerts. We defined three categories <b>of</b> <b>overridden</b> alerts: informational errors (35); system errors (244) and accurate alerts (334). Two reasons account for 40 % of false-positive alerts: an inability of the system to recognize real conflicts between drug treatments and guidelines stating that the two drugs can be used together, because the benefit outweighs the risk of side effects due to the drug–drug interaction. Conclusions. We created a classification <b>of</b> <b>overridden</b> alerts, in the context of computerized physician order entry system coupled with a drug–drug interaction detection system. There is clearly room for improvement in the development of drug– drug interaction software. This classification should make it possible to break this work down into smaller tasks, making i...|$|R

The objective of this study is to determine appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>overridden</b> medication-related CDS overrides in the ICU. Materials and methods: We evaluated <b>overridden</b> medication-related alerts <b>of</b> four alert categories from January 2009 to December 2011.
