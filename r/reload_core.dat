The proposed amendment is required to support safe operation of the plant during the next operating cycle (Cycle 28). During the current operating cycle (Cycle 27), KPS has experienced two prolonged shutdown periods, the first between February 20 and July 2 of 2005 and the second between April 26 and May 23 of 2006. Due to these prolonged shutdown periods, the KPS core did not experience the fuel burnup that was anticipated when the Cycle 27 and 28 core designs were developed. Therefore, the fuel burned in Cycle 27 that {{will remain in the}} core during Cycle 28 will have more reactivity than originally anticipated.

An excellent core loading pattern can not only enhance operation factor, reduce operation cost, but also increase operation safety.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} the development of a comprehensive, rapid and conceptually simple methodology for PWR <b>core</b> <b>reload</b> pattern and fuel composition optimization, capable of systematic incorporation of constraints, in which cycle burnup is defined as the optimality criterion. A coarse mesh nodal method for PWR core analysis was formulated by coupling the one-and-one-half-group diffusion theory model for spatial power calculations with the linear reactivity versus burnup model (LRM) for depletion calculations. The accuracy and suitability of this model was determined through comparisons of its results with those of state-of-the-art core analysis methods. The simplicity of the LRM-based core model allowed the direct analytical computation of the derivatives necessary in the steepest gradient type optimization methods applied in the present work, and its versatility permitted use of the analytical and computational methods for a variety of applications, ranging from <b>core</b> <b>reload</b> pattern searches to burnable poison (BP) and composition optimization. Algorithms for identification of unconstrained maximum-burnup <b>core</b> <b>reload</b> patterns and for optimal BP allocation were successfully implemented and tested, and the basis for systematic incorporation of constraints on power peaking was developed. The potential application of the methodology to fuel composition optimization was also examined. Most of the methodological developments have been embodied in the LRM-NODAL code which was programmed {{in the course of this}} research. From the numerical and analytical results it was found that the optimal core configurations are arranged such as to produce power histories and profiles in which the most reactive assemblies are at their highest allowable power at EOC (thus maximizing their importance) and where the converse applies to the least reactive; these preferred profiles also produce relatively higher leakage at EOC, evolving to the lowest possible leakage at EOC, but always consistent with the maximization of the core reactivity importance.

40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} to optimize pressurized water reactor <b>core</b> <b>reload</b> design for low-leakage fuel management, a strategy recently adopted by most utilities to extend cycle length and mitigate pressurized thermal shock concerns. The method consists of a two-stage optimization process which provides the maximum cycle length for a given fresh fuel loading subject to power peaking constraints. In the first stage, a best fuel arrangement is determined at the end-of-cycle {{in the absence of}} burnable poisons. A direct search method is employed in conjunction with a constant power, Haling depletion. In the second stage, the core control poison requirements are determined using a linear programming technique. The solution provides the fresh fuel burnable poison loading required to meet core power peaking constraints. An accurate method of explicitly modeling burnable absorbers was developed for this purpose. ^ The design method developed here was implemented in a currently-recognized fuel licensing code, SIMULATE, that was adapted to the CYBER- 205 computer. This methodology was applied to <b>core</b> <b>reload</b> design of cycles 9 and 10 for the Commonwealth Edison Zion, Unit- 1 Reactor.

Cycle length increase is a direct measure of economic savings for a given fuel loading. The results of cycle 10 optimization produced similar improvements. ^ The research represents the first use of an accurate, commercially acceptible neutronics modeling method in an automated optimization procedure which also incorporates burnable absorber design strategy. ...|$|R

Although the proposed irradiation of this limited number of fuel rods to high burnup does not require any Technical Specification changes, a specific safety evaluation will be performed for the condition consistent with the existing <b>core</b> <b>reload</b> program to ensure that no unreviewed safety question exists as defined by 10 CFR 50. 59. U 0 o 5928 - 00 - 20394 Page 2 A licensing basis commitment on rod burnup limits affects the implementation of this proposed program in that the four fuel rods will operate to burnup levels in excess of the lead rod burnup limit currently identified for Framatome Cogema Fuels (FCF) Mark-B fuel. These limits are specified in NRC approved Framatome Cogema Fuels Topical Reports BAW- 101 86 P-A...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Reactor {{refueling}} is a computationally intensive {{problem solving}} process that requires automation since significant resources are expended upon {{the search for}} an optimal core loading. Without imposing some constraints upon the configurations investigated, an extremely large number of prototype loadings may be generated without discovery of an improved loading. As the result of years of study upon the problem, a fuel management expert understands how to direct and constrain the search for an acceptable minimum peak power loading. This research attempts to automate the expert's knowledge with the ease of representation and maintenance the tools of artificial intelligence (AI) are most specialized. It seeks to make his expertise generally available. The structure, operators, and search methods for representation of the <b>core</b> <b>reload</b> problem are identified and reveal the limitations which many expert system tools have for its solution. An object-oriented representation allows a natural means to define components {{of the problem and}} share many dependent attributes of objects in the representation consistently. The expert system prototype, Shuffle, is written in Smalltalk, an object-oriented programming language, and evaluates loadings as it generates them using a two group, two dimensional power calculation compiled in a PC-based FORTRAN. Proven strategies of fuel management experts were incorporated on top of an object oriented representation in a highly interactive environment. Shuffle currently includes three strategies or subgoals, each subgoal progressively positioning less reactive fuel by distinct move instructions. Each subgoal is implemented as a hierarchical subclass of constraints and heuristics that generally remain consistent with each new loading. These constraints include requirements for a modified out-in loading pattern with map regions declared as even, odd, intermediate, and peripheral. Evaluating the intelligence of Shuffle requires an analysis of both its rate of convergence toward an improved pattern and its ability to correct {{what appears to be a}} poor pattern. Some experiments with test patterns revealed that additional constraints could improve convergence but may limit exploration by the system...|$|R
