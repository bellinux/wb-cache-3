25|$|The {{mechanics}} of drag systems usually consist of {{any number of}} discs (drag washers) arranged in a stack on the spool shaft or in some cases, on the drive shaft. There is generally a screw or lever mechanism that presses against the washers—the higher the pressure, the greater the resistance. Drag washers are commonly made of materials such as steel, Teflon, carbon fiber, other <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> or metal alloys. Since large fish can generate a lot of pulling power, reels with higher available drag forces (which generate greater heat) for higher-test lines will use stronger and more heat-resistant materials than reels designed for low-test lines. A good drag system is consistent (generates the same force over and over), durable and smooth (no jerkiness).|$|E

However, current fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> joint {{standards}} are based on standards written for their metallic counterparts, and the relevant design codes lack reliable design guidelines. We have developed an innovative fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> joining technique to address these and other problems that {{have been reported in}} the literature. The proposed joint can be used with filament wound pipes, the most common fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> pipe manufacturing technique. This joint can be manufactured using current filament winding equipment with minor alterations. This report emphasizes the design concept and the development of the design calculations for the proposed fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> joint. Pipe joints are susceptible to two failure mechanisms, failure from the standpoint of strength and leakage. The strength design procedure is derived from first principles taking into account the orthotropy of the fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> material. The leakage analysis follows the guidelines of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel code. The analytical design calculations are checked using finite element analysis. The agreement is excellent. We also conducted a detailed finite element analysis of a particular joint, designed using the simplified method, in order to assess the safety of the simple design calculations.

2500|$|Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) {{is among}} the hardest of all tool {{materials}} and is therefore extremely resistant to wear. [...] It consists of a layer of diamond particles, typically about [...] thick, bonded as a sintered mass to a tungsten-carbide support.

It should be noted that PCD is not used on ferrous metals due to excess wear resulting from a reaction between the carbon in the PCD and the iron in the metal.|$|E

End-fitting is a mechanical device that forms {{the transition from the}} spoolable <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> line pipe to the connector.
