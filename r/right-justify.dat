40|$|Ling and Marinov (L & M) have {{constructed}} {{an interesting}} symbolic alternative to current connectionist models of language acquisition. The kind of detailed comparison of connectionist and symbolic models {{that they are}} pursuing works to clarify and solidify the basis of modelling as a research tool in cognitive science. Work {{such as that of}} Shavlik, Mooney, and Towell (1991) shows that symbolic pattern associators (SPA) can rival artificial neural networks (ANN) across a wide range of tasks. Moreover, these SPA models often run more quickly and can be interpreted through a concrete set of easily summarized production rules. Together, these various properties make SPAs good competitors with ANNs, particularly when issues of psychological and neuropsychological verisimilitude are not at stake. L & M believe that their model outperforms the connectionist model presented by MacWhinney and Leinbach (1991) (M & L) &quot;by a wide margin&quot;. This conclusion is incorrect, because many of the numbers they use to support the conclusion are incorrect. In fact the performance of the two models is remarkably similar along virtually all relevant dimensions. The actual figures that should have been included in Table 4 from L & M are as shown here in Table 1. The simulation from which the results in Table 1 are taken is a minimalized version of the simulation reported on in M & L. It only uses <b>right-justified</b> representations, one pool of hidden units, and no copy units. These changes were made not to improve performance, but {{to make it easier for}} others to replicate these results in their own laboratories.
