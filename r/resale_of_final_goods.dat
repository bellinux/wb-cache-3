I obtain the following three results. First, population and labour efficiency have different roles in the income elasticity of demand, thus having different impacts on the number <b>of</b> <b>final</b> <b>goods.</b> Second, given the number <b>of</b> <b>final</b> <b>goods,</b> the composition <b>of</b> varieties {{is determined by the}} relative importance of desirability and technological feasibility <b>of</b> each <b>final</b> <b>good.</b> Finally, the equilibrium number and composition <b>of</b> <b>final</b> <b>goods</b> may not necessarily be the same as the optimal ones.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the two most recent European Union enlargements on CEECs trade <b>of</b> intermediate and <b>final</b> products separately. A theoretically justified gravity model which incorporates the extensive margin of trade and accounts for firm heterogeneity is estimated using highly disaggregated trade data for the period 1999 to 2009. We hypothesize that the CEECs have a comparative advantage on the assembly <b>of</b> <b>final</b> <b>goods</b> and evaluate {{the effect of the}} EU-accession on CEECs imports in intermediates products and on CEECs export <b>of</b> <b>final</b> <b>goods</b> to OECD countries. To capture the importance of production networks, imported intermediate products from the OECD are added as a determinant of the corresponding exports <b>of</b> <b>final</b> <b>goods.</b> We find a positive and significant effect of accession on CEECs trade <b>of</b> intermediate and <b>final</b> <b>goods.</b> In particular, deeper integration and the consequent elimination of behind the border trade barriers have had a positive impact {{not only in terms of}} increasing trade volumes, but also in terms of increasing trade varieties between the two parts of the European continent.

40|$|We analyze a rational-expectations {{model of}} {{information}} acquisition and price formation in an intermediate- good market: prices and net supply are non-negative, there are no noise traders, and the intermediate good has multiple potential uses. Several of our results differ from the classic Grossman-Stiglitz approach. For example, the price mechanism is more informative at high and low prices and potentially uninformative at middle prices. Also, an informed trade by a producer <b>of</b> one <b>final</b> <b>good</b> amounts to a noise trade {{from the perspective of}} a producer <b>of</b> another <b>final</b> <b>good,</b> so (a) as the price mechanism becomes more informative for producers <b>of</b> one <b>final</b> <b>good,</b> it becomes less informative for producers of others, who therefore have a stronger incentive to acquire information, so information acquisition has the strategic-complements property between groups, and (b) having more producers (in multiple groups) become informed need not increase the informativeness of the price mechanism. ...|$|R

We find a positive effect on both export intensity, the value of exports, and export diversification, the number of exported products.

30|$|The {{continuous}} {{appreciation of}} the Yen and the rapid aging of the Japanese population have forced Japanese firms to shrink domestic production and to enlarge overseas production, by reducing production costs and seeking new markets.

(2) An increase of value-added, through which the production shift is induced from Japan to Japanese subsidiaries in China, is smaller than the reduction of value-added in Japan. (3) A change in the compensation of employees is also similar to that of value-added, which suggests that the production shift might be related to the cost reduction. (4) Worldwide suppliers that distribute some key intermediate goods, like “Electronic components” against “Household electronic equipment, and communication equipment,” might not suffer so much from such a production shift.|$|R
