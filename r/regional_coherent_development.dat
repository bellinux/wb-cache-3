We {{have developed an}} object oriented timetabling framework that adapts to varied problem structures, and allows for easy and flexible maintenance of timetabling algorithms and constraints. We use the Unified Modelling Language for problem structure representations and Object Constraint Language for constraint expressions. The model is easier to understand as compared to mathematical formulations and results in <b>coherent</b> <b>development</b> from problem specification to software constructions. We also describe an application that we have instantiated from this framework. ...|$|R

They include isolated folds with axial traces up to 200 km long, trains of tightly folded structures tens of km long, and thrusts.

Crater counts on the deformed terrain point to Noachian to Early Hesperian ages. On the basis of the geometry and geological relations of these structures, we propose that they form part of an old martian orogen, the Thaumasia–Aonia Orogen, which embraced not only the Thaumasia Plateau, but areas of Daedalia Planum, Aonia Terra and Nereidum Montes as well.
