40|$|The {{intensive}} {{exploration of}} melon (Cucumis melo L.) crops in the Brazilian Northeast favors {{the occurrence of}} root diseases such as the <b>Rhizoctonia</b> <b>canker,</b> caused by Rhizoctonia solani. Twenty melon genotypes were challenged against the pathogen isolates RS- 9 and RS- 10 aiming at selecting those potentially useful for breeding programs and/or integrated disease management. Seeds were planted in infested soil (50 mg of colonized rice grains kg- 1 of soil). Disease severity was assessed 15 days after inoculation, {{by means of a}} disease scale from 0 to 4, used later to cluster genotypes in five classes. None of the genotypes presented immune-like reaction to R. solani, independent of the pathogen isolate. Disease severity ranged from 6. 2 to 85. 4 % and from 7. 8 to 85. 2 %, for isolates RS- 9 and RS- 10, respectively. When both isolates were considered simultaneously, genotypes Sancho, AF- 1805, Athenas, AF- 682, Torreon, and Galileo were highly resistant. Genotypes Sancho and AF- 1805 had the lowest disease severity levels in relation to isolate RS- 9, and genotype Gold Pride, in relation to RS- 10. These genotypes differed significantly from the others, within isolates. Therefore, they are potential sources of resistance to R. solani and should be considered as a priority planting choice in infested areas...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Diseases {{of tomato}} were {{investigated}} in four plots at a University farm located in Choba, {{a community of}} the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria. Disease symptoms included irregular leafspots, dark brown lesions with chlorotic halos, vein clearing, chlorosis, yellowing, blight, wilts and defoliation. Flower blight and drop was observed in the plants that reached the flowering stage before dieing. Other symptoms were stunting, stem canker, die-back, shriveling of stem and death. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, Verticillium albo-atrum and Rhizoctonia solani were the three fungi isolated on acidified potato dextrose agar from symptomatic roots and stems of permanently wilted plant samples. Pathogenicity of isolates was established. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} Fusarium, Verticillium and Rhizoctonia spp. limit production of tomato in this part of Nigeria. The study also confirms earlier reports that Fusarium wilt limits tomato production in the forest zone and also establishes Verticillium wilt and <b>Rhizoctonia</b> stem <b>canker</b> and root rot as other important diseases limiting tomato production in Rivers State. Therefore the production of tomato requires the development of efficient control systems to reduce economic loss associated with these diseases. @ JASEM Tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.) is grown in many parts of Nigeria both as wet and dry season crops. Although most tomato production is at a smal...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of organic}} soil {{amendments}} on populations of mycophagous springtails and nematodes and on <b>Rhizoctonia</b> solani stem <b>canker</b> of potato were investigated in two field experiments each lasting two years. The organic amendments {{consisted of three}} green manure crops (white mustard, forage rape and oats), and farmyard manure (FYM, alone or in combination with white mustard). In Year 1, before the application of soil amendments, experimental fields were infested with R. solani by growing a potato crop from seed tubers severely infested with black scurf. In the next year potato was grown again as test crop. In Experiment 1, there was a moderate degree of Rhizoctonia stem infection in the test crop. Organic amendments reduced the disease severity and increased populations of mycophagous soil organisms. The greatest reduction in disease severity was found when FYM application was combined with white mustard or when oats was grown as green manure crop. In Experiment 2, Rhizoctonia stem infection was so severe that emergence of potatoes in the test crop was reduced. Again, soil fauna populations were increased by farmyard manure combined with mustard and also when oats was grown as green manure crop. The disease severity was only slightly reduced by the former treatment, and significantly by the latter one. FYM+white mustard increased the springtail populations and {{had no effect on}} mycophagous nematodes, whereas oats increased the numbers of mycophagous nematodes tenfold. The results from both experiments support the hypothesis that stimulating the populations of mycophagous soil mesofauna can contribute to a reduction in Rhizoctonia disease severity in potato...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of faba bean (Phaseolus lunatus) is limited {{due to the}} occurrence of <b>Rhizoctonia</b> <b>canker,</b> caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani. In order to select materials with potential for use in faba beans breeding programs and/or disease integrated management, 72 genotypes were evaluated and also stability of the disease resistance in relation to different pathogen isolates, inoculum densities and soil type. The seeds were sown in soil infested with the pathogen {{by the addition of}} colonized substrate (rice grains). The evaluation of genotypes was done after 15 days, using a note scale to discriminate the genotypes into five reaction classes. None of the 72 genotypes showed immunity to R. solani and only four genotypes (F- 42, F- 49, F- 53 and F- 58) behaved as highly resistant. The reactions presented by these genotypes varied according to the R. solani isolate, inoculum density and soil used. The genotype F- 58 showed more stable resistance to pathogen isolates and inoculum densities. The genotype F- 53 showed resistance stability in soils collected in different locations, remaining highly resistant in all situations. The genotype F- 58 did not show high resistance to only one tested soil. Therefore, the genotypes F- 58 and F- 53 are promising sources of resistance to R. solani and should be indicated in areas infested by the pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops in New Zealand and internationally. Potato plants are susceptible to a range of pathogenic diseases, including the Rhizoctonia diseases, which are globally ubiquitous. Since synthetic fungicide control of the causal pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani KÃ¼hn, is not always efficacious, combined with a current drive to reduce synthetic agrichemical inputs in New Zealand agriculture, alternatives should be sought. The present study examined the potential for biological control (biocontrol) of Rhizoctonia diseases of potato from a New Zealand agricultural perspective. The study included investigations into inundative biocontrol (introduction of single/multiple strains of soil microorganisms) and conservation biocontrol, including organic matter amendments and crop rotation practice. To investigate inundative biocontrol, isolations were conducted from New Zealand potato cropping soils for members of the genera Trichoderma, Pseudomonas and Bacillus, identified as strong potential biocontrol candidates from previous published studies. Comparisons between the bacterial isolates in dual culture with two R. solani strains suggested that one soil (from the Pukekohe region) harboured Pseudomonads with greater suppressive potential than those from three other soils. In greenhouse assays, selected isolates (89) were applied to plant growth medium as fungal spore or bacterial cell suspensions, to test for their capacity to suppress Rhizoctonia diseases of potato. Initially, 22 isolates demonstrated positive impacts on either <b>Rhizoctonia</b> <b>canker</b> symptoms and/or on plant parameters (e. g. tuber number or weight). However, no isolates gave strong and consistant suppression of Rhizoctonia diseases in repeated assays. The results indicated that inundative biocontrol was insufficient to achieve strong, consistent suppression of Rhizoctonia diseases of potato, when applied in this commercially realistic manner. Investigations into conservation biocontrol included testing several organic matter (OM) amendments previously suggested as potential suppressors of Rhizoctonia diseases of potato. These OMs were based on pine bark compost, chitin or biochar. Very slight disease suppression was detected. Results from analysis of soil community substrate utilisation showed that increases in activity or diversity as a result of OM amendment, at commercially viable concentrations, were insufficient to suppress Rhizoctonia diseases. The soil population of R. solani AG 3 and AG 2 - 1, and fungal and bacterial soil community structure, as a result of four crop rotation treatments (including potato monoculture) from the Pukekohe region were assessed. No rotation treatment increased pathogen inoculum. Soil bacterial community was not affected by rotation treatment. Fungal community was affected by the most recent crop, but not crop sequence. The impact of the four rotation treatments on Rhizoctonia disease expression was also assessed. Soils from all four treatments gave similar disease expression. Culture dependent and independent techniques used to determine soil fungal and bacterial community richness, diversity or metabolic activity demonstrated that increases in these parameters did not correlate with decreases in Rhizoctonia disease measures. The study concluded that consistent biocontrol of Rhizoctonia diseases of potato probably requires the presence and stimulation of a specific, small group of suppressive organisms. For biocontrol of these diseases to be a reliable option for potato growers, biocontrol agents will probably require appropriate and economically feasible nutritional support when introduced into crop disease management strategies...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to determine the role of 3 -methylthioproprionic acid (MTPA) in the pathogenicity of potato stem <b>canker,</b> <b>Rhizoctonia</b> solani, and the concentrations required to inhibit growth of R. solani under laboratory and plant house-based conditions. The experiments were {{laid out in a}} completely randomized design with five treatments and five replications. The treatments were 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mM concentrations of MTPA. The purified toxin exhibited maximal activity at pH 2. 5 and 30 Â°C. MTPA at 1, 2, 4, and 8 mM levels reduced plant height, chlorophyll content, haulm fresh weight, number of stolons, canopy development, and tuber weight of potato plants, as compared to the control. MTPA significantly affected mycelial growth with 8 mM causing the highest infection. The potato seedlings treated with MTPA concentrations of 1. 0 â 8. 0 mM induced necrosis of up to 80 % of root system area. Cankers were resulted from the injection of potato seedling stems with 8. 0 mM MTPA. The results showed the disappearance of cell membrane, rough mitochondrial and cell walls, change of the shape of chloroplasts, and swollen endoplasmic reticulum. Seventy-six (76) hours after toxin treatment, cell contents were completely broken, cytoplasm dissolved, and more chromatin were seen in the nucleus. The results suggested that high levels of the toxin concentration caused cell membrane and cytoplasm fracture. The integrity of cellular structure was destroyed by the phytotoxin. The concentrations of the phytotoxin were significantly correlated with pathogenicity and caused damage to the cell membrane of potato stem base tissue...|$|R
