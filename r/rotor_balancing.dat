This thesis is dedicated to the research of flexible <b>rotor</b> <b>balancing</b> techniques, and aims to apply some advanced techniques to the field of high-speed <b>rotor</b> <b>balancing.</b> Significant progress in balancing methods for flexible rotors can be achieved by the improvement and optimization of existing balancing techniques. Experimental tests were conducted to demonstrate the ability of the influence coefficient method to achieve precise balance of flexible rotors. Various practical aspects of flexible- <b>rotor</b> <b>balancing</b> were investigated. Tests were made on a laboratory quality test rig having a 3. 6 m long rotor representing a High Pressure Turbine (H. P. T) (10. 1 kg) (43. 767 cm), a Low Pressure Turbine (L. P.

The data acquisition system utilizes dual high-speed computer systems to share the tasks of measurement data processing, and results display. A study of balancing errors is systematically discussed in detail from the view point of increasing the balancing precision. The methods for controlling and reducing these errors are also discussed. Both the qualitative and quantitative analyses of balancing errors are performed as the guide to reduce the error and improve the balancing quality.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the shake test setup, testing procedure, data acquisition and reduction process, and the shake test results. The first {{objective of the}} shake test is to identify the modal properties of the hub inplane motions. The prediction of the ground resonance for the rotor-support system is {{a crucial part of}} the risk reduction process in rotor testing. Such analysis requires the structural properties of the hub modes as input. In particular, ground resonance is an aeromechanic instability that can occur during the frequency-crossings of the inplane hub and blade motions. Since the frequency of the blade inplane mode varies with the rotor rotational speed, the frequency-crossings define the critical speed ranges in rotor operation. Ground resonance depends on the level of damping of the blade inplane 2 modes as well as the damping of the hub modes, which in turn depends on the structural properties of the stand support system. Several configurations of the wind tunnel setup were shake-tested to identify a ground resonance-safe test configuration. The second objective of the shake test is to perform a dynamic calibration of the <b>rotor</b> <b>balance.</b> Accurate measurement of the rotor vibratory hub loads is crucial in the development of rotor systems and has remained one of the major challenges in rotorcraft testing (refs. 1 [...] 4). In the MDART test setup, a five-component <b>rotor</b> <b>balance</b> installed below the rotor hub in the nonrotating system measures both the steady and the vibratory rotor hub loads.

Rotor {{unbalance}} {{remains one}} of the leading causes of deterioration and vibration of rotating machinery; but, if physical weight corrections can be made, many machines can be successfully balanced in-place with considerable savings in downtime and labor costs. In-place balancing can, however, pose some unique problems, and a prime concern is the time, expense, and wear and tear to simply start and stop the machine for trial data. Therefore, this paper is presented to provide guidelines for recognizing and overcoming some of the more common in-place balancing problems so that the number of balance runs can be kept to a minimum. Vibration analysis techniques are presented as the first step to verify that the problem is truly unbalance and not looseness, weakness, distortion, resonance, misalignment, eccentricity, or other problems which could be mistaken for unbalance.
