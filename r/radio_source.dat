5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May the radio scintillations became less {{noticeable}} until they ceased altogether. This implies that the <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> significantly expanded {{in the time that}} had passed since the burst was detected. Using the known distance to the source and the elapsed time before the scintillation ended, Frail calculated that the <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> had expanded at almost the speed of light. While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a relativistically expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680. The remnant of this explosion, Cassiopeia Ais heavily obscured by interstellar dust, which is possibly why it {{did not make a}} notable appearance.

This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260° to an angular distance of 20″ with an angular width of 2″. In 1969–70, a strong component of the radio emission was found to closely align with the optical source of the jet.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} month, Frail {{observed}} that the luminosity of the <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> fluctuated significantly {{from day to day}} but increased on average. The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result of the radio waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3microarcseconds.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with a {{diameter}} between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars. There are probably at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge {{of one of the}} spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The very center is marked by an intense <b>radio</b> <b>source,</b> named Sagittarius A*, which {{is likely to be a}} supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a {{group of}} six galaxies, four of which are {{interacting}} gravitationally and two of which simply appear {{to be a part of}} the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy. The <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> 3C 326 was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy from the radio galaxy nucleus.|$|E

40|$|Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the FIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters) catalogs, we {{examined}} the optical environments around double-lobed <b>radio</b> <b>sources.</b> Previous {{studies have shown that}} multi-component <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> exhibiting some degree of bending between components are likely to be found in galaxy clusters. Often this radio emission is associated with a cD-type galaxy {{at the center of a}} cluster. We cross-correlated the SDSS and FIRST catalogs and measured the richness of the cluster environments surrounding both bent and straight multi-component <b>radio</b> <b>sources.</b> This led to the discovery and classification of a large number of galaxy clusters out to a redshift of z ~ 0. 5. We divided our sample into smaller subgroups based on their optical and radio properties. We find that FR I <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> are more likely to be found in galaxy clusters than FR II sources. Further, we find that bent <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> are more often found in galaxy clusters than non-bent <b>radio</b> <b>sources.</b> We also examined the environments around single-component <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> and find that single-component <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> are less likely to be associated with galaxy clusters than extended, multi-component <b>radio</b> <b>sources.</b> Bent, visually-selected sources are found in clusters or rich groups ~ 78 % of the time.

25|$|Whether {{or not a}} <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> is {{expanding}} supersonically, it must do work against the external medium in expanding, and so it puts energy into heating and lifting the external plasma. The minimum energy stored in the lobes of a powerful <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> might be 1053 J. The lower limit on the work done on the external medium by such a source is several times this. A {{good deal of the}} current interest in radio sources focuses on the effect they must have at the centres of clusters at the present day. Equally interesting is their likely effect on structure formation over cosmological time: it is thought that they may provide a feedback mechanism to slow the formation of the most massive objects.|$|E

25|$|Donald Lynden-Bell and Martin Rees {{hypothesized}} in 1971 {{that the}} center of the Milky Way galaxy would contain a supermassive black hole. Sagittarius A* was discovered and named on February 13 and 15, 1974, by astronomers Bruce Balick and Robert Brown using the baseline interferometer of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. They discovered a <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> that emits synchrotron radiation; it was found to be dense and immobile because of its gravitation. This was, therefore, the first indication that a supermassive black hole exists in {{the center of the}} Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} {{reasons for this}} very strong preference for ellipticals. One is that ellipticals generally contain the most massive black holes, and so are capable of powering the most luminous active galaxies (see Eddington luminosity). Another is that ellipticals generally inhabit richer environments, providing a large-scale intergalactic medium to confine the <b>radio</b> <b>source.</b> It may also be that the larger amounts of cold gas in spiral galaxies in some way disrupts or stifles a forming jet. To date there is no compelling single explanation for the observations.|$|E
