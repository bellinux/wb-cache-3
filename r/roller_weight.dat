50|$|Tank mine sweeps. Several mine sweeps of {{different}} {{designs for the}} T-26 and ST-26 (minus its bridge) tanks were developed in the USSR, {{but none of them}} were passed into army service. Three models of mine plows (suspended from a front frame, operated with a hand cable winch and with special blades) were tested in 1932-1934. Trials showed very poor performance of such types of mine-sweep on compacted soil or scrubby land. The much more successful KMT-26 mine <b>roller</b> (<b>weight</b> 1.55 t, mine-sweeping speed 6-8 km/h, able to absorb up to 3 anti-tank mine explosions) was developed and tested in July 1934; three such mine-exploding rollers were produced. An experimental mine flail was tested in August-September 1939 also. Mine sweeps could be mounted on T-26 or ST-26 tanks in 1.5 hours and jettisoned without crew exit if necessary.|$|E

40|$|The three D-Zero cryostats (2 EC and 1 CC) will rest {{on three}} {{carriages}} {{which in turn}} ride {{on a set of}} hardened ways in the center beam. A pair of Tychoway rollers will be fitted to each of the four corners of the three carriages to provide the rolling support. In the final design, the two EC cryostats will be able to roll out and away from the CC cryostat in order to provide access to the space between each cryostat for maintenance and repairs. The cryostat will be frequently accessed, about once a month. during a collider run. The heaviest cryostat weighs about 360 tons. The large <b>roller</b> <b>weight</b> in one position for such a long period of time, created a concern about the rollers dimpling the hardened ways or even suffering permanent deformations themselves. There is also the possibility that the vertical position of the cryostat will need to be adjusted to align it with the beam line or that the carriage and cryostat will have to be lifted to remove and service the rollers. A device or system was needed to (1) relieve the weight of the cryostats from the rollers and the hardened ways, and (2) minimally adjust the vertical position of the cryostats, if necessary, and/or service the rollers. Compact hydraulic jacks seemed to be the answer. The first and foremost criteria was capacity. It was desired that the jacks be rated to twice the actual load. A jack is to be placed beside each roller, giving a total of eight per cryostat. The load per jack for a 360 ton cryostat would then be 45 tons, leaving 90 tons as the required capacity. The second and equally important criteria to be met was size. After installation of the Tychoway rollers. room to mount these jacks is very limited underneath the carriage. The space surrounding the bottom of the carriage is cluttered with wiring and plumbing and thus further limits available space for the jacks. What was left was a 3. 75 -inch x 6. 0625 -inch x 12. 25 -inch rectangular envelope on each side of a pair of rollers (see Appendix A) ...|$|E

5000|$|Rubber {{conveyor}} belts {{are commonly used}} to convey items with irregular bottom surfaces, small items that would fall in between rollers (e.g. a sushi conveyor bar), or bags of product that would sag between rollers. Belt conveyors are generally fairly similar in construction consisting of a metal frame with rollers {{at either end of}} a flat metal bed. The belt is looped around each of the rollers and when one of the rollers is powered (by an electrical motor) the belting slides across the solid metal frame bed, moving the product. In heavy use applications the beds which the belting is pulled over are replaced with rollers. The <b>rollers</b> allow <b>weight</b> to be conveyed as they reduce the amount of friction generated from the heavier loading on the belting.|$|R

40|$|Small scale {{centrifuge}} {{models were}} used to study the behaviour of arches repaired using different techniques. The models under test were 1 / 12 th scale replicas of a 6 metre single span three ring arch. Two types of arch geometry, with span/rise of 4 and 2, were studied as a shallow and deep arch geometry. The models were tested in a centrifuge under a steady equivalent gravity of 12 g. Two types of 2 -D and 3 -D arch models were studied which had the same geometry but different in the addition of spandrel walls. The 3 -D models were built with spandrel walls but without any wing walls or parapet. Both 2 -D and 3 -D arch models were tested under rolling and failure loads. The models were usually tested with fourteen passes of a rolling load and then up to the observation of first signs of failure {{to enable them to}} be suitable for applying a repair method. The repaired models were tested using the same procedure but up to the full failure load. To understand the behaviour of the arch models under unsymmetrical loads different <b>roller</b> <b>weights</b> were applied at different positions. The arch deflection and the soil/masonry interaction in arch extrados were measured in all the tests and compared with each other. Plastic mesh reinforcement, stitching, and concrete slab on top of the soil backfill were applied as repair methods to the 2 -D arch models. A review of the results has shown an increase in arch stiffness, decrease in deflections and a significant improvement in the ultimate load carrying capacity. A significant effect on the pressure distribution on the arch barrel was observed due to the application of the concrete slab on top of the backfill. Stitching of arch barrel and the barrel to the spandrels, applying partial saddle concrete and strengthening of spandrel wall using reinforced concrete were tested in the 3 -D arch models. The results showed improvements in the stiffness and ultimate arch load carrying capacity due to these repair techniques. The results provide a valuable data base for validation of numerical models and an initial attempt to use them with a commercial finite element program is included.

5000|$|The Santa Fe did not buy any USRA Heavy Pacifics, either, {{but after}} the war, Baldwin began {{building}} the new and even heavier 3400 Class for the road.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop guidelines and criteria for design and construction of overlays on cracked and seated concrete pavements. The main factors which are investigated in this study include number of the seated <b>roller</b> pass, <b>weight</b> of seating <b>roller</b> pass, <b>weight</b> of seating <b>roller,</b> thickness of overlay, fiber content and fiber layer location. Eleven test sections were constructed on I- 65 and twenty two test sections were constructed on US- 31. An extensive investigation was conducted involving both field and laboratory testing. Field investigations included pavement condition survey and non destructive testing (NDT) of the pavements using FWD or Dynaflect. The laboratory investigation focused on physical property testing, complex modulus testing and fatigue testing. Three fiber extraction methods have been developed for this project. Preliminary test Results show good precision of these methods. These fiber extraction methods should be used in future projects. Deflection measurements can be used to determine the appropriate weight and drop height of the breaking head. The Guillotine breaker used in this project is effective in breaking PCC pavement. A 40 ton roller is recommended because the 50 ton roller apprears to “overwork” the crack concrete pavement. Roller passes have no significant effect on the maximum deflections. The optimum roller pass can not be determined exclusively based on the maximum deflections. One to three passes of a 40 ton pneumatic-tired roller is adequate when seating is needed to assure contact of cracked pavement pieces with the subgrade. Use of fiber and the fiber layer location do not have a significant effect on pavement strength in term of the maximum deflection. But use of fiber will delay the crack development. The least cracks were developed in the sections which have fiber in all three layers. It is recommended that fiber be used in all overlay layers. Overlay thickness has an important effect on the maximum deflections and the development of reflective cracks. General trends of crack development showed in the first two years. Cracked and seated sections have less cracks than non cracked and seated sections, with other conditions being the same. The general trends are not obvious after two years. Beams of 3 x 3 in. are recommended to be used for the flexural fatigue tests in the future due to small variability. Addition of fiber increase the fatigue life of overlay mixture. Composite samples with fiber (4. 5 lb) have predicted fatigue life two times greater than those without fiber. Loading frequency and temperature have significant effects on dynamic modulus and phase angle of overlay mixture. The addition of fiber will change the viscoelastic properties of mixture...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{construction}} of rolled-fill earth dams with the standard methods of practice, taking the Hirakud Dam as the basis. The field operations of the investigation to obtain observational information and to secure samples for the laboratory testing include observation of rain gauge and river gauge readings, taking river water samples, digging test pits, drilling grout holes, opening drifts, digging borrow pits and conducting detailed topographical surveys. Laboratory tests are conducted on the samples {{and the results are}} plotted in graphs. Rainfall and run-off statistics are plotted in graphs. Observational information of geology is plotted in log sheets and the field data of survey works is made use of for the preparation of the topographical maps. From the results of the investigation it is found that the Hirakud Dam has a firm foundation and there is sufficient quantity of material for the embankment at site. The annual rainfall is 47. 49 inches yielding a run-off of 50 million sore feet over a catchment area of 32, 200 square miles. The stability of the embankment is computed by the slip circle method and the seepage water from the flow net method. The dam is designed for 100 years with a reservoir capacity of 5. 98 million acre feet at the maximum water level elevation 625 feet, the bed level being elevation 500 feet. The dead storage is 2. 24 million acre feet corresponding to elevation 590 feet, and the maximum submerged area corresponding elevation 625 feet is 150, 380 acres. The minimum factor of safety for the upstream slope is 1. 68 and that for the downstream slope is 1. 19. The seepage water is 0. 264 cubic feet per lineal foot per year. The dam is to be constructed as per the design and the specifications. The compaction is attained by the mechanical effort at the optimum moisture content. The mechanical effort is influenced by the type of <b>roller,</b> its <b>weight</b> and the number of passes. Field control is affected by vigilant supervision, needle penetration, ring test and sand test. The construction is to be carried out according to a plan of seven stages. A comparison and contrast is drawn between the U. S. A. and India to bring out the inherent difficulties of construction operations of large dams in India. Importance is given to the sequence of the subject matter since no text book gives all the relevant portions as used in practice. Reference is given to the text books from which the formulas are taken so that a student who is interested in theory, derivation and explanation of the formulas may study the available literature.

50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle cut side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small <b>rollers.</b> The <b>weight</b> of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|R

The matrix material consists of epoxy resin LY 556 and room-temperature curing hardener HY 951 supplied by Crystal Chemicals, Delhi, India. The composites were fabricated by blending epoxy resin, glass fiber, and SiC filler in a certain weight percentage reinforcement. Five different compositions of composites were prepared by varying the SiC filler reinforcement with fixed weight percentage (wt.%) of chopped glass fiber reinforcement. SiC filler in five different weight percentages (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt.%) are added with fixed 20 wt.% of chopped glass fiber and remaining epoxy so as to notice the effect of SiC reinforcement on physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of chopped glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composites. The composites were prepared by blending certain weight percentage of fiber/filler and epoxy resin in separate containers and then poured in a mold of desired dimensions. Labeling was done with the help of <b>rollers,</b> and suitable <b>weights</b> were applied on top of the mold. Similarly, five different compositions of fiber, filler, and epoxy resin are poured in separate molds by varying five percentages of SiC filler content with that of the epoxy resin keeping the chopped glass fiber weight percentage as constant. The composites are then left for solidification at room temperature for 24 h. After the solidification process, the composites are then removed from the mold and marking is done as per the test standards. Specimens were prepared as per American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) test standards for tensile, flexural, interlaminar shear strength, impact strength, and hardness tests.|$|R

50|$|Road <b>rollers</b> use the <b>weight</b> of {{the vehicle}} to {{compress}} the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial compaction of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways a four wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would {{be used due to}} its high weight, speed and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem roller or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader, and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (There is however an exception, if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth drum roller, a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.|$|R
