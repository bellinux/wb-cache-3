40|$|Introduction. Chronic {{functional}} instability—characterized by repeated ankle inversion sprains and {{a subjective}} sensation of instability—is {{one of the}} most common residual disabilities after an inversion sprain. However, whether surgical reconstruction improves sensorimotor control has not been reported to date. The purpose of this study was to assess functional improvement of chronic ankle instability after surgical reconstruction using the remnant ligament. Materials and Methods. We performed 10 cases in the intervention group and 20 healthy individuals as the control group. Before and after surgical reconstruction, we evaluated joint position sense and functional ankle instability by means of a questionnaire. Results and Discussion. There was a statistically significant difference between the control and intervention groups before surgical reconstruction. Three months after surgery in the intervention group, the joint position sense was significantly different from those found preoperatively. Before surgery, the mean score of functional ankle instability in the intervention group was almost twice as low. Three months after surgery, however, the score significantly increased.

30|$|One of {{the other}} criticisms of {{lengthening}} is the psychologic impact on the child. Although lengthening is undisputedly stressful for {{the child and the}} family, two recent {{studies have shown that the}} majority of problems are transitory and remit with appropriate treatment [52, 53] and that the lengthening treatment does not cause long-term psychologic maladjustment [53]. Although most patients tolerate the lengthening process well, some patients do develop loss of appetite, weight loss and difficulty sleeping. A single small dose of amitriptyline before bedtime is useful in helping these patients. Lengthening should not be an excruciatingly painful experience. If a patient is complaining of a lot of pain, especially during the day while at rest, the cause of the pain should be sought. Pain may be related to pin infection, pin loosening or cutting out, frame instability, nerve entrapment/stretch, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, rupture of the regenerating bone after premature consolidation, among other causes. Appropriate treatment, such as antibiotics, pin removal, wire <b>retensioning,</b> slowing distraction, pin replacement and backing up of the distraction, should be administered as soon as the problem is recognized. Peroneal nerve release should be considered if evidence of peroneal nerve stretch does not respond to slowing distraction.|$|E

Injection of oxytocin after delivery decreases the prevalence of bleeding and shortens the duration of third stage of delivery. Measurement of the amount of feto- maternal transfusion was the second object. Materials and Methods : This research was done on 230 single fetus case. gestation less than 34 weeks and Rh- patients were omitted. The first group was injected 10 units of oxytocin intramuscularly immediately after delivery. In the second group there was no injection of oxytocin, 25 persons from the first group and 27 persons from the second group were selected randomly. kleihaver test was performed before and half hour after delivery in order to measure the amount of feto- maternal blood transfusion. Results : The mean of the third stage in the group who were injected with oxytocin immediately after placenta delivery was 4. 2 minutes, and for the second group was 5 minutes. There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean time of two groups. In the first group there was no <b>retension</b> of placenta, but in second group three cases (2. 6 %) <b>retension</b> of placenta was noticed. The mean volume of bleeding in the third stsge, of first and second groups was 54. 9 and 72. 5 ml liters respectively, 72. 5 ml and the differences were not stotically significant. In the first group, the amount of fetus blood transfusion to mother was 27 and in the second group was 26. 4 ml. there was no significant difference in feto- maternal blood transfusion.

It was found that to the dog under anesthesia the phagocytosis of the RES is clearly inhibited, and with the use of Isozole it is slightly inhibited, while deep anesthesia such as combination anesthesia and low body temperature anesthesia distinctly affects the phagocytic function of the RES. 2. On the other hand, {{in the study of the}} hemoglobin synthesis which reflects the metabolic function of the RES, by means of fractionation of hermin iron and non-hemin iron in erythrocytes it was demonstrated that the hemoglobin synthesis is clearly inhibited by anesthesia and deep anesthesia inhibits the synthesis to a greater extent. 3. Simultaneous observations of the total organic iron, hemosiderin, ferritin fractions revealed that under anesthesia the <b>retension</b> of hemosiderin is increased, ferritin is decreased, and the ratio of hemosiderin to ferritin is lessened, suggesting that there develops a <b>retension</b> phenomenon in the RES. 4. The metabolic function of the RES is markedly inhibited by the low body temperature anesthesia at 27 ℃ to 28 ℃ but along with the lapse of time there develops an adaptation-recovery phenomenon and the metabolic function is inhibited more markedly rather than phagocytosis but it does not reach the stage of arresting the reaction. These findings clearly demonstrate that the Glycyrrhizin (59) Fe colloid method is a superior one for examining the functions of the RES to the classical method available. Further, in the investigation of the RES by this method it has been suggested that the function of RES is less inhibited by shallow anesthesia while by the deep anesthesia its inhibition is greater, and that under the low body temperature anesthesia more of the primeval function of the RES is maintained, thus rendering many useful criteria of clinical importancs...|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} the paper {{is to provide a}} {{short-term}} evaluation of some commercially available FRP tendon-anchor systems for application in prestressed concrete structures. Ten FRP tendon-anchor systems were stressed and subjected to sustained load for a period of three days to determine ease of installation, mechanical performance and anchor seating losses. The FRP tendons used aramid, carbon, and glass fibres embedded in epoxy or vinyl ester resin (except for one case). Anchors were of the wedge (or spike) and potted type. A minimum of two tests were conducted for each system at a load level equal to 65 % of the manufacturer's specified ultimate tendon strength. Collected data included load, strain, and displacement readings during both initial stressing and three-day sustained load. In most cases, anchorage devices permitted the stressing of the FRP tendons at the desired load level. Among wedge-type anchors, plastic and aluminium wedges had questionable performance, whereas steel wedges (in direct contact with the tendon or using a metal sleeve between tendon and wedge) showed good performance. Regardless of wedge material (plastic, aluminium, or steel), grit application to the wedge internal surface was highly beneficial. The spike anchor presented some installation difficulties. Resin potted anchors worked well and were easy to install. For the one case considered (wedge anchor), it was determined that <b>retensioning</b> produces early failure and anchor-zone temperatures between - 40 degrees C and + 60 degrees C have no effect on system performance. Anchor seating losses during short-term use are in general small and could become insignificant depending on the length of the tendon. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

40|$|With the {{ubiquity of}} low-powered {{technologies}} and devices in the urban environment operating in every area of human activity, the development and integration of a low-energy harvester suitable for smart cities applications is indispensable. The multitude of low-energy applications extend from wireless sensors, data loggers, transmitters and other small-scale electronics. These devices function in the microWatt-milliWatt power range and will {{play a significant role}} in the future of smart cities providing power for extended operation with little or no battery dependence. This study thus aims to investigate the potential built environment integration and energy harvesting capabilities of the Wind-Induced Flutter Energy Harvester (WIFEH) – a microgenerator aimed to provide energy for low-powered applications. Low-energy harvesters such as the WIFEH are suitable for integration with wireless sensors and other small-scale electronic devices; however, there is a lack in study on this type of technology’s building integration capabilities. Hence, there is a need for investigating its potential and optimal installation conditions. This work presents the experimental investigation of the WIFEH inside a wind tunnel and a case study using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of a building integrated with a WIFEH system. The experiments tested the WIFEH under various wind tunnel airflow speeds ranging from 2. 3 to 10 m/s to evaluate the induced electromotive force generation capability of the device. The simulation used a gable-roof type building model with a 27 ° pitch obtained from the literature. The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow was used for the simulation of the approach wind. The work investigates the effect of various wind speeds and WIFEH locations on the performance of the device giving insight on the potential for integration of the harvester into the built environment. The WIFEH was able to generate an RMS voltage of 3 V, peak-to-peak voltage of 8. 72 V and short-circuit current of 1 mA when subjected to airflow of 2. 3 m/s. With an increase of wind velocity to 5 m/s and subsequent membrane <b>retensioning,</b> the RMS and peak-to-peak voltages and short-circuit current also increase to 4. 88 V, 18. 2 V, and 3. 75 mA, respectively. For the CFD modelling integrating the WIFEH into a building, the apex of the roof of the building yielded the highest power output for the device due to flow speed-up maximisation in this region. This location produced the largest power output under the 45 ° angle of approach, generating an estimated 62. 4 mW of power under accelerated wind in device position of up to 6. 2 m/s.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Hemorrhoid {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{anorectal}} disease which presents with pain, bleeding and mass protrusion from anus. One of the most important reasons to avoid operation in these patients fears of the pain. Pain control specially during the first 24 hour postoperation period results in decreasing urinary <b>retension</b> and constipation as well as increasing patients pleasant. In this study we assisted the effect of pudendal nerve block to reduce pain in posthemorrhoidectomy period and compared with those patients without pudendal nerve block. Materials & Methods: We randomized 120 patients with average age of 37. 7 year who referred to the hospitals of Ahwaz university for hemorrhoidectomy into 2 groups (N 1 : 60 N 2 : 60). In the first group pudendal nerve block was done but in the second group we didn't. Then pain scores by analogue scale method were calculated in each group at 2, 6, 12 & 24 hours after operations. The scores were matched with Chi- Square test. Also we calculated and compared the dosages of injected narcotics. Results: The average pain scores at 2, 6, 12, 24 hours after operation in the first group (with nerve block). Were 2. 53, 2. 4, 1. 91, 2. 7, 2. 38, and in the second group (without nerve block) were 3. 43, 3. 23, 2. 98, 2. 81, 3. 11. The average of narcotic dosage in the first group was 0. 69 and in the second group was 1. 3. P-value in two groups in those times were 0. 001, 0. 002, 0. 001, 0. 66. P-value for comparison of two groups was 0. 01.

40|$|Duodenal diverticula {{is not a}} rare condition. There {{are many}} medical reports of this disease since the stage of Morgagni up to date. But the true from and {{clinical}} significance of duodenal diverticula has not yet revealed. I studied 76 cases of this disease clinically and roentogenologically. My report does not contain a ulcerative or tractions pouch of the viscus. Conclusions are as follows : 1. Age and Sex. The majority of duodenal diverticula are observed after middle age. The sex incidence is equal. 2. The order of frequency of duodenal diverticula are, 1 mid of second portion (para Vaterian) 2 third portion 3 Flex, duodenojejunalis. I did not observed in the first portion. 3. Usually single, but several cases had multiple. 4. Clinical symptoms are classified into three types, Type 1 resembling cholecystitis or cholelithiasis Type 2 resembling gastric or duodenal ulcer Type 3 resembling gastroenteritis 5. Clinical Examination Many cases had a leucocytosis. Duodenal juice showed an inflammatory condition of the biliary tract. Increasing of serum amylase is noted. 6. Roentogen examination. All the diverticula situated on the inner surface of the duodenal loop. Deformation of {{the first or second}} portion of the duodenum is revealed due to an adhesion between the gallbladder and the viscus. Peristasis of the wall of the sac is not noted. I found more than three hours <b>retension</b> of the contrast meal in the pouch. 7. Duodenal diverticula seems to be not cause clinical symptom. There is, however, the gallbladder is involved as a result of pressure on the duct, causing a cholecystitis, cholangitis, and jaundice. Retention of the bile flow also causes a gallstone.

40|$|The fate of insulin, as {{it relates}} to its action on skeletal-muscle glucose uptake, was studied in non-cyclically perfused rat hindlimbs. Insulin (1 m-i. u. /ml) with and without 125 I-labelled insulin was infused intra-arterially for 5 or 6 min. Net glucose uptake and the release of 125 I-labelled insulin into the venous {{effluent}} were evaluated by arteriovenous-difference measurements for an additional 24 – 32 min. The infusion of insulin for 5 min promoted glucose uptake, an effect that persisted throughout a subsequent 25 min of perfusion in the absence of insulin. The addition of insulin antibody to the perfusate in the presence of insulin blocked the action of insulin on glucose uptake, but it failed to alter insulin action if the muscle tissue had been exposed to insulin before addition of antibody. When 125 I-labelled albumin was infused for 6 min, venous effluent radioactivity decayed rapidly and remained HClO 4 -insoluble and there was no significant tissue <b>retension</b> of radioactivity. Comparable experiments in which 125 I-labelled insulin was infused for 6 min revealed that the venous effluent radioactivity decayed more slowly, a significant amount of the 125 I-labelled insulin appeared as fragments (HClO 4 -soluble) and there was a significant retention of radioactivity in the tissue. Radioactivity in muscle tissue biopsies obtained 28 min after infusion of 125 I-labelled insulin was associated largely with intact insulin and a peptide of mol. wt. 2400. The total radioactivity retained in the muscle at this time was 7 % of the amount infused. An insulin bolus (1 i. u.) failed to increase the discharge of this tissue-associated radioactivity. These results suggest that insulin and a product of insulin metabolism persists in muscle tissue long after the arterial presence of insulin ends. This tissue residence and processing of insulin may be important components of insulin's prolonged action on glucose uptake by skeletal muscle...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims. Our {{policy for}} the {{surgical}} treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been to minimize the extent of liver resection using a microwave tissue coagulator (MTC) and to not perform Pringle's maneuver {{for the prevention of}} ischemic injury to the liver routinely. We verify the safety of liver resection using MTC in HCC patients with poor liver functional reserve, and clarify the long-term outcome of HCC patients who underwent curative resection using MTC. Methodology. One hundred sixty-eight patients who underwent curative resection using MTC between 1992 and 2001 were divided into two groups according each patient's score in the Indocyanin Green <b>Retension</b> 15 Test (ICG-R 15 test). The high (ICG-R 15 values> 20) and low ICG-R 15 groups (ICG-R 15 values< 20) included 100 and 68 HCC patients, respectively. Clinical characteristics of each group were evaluated, and operative mortality and morbidity, as well as overall and disease-free survival rates, were compared between the two groups to determine risk factors for overall and disease-free survival. Results. Although there were significant differences in liver function-related parameters between the low and high ICG-R 15 groups, no differences in surgical or tumor factors were found. No patients in this study developed post-operative liver failure, and {{there was no significant difference}} in morbidity between the low and high ICG-R 15 groups. The overall survival rate of the low ICG-R 15 group was significantly longer than the high ICG-R 15 group (p= 0. 0003). Cox's multivariate analysis showed that an ICG-R 15 value less than 20 was the only significant independent factor for overall survival. Disease-free survival rates in the low ICG-R 15 group were significantly longer than in the high ICG-R 15 group (p= 0. 0007). Multivariate analysis showed that serum albumin level and number of tumors were significant independent factors for disease-free survival. Conclusion. The long-term outcome of HCC patients with low ICG-R 15 following curative resection using MTC was acceptable. This procedure was safe even for patients with high ICG-R 15...|$|R
40|$|As {{the result}} of biological-metabolic {{experiments}} with loose-binding glycyl-lycine iron colloid, whict has been proven to be almost an ideal colloid for the use in examining the function of reticulo-endothelial system (as described in Part 1), using mice and rabbits, the following conclusions were drawn. 1. In the case of intravenous injection to mice LD 50 of this colloid solution proves to be 1. 25 ml/ 20 g (solution containing 100 γ Fe… plus 10 mg/ml of glycyl-lycine), and when 1 / 3 of this amount {{is used as a}} fixed dose for the tracing of the reticulo-endothelial system, there can be observed no side-effects and it yields the desired result. 2. It has been demonstrated that immediately after the in travenous iujection phagocytosis of this colloid solution commences rapidly and Fe… can be detected in reticulo endothelial cells, and subsequently it is utilized for hemoglobin synthesis. Experimentally, it is observed that phagocytotic phase and iron metabolic phase are distinct and in addition, the <b>retension</b> in the reticulo-endothelial system is rapidly released. 3. This iron colloid can reveal precisely any experimental abnormality of the reticulo-endothelial function. It has been shown that the funcfion of reticulo-endothelial system should be studied from two angles of phagocytosis and utilization, and that there is room for further clitical study on the unilateral approach in this study. 4. Compararative studies on the efficiency of commercial, hard-binding iron colloid with this loose-binding colloid have demonstrated that cellular blocking occurs least with this new iron colloid in vivo. In addition, similar comparisons made in vitro likewise verify this point. 5. In the comparison of this colloid with serum iron colloid, no superiority can be seen with either one as regards the efficiency in vivo metabolism. Therefre, it can safely be said that glycyl-lycine iron colloid is superior from the viewpoint of it being a non-biological preparation. These findings support the author's belief that glycyl-lycine iron colloid is the best available substance at present for the clinical use in exmamining the function of reticulo-endothelial system and also as an excellent therapeutic agent for iron-deficiency anaemi...|$|R
