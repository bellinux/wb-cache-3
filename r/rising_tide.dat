When his S.H.I.E.L.D. monitor, Agent Quan Chen, discovers him missing the next day, Agent Phil Coulson {{and his team of}} agents are tasked with finding him. Quan reveals that Chan's location and abilities were leaked by the hacktivist group <b>Rising</b> <b>Tide.</b> Skye, a new civilian recruit and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee, was once a member of the <b>Rising</b> <b>Tide.</b> She traces the hack that released the information back to Miles Lydon, her secret boyfriend and <b>Rising</b> <b>Tide</b> contact. The team goes to confront Lydon, but Skye reaches him first; the two are caught together by Agent Melinda May and are taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.|$|E

5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E
5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow.

5|$|Parental care {{is found}} in a few species of beetle, perhaps for {{protection}} against adverse conditions and predators. The rove beetle Bledius spectabilis lives in salt marshes, so the eggs and larvae are endangered by the <b>rising</b> <b>tide.</b> The maternal beetle patrols the eggs and larvae, burrowing {{to keep them from}} flooding and asphyxiating, and protects them from the predatory carabid beetle Dicheirotrichus gustavi and from the parasitoidal wasp Barycnemis blediator, which kills some 15% of the larvae.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} a {{classified}} S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, tensions among the agents are high due to poor communication during the fight. This concerns Reyes, who decides to double-cross Coulson and secure the 0-8-4 for her government. Together, the agents devise a plan to activate the weapon, blowing {{a hole in the}} Bus. The drop in pressure opens the interior doors, allowing the agents to subdue the soldiers. At the facility, Reyes and her men are incarcerated and the 0-8-4 is launched into the sun in a rocket. The team watch the launch together, celebrating their combined efforts, while Ward agrees to supervise Skye's S.H.I.E.L.D. training.

30|$|Water depth at the RS {{inside the}} Sundarbans is highly {{dependent}} on the tidal oscillation at the coast {{and to a lesser}} extent on the magnitude of freshwater inflows from upstream. During field observation, water depths at the sampling stations were found to vary from 1.6 to 12.5 m and 3.7 to 15.9 m during falling and <b>rising</b> <b>tides,</b> respectively. Tides of the RS are semidiurnal with two high water and two low water levels per day. During <b>rising</b> <b>tides,</b> more saline offshore water flows toward the upstream, whereas during falling tide conditions, inland freshwater and less saline waters from the upstream area flow toward the downstream region.|$|R
5|$|The {{battle was}} {{ultimately}} decided when the <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> lifted Rhett's sloops free while temporarily leaving the Royal James stranded. Bonnet was left helpless, watching while the enemy vessels repaired their rigging and closed to board his paralysed vessel. Outnumbered almost three to one, Bonnet's men {{would have had}} little hope of winning a boarding action. Bonnet ordered his gunner, George Ross, {{to blow up the}} Royal James's powder magazine. Ross apparently attempted this, but was overruled by the remainder of the crew, who surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and returned to Charles Town with his prisoners on 3October.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{small groups}} of bluespotted ribbontail rays follow the <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> onto sandy flats to root for small benthic {{invertebrates}} and bony fishes in the sediment. When the tide recedes, the rays separate and withdraw to shelters on the reef. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to litters of up to seven young. This ray is capable of injuring humans with its venomous tail spines, though it prefers to flee if threatened. Because of its beauty and size, the bluespotted ribbontail ray is popular with private aquarists despite being poorly suited to captivity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as it faces widespread habitat degradation and intensive fishing pressure throughout its range.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, news {{had reached}} Charles Town that Bonnet's vessels were moored in the Cape Fear River. Robert Johnson, {{governor}} of South Carolina, authorised Colonel William Rhett to lead a naval expedition against the pirates, even though the Cape Fear River was in North Carolina's jurisdiction. After a false start due to the appearance of another pirate ship near Charles Town, Rhett arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Cape Fear River on 26September with two eight-gun sloops, the Henry and the Sea Nymph, and a force of 130 militia men. Bonnet initially mistook Rhett's squadron for merchantmen and sent three canoes to capture them. Unfortunately for Rhett, his flagship Henry had run aground in the river mouth, enabling Bonnet's canoe crews to approach, recognize the heavily armed and manned sloops as hostile and return uninjured to warn Bonnet. The sun had set by the time the <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> lifted the Henry off the river bottom.|$|E

5|$|HMS Hardy was the {{flotilla}} {{leader for}} the H-class destroyers, built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of}} the conflict. Hardy was transferred to Freetown, Sierra Leone, in October 1939 to hunt for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K. After returning to the United Kingdom in early 1940, the ship became flagship of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla assigned to the Home Fleet. During the Norwegian campaign of 1940, Hardy participated in the First Battle of Narvik where she sank one German destroyer. As the British ships were withdrawing, they were discovered by two other German destroyers that so badly damaged Hardy that she had to be run aground to stop her from sinking. The ship was lifted by a <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> and eventually capsized.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1804, Emerald and her crew took part in an {{invasion}} of Surinam. The invasion force consisted of Hood's flagship , Emerald, the 44-gun heavy frigates Pandour and , the 28-gun sixth-rate , the 12-gun schooner , the 12-gun corvette , and the 8-gun Drake, together with 2,000 troops under Brigadier-General Sir Charles Green. The force arrived from Barbados on 25 April after a twenty-two-day journey. The sloop Hippomenes, a transport and a further three armed vessels, landed Brigadier-General Frederick Maitland and 700 troops at Warapee Creek {{on the night of}} 30 April. The following night, O'Bryen was ordered to assist Brigadier-general Hughes in the taking of Braam's Point. A sandbar initially prevented Emerald from entering the Surinam River but O'Bryen forced her across on the <b>rising</b> <b>tide,</b> with Pandour and Drake following. Anchoring close by, the three British ships quickly put the Dutch battery of 18-pounders out of action and captured the fort without loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Joaquim Inácio {{returned}} to Rio de Janeiro in October, his {{tour of duty}} having lasted three years. He was then sent back to Cisplatina aboard the frigate Niterói and in December {{he became the first}} officer of the barque Grenfell. On 17 February 1828, he fought in the Battle of Quilmes. During the engagement, the Brazilian barque-brig (three-masted barque) Vinte e nove de agosto ran aground and was about to be boarded. Seeing this, Joaquim Inácio positioned the Grenfell near the threatened vessel and protected her until she could be freed by the <b>rising</b> <b>tide.</b> Both ships {{returned to}} the battle, which resulted in a Brazilian victory. Brazil's efforts in the war were ultimately in vain, as it eventually relinquished Cisplatina, which became the independent nation of Uruguay. In July 1829, Joaquim Inácio again returned to Rio de Janeiro, and on 17 October he was promoted to first lieutenant.|$|E

5|$|New Zealands first wartime {{action was}} the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, {{as part of}} the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral David Beatty. Beatty's ships were {{originally}} intended to provide distant support for the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast, in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks once the tide rose. When the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule at 11:35a.m., the battlecruisers, led by Beatty aboard his flagship, , began to head south at full speed to reinforce the smaller British ships; the <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the sandbar {{at the mouth of the}} Jade estuary.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} stingrays inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs, the bluespotted ribbontail ray generally spends the day hidden alone inside caves or under coral ledges or other debris (including from shipwrecks), often with only its tail showing. At night, small groups assemble and swim onto shallow sandy flats with the <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> to feed. Unlike many other stingrays, this species seldom buries itself in sand. The bluespotted ribbontail ray excavates sand pits in search of molluscs, polychaete worms, shrimps, crabs, and small benthic bony fishes; when prey is located, it is trapped by {{the body of the}} ray and maneuvered into the mouth with the disc. Other fishes, such as goatfish, frequently follow foraging rays, seeking food missed by the ray.|$|E
5|$|The Severn bore is a {{tidal bore}} {{seen on the}} tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way {{upstream}} {{in a series of}} waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E
