5|$|Llanbadarn Fawr was {{the focus}} of the English forces {{assembled}} in south Wales against the insurrection of Rhys ab Meredydd in 1287. By this time the <b>rector</b> was invariably an absentee cleric; John de Camera, <b>Rector</b> 1329–1334 was also canon of St David's, Hereford and Abergwili, and was a government clerk. Then, as now, such a large and remote charge invited pluralism and non-residence. There was, at this time, a comparatively small amount in tithes, but the <b>rector</b> was nonetheless equivalent in substance to an abbot, owing to the ownership of extensive lands by Frankalmoin tenure.|$|E
5|$|The large {{octagonal}} font {{dates from}} the 13th century. The {{south side of the}} church has memorials from the 18th century to Henry Morris, <b>Rector</b> of Llanfachraeth, and his sons Richard and Owen, and also some 19th-century memorials.

5|$|The <b>rector</b> {{is chosen}} by the {{governor}} of the State of São Paulo from a list of 3 candidates elected by the university's community, including students and administrative staff.

The <b>rector</b> serves for a term of 4 years before a new election is held, and can not be reelected in the following term. Zeferino Vaz was the first <b>rector</b> and held the position for 12 years until his mandatory retirement.|$|E
