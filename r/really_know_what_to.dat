Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts, worked on a track titled [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{and sent it to}} the singer. Underwood loved the song and recorded it, also naming her album Blown Away as it was the song that defined the album's darker direction. She then started writing material with several songwriters, including Hillary Lindsey and Kear. Together, the trio wrote [...] "Two Black Cadillacs", which is about two women finding out that they both are involved in a relationship with the same man and set their differences aside to kill him. Underwood said that [...] "it was so much fun to write and just be in that room" [...] with Lindsey and Kear, as they [...] "didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> expect or where we were headed or what we would end up with."

Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going to come to my room and have sex with me. I couldn't lock the door, so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E

[...] Andretti driver Robin Frijns revealed his interest in how he would compare against sim drivers: [...] "I don’t <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> expect, maybe the sim drivers or the fans are really good, maybe not, we don’t know.

2500|$|In 1927 Bacon {{moved to}} Berlin, where he saw Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin, later {{catalysts}} of his artistic imagination.

I didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, so I hung on for a while, and then, since I'd managed to keep a bit of money, I {{decided to go to}} Paris." [...] Bacon then spent the next year and a half in Paris. He met Yvonne Bocquentin, pianist and connoisseur, at the opening of an exhibition. Aware of his own need to learn French, Bacon lived for three months with Madame Bocquentin and her family at their house near Chantilly. He travelled into Paris to visit the city's art galleries. At the Château de Chantilly (Musée Condé) he saw Nicolas Poussin's Massacre of the Innocents, a painting which he often referred to in his own later work. From Chantilly, he went to an exhibition that inspired him to take up painting.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis's Sun {{recording}} contract {{ended in}} 1963, {{and he joined}} Smash Records, where he {{made a number of}} rock recordings that did not further his career. [...] The team at Smash (a division of Mercury Records) came up with [...] "I'm on Fire", a song that they felt would be perfect for Lewis and, as Colin Escott writes in the sleeve to the retrospective A Half Century of Hits, [...] "Mercury held the presses, thinking they had found Lewis's comeback hit, and it might have happened if the Beatles hadn't arrived in the America, changing radio playlists almost overnight. Mercury didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with Lewis after that." [...] One of Smash's first decisions was to record a retread of his Sun hits, Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis, which may have been inspired by the continuing enthusiasm European audiences had shown for Lewis's brand of rock and roll. However, none of Lewis's early Smash albums, including The Return of Rock, Memphis Beat, and Soul My Way, were commercial successes.|$|E

2500|$|Christopher Bahn of The A.V.

Bahn also commented that Liz's [...] "cynicism and skepticism [...] was a good quality for a scientist, but also a sometimes offputting character tic". In an analysis of Doctor Who and the Silurians for Doctor Who: The Television Companion, David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker were positive towards Liz, who they said was [...] "very good foil, far removed from the naïve young companions of the past". Radio Times writer Mark Braxton wrote that, despite her short appearance, [...] "Liz established herself thanks to her brilliant mind, a succession of crazy outfits and Caroline John's consummate professionalism as an actress". Braxton also felt that [...] "she was too caring to be cold" [...] and despite not having the [...] "companionly affection" [...] later seen with Jo Grant and Sarah Jane Smith, they had an [...] "innate respect" [...] for each other. Braxton's colleague Patrick Mulkern, while calling John a [...] "gifted actress", criticised the way Liz was [...] "severely styled" [...] in her first appearance. SFX Ian Berriman also criticised Liz in Spearhead from Space, writing that she was [...] "so snarky she's annoying". Will Salmon of the magazine listed Liz's departure as one of the worst in the series since she just [...] " [...] between seasons". DVD Talk's John Sinnott felt that John could come across as [...] "a bit stiff" [...] and did not have much chemistry with Pertwee, most likely due to their personal relationship. In 2010, readers of Radio Times voted Liz the 27th best companion, out of 48 options. In Ridley Scott's 2012 film Prometheus, Noomi Rapace's character is named Dr. Elizabeth Shaw; Dr. Nicolas Pillai, a lecturer from the University of Warwick's Film and Television Studies department, argues that this is a reference to the Doctor Who character, as Scott used to work for the BBC as a designer.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2012, Chad sees rescuing the kidnapped Melanie as his [...] "last {{chance for}} a normal life" [...] after the deaths of Lexie and Stefano. [...] "Melanie has become his family," [...] Deidrick said. He {{described}} Melanie and Chad's reunion as an [...] "overpowering emotion for Chad." [...] When he discovers that Gabi is behind Melanie's kidnapping, Chad is so shocked that [...] "He doesn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the information." [...] However, Chad rationalizes keeping Gabi's involvement from Melanie because he [...] "doesn't want to make things worse," [...] thinking she's been through enough. In the meantime Chad does everything to cut Gabi out of his life; [...] "he pretty much exiles her," [...] Deidrick said. Chad focuses all of his attention on Melanie and becomes extremely [...] "protective." [...] Chad feels the need to shelter Melanie. However it is Chad's lying that leads to their break. Though Chad seems overprotective, Deidrick said that Chad is overwhelmed after losing Lexie and Stefano and he reacts the way any normal person would. According to Deidrick, Chad reaches his boiling point and lashes out in anger. Chad sudden decision to ask Melanie to marry is his attempt {{to regain control of}} his life and his relationship. When she dumps him, Deidrick believed it is Chad's compupance for trying to control everything. It takes time for Chad to sort through his feelings. Deidrick explained that Chad has dealt with just about everything since his introduction and those experiences have hardened him. After losing Melanie, Chad immediately sets his sights on revenge. However, when Chad {{is at the end of}} his rope, he has no choice but to turn to his family, which allows for the writers to develop Chad's relationship with EJ. Deidrick relishes in Chad's attempt to destroy Gabi's budding romance with Nick Fallon (Blake Berris). But Chad is kind of left in limbo after Burnett's departure. Though he trusts the writers, Deidrick realized that Chad needed to make a change. And suddenly, it started, as Deidrick found ways to challenge himself by portraying Chad's [...] "pain and vulnerability" [...] with everyone he comes in contact with. Chad has yet to understand that, [...] "You have to let things go," [...] said Deidrick, a motto that he lives by in his personal life.|$|E
