40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{relationship}} isokinetic strength that the elite water polo players produced with lower and upper limbs (<b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movements)</b> and only upper limbs (without <b>leg</b> <b>movements)</b> and the velocity of the shoot. Eighteen elite male players of Turkish professional water polo first league aged between fifteen and thirty-three took part in the study voluntarily. The physical characteristics of the players were taken and throwing velocities of overhead, back hand and sweep throw were measured from position 2, 3, 4 and 6. Isokinetic strength measurements were made within different joint moves (trunk, shoulder, knee, hip). In two separate shooting protocols (<b>with</b> and without <b>leg</b> <b>movements)</b> the shooting velocity were measured in different positions. A significant difference was found between <b>with</b> and without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> in different throwing velocity shoots were recorded in different shooting positions (p< 0. 01). It was seen that the average of the velocity of <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> shoot was higher than the without <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> shoot. In terms of shooting positions, 2 nd position when the relationship between the velocity of <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoot and isokinetic muscle strength was considered, trunk flexion, shoulder extension, left hip abduction, left knee flexion as relevant p< 0. 05, a relationship with right knee extension was found (p< 0. 01). 3 rd position, a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) was recorded between trunk flexion, shoulder flexion, left hip abduction, right knee extension and left knee flexion. In 4 th position, between the <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoot and trunk flexion, shoulder flexion, right hip extension, left hip extension, right hip flexion, left hip flexion, right knee extension, left knee extension, left knee flexion and left hip abduction. A positive relationship (p< 0. 01) between <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> (back) shoots thrown from 6 th and trunk flexion, shoulder extension, shoulder flexion, left hip extension, right hip flexion, left hip abduction, right knee extension and left knee extension. Also a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) between the <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> backhand shoots thrown in 6 th position, and right hip extension and left hip flexion. A positive relationship (p< 0. 05) was seen between the shoots thrown from part 6 th position <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> sweep shoots and trunk flexion and left hip extension. When the relationship between the velocity of without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoot and isokinetic strength is overviewed according to the positions, in 2 nd position there is a relationship between without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoot and trunk flexion and shoulder extension, with the shoulder flexion a positive relationship was seen (p< 0. 01). In 3 rd position, there is a positive relationship (p< 0. 01), was recorded in the trunk flexion, a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) was seen in shoulder extension and shoulder flexion. In 4 th position, a positive relationship (p< 0. 01) was found with the trunk flexion. A positive relationship (p< 0. 01) was found <b>with</b> the without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> backhand shoots that were thrown from the 6 th position and trunk flexion, shoulder extension, shoulder flexion. A positive relationship (p< 0. 05) was recorded <b>with</b> the without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> sweep shoots and trunk flexion and shoulder extension. In conclusion, the isokinetic strength produced by the lower and upper limbs’ relation with the velocity of <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoots thrown from different parts was found. The isokinetic strength produced by the upper limbs’ relation with the velocity of without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoots thrown from different parts was found. The isokinetic strength's (produced by the upper limbs) contribution to the velocity of the shoot in without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoot is higher than <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoots. The results of the study upper limbs strengths’ (trunk flexion, shoulder flexion, shoulder extension) are more effective in the velocity of the shoot...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{stick insect}} Carausius morosus {{continuously}} moves its antennae during locomotion. Active antennal movements may re¯ect employment of antennae as tactile probes. Therefore, this study treats two basic {{aspects of the}} antennal motor system: First, the anatomy of antennal joints, muscles, nerves and motoneurons is described and discussed in comparison with other species. Second, the typical movement pattern of the antennae is analysed, and its spatio-temporal coordination <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> described. Each antenna is moved by two single-axis hinge joints. The proximal head-scape joint is controlled by two levator muscles and a three-partite depressor muscle. The distal scapepedicel joint is controlled by an antagonistic abductor/ adductor pair. Three nerves innervate the antennal musculature, containing axons of 14 ± 17 motoneurons, including one common inhibitor. During walking, the pattern of antennal movement is rhythmic and spatiotemporally coupled <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> The antennal abduction/adduction cycle leads the protraction/retraction cycle of the ipsilateral front <b>leg</b> <b>with</b> a stable phase shift. During one abduction/adduction cycle there are typically two levation/depression cycles, however, with less strict temporal coupling than the horizontal component.

The typical antennal movement pattern is sufficient to reliably detect obstacles of critical height, i. e. where leg reflexes alone will not suffice to overcome the obstacle. The technical application of insect-like actively moved tactile probes on a legged robot may provide a simple, fast and reliable means of object detection within the working range of the front legs. ...|$|R

The effect of other sleep-disturbing conditions on atrial fibrillation progression is not known. We sought to determine whether frequent periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> during sleep is {{a risk factor for}} progression of atrial fibrillation. In this retrospective study, patients with atrial fibrillation and a clinical suspicion of restless legs syndrome who were referred for polysomnography were divided into two groups based on severity of periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> during sleep: frequent (periodic movement index > 35 /h) and infrequent (≤ 35 /h). Progression of atrial fibrillation to persistent or permanent forms between the two groups was compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test, chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis. Of 373 patients with atrial fibrillation (77 % paroxysmal, 23 % persistent), 108 (29 %) progressed to persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation during follow-up (median, 33 months; interquartile range, 16 - 50). Compared to patients <b>with</b> infrequent periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> during sleep (n= 168), patients <b>with</b> frequent periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> during sleep (n= 205) had a higher rate of atrial fibrillation progression (23 % vs. 34 %; p= 0. 01).

The design and use of a control system is often done with a simulation model of a plant, but the time-variant and nonlinear nature of the cardiovascular system and subject-specific responses to external stimuli makes the modelling and identification challenging. Instead, we implemented an intelligent self-learning fuzzy controller that does not need any prior knowledge about the plant.

With this new control strategy, HR and dBP could be successfully controlled within medically tolerable ranges (deviations < 2. 5 bpm and < 5 mmHg from desired values, respectively).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{neonates}} with {{spina bifida}} aperta (SBA), <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> by myotomes caudal to the meningomyelocele (MMC) are transiently observed. It {{is unclear whether}} these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> relate to functional neural conduction through the MMC. For optimal therapeutical intervention, pathophysiological insight in these transient <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> seems relevant. If <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> by myotomes caudal to the MMC concur with the execution of general movements (GMs), functional neural conduction through the MMC is implicated. OBJECTIVE: In neonates with SBA, we aimed {{to determine whether the}} transiently present <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC indicate functional neural conduction through the MMC. METHODS: During the perinatal period, fetuses and neonates with SBA (n = 7 and n = 13, respectively) were longitudinally analysed for concurrency between <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC and GMs. To address the integrity of the reflex arc in spinal segments (at, or) caudal to the MMC, tendon leg reflexes were assessed during the first postnatal week. RESULTS: At postnatal day 1, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC concurred with GMs in 12 of 13 infants. Isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> were observed in only 3 of these 12 infants (isolated vs. concurrent; p < 0. 005). <b>Leg</b> <b>movements</b> concurring <b>with</b> GMs lasted longer than isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> (median duration = 11 s vs. 2 s; p < 0. 05). Between days 1 and 7, tendon leg reflexes (at, or) caudal to the MMC had disappeared in all but 1 neonate. However, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC remained concurrently present with GMs in all five neonates available for follow-up after day 7. Comparing these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> between days 1 and 7 indicated a decreased duration (- 44 %, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In neonates <b>with</b> SBA, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC concur with GMs, indicative of functional neural conduction through the MMC. The disappearance of these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> is caused by lower motor neuron dysfunction at the reflex arc, whereas neural conduction through the MMC is still functional...|$|R

DESIGN: Changes in heart rate variability (HRV), HRV spectra, and electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra associated with idiopathic PLMS were compared with changes associated <b>with</b> isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and respiratory-related <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> during sleep. Furthermore, correlations between electromyographic activity, HRV changes, and EEG changes were assessed. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Whole-night polysomnographic studies of 24 subjects fulfilling the criteria of either periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> disorder (n = 8), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (n = 7), or normal polysomnography (n = 9) were used. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Spectral HRV changes started before all EEG changes and up to 6 seconds {{before the onset of}} all types of <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> An initial weak autonomic activation was followed by a sympathetic activation, an increase of EEG delta activity, and finally a progression to increased higher-frequency EEG rhythms. After movement onset, HRV indicated a vagal activation, and, the EEG, a decrease in spindle activity. Sympathetic activation, as measured by HRV spectra, was greater for PLMS than for all other movement types. In EEG, gamma synchronization began 1 to 2 seconds earlier for isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and respiratory-related <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> than for PLMS. Significant correlations were found between autonomic activations and electromyographic activity, as well as between autonomic activations and EEG delta activity, but not between higher-frequency EEG rhythms and EMG activity or HRV changes.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of acute intensive exercise and chronic exercise on sleep patterns in patients <b>with</b> periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> (PLM). Methods: The study involved acute and chronic exercise. The acute intensive exercise group consisted of 22 volunteers who underwent a maximum effort test and a polysomnography (PSG) on the same night. The chronic exercise group included. 11 patients who performed 72 physical training sessions undergoing three PSG studies {{on the night of}} sessions 1, 36, and 72. Blood samples were collected from both acute and chronic groups for beta-endorphin dosage. Results: Our results showed that both forms of physical exercise lowered PLM levels. The acute physical exercise increased sleep efficiency, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced wake after sleep onset, whereas the chronic physical exercise increased sleep efficiency, REM sleep, and reduced sleep latency. We also found a significant negative correlation between beta-endorphin release after acute intensive exercise and PLM levels (r = - 0. 63). Conclusion: Physical exercise may improve sleep patterns and reduce PLM levels. The correlation between beta-endorphin release after acute intensive exercise and PLM levels might be associated with the impact physical exercise has on the opiodergic system.

40|$|Animals {{generally}} exhibit circadian {{rhythms of}} locomotor activity. They initiate locomotor behavior not only reflexively {{in response to}} external stimuli but also spontaneously {{in the absence of}} any specific stimulus. The neuronal mechanisms underlying circadian locomotor activity can, therefore, be based on the rhythmic changes in either reflexive efficacy or endogenous activity. In crayfish Procambarus clarkii, it can be determined by analyzing electromyographic (EMG) patterns of walking legs whether the walking behavior is initiated reflexively or spontaneously. In this study, we examined quantitatively the leg muscle activity that underlies the locomotor behavior showing circadian rhythms in crayfish. We newly developed a chronic EMG recording system that allowed the animal to freely behave under a tethered condition for more than 10 days. In the LD condition in which the animals exhibited LD entrainment, the rhythmic burst activity of leg muscles for stepping behavior was preceded by non-rhythmic tonic activation that lasted for 1323 +/- 488 ms when the animal initiated walking. In DD and LL free-running conditions, the pre-burst activation lasted for 1779 +/- 31 and 1517 +/- 39 ms respectively. In the mechanical stimulus-evoked walking, the pre-burst activation ended within 79 +/- 6 ms. These data suggest that periodic changes in the crayfish locomotor activity under the condition of LD entrainment or free-running are based on activity changes in the spontaneous initiation mechanism of walking behavior rather than those in the sensori-motor pathway connecting mechanoreceptors <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> (c) 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{parasitoid}} wasp Ampulex com-pressa induces a set {{of unique}} behavioral effects upon stinging its prey, the cockroach. It stings into the first thoracic segment inducing 2 to 3 min of transient flaccid paralysis of the front legs. This facilitates a second sting in the cockroach’s head that induces 30 min of excessive grooming followed by a 2 to 5 -week long lethargic state. In the present study, we examine the immediate effect of the first sting, which is a transient paralysis of the front legs. Using radiolabeled wasps, we demonstrate that the wasp injects its venom directly into the cockroach’s first thoracic ganglion. The artificial injection of milked venom into a thoracic ganglion abolishes spontaneous and evoked responses of the motoneurons associated <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> To investigate the physiological mechanism of action of the venom, we injected venom into the last abdominal ganglion of the cockroach, which houses a well-characterized cholinergic synapse. In-jected venom abolishes both sensory-evoked and ago-nist-evoked postsynaptic potentials recorded in the postsynaptic neuron for 2 to 3 min without affecting action potential propagation. Thus, the venom blocking effect has a postsynaptic component that follows the same time course as the transient paralysis induced by the thoracic sting. Finally, injection of a nicotinic antag-onist in the front thoracic ganglion induces paralysis of the front legs. We conclude that the transient paralytic effect of the thoracic sting can be mainly {{accounted for by the}} presence of a venom active component that in-duces a postsynaptic block of central cholinergic synap...|$|R

However, subjective estimations {{of sleep and}} sleepiness can differ considerably from objective measures. The pupillographic sleepiness test (PST) could identify patients with sleep disorders requiring polysomnography (PSG) and further treatment. Methods. We performed a PST and a PSG of 35 nondemented patients with WML, who reported nonrestorative sleep or daytime sleepiness, and assessed the diagnostic value of the pupillary unrest index (PUI). Sleep parameters were compared to normative data. Results. The mean PUI of WML patients was normal (5. 89 [*]mm/min) and comparable to PUIs of patients with other neurological disorders. All 9 of the 35 WML patients (25. 7 %) who had a PUI above normal also had clinically relevant sleep disorders (5 : sleep apnea, 7 : periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements,</b> and 4 : insomnia). Six patients with a normal PUI had mild to moderate primary insomnia. Conclusion. PST and PSG parameters were physiological in most patients with WML.

40|$|Advances in our {{understanding}} of the physiological basis of locomotion enable us to optimize the neurorehabilitation of patients with lesions to the central nervous system, such as stroke or spinal cord injury (SCI). It is generally accepted, based on work in animal models, that spinal neuronal machinery can produce a stepping-like output. In both incomplete and complete SCI subjects spinal locomotor circuitries can be activated by functional training which provides appropriate afferent feedback. In motor complete SCI subjects, however, motor functions caudal to the spinal cord lesion are no longer used resulting in neuronal dysfunction. In contrast, in subjects with an incomplete SCI such training paradigms can lead to improved locomotor ability. Appropriate functional training involves the facilitation and assistance of stepping-like <b>movements</b> <b>with</b> the subjects' <b>legs</b> and body weight support as far as is required. In severely affected subjects standardized assisted locomotor training is provided by body weight supported treadmill training <b>with</b> <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> either manually assisted or moved by a driven gait orthosis. Load- and hip-joint related afferent input is of crucial importance during locomotor training as it leads to appropriate leg muscle activation and thus increases the efficacy of the rehabilitative training. Successful recovery of locomotion after SCI relies on the ability of spinal locomotor circuitries to utilize specific multisensory information to generate a locomotor pattern. It seems that a critical combination of sensory cues is required to generate and improve locomotor patterns after SCI. In addition to functional locomotor training there are number of other promising experimental approaches, such as tonic epidural electrical or magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord, which both promote locomotor permissive states that lead to a coordinated locomotor output. Therefore, a combination of functional training and activation of spinal locomotor circuitries, for example by epidural/flexor reflex electrical stimulation or drug application (e. g. noradrenergic agonists), might constitute an effective strategy to promote neuroplasticity after SCI in the future...|$|R

Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} dopamine transporter (DAT) density in patients <b>with</b> periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> (PLM) shown by [Tc- 99 m]TRODAT- 1 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging {{and to determine}} the influence of acute physical exercise (maximal exercise test [MET]) on DAT densities. Methods: Sixteen healthy male volunteers between 45 and 65 yr of age were selected to participate in the study. Each subject (eight subjects in the control group and eight subjects in the patients with PLM experimental group) underwent baseline polysomnography (PSG) to evaluate sleep patterns and PLM index values. After obtaining PSG baselines, SPECT baselines were determined using [Tc- 99 m]TRODAT- 1, a selective DAT imaging ligand. Subsequently, the volunteers performed the MET in the morning, followed by a SPECT 2 h later and PSG that night to assess the effect of acute physical exercise on DAT and sleep patterns. Results: the baseline SPECT results showed marginally significantly lower DAT densities in the striatal region of the experimental group. After the MET, no significant differences were observed between groups. the results also showed a significant reduction in the PLM index in the experimental group and a significantly increased percentage of stage 1 non-REM sleep in both groups after MET. Conclusions: Our results show that patients with PLM had a marginally lower DAT density in the left putamen region compared with the control group. Although the effect of acute physical exercise (MET) reduced PLM symptoms, the results suggest that this improvement was not due to DAT availability.

50|$|Individuals <b>with</b> restless <b>legs</b> {{syndrome}} {{have increased}} numbers of K-complexes {{and these are}} associated with (and often precede) <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> Dopamine enhancing drugs such as L-DOPA that reduce <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> do not reduce the K-complex suggesting that they are primary and the <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> secondary to them. Failure of such drugs to reduce K-complexes in spite of reducing the <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> has been suggested to be why patients after such treatment still continue to complain of non-restorative sleep. Clonazepam is another treatment for RLS; like other benzodiazepines, it inhibits REM sleep by enhancing levels of GABA. This inhibition of REM sleep significantly decreases K-complex count, and unlike L-DOPA treatment, clonazepam studies report improvement in sleep restoration. Therefore, drugs that inhibit REM sleep also decrease K-complex count.|$|R
40|$|Neural {{output from}} the {{locomotor}} system for each {{arm and leg}} influences the spinal motoneuronal pools directly and indirectly through interneuronal (IN) reflex networks. While well documented in other species, less {{is known about the}} functions and features of convergence in common IN reflex system from cutaneous afferents innervating different foot regions during remote arm and <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> in humans. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to use spatial facilitation to examine possible convergence in common reflex pathways during rhythmic locomotor limb movements. Cutaneous reflexes were evoked in ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle by stimulating (in random order) the sural nerve (SUR), the distal tibial nerve (TIB), and combined simultaneous stimulation of both nerves (TIB&SUR). Reflexes were evoked while participants performed rhythmic stepping and arm swinging movement with both arms and the leg contralateral to stimulation (ARM&LEG), with just arm movement (ARM) and <b>with</b> just contralateral <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> (<b>LEG).</b> Stimulation intensities were just below threshold for evoking early latency (, 80 ms to peak) reflexes. For each stimulus condition, rectified EMG signals were averaged while participants held static contractions in the stationary (stimulated) <b>leg.</b> During ARM&LEG <b>movement,</b> amplitudes of cutaneous reflexes evoked by combined TIB&SUR stimulation were significantly larger than simpl...|$|R

40|$|Background: Normal sleep {{continuity}} and architecture show remarkable inter-individual variability. Previous {{studies suggest that}} brain morphology may explain inter-individual differences in sleep variables. Method: Thirty-eight healthy subjects spent two consecutive nights at the sleep laboratory with polysomnographic monitoring. Furthermore, high-resolution T 1 -weighted MRI datasets were acquired in all participants. EEG sleep recordings were analyzed using standard sleep staging criteria and power spectral analysis. Using the FreeSurfer software for automated segmentation, 174 variables were determined representing the volume and thickness of cortical segments and the volume of subcortical brain areas. Regression analyses were performed {{to examine the relationship}} with polysomnographic and spectral EEG power variables. Results: The analysis did not provide any support for the a-priori formulated hypotheses of an association between brain morphology and polysomnographic variables. Exploratory analyses revealed that the thickness of the left caudal anterior cingulate cortex was positively associated with EEG beta 2 power (24 – 32 Hz) during REM sleep. The volume of the left postcentral gyrus was positively associated <b>with</b> periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> during sleep (PLMS). Conclusions: The function of the anterior cingulate cortex as well as EEG beta power during REM sleep have been related to dreaming and sleep-related memory consolidation, which may explain the observed correlation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effects of verticalization with or without combined movement of the lower limbs in patients in a vegetative state or a minimally conscious state. In particular, we aimed to study whether, in the group with combined movement, there was better tolerance to verticalization. This was a randomized trial conducted in a neurorehabilitation hospital. Twelve patients with vegetative state and minimally conscious state 3 - 18 months after acute acquired brain injuries were included. Patients were randomized into A and B treatment groups. Study group A underwent verticalization with a tilt table at 65 ° and movimentation of the lower limbs with a robotic system for 30 [*]min three times a week for 24 sessions. Control group B underwent the same rehabilitation treatment, with a robotic verticalization system, but an inactive lower-limb movement system. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were determined. Robotic movement of the lower limbs can reduce the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension in hemodynamically unstable patients. Despite the small number of patients involved (only eight patients completed the trial), our results indicate that blood pressures and heart rate can be stabilized better (with) by treatment <b>with</b> passive <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> in hemodynamically unstable patients...|$|R

40|$|Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> is {{associated}} <b>with</b> a ∼ 3 -fold increase in {{blood flow to}} the leg but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The objective {{of the present study was}} to examine the role of nitric oxide (NO) for the hyperaemia observed during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement.</b> <b>Leg</b> haemodynamics and metabolites of NO production (nitrite and nitrate; NOx) were measured in plasma and muscle interstitial fluid at rest and during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> <b>with</b> and without inhibition of NO formation in healthy young males. The hyperaemic response to passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> and to ACh was also assessed in elderly subjects and patients with peripheral artery disease. Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> (60 r. p. m.) increased leg blood flow from 0. 3 ± 0. 1 to 0. 9 ± 0. 1 litre min− 1 at 20 s and 0. 5 ± 0. 1 litre min− 1 at 3 min (P < 0. 05). Mean arterial pressure remained unchanged during the trial. When passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> was performed during inhibition of NO formation (NG-mono-methyl-l-arginine; 29 – 52 mg min− 1), leg blood flow and vascular conductance were increased after 20 s (P < 0. 05) and then returned to baseline levels, despite an increase in arterial pressure (P < 0. 05). Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> increased the femoral venous NOx levels from 35 ± 5 at baseline to 62 ± 11 μmol l− 1 during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> (P < 0. 05), whereas muscle interstitial NOx levels remained unchanged. The hyperaemic response to passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> were correlated <b>with</b> the vasodilatation induced by ACh (r 2 = 0. 704, P < 0. 001) and with age (r 2 = 0. 612, P < 0. 001). Leg blood flow did not increase during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> in individuals <b>with</b> peripheral arterial disease. These results suggest that the hypaeremia induced by passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> is NO dependent and that the source of NO is likely to be the endothelium. Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> could therefore be used as a non-invasive tool to evaluate NO dependent endothelial function of the lower limb...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{neonates}} with {{spina bifida}} aperta (SBA), <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> innervated by spinal segments located caudal to the meningomyelocele are transiently present. This study in neonates with SBA aimed {{to determine whether}} the presence of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> indicates functional integrity of neuronal innervation and whether these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> disappear as a result of dysfunction of upper motor neurons (axons originating cranial to the meningomyelocele) and/or of lower motor neurons (located caudal to the meningomyelocele). METHODS: <b>Leg</b> <b>movements</b> were investigated in neonates with SBA at postnatal day 1 (n = 18) and day 7 (n = 10). Upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction was assessed by neurologic examination (n = 18; disinhibition or inhibition of reflexes, respectively) and by electromyography (n = 12; absence or presence of denervation potentials, respectively). RESULTS: Movements, related to spinal segments caudal to the meningomyelocele, were present in all neonates at postnatal day 1. At day 1, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> were associated <b>with</b> signs of both upper (10 of 18) and lower (17 of 18) motor neuron dysfunction caudal to the meningomyelocele. In 7 of 10 neonates restudied after the first postnatal week, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> had disappeared. The absence of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> coincided <b>with</b> loss of relevant reflexes, which had been present at day 1, indicating progression of lower motor neuron dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the presence of neonatal <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> does not indicate integrity of functional lower motor neuron innervation by spinal segments caudal to the meningomyelocele. Present observations could explain why fetal surgery {{at the level of the}} meningomyelocele does not prevent loss of <b>leg</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R
