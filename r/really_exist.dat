25|$|When {{a virtual}} airline grows {{to a point}} where {{managing}} their operations becomes difficult, the airline might subdivide into smaller groups, called a hub. The concept is similar to pilot bases in real-world airlines where pilots are grouped together at a major airport to start and end a series of flights, under the direction of a hub manager. Virtual airlines based on airlines that <b>really</b> <b>exist</b> commonly provide hubs associated with what would be expected in the real world, and follow their schedules as closely as possible.|$|E
25|$|The Yogacara {{school of}} Mahayana investigates the {{workings}} of the mind, stating that only the mind (citta-mātra) or the representations we cognize (vijñapti-mātra), <b>really</b> <b>exist.</b> In later Buddhist Mahayana thought, which took an idealistic turn, the unmodified mind came {{to be seen as a}} pure consciousness, from which everything arises. Vijñapti-mātra, coupled with Buddha-nature or tathagatagarba, has been an influential concept in the subsequent development of Mahayana Buddhism, not only in India, but also in China and Tibet, most notable in the Chán (Zen) and Dzogchen traditions.|$|E

25|$|No truly smooth {{surfaces}} <b>really</b> <b>exist,</b> {{and surface}} imperfections are visible under a microscope. As a result, when two bodies are pressed together, contact is only {{performed in a}} finite number of points, separated by relatively large gaps, as can be shown in Fig. 2. Since the actual contact area is reduced, another resistance for heat flow exists. The gases/fluids filling these gaps may largely influence the total heat flow across the interface. The thermal conductivity of the interstitial material and its pressure are the two properties governing its influence on contact conductance.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the physics}} {{establishment}} {{did not share}} {{his belief in the}} reality of atoms and molecules — a belief shared, however, by Maxwell in Scotland and Gibbs in the United States; and by most chemists since the discoveries of John Dalton in 1808. He had a long-running dispute with the editor of the preeminent German physics journal of his day, who refused to let Boltzmann refer to atoms and molecules as anything other than convenient theoretical constructs. Only a couple of years after Boltzmann's death, Perrin's studies of colloidal suspensions (1908–1909), based on Einstein's theoretical studies of 1905, confirmed the values of Avogadro's number and Boltzmann's constant, and convinced the world that the tiny particles <b>really</b> <b>exist.</b>|$|E
25|$|In this context, {{on the eve}} of {{independence}} there did not <b>really</b> <b>exist</b> a political movement strictly based on the demand for the rights of women. Existing institutions sustained political parties, and although these rights were the subject of speeches, they were not then among political priorities. The Union of women and the Union of girls belonging to the Communist party agitated especially in the social and labour domains. As for the Muslim union and the cells destourian women created in 1951-1952, they did not begin to call for the right to vote and eligibility for office until 1955. These two rights became official on March 14, 1957 and Tunisian women voted {{for the first time in}} municipal elections in May 1959 and later in the presidential and legislative elections of November 1959. But the right to education remained the only one unanimously sought by feminine organizations. From this point of view, the Code was not promulgated under any feminist pressure, that, when it existed, was usually directed to other ideals.|$|E

[...] The script also includes a difficulty on the part of the detectives in coping and dealing this new form of cyber-crime and differentiating the truth from the hoax; Leight said, [...] "Their biggest frustration is trying to understand what's real and what isn't.

500|$|While {{attending}} Central St Martins College, Arulpragasam {{wanted to}} make films and art depicting realism that would be accessible to everyone, something that she felt was missing from her classmates' ethics and the course criteria.

Maya told Arthur magazine [...] " [...] exploring apathy, dressing up in some pigeon outfit, or running around conceptualising... It missed {{the whole point of}} art representing society.

500|$|The Tempest, Hazlitt claims, {{is one of}} Shakespeare's [...] "most {{original}} and perfect" [...] plays, {{similar in some ways}} to A Midsummer Night's Dream but finer as a play, if not as rich in poetic passages. The Tempest demonstrates the author to be a master of both comedy and tragedy, with a full command over [...] "all the resources of passion, of wit, of thought, of observation". Yet again, Hazlitt here devotes considerable space to not just the characters in the play, but the character of the play as a whole. The world of the play seems to be created out of nothing; yet, though dream-like, in large part a product of the imagination, its setting resembles that of a painting we may have seen—"Prospero's enchanted island [...] airy music, the tempest-tost vessel, the turbulent waves, all have the effect of the landscape background of some fine picture"—its poetry having a music that conjures up meaning in the listener's mind—"the songs [...] without conveying any distinct images, seem to recall all the feelings connected with them, like snatches of half-forgotten music heard indistinctly and at intervals"—and its characters, many of whom, like Ariel, we know could not <b>really</b> <b>exist,</b> are drawn so as to seem [...] "as true and natural as [...] real characters". All is so artfully unified that [...] "that part which is only the fantastic creation of his mind, has the same palpable texture, and coheres 'semblably' with the rest." ...|$|E
