5|$|<b>Restrictive</b> N-terminal truncation: The {{approximately}} 30 {{amino acids}} N-terminal extension of cTnI is an adult heart-specific structure. The N-terminal extension contains the PKA phosphorylation sites Ser23/Ser24 and {{plays a role}} in modulating the overall molecular conformation and function of cTnI. A <b>restrictive</b> N-terminal truncation of cTnI occurs at low levels in normal hearts of all vertebrate species examined including human and significantly increases in adaptation to hemodynamic stress and Gsα deficiency-caused failing mouse hearts. Distinct from the harmful C-terminal truncation, the <b>restrictive</b> N-terminal truncation of cTnI selectively removing the adult heart specific extension forms a regulatory mechanism in cardiac adaptation to physiological and pathological stress conditions.|$|E
5|$|A {{version of}} this story {{circulating}} in 1836, recounted by Martineau, added that the slaves were emaciated, showed signs of being flayed with a whip, were bound in <b>restrictive</b> postures, and wore spiked iron collars which kept their heads in static positions.|$|E
5|$|Articulographs able {{to measure}} in three {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require <b>restrictive</b> headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less <b>restrictive</b> headmount is able to be used.|$|E
5|$|Debate {{about what}} {{criteria}} a plant must meet {{to be considered}} carnivorous has yielded two proposed definitions: one with strict requirements and the other less <b>restrictive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Germany, Poland and Hungary seized Czech {{borderland}} {{following the}} Munich agreement with UK, France and Italy, in October 1938, immediately putting into force their own <b>restrictive</b> gun laws within the occupied territory.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the decades}} {{following}} federation, <b>restrictive</b> laws and connections to businesses have meant that the media is a largely state-owned enterprise. One of the earliest known text publications in Borneo, Hikayat Panglima Nikosa (Story of Nikosa the Warrior), was first printed in Kuching, 1876.|$|E
5|$|MF Dnes {{pointed out}} that despite the steady rise of firearm {{ownership}} in the country since abolition of <b>restrictive</b> Communist legislation after the Velvet Revolution, the number of intentional homicide victims has been steadily falling since its peak in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Many weekend visitors—particularly from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia—prefer Belgrade nightlife to that {{of their}} own capitals, due to a {{perceived}} friendly atmosphere, plentiful clubs and bars, cheap drinks, the lack of language difficulties, {{and the lack of}} <b>restrictive</b> night life regulation.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{supported}} the African-American defendants in Shelley v. Kraemer, {{when they tried}} to occupy a house they had purchased in a neighborhood which had racially <b>restrictive</b> housing covenants. The African-American purchasers won the case in 1945.|$|E
5|$|After the 2000 election, Fletcher {{crafted a}} {{compromise}} bill that allowed patients to sue their HMOs in federal court, capped {{pain and suffering}} awards at $500,000, and eliminated punitive damage awards. Despite an eventual compromise allowing patient lawsuits to go to state courts under certain circumstances and heavy lobbying in favor of Fletcher's bill by President George W. Bush, the House refused to pass it, favoring an alternative proposal by Georgia's Charlie Norwood that was less <b>restrictive</b> on patient lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided {{the foundation for}} the peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and the culmination of the 'Pax Romana'. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less <b>restrictive,</b> but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Andros was {{commissioned}} governor of New England in 1686. He had earned the enmity {{of the local}} populace by enforcing the <b>restrictive</b> Navigation Acts, denying the validity of existing land titles, restricting town meetings, and appointing unpopular regular officers to lead colonial militia, among other actions. Furthermore, he had infuriated Puritans in Boston by promoting the Church of England, which was rejected by many Nonconformist New England colonists.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} has a high {{proportion}} of public servants, the Commonwealth Government contributes the largest percentage of Gross State Product and is the largest single employer in Canberra, although no longer the majority employer. Compared to the national averages, the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher; tertiary education levels are higher, while the population is younger. Property prices are relatively high, in part due to comparatively <b>restrictive</b> development regulations.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, the {{ketogenic}} diet {{was available}} from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less <b>restrictive</b> variants, {{such as the}} modified Atkins diet, were in use, particularly among older children and adults. The ketogenic diet was also under investigation {{for the treatment of}} a wide variety of disorders other than epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s rising shore costs, dock workers strikes, <b>restrictive</b> {{practices}} {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic, and subsidised competition from American shipping lines, persuaded Manchester Liners to switch its future fleet to container ships only. An example of the delaying effect of the strikes in the Canadian ports, with consequent impact on operating costs, was an extended ninety-day return voyage to Quebec City in early 1967 by the new Manchester Progress.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{geological}} {{layout of the}} Rhondda Valley, transport links are fairly <b>restrictive.</b> The original road layout followed the valleys with few connections between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out of work miners was created to build mountain roads connecting communities together. The mountain roads had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass have been created out of former railway lines.|$|E
5|$|Duncan and Fogarty (1984) {{argued that}} the key {{difference}} lies in {{the contrast between the}} stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina. According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a <b>restrictive</b> immigration policy, similar to Australia’s, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.|$|E
5|$|First-order axiomatizations of Peano {{arithmetic}} have {{an important}} limitation, however. In second-order logic, {{it is possible to}} define the addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot be done in the more <b>restrictive</b> setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly <b>restrictive</b> because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E
5|$|Jolliffe's motives {{regarding}} his accusations, {{as well as}} his choice of words, would be questioned for many years afterwards. That would change. In the late 1970s, when David Lewis was doing research for his Memoirs he came across archival evidence proving the charge. Due to Lewis's discovery, Drew's son Edward, placed extremely <b>restrictive</b> conditions on his father's papers housed in the Public Archives of Canada that continue as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Multimedia {{support has}} been {{problematic}} in Debian regarding codecs threatened by possible patent infringements, without sources or under too <b>restrictive</b> licenses, and regarding technologies such as Adobe Flash. Even though packages with problems related to their distribution could go into the non-free area, software such as libdvdcss is not hosted at Debian.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2013, Marc Webb {{posted on}} Twitter that {{principal}} photography had begun {{and that the}} sequel was being shot on 35 mm film in the anamorphic format, instead of being filmed digitally as the preceding film was. Sony revealed {{this would be the}} first Spider-Man film to be filmed entirely in New York State, including a car-chase scene that was filmed in Rochester because the speed laws are less <b>restrictive</b> in upstate New York.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the Court {{reviewed}} another restriction, {{this time}} concerning funding restrictions imposed {{by a public}} university. In the 1997 case Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, a government supported university sought to withhold funds from religious student publications despite funding similar secular publications. While the Court said the government could seek to shape funding to support a government message, such <b>restrictive</b> steps could not be imposed {{to the exclusion of}} a particular viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} <b>restrictive</b> lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the lung is inflamed {{for a long period of}} time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{institutional}} {{problems in the}} delivery of pain management include lack of resources for adequate training of physicians, time constraints, failure to refer people for pain management in the clinical setting, inadequate insurance reimbursement for pain management, lack of sufficient stocks of pain medicines in poorer areas, outdated government policies on cancer pain management, and excessively complex or <b>restrictive</b> government and institutional regulations on the prescription, supply, and administration of opioid medications.|$|E
5|$|The play Raisin in the Sun was {{inspired}} by Lorraine Hansberry's time in the neighborhood after her father won the repeal of <b>restrictive</b> covenants. The Hansberry house, the red brick three-flat at 6140 S. Rhodes which they bought in 1937, is up for landmark status before the Chicago City Council's Committee on Historical Landmarks Preservation.|$|E
5|$|The slave's freedom {{could be}} either total or partial, at the master's whim. In the former, the emancipated slave was legally {{protected}} against all attempts at re-enslavement—for instance, {{on the part}} of the former master's inheritors. In the latter case, the emancipated slave could be liable to a number of obligations to the former master. The most <b>restrictive</b> contract was the paramone, a type of enslavement of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.|$|E
5|$|To {{distinguish}} between OHS {{and various other}} lung diseases that can cause similar symptoms, medical imaging of the lungs (such as a chest X-ray or CT/CAT scan), spirometry, electrocardiography and echocardiography may be performed. Echo- and electrocardiography may also show strain {{on the right side}} of the heart caused by OHS, and spirometry may show a <b>restrictive</b> pattern related to obesity.|$|E
5|$|Unmarked phrase {{order is}} subject–object–{{predicate}}. While the predicate generally has {{to remain in}} clause-final position, the other phrases are free to change order or to wholly disappear. The topic tends to be placed clause-initially, new information rather {{at the end of}} the clause. Topic can be overtly marked with bol, which can also mark contrastive focus, overt additive focus ('even, also') can be marked with the clitic č, and overt <b>restrictive</b> focus with the clitic l ('only').|$|E
5|$|Until 1914 the Medal of Honor and the Purple Heart {{were the}} only medals that could be {{received}} so prior to 1916 the criteria for the Medal of Honor were much less <b>restrictive</b> than it is today. In 1916 however a board was established to ensure that future awards would be made only for the highest purposes, and some awards were rescinded.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} end-of-life care, Brady died of <b>restrictive</b> {{pulmonary disease}} in Ashworth Hospital on 15 May 2017. On 21 September 2017, the inquest {{found that he}} {{died of natural causes}} and his hunger strike had not been a contributory factor. Brady had refused food and fluids for more than 48 hours on various occasions, causing him to be fitted with a nasogastric tube, although his inquest noted that his body mass index was not a cause for concern. Brady was cremated on 25 October 2017 and his ashes were disposed of at sea.|$|E
5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL). They were {{originally}} intended as a means to make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying memory model, allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types with the library. However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction of the memory model would incur unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more <b>restrictive.</b> As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to <b>restrictive</b> abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (<b>restrictive</b> cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Adolph Ochs bought The New York Times, a money-losing {{newspaper}}, {{and formed}} the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, {{one of the}} United States' newspaper dynasties, has owned The New York Times ever since. The publisher went public on January 14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the American Stock Exchange. After this, the family continued to exert control through its ownership {{of the vast majority}} of Class B voting shares. Class A shareholders are permitted <b>restrictive</b> voting rights while Class B shareholders are allowed open voting rights.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 {{passage of}} the Moore {{amendment}} expanded the state's Nicholson local option law to apply to all liquor license applicants within a local township or city ward. The {{next step was to}} seek countywide prohibition. The IASL appealed to the general public, holding large rallies in Indianapolis and elsewhere, to support a county option law that would provide a more <b>restrictive</b> ban on alcohol. In September 1908 Indiana governor J. Frank Hanly, a Methodist, Republican, and teetotaler, called for a special legislative session to establish a county option that would allow county voters to prohibit alcohol sales throughout their county. The state legislature passed the bill with only a narrow margin. By November 1909 seventy of Indiana's ninety-two counties were dry. In 1911 a Democratic legislative majority replaced the county option with the Proctor law, a less-geographically <b>restrictive</b> local option, and the number of dry counties was reduced to twenty-six. Despite the setback prohibition advocates continued to lobby legislators for support. In December 1917 several temperance organizations formed the Indiana Dry Federation to fight the politically powerful liquor interests, with the IASL joining the group a short time later. The Federation and the League vigorously campaigned for statewide prohibition, which the Indiana General Assembly adopted in February 1917. Subsequent legal challenges delayed implementation of statewide prohibition until 1918, when a court ruled in June that Indiana's prohibition law was constitutionally valid.|$|E
