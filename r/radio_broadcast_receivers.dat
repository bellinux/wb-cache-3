5000|$|The {{definition}} of {{television in the}} original licensing legislation presumed a wireless <b>radio</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>receiver,</b> and {{it was unclear whether}} it extended to computers, internet devices, 3G mobile phones, or other newer technologies. In April 2007, then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Noel Dempsey proposed modernising the definition to include newer technologies The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources cautioned against too broad a definition: The Joint Committee notes that the proposed changes to the definition and interpretation as to what constitutes a television set could have adverse effects on the perception of Ireland as a global leader in technological developments. The Joint Committee accepts that the introduction of additional forms of licence fee collection, in that regard, could negatively impact on the business sector.|$|R
5000|$|Radio {{receivers}} {{are essential}} components of all systems that use <b>radio.</b> Besides <b>broadcast</b> <b>receivers,</b> described above, <b>radio</b> receivers {{are used in}} a huge variety of electronic systems in modern technology. They can be a separate piece of equipment (a radio), or a subsystem incorporated into other electronic devices. A transceiver is a transmitter and receiver combined in one unit.

50|$|A {{communications}} receiver {{is a type}} of radio receiver used as a component of a radio communication link. This is in contrast to a <b>broadcast</b> <b>receiver</b> which is used to receive <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasts.</b> The difference between the two is that <b>broadcast</b> <b>receivers</b> only receive <b>broadcast</b> bands, such as the medium wave and/or longwave AM broadcast bands and the VHF FM broadcast band, while a communication receiver receives a wider part of the radio spectrum not used for broadcasting, that includes amateur, military, aircraft, marine, and other bands. They are often used with a radio transmitter as part of a two way radio link for shortwave radio or amateur radio communication, although they are also used for shortwave listening.|$|R

This can be received on many FM <b>broadcast</b> <b>receivers,</b> {{and as a result}} KXKW-LP markets itself as an FM <b>radio</b> <b>broadcast</b> station. The station is airing a Regional Mexican format under the brand [...] "El Sabor 87-7/105-3." [...] To meet the legal requirements for visual content, the station runs a feed of the local National Weather Service radar.|$|R
5000|$|Using the aliases Edward Green (Gimpel) and William Caldwell (Colepaugh), they {{rented a}} studio {{apartment}} {{on the top floor}} of a building at 39 Beekman Place, selected for its lack of steel frame construction that might interfere with radio signals. They set about procuring parts for the radio transmitter Gimpel was expected to build. A bulky magnifier unit was supplied to them by Berlin to read the microdots containing radio plans, however they left it behind when disembarking the submarine because of its excessive weight. They bought a magnifying glass, but found it was insufficiently powerful to read the dots. Gimpel obtained a 1944 edition ARRL Radio Amateurs Handbook containing transmitter plans, as well as a multimeter, several milliamp meters, a roll of copper bell wire, and some small hand tools. They purchased a used General Electric <b>broadcast</b> <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> which Gimpel intended to convert to an 80 watt shortwave radio transmitter by modifying it with additional electronic components, however there is no evidence this was ever accomplished.|$|R
