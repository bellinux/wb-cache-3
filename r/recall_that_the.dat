25|$|The {{emblem of}} Springvale is the Jerusalem cross with four {{additional}} lines drawn in. The emblem serves to <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> school {{was founded on}} Christian principles.

25|$|The {{following}} is an intuitive way of understanding the hyperreal numbers. The approach taken here {{is very close to}} the one in the book by Goldblatt. <b>Recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sequences converging to zero are sometimes called infinitely small. These are almost the infinitesimals in a sense; the true infinitesimals include certain classes of sequences that contain a sequence converging to zero.|$|E
25|$|<b>Recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> R-square {{statistic}} {{in multiple}} regression reflects {{the percent of}} variance accounted for in the Y variable using all X variables. Thus, the change in R-square will reflect the percent of variance explained by the variable added to the model. The change in R-square is more appropriate than simply looking at the raw correlations because the raw correlations {{do not reflect the}} overlap of the newly introduced measure and the existing measures.|$|E
25|$|The x′ axis is also tilted {{with respect}} to the x axis. To {{determine}} the angle of this tilt, we <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> slope of the world line of a light pulse is always±1. Fig.2‑3c presents a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O′. Event P represents the emission of a light pulse at x′=0, ct′=−a. The pulse is reflected from a mirror situated a distance a from the light source (event Q), and returns to the light source at x′=0,ct′=a (event R).|$|E

25|$|Right-handed {{people would}} {{normally}} choose {{to move their}} right hand 60% of the time, but when the right hemisphere was stimulated they would instead choose their left hand 80% of the time (<b>recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> right hemisphere of the brain {{is responsible for the}} left side of the body, and the left hemisphere for the right). Despite the external influence on their decision-making, the subjects continued to report that they believed their choice of hand had been made freely. In a follow-up experiment, Alvaro Pascual-Leone and colleagues found similar results, but also noted that the transcranial magnetic stimulation must occur within 200 milliseconds, consistent with the time-course derived from the Libet experiments.|$|E
25|$|In {{differential}} geometry, the {{two principal}} curvatures {{at a given}} point of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator at the point. They measure how the surface bends by different amounts in different directions at that point. We represent the surface by the implicit function theorem as the graph of a function, f, of two variables, {{in such a way}} that the point p is a critical point, i.e., the gradient of f vanishes (this can always be attained by a suitable rigid motion). Then the Gaussian curvature of the surface at p is the determinant of the Hessian matrix of f (being the product of the eigenvalues of the Hessian). (<b>Recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hessian is the 2-by-2 matrix of second derivatives.) This definition allows one immediately to grasp the distinction between cup/cap versus saddle point.|$|E
25|$|If G is a group, the Whitehead group Wh(G) {{is defined}} {{to be the}} cokernel of the map G × {±1} → K1(Z) which sends (g,±1) to the {{invertible}} (1,1)-matrix (±g). Here Z is the group ring of G. <b>Recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> K-group K1(A) of a ring A {{is defined as the}} quotient of GL(A) by the subgroup generated by elementary matrices. The group GL(A) is the direct limit of the finite-dimensional groups GL(n, A) → GL(n+1, A); concretely, the group of invertible infinite matrices which differ from the identity matrix in only a finite number of coefficients. An elementary matrix here is a transvection: one such that all main diagonal elements are 1 and there is at most one non-zero element not on the diagonal. The subgroup generated by elementary matrices is exactly the derived subgroup, in other words the smallest normal subgroup such that the quotient by it is abelian.|$|E

500|$|After More, no writs {{of error}} issued from federal {{criminal}} trials {{in the circuit}} courts for 84 years. [...] In 1889, Congress created a right of appeal by writ of error in capital cases. In 1891, the Judiciary Act of 1891 (the [...] "Evarts Act") extended this right to other serious crimes. The Judicial Code of 1911 abolished the circuit courts and placed original jurisdiction for the trial of all federal crimes in the district courts. Appeal to the courts of appeals by writs of error was provided for all [...] "final decisions," [...] in civil and criminal cases alike. Appeals to the Supreme Court were permitted directly from the district courts by writ of error, from the courts of appeals on certified questions, and by petition for certiorari. Without reported discussion of the jurisdictional issue, the Court did hear writs of error from criminal cases removed to the circuit courts. (<b>Recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Judiciary Act of 1789 explicitly authorized appeals in removal cases.) ...|$|E

For a moment I froze {{in front of the}} computer, {{thinking}} about writing a letter of complaint to the company for sending us the wrong font. After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough to <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in text size. That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. Then I looked into the types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E

500|$|HitFix {{reviewer}} Alan Sepinwall complemented {{the series}} for its cast and music, {{but said that}} he didn't understand the hype towards the series. He also criticized {{the battle for the}} main-role of Marilyn for the musical, writing, [...] "the show keeps trying to position Karen and Ivy as equally-deserving of the part, when Hilty very thoroughly outclasses McPhee whenever the production numbers start." [...] Despite this, he called the pilot, [...] "smart and slick", and that he would keep on watching future episodes. He ultimately gave the episode a B. In a podcast with Sepinwall and fellow HitFix writer Dan Feinberg, the two were very negative towards Jaime Cepero's performance as Ellis Tancharoen, with Sepinwall comparing it to a failed version of [...] "All About Eve". They also criticized the writing for Messing's character, Julia Houston and Hilty's character, Ivy Lynn. Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker praised Messing's performance calling her [...] "funny and charming" [...] and a dialed down version of her Will and Grace character Grace Adler. He later went on to criticize the storyline between McPhee and Hilty, believing that Hilty was [...] "obviously superior" [...] to McPhee and that the storyline felt [...] "strained". He also went on to write that he hoped the series became a ratings success. Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, ranked the pilot episode as the 8th best television episode of 2012 saying, [...] "After we watched the subsequent 14 episodes of Smash with a mixture of fascination and dismay (seriously, did Debra Messing's Julia wear a men's pajama top to meet her lover?), it was difficult to <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pilot was positively magical. But it was. In fact, that episode-ending performance of Let Me Be Your Star (featuring dueling divas Megan Hilty and Katharine McPhee) was among TV's most watchable and gleeful three minutes of the year. Rare is the series whose high-water mark is its pilot, and Smash is a shining example." ...|$|E
500|$|Francisco Rafael Arellano Félix {{was born}} in Culiacán, Sinaloa, [...] on 24 October 1949, to Benjamín Francisco Arellano Sánchez (father) and Norma Alicia Félix Zazueta (mother). His father was {{from the state of}} Durango but emigrated to Sinaloa, where he met his wife, in the 1940s. The couple had eleven children, Francisco Rafael being the eldest of his seven {{brothers}} (Benjamín, Carlos Alberto, Eduardo, Ramón Eduardo, Luis Fernando, Francisco Javier) and four sisters (Alicia María, Enedina, Norma Isabel and Leticia). He also had two half-brothers, Jesús and Manuel Arellano, but their second surnames remain confidential. Francisco Rafael grew up in a modest house in Miguel Hidalgo St. #566 in Culiacán, blocks away from the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, and lived there for about 20 years. Neighbors <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Arellano Félix brothers were [...] "cheerful boys" [...] without addictions and inclined to selling clothes, licor, and candy that they brought illegally from the United States. Francisco Rafael went to [...] "Álvaro Obregón" [...] elementary school a couple of streets away from their house. He later attended [...] "Emilio Obeso" [...] middle school in the same neighborhood. At a young age, Francisco Rafael dropped out of middle school to help out his father, a mechanic. Alongside his brothers Benjamín and Ramón, however, he also smuggled contraband from Tijuana. His affinity towards music led him and his two brothers to form a musical group known as [...] "Sonido Escorpión" [...] and later renamed as [...] "Los Escorpiones". By the 1970s, his family moved to Guadalajara, Jalisco, but Francisco Rafael stayed in Culiacán, where he owned an event center known as [...] "El Chaplín". He then moved years later to Mazatlán and created the discothèque Frankie Oh. Francisco Rafael's discothèque was a major nightlife attraction in Mazatlán during the mid-1980s. With an estimated US$5 million investment to build it, Frankie Oh had the capacity to host 2,500 people; it had an internal waterfall and a large dance floor surrounded by a fish tank. The nightclub's theme also mirrored a zoo because it had several exotic animals, including two lions, in the entrances and in the surroundings. The only non-living animal inside Frankie Oh was a scorpion, which was found as a giant metal statue at a water fountain and as the logo of the nightclub. Francisco Rafael usually carried a diamond-encrusted scorpion necklace in reference to his astrological sign, the Scorpio.|$|E
