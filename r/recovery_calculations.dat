Methods for in vivo <b>recovery</b> <b>calculations</b> have been described in the literature [26]. Internal indicator technique was used in this study. The perfusate for microdialysis was prepared using 0.1  ml (4  mg) of gentamicin 80  mg/ 2  ml vial. This was injected into a 1 -l bag of Hartmann’s solution to make up a concentration of 4  μg/ml which was then be used as the perfusate for the catheters. Gentamicin was used as an internal standard to enable in vivo <b>recovery</b> <b>calculations</b> and was chosen due to similarities with tobramycin (molecular weight of gentamicin = 467 vs tobramycin = 477  g/mol). Using CMA 107 battery pumps, the microdialysis catheters were primed with the perfusate solution at a rate of 5  μl/min for 10  min. The catheters were then inserted, and the perfusate rate was reduced to 1  μl/min {{for the remainder of the}} experiment. Once inserted, the catheters were perfused for a period of 1  h to achieve a steady state equilibrium.|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{inspired}} by the project funded by Bureau of Safety and Environment Enforcement (BSEE) to study the use of epoxy (or any cement alternative) to plug offshore wells damaged by hurricanes. The project focuses on non-cement materials to plug wells that are either destroyed or damaged to an extent where vertical intervention from the original wellhead is no longer possible. The proposed solution to this problem was to drill an offset well and intersect the original borehole at the very top and spot epoxy (or any suitable non-cement plugging material) in the original well. The spotted epoxy then would fall by gravitational force {{all the way down to}} the packer and then settle on top of the packer to plug the annulus of the damaged well permanently. This thesis mainly concentrates on the factors affecting the fall rates and how to correlate them in order to derive an applicable test that can be conducted on the field or lab to calculate the terminal velocity of the known epoxy composition. Determining the settling velocity of the epoxy is crucial due to the fact that epoxy should not set prematurely for a better seal and isolation. The terminal velocity and the recovery for epoxy based plugging fluids were tested by using an experimental setup that was developed for this purpose. The results were also validated by using an alternative experiment setup designed for this purpose. Factors affecting the terminal velocity and recovery of epoxy were studied in this research since the settling velocity of the epoxy is crucial because epoxy should not set prematurely for a better seal and isolation. The study was conducted by using an experiment setup that was specially developed for terminal velocity and <b>recovery</b> <b>calculations</b> for plugging fluids.

40|$|This study {{basically}} {{focuses on}} numerical simulation of shale gas flow. To {{be able to}} capture the complex nature of shale gas reservoirs, different storage and flow mechanisms {{must be taken into}} consideration. Shale reservoir medium consists of organic matter (kerogen), inorganic matter, natural fractures, and hydraulic fractures. In this medium, Darcy flow is not fully capable of modeling shale gas flow since there is different flow mechanisms due to complex porosity system. In addition, Fickian diffusion and flow from matrix to fractures must be considered. For this purpose, the multiple porosity model is used. To be able to keep the resolution of the micromodel on the reservoir scale simulation, the idea of dynamic apparent permeability is followed. Storage mechanisms of shale gas is also as complex as flow mechanisms. Gas is not only stored as free fluid in pores and fractures, but also as adsorbed phase at the surface of organic matter. However, fluid properties of free gas in nano-scale pores are different than their original values. Also adsorbed phase occupies considerable amount of pore volume which causes reduction in free gas volume. As pore pressure decreases throughout the reservoir life, desorbed gas will be produced with free gas. Thus better understanding of this adsorbed gas behavior within organic matter is the key for accurate modeling of desorption and total gas production. The proposed workflow is first integrating desorption to the reservoir model by commercial simulator feature. Second, integrating diffusion using the multiple porosity model and application of dynamic apparent permeability to upscale the model. Third, different fluid properties are introduced to simulator by defining another PVT region. Finally, occupied pore space by adsorbed phase is introduced by modifying Langmuir parameters. Results are discussed by comparing different cases with cumulative gas production and average reservoir pressure. Significant difference of the models with and without integrating relevant model and properties shows the importance of the nanoscale considerations and their effect on ultimate <b>recovery</b> <b>calculations.</b> Decreasing pore size has a strong effect on gas formation volume factor and viscosity. It causes a decrease on cumulative gas production and average reservoir pressure. Nano-scale effects have a huge impact on both cumulative gas production and reservoir pressure.

Sediment-hosted ore within a turbiditic sequence is strongly structural controlled. It is sheet-like with several elongated, subvertical massive zoned sulphide bodies with central pyrrhotitic cores surrounded by pyrite ore which is enclosed by semi-massive and breccia-stringer mineralisation. This study showed pronounced grain sizes, texture, mineral composition and trace element geochemistry heterogeneity. The pyrite-pyrrhotite-galena-sphalerite ore has minor marcasite, chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite and trace tetrahedrite (±freibergite), native silver and magnetite. Enrichment trends towards {{the surface and}} peripheral pyrite-dominated ore zones are in Ag, As, Tl, Hg, Sb, Sn, Mo and Au. The first Re-Os whole rock massive sulphide isochron age is 378 ± 15 Ma. Initial ϒOs of ~ 170 is either caused by juvenile continental crust of the Lachlan Fold Belt as metal source or by a contribution of primitive mantle Os. Zinc isotope compositions of sphalerite (δ⁶⁶ZnJMC 0. 220 - 0. 450 ‰) suggest effectively leached average continental crust as the source for metals, chlorite thermometry showed temperatures at 314 - 343 °C, high Cu concentrations coincide with light Zn isotopes that define two major zones of fluid influx and the isocon method showed host lithology replacement was negligible during ore genesis. Sulphides formed in sites of increased dilation and fracture-induced permeability during prolonged periods of fracturing and fluid pulses. Decreasing fluid pressure and adiabatic cooling initiated precipitation of sulphides. No evidence for fluid mixing was identified. Initially, lower parts of the orebody formed in dilational zones in sandstone-rich sequences along a transpressional fault corridor. Major fracturing then caused the formation of upper main lode and upgrading of the lower main lode ore zones. Changing fluid temperatures, internal refinement via dissolution-reprecipitation and temporal fluid composition change created vertical mineralogical and geochemical ore zonation. The orebody was modified during post-depositional compression during continued basin inversion resulting in sulphide remobilisation, upgrading and amplified ore zonation. Zinc and, in particular, Pb recovery rates significantly fluctuated since production began in 1983. Fluctuating recovery rates resulted from grain size variability and subsequent poor particle liberation during grinding. Silver recoveries rarely exceeded 50 %. Poor Ag recoveries were due to fine-grained argentian tetrahedrite, common associations with gangue phases and alteration of tetrahedrite. High concentrations of Bi were encountered recently in lead concentrate. A galenamatildite solid solution contains Bi (max. 5, 645 ppm). High Bi {{is limited to the}} lower most main lode ore zone. Geometallurgical ore characterisation via QEMSCAN® was undertaken to predict mineral processing characteristics of ore sourced from parts of the same stope. On the stope scale there are significant variations in flotation characteristics from different parts of the stope which enables prediction of recoveries, concentrate qualities and mill throughput. Theoretical <b>recovery</b> <b>calculations</b> suggest that ore from the western part will have 10 % lower recovery. Theoretical and long-term average recoveries are similar for Zn but not for Pb. Theoretical data may over- estimate recovery because sample preparation may liberate more particles than plant grinding. An overview of mineralogy and trace elements allows geometallurgical ore characterisation on the stope scale to better predict mill performance. Investigation of geometallurgical ore characteristics and penalty element concentrations are recommended on a stope-by-stope basis within life-of-mine planning. Thesis (Ph. D.)

These errors contribute non-linearly to the variance in the final recovery estimate. This paper develops the mathematical formulation for variance propagation in toll smelting operations, including the effect of in-process inventory, assuming measurement biases have been eliminated beforehand. Operational data from a Southern African copper smelter is used for a case study. The method of propagation of variance showed that uncertainties in stockpile assays were the main contributors to variance in the recovery estimate. Variance in the volume and bulk density uncertainties contributed a secondary, yet significant, proportion to the overall recovery variance. It was determined, for the given case study, that the recovery variance depended on the calculation method used and that variance propagation via the two-product formula was smaller than recovery variances calculated via the standard recovery formula. However, the probability that the two product formula will give inaccurate (versus imprecise) results is significantly more due to the practical difficulty of equiprobable sampling of tailings streams from smelter plants (which includes materials such as slags and flue dust). Recommendations are made on how to achieve a reduction in overall uncertainty for toll treatment smelters. © The South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2006. Revie...|$|R
40|$|A simple UV-spectrophotometric {{method for}} the {{determination}} of the total vitamin C (ascorbic acid + dehydroascorbic acid) in various fruits and vegetables at Sylhet area is described. The spectrophotometric method involves the oxidation of ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid by bromine water in presence of acetic acid. After coupling with 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl hydrazine at 37 °C temperature for three hours, the solution is treated with 85 % H 2 SO 4 to produce a red color complex and the absorbance was spectrophotometrically measured at 521 nm. The content of vitamin C were 12 to 118 mg/ 100 g in fruits and 22 to 135 mg/ 100 g in vegetables.

40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} developed that quickly calculates blowdown heat loss {{as a function of}} makeup water, boiler water chemistry, and blowdown recovery equipment. By inputting water analysis, basic system parameters, and type of fuel, the cost of heat loss in the blowdown can be quickly and accurately determined. Present operating systems can quickly be evaluated as to potential cost savings on the addition of a blowdown flash tank and/or a recovery heat exchanger. Proposed systems can be engineered from the start with an eye to decreasing energy loss and saving money. In addition, the proper internal treatment is recommended along with appropriate products. Cost of energy lost in the blowdown is calculated based on different levels of blowdown heat <b>recovery.</b> Accurate <b>calculations</b> are readily available to make more intelligent decisions on the purchase of recovery equipment, rather than depending on very tedious, potentially inaccurate determinations by long hand...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hydrothermal}} carbonization on {{the properties of}} cellulose present in lignocellulosic biomass was investigated for converting it into a renewable energy resource with high energy recovery efficiency. The biochar obtained from cellulose subjected to hydrothermal carbonization showed {{a significant increase in}} its carbon content and a calorific value. 13 C NMR spectroscopy showed that when raw cellulose was subjected to hydrothermal carbonization above 220 °C, the resulting biochar had more aromatic and aliphatic fractions than those in raw cellulose. The resulting composition of the biochars was comparable to that of solid fuels and was between that of lignite and sub-bituminous coal. Therefore, cellulose, the main component of lignocellulosic biomass, was used to investigate the effects of varying the reaction temperature during hydrothermal carbonization. The energy <b>recovery</b> efficiency <b>calculations</b> showed that the optimum reaction temperature for the transformation of a mixture of cellulose was approximately 220 °C...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we give an {{alternative}} {{proof of the}} necessary and sufficient condition for achieving optimal checkpoint garbage collection in distributed systems [9]. We show that, by formulating the <b>recovery</b> line <b>calculation</b> problem as a reachability analysis problem on a rollback-dependency graph, {{the proof can be}} greatly simplified. We also present a polynomial-time optimal garbage collection algorithm based on a graph search. Keywords: fault tolerance, distributed systems 1 Introduction A checkpoint is a snapshot of process state, saved on nonvolatile storage to survive failures. A process periodically takes checkpoints during its execution so that when its volatile state is lost due to a failure, the execution can resume from a checkpointed state (an action called rollback recovery) instead of from the very beginning. In a distributed system, two checkpoints c 1 and c 2 of two processes p 1 and p 2 are inconsistent if a message was sent from p 1 after c 1 and received by p 2 bef [...] ...|$|R
