In a bid to lay a foundation for effective future control programme, this study was carried out with the aim of assessing the diagnostic efficacy of some questionnaire-based rapid assessment indices of urinary schistosomiasis. A total number of 1, 363 subjects were enrolled for the study. Questionnaires were administered basically in English and Hausa languages by trained personnel. Following informed consent, terminal urine samples were collected between 09 : 40 AM and 2 : 00 PM using clean 20 ml capacity universal bottles. 10 μl of each urine residue was examined for the eggs of S. haematobium using x 10 objective nose of Motic Binocular Light Microscope (China). The average age ± Standard Deviation (SD) of school children examined was 15. 30 ± 2. 30 years and 40. 87 % were females. The overall prevalence and geometric mean intensity of S. haematobium infection were 26. 41 % (24. 10 ─ 28. 85) and 6. 59 (5. 59 ─ 7. 75) eggs / 10 ml of urine respectively. Interestingly, a questionnaire equivalence of the prevalence obtained in this survey was 26. 41 % (24. 10 ─ 28. 85) for <b>Rapid</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Procedure</b> based on self-reported blood in urine.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} {{community}} perceptions toward malaria have been undertaken in high-endemic countries, and studies from low-endemic countries {{have only recently}} been published. Similar information is also needed for hypoendemic countries such as Indonesia, {{to cope with the}} persistence of foci-endemic malaria in these regions. An applied qualitative method, <b>Rapid</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Procedures,</b> was employed during a 3 -month intensive data collection period in Jepara district, Central Java province. Data were retrieved from 38 free-listings, 28 in-depth interviews, seven focus group discussions and unstructured observation. Qualitative thematic content analysis was applied. In this community, malaria (known as katisen or panas tis) was considered a common but minor illness. Insufficient understanding of malaria signs and symptoms in the subvillages likely leads to delay in illness recognition and treatment; not surprisingly self-treatment is common and the dosage most likely below the recommended dose. The health center was used but when it did not work, most people would shift back to traditional services due to cost considerations. Low understanding and acceptance of the causal link between the mosquito and malaria, likely leading to poor comprehension of preventive activities, as well as confusion of malaria with dengue fever, were identified. In conclusion, this study highlights a consistent gap between the common understanding and the biomedical description of malaria. If case management continues to be the main strategy in malaria control program, the emic perspective of the people must be well-integrated into the program. Likewise, interventions to improve home-treatment should also be developed. <b>Rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> (RAP) Malaria Community perception Indonesia...|$|R

40|$|Loiasis is a {{neglected}} tropical disease caused by infection with the filarial parasite Loa loa, transmitted by Chrysops vectors. Loiasis has recently {{emerged as a}} disease of public health importance when neurologic serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in individuals with high L. loa microfilaraemia after ivermectin treatment. This had {{a negative impact on}} the control of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis in areas of co-endemicity with loiasis. Microfilarial prevalence of 20 % has been suggested as the threshold above which there is an unacceptable risk of SAEs with ivermectin treatment. The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) undertook large scale mapping of loiasis in 11 potentially endemic countries using a <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> for loiasis (RAPLOA) that uses a simple questionnaire on the history of eye worm. A geostatistical analysis method called kriging applied to the results in 4798 sampled villages generated a contour map of eye worm prevalence, providing the first global map of loiasis based on actual survey data.

The method is tested against data from the Snowy River Estuary in south-eastern Australia but would be suitable over a range of estuaries.

Local knowledge of malaria was influenced by clinical diagnosis and was based on the co-existence of signs of illness. People conventionally self-medicated or used herbs for symptomatic relief prior to seeking clinical diagnosis and treatment, with treatment delay influenced by the logistic difficulties within the region, direct and indirect costs associated with treatment seeking, and delays in the return of results once a blood film for diagnosis was made. People were familiar with mosquito control activities conducted by the Malaria Control Service and, as a result, most respondents associated malaria with mosquitos.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{validity}} of observations on eye worm and Calabar swellings for the rapid assessment of the prevalence and intensity of loiasis at the community level. METHOD: A total of 12 895 individuals {{over the age of}} 15 years living in 102 communities in Cameroon and Nigeria took part in the study. A standardized questionnaire was administered to participants from whom finger-prick blood samples were collected and examined for Loa loa microfilariae.

40|$|Abstract Background Focus groups, <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures,</b> key {{informant}} {{interviews and}} institutional reviews of local health services provide valuable insights on health service resources and performance. A long-standing challenge of health planning is to combine {{this sort of}} qualitative evidence in a unified analysis with quantitative evidence from household surveys. A particular challenge {{in this regard is}} to take account of the neighbourhood or clustering effects, recognising that these can be informative or incidental. Methods An example of food aid and food sufficiency from the Bosnian emergency (1995 - 96) illustrates two Lamothe cluster-adjustments of the Mantel Haenszel (MH) procedure, one assuming a fixed odds ratio and the other allowing for informative clustering by not assuming a fixed odds ratio. We compared these with conventional generalised estimating equations and a generalised linear mixed (GLMM) model, using a Laplace adjustment. Results The MH adjustment assuming incidental clustering generated a final model very similar to GEE. The adjustment that does not assume a fixed odds ratio produced a final multivariate model and effect sizes very similar to GLMM. Discussion In medium or large data sets with stratified last stage random sampling, the cluster adjusted MH is substantially more conservative than the naïve MH computation. In the example of food aid in the Bosnian crisis, the cluster adjusted MH that does not assume a fixed odds ratio produced similar results to the GLMM, which identified informative clustering. </p...|$|R

To target chemotherapy effectively, <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> are needed for identifying high-risk communities that are foci for the disease. In this review, we examine the development and validation of simple school questionnaires for screening communities for Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni rapidly and inexpensively. The focus is on sub-Saharan Africa, where 85 % of the current schistosomiasis burden is concentrated. For more than a decade, the questionnaire approach has been validated in 10 countries, with 133 880 children interviewed in 1282 schools, and with 54 996 children examined for S. haematobium. The questionnaires were well accepted, highly reliable, and of low cost. The success of the questionnaires is {{explained by the fact}} that S. haematobium infections were easily perceived through the presence of blood in urine. Evidence from 48 258 children interviewed in 545 schools indicated that reported blood in stools and bloody diarrhoea are valuable indicators for community diagnosis of S. mansoni. However, the diagnostic performance of the questionnaires for S. mansoni was weaker than for S. haematobium, and although these results are encouraging, the questionnaires need additional validation. Recently, questionnaires were extended from community to individual diagnosis and showed considerable promise. Questionnaires are now available for promptly defining the magnitude of schistosomiasis in a large area, which will allow limited resources for morbidity control to be allocated optimally...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent {{research}} on automatic analysis of social media data during disasters has given {{insight into how}} to provide valuable and timely information to formal response agencies—and members of the public—in these safety-critical situations. For the most part, this work has followed a bottom-up approach in which data are analyzed first, and the target audience’s needs are addressed later. Here, we adopt a top-down approach in which the starting point are informa-tion needs. We focus on the aid agency tasked with coordinating humanitarian response within the United Nations: OCHA, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. When disasters occur, OCHA must quickly make deci-sions based on the most complete picture of the situation they can obtain. They are responsible for organizing search and rescue operations, emergency food as-sistance, and similar tasks. Given that complete knowledge of any disaster event is not possible, they gather information from myriad available sources, including social media. In this paper, we examine the <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> used by OCHA, and explain how they executed these procedures during the 2013 Typhoon Yolanda.

40|$|Background: Loiasis {{is a major}} {{obstacle}} to ivermectin treatment for onchocerciasis control and lymphatic filariasis elimination in central Africa. In communities {{with a high level}} of loiasis endemicity, there is a significant risk of severe adverse reactions to ivermectin treatment. Information on the geographic distribution of loiasis in Africa is urgently needed but available information is limited. The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) undertook large scale mapping of loiasis in 11 potentially endemic countries using a <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> for loiasis (RAPLOA) that uses a simple questionnaire on the history of eye worm. Methodology/Principal Findings: RAPLOA surveys were done in a spatial sample of 4798 villages covering an area of 250063000 km centred on the heartland of loiasis in Africa. The surveys showed high risk levels of loiasis in 10 countries where an estimated 14. 4 million people live in high risk areas. There was a strong spatial correlation among RAPLOA data, and kriging was used to produce spatially smoothed contour maps of the interpolated prevalence of eye worm and the predictive probability that the prevalence exceeds 40 %. Conclusion/Significance: The contour map of eye worm prevalence provides the first global map of loiasis based on actual survey data. It shows a clear distribution with two zones of hyper endemicity, large areas that are free of loiasis and several borderline or intermediate zones.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade much {{progress}} has been made in reducing malaria transmission in Macha, Southern Province, Zambia. Introduction of artemisinin combination therapies as well as mass screenings of asymptomatic carriers is believed to have contributed the most. When an endemic malaria situation is moving towards a non-endemic situation the resident population loses acquired immunity and therefore active case detection and efficient surveillance is crucial to prevent epidemic outbreaks. Our purpose was to evaluate the impact of cell phone surveillance and geographical information systems on malaria control in Macha. Furthermore, it evaluates what screening and treatment of asymptomatic carriers and implementation of rapid diagnostic tests in rural health care has led to. Ten in-depth semistructured interviews, field observations and data collection were performed at the Macha Research Trust and at surrounding rural health centers. This qualitative method was inspired by <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> The cell phone surveillance has been easily integrated in health care, and its integration with Geographical Information Systems has provided the ability to follow malaria transmission on a weekly basis. In addition, active case detection of asymptomatic carriers has been fruitful, which is reflected in it soon being applied nationwide. Furthermore, rapid diagnostic tests have provided rural health centers with reliable malaria diagnostics, thereby decreasing excessive malaria treatments and selection for drug resistance. This report reflects the importance of asymptomatic carriers in targeting malaria elimination, as well as development of effective surveillance systems when transmission decreases.

This should not be confused with a narrow focus, however; RE demands consideration of multiple contextual layers and the actors inhabiting them simultaneously. Key informants, ubiquitous in the realm of ethnographic methods, occupy a more prominent role as community liaisons or liminal ethnographic team members in this more rapid process. Existing data as well as expert consultants have heightened importance in RE; rather than seeking a completely new interpretation of the subject, rapid ethnography often prioritizes multi-level scanning for existing definitions of phenomena and the augmentation of previous research. For occupational scientists, RE presents several opportunities. First, although cultural anthropologists have at times criticized rapid ethnography for lacking depth, Baines 2 ̆ 6 Cunningham (2011) point out the capacity of RE to provide sufficiently complex descriptions of a social situation while operating within the current context of research funding constraints. Second, the emphasis in RE on attending to dialogue between actors and multiple levels of context support Laliberte Rudman’s (2013) charge to examine how occupation possibilities align with and are negotiated within broader socio-political situations. This session describes rapid ethnographic approaches, outlines their characteristics potentially useful in the realm of occupational science research, and provides a specific example of rapid ethnography employed in a research project carried out in the content of a collaborative anthropology-occupational therapy field school with a team of faculty and student researchers...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{and chronic}} {{malnutrition}} {{are associated with}} disease and death. Prevalence of acute malnutrition is positively correlated with children's mortality rates in refugee camps (Mason 2002). Children under-five have the highest death rates of all refugees (Toole 1988 et al.). It is thought that malnutrition related morbidity and mortality is preventable (Allen and Gillespie 2001, Toole and Waldman 1993). Assessment of nutritional status with anthropometry is practical and acceptable on an international level (Allen and Gillespie 2001) (Appendix A). Furthermore, {{research suggests that the}} ability to monitor a population over time helps identify the effectiveness of interventions (Peck et al. 1981). Baseline prevalence data and monitoring malnutrition are necessary to evaluate and implement adequate program support to refugees. At the Thai-Burmese refugee camps, nutrition assessments are not conducted regularly; however health agencies provide monthly growth monitoring. A chronic malnutrition prevalence of 36 % was found in the largest Burmese refugee camp on the Thai-Burmese border by Banjong et al. (2003). The researchers conducted a dietary assessment that included food weighing, anthropometric measurements, and a questionnaire comprising consumption patterns, resources and dietary intake questions on 182 households. It was expected that this prevalence was border wide. Kemmer et al. (2003) collected blood samples in five out of ten Burmese refugee camps in Thailand on 857 children aged 6 to 59 months old. A high chronic malnutrition prevalence of 46 % was found by convenience sampling. Utilizing simpler, more cost-effective methods would be more practical in refugee camps. <b>Rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> collect essential information relative to nutritional status in approximately ten minutes per person (Appendix A) ...|$|R

S. {{fisheries}} legislation requires National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{to attend}} to the critical social and economic issues surrounding the definition and identification of fishing communities, and to the effects that changes to the physical environment and regulatory decisions can have on such communities. To fulfil their mandate, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) sponsored the research entitled 2 ̆ 2 Identifying Fishing Communities in the Gulf of Mexico 2 ̆ 2 to study the economic, social and cultural status of potential fishing communities along the Gulf of Mexico. NMFS contracted the research project to Impact Assessment, Inc. to study 80 plus potential fishing communities in the Florida Gulf Coast. I worked as an intern in the research and visited the communities with other team members. The task of our project was to provide NMFS with basic profiles of fishing communities for NMFS to develop a culturally appropriated intervention. Research methods include <b>Rapid</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Procedures</b> (RAP), semi-structured key informant interviews, participant observation, and archival and secondary research mainly for community histories. Apart from my internship research, I also conducted some additional interviews and observations for my thesis. My findings indicate that fishing communities along the Florida Gulf Coast encounter with challenge from increased regulation, 2 ̆ 2 dumping 2 ̆ 2 seafood imports and virtually uncontrolled waterfront development. By a comparison of three groups of fishing communities, i. e., 2 ̆ 2 diminished communities, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 residual communities, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 resilient communities, 2 ̆ 2 the thesis explores how communities respond to the challenges and encourages fishermen to take action to preserve their generation-long fishing tradition. In conclusion, the thesis suggests that a solution to ease the decline of fishing communities requires cooperation of all parties concerned, including the fishery regulatory agency, commercial fishermen, and the federal and local government...|$|R
40|$|In Indonesia, the {{neonatal}} mortality rate remains consistently high at 19 per 1000 live births although various {{efforts have been}} conducted to prevent newborn death. This condition is also caused by maternal behavior which is not supportive for saving newborn lives. However, all approaches tend to focus to health providers and not voluntary health workers who {{have the potential to}} influence positive behavior of the mother in newborn care. This study was aimed to assess the role of VHWs to influence maternal newborn care. This research was done through a <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> in two subdistricts. Sixteen VHWs conducted two sessions of health education by doing home visit of 32 mothers during their pregnancy and first day to seven days after delivery. Observation of maternal newborn practices and indepth interviews were performed with midwives, traditional birth attendants and family members. Improved maternal practices were noted such as early initiation of breastfeeding practice, thermal control, cord care and infection prevention. There were 28 out of 32 newborns who received early initiation of breastfeeding and colostrum. Thirty out of 32 babies were dried and wrapped immediately after birth. There were four mothers put medicine or other herbs on the umbilical cord, and ten mothers washed their hands before touching the newborn. After the VHWs home visit there were likely changes of better practices of newborn care among the mothers. It is recommended that the District Health Office optimize the role of the VHWs in improving newborn care practices during the neonatal period...|$|E
40|$|Loiasis {{is a major}} {{obstacle}} to ivermectin treatment for onchocerciasis control and lymphatic filariasis elimination in central Africa. In communities {{with a high level}} of loiasis endemicity, there is a significant risk of severe adverse reactions to ivermectin treatment. Information on the geographic distribution of loiasis in Africa is urgently needed but available information is limited. The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) undertook large scale mapping of loiasis in 11 potentially endemic countries using a <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> for loiasis (RAPLOA) that uses a simple questionnaire on the history of eye worm. RAPLOA surveys were done in a spatial sample of 4798 villages covering an area of 2500 × 3000 km centred on the heartland of loiasis in Africa. The surveys showed high risk levels of loiasis in 10 countries where an estimated 14. 4 million people live in high risk areas. There was a strong spatial correlation among RAPLOA data, and kriging was used to produce spatially smoothed contour maps of the interpolated prevalence of eye worm and the predictive probability that the prevalence exceeds 40 %. The contour map of eye worm prevalence provides the first global map of loiasis based on actual survey data. It shows a clear distribution with two zones of hyper endemicity, large areas that are free of loiasis and several borderline or intermediate zones. The surveys detected several previously unknown hyperendemic foci, clarified the distribution of loiasis in the Central African Republic and large parts of the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo for which hardly any information was available, and confirmed known loiasis foci. The new maps of the prevalence of eye worm and the probability that the prevalence exceeds the risk threshold of 40 % provide critical information for ivermectin treatment programs among millions of people in Africa...|$|E
40|$|Loiasis is {{currently}} receiving attention {{as a disease}} of public health importance because {{of the possibility of}} increased risk of developing neurologic serious adverse event following mass ivermectin treatment against onchocerciasis in individual co-infected with Onchocerca volvulus and Loa loa. <b>Rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> for loiasis (RAPLOA) was conducted in 12 communities covering the 3 senatorial districts of Osun State, Nigeria. A total of 960 people were interviewed for history of eye worm using the WHO guidelines for rapid assessment. The survey confirmed the presence of loiasis in all the 12 communities with 4 in Osun East/Ife south senatorial district being at high risk with a prevalence of over 40 %. Based on the RAPLOA results, communities within Osun East/Ife south senatorial district were selected for microfilaraemic assessment of L. loa and O. volvulus. A total of 1115 and 1091 individuals were screened for L. loa and O. volvulus microfilaria worms respectively. 160 (14. 3 %) had L. loa microfilaria detected in their blood with 8 (5. 0 %) individuals having L. loa loads above 8000 mf/ml. 166 (15. 2 %) subjects had O. volvulus microfilaria (range 4 - 504 mf/ml) detected in their skin snip. 30 (2. 69 %) subjects were co-infected with both L. loa and O. volvulus. There was a significant variation in the prevalence (2. 1 % to 33. 3 %) of onchocerciasis in the communities studied (p = 0. 001). Five (41. 7 %) of the studied communities had a prevalence that is equal to or greater than 20 %. Low prevalence of onchocerciasis and loiasis co-infection in this study suggests that loiasis may not pose a serious epidemiological threat to the continuous distribution and sustainability of ivermectin for the treatment of onchocerciasis. Evaluation of the interruption of onchocerciasis transmissions in this region using all the indicators set forth by WHO is therefore suggested...|$|E
40|$|Mining {{communities}} with migrant populations are high-risk locations for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) /sexually transmitted infection transmission in Sub-Saharan Africa. Interventions presupposing certain groups to be at high risk, such as those working exclusively as commercial sex workers, may divert attention from other high-risk groups. Qualitative research was conducted {{in a small town}} adjacent to a large-scale commercial gold mine in north-western Tanzania. Objectives were to identify populations at high risk of HIV and suggest suitable behavioural interventions by gaining an understanding of sexual behaviour patterns in the town. <b>Rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> were employed comprising participant observation, informal questioning and in-depth interviews. Epidemiological categories of "core", "bridging" and "general" populations may not be adequate to the understanding of risk. Many types of women were found to receive payment for sex, distinguished by permanency of residence, age, relationship status, accommodation and income-earning activity. Paying for sex and having multiple partners was common among most men. The town was a high-risk environment {{as a result of the}} economic opportunities available there (in contrast to the poverty of surrounding areas), which were often accessed by offering sex in exchange for money or gifts. In this environment, the potential for spread of HIV infection between sub-populations was high and identification of distinct high- and low-risk groups not possible. However, the methodology enabled the identification of different social circumstances of risk, such as residential arrangements, employment status and venues for recreation, associated with different types of people. Targeted interventions may be oriented to specific circumstances in order to address risk practices in a culturally appropriate manner. It is useful to think of risk environments rather than attributing risk to types of people, and to target interventions to these environments. The methodology also enabled an approach to interventions sensitive to different circumstances associated with risk within the town while identifying structural factors affecting risk at the level of the town as a whole.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen a {{considerable}} body of literature emerge recognising the potential for tourism {{to contribute to the}} elimination of poverty. That said, there is candid agreement regarding the need for further research in this area. Of interest to the study reported in this paper is the apparent lack of progress from case study reporting to the development of applications or tools designed to facilitate best practice application in the field. To date where interventions have occurred they have not been inexpensive. The underlying premise of this study therefore lies in the view that if the tourism sector is to contribute to poverty alleviation then cost effective and timely methods of identifying ways to achieve this need to be developed. The objective {{of this paper is to}} review the design and testing of a <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> (RAJ <b>procedure</b> designed to address the divide between research in this field and its appropriate application. To that end this paper introduces RA methods, followed by a summary of their use in tourism settings to date. An overview of the RA designed as part of this study is then provided.
