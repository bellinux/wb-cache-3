40|$|AIM : The primary aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of a range of sports bras in reducing multi-planar breast displacement during treadmill running and a two-step star jump. A secondary aim was to assess the relationship between perceptual bra comfort, bra fit and breast pain and measured breast displacement. METHODS : Seventeen females (mean age 22 years, range 18 – 31 years) with bra cup sizes B to C volunteered to take part in the study. Three dimensional breast movements were determined for six randomly assigned breast support levels during treadmill running and two-step star jumping. Participants completed a perceptual questionnaire rating bra comfort, bra fit and breast pain. RESULTS : Not all the bras significantly reduced <b>resultant</b> breast <b>movement</b> compared to a control condition. Not all the bras reduced <b>resultant</b> breast <b>movement</b> significantly at all speeds during the treadmill test. A different bra performed best during each of the treadmill running speeds. Perceptual ratings of bra fit and bra comfort were stronger and more reliable predictors of breast pain than breast displacement in our group of relatively small breasted participants. CONCLUSION : Therefore it is apparent that <b>resultant</b> breast <b>movement</b> and the reduction of such movement is a multifaceted function of breast size, bra design and movement/activity type. The variance in bra performance at different treadmill running speeds highlights this fact and indicates that sports bras should be carefully selected to best suit the activity and breast size of the user.

40|$|Time {{dependent}} deformation is {{a common}} process in soil slopes but never the less a challenging task for stability assessment. Slope failure and the land subsidence originating not only from extensive constructions and mining but also due to geological processes are common problems, which adversely influence environment, human safety and economic development. In order to pursue an advanced methodology for management and mitigation of soil slope failure, such points as adequate monitoring technology, effective deformation recognition, reliable numerical modeling, and precise slope stability analysis are important {{to be taken into}} account. Within this scope, terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) was adopted to collect high resolution point cloud data from a fresh cut high slope in sandy and clayey soils in an open pit mine. Therefore, four scanning campaigns have been conducted over a period of three months. A conversion tool to transfer a LiDAR data-based 3 D geological model into a 3 D geotechnical model for numerical simulation has been developed. Two sophisticated techniques, i. e. both maximum distance method and feature degree method, were proposed to recognize the slope displacement in mm resolution from the surface model.

5000|$|Hornsby's action {{theory is}} {{significantly}} {{influenced by the}} philosophy of Donald Davidson. In her book Actions (1980), she argues that actions are events occurring {{beneath the surface of}} the skin. The argument for this turns on an ambiguity in the slogan [...] "all actions are bodily movements". The ambiguity stems from the fact that 'move' is one of a class of verbs that can occur either transitively or intransitively. Nominal expressions containing such verbs are therefore ambiguous: for example, 'the movement of the flag' can refer either to the action of someone's moving the flag or to the <b>resultant</b> <b>movement</b> of the flag. As we only ever answer a question about what someone did by using transitive verbs --- e.g. 'Jack moved his arm', not 'Jack's arm moved' (unless the latter is taken to imply that the former is true) --- the slogan [...] "all actions are bodily movements" [...] is only true if 'movement' is read transitively. This ambiguity noted, Hornsby then points out that if A VT-s B, then A caused B to VI ('T' and 'I' serving to disintguish between transitive and intransitive uses of the relevant verbs). If Jack raisedT the flag, Jack caused the flag to riseI. As causes and effects must be distinct, we must therefore also distinguish between Jack's raisingT his arm from Jack's arm's risingI, the former causing the latter. So actions are bodily movementsT, which cause bodily movementsI. The final move is to claim that we know from physiology that the causes of bodily movementsI are events that occur {{beneath the surface of the}} skin. Therefore, actions occur beneath the surface of the skin.|$|E

The <b>resultant</b> joint <b>movement</b> {{can be estimated}} through the related multiple- muscle activities, which is formulated as the forward problem. Neuroprosthetic applications may benefit from co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscle pairs to achieve more stable and robust joint movements.

A synergy based solution is presented for the inverse estimation of multiple muscle activations from joint move- ment, focusing on one degree-of-freedom tasks. The approach comprises muscle synergy extraction via the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. Cross validation is performed to evaluate the method for prediction accuracy based on experimental data from ten able-bodied subjects. The results demonstrate that the approach succeeds to inversely estimate the multiple muscle activities from the given joint torque sequence.

40|$|Measurements of {{the rates}} of {{pressure}} rise and a photo&raphic study of the flames emerging from the maximum experimental safe gap apparatus have shown that although relief venting may reduce the maximum explosion pressure it may increase the rate of pressure rise within the time interval when the reaction zone and following hot combustion products are flowing through the flange gap. In some explosions {{the presence of the}} relief caused acoustic standing waves, and the <b>resultant</b> <b>movement</b> of gas interfered with the combustion wave. Schlieren and direct photographs of the transmitterr explosions have shown that, in vented explosions, transmission through a flange gap need not necessarily occur nearest to the igniting source, and in some cases ignition took place in two locations simultaneously. With ethylene/air and propane/air mixtures the transmissions occurred during the initial stages of the explosion. With hydrogen/ air mixtures the transmission of the explosion occurred when the explosion pressure reached 25 per cent of the peak value. As the location of the explosion transmission through a flange gap is largely unpredictable, the timing of the newly formed flame front outside the vessel with ionisation detectors opposite the igniting source may be inaccurate.

In experiment 1, 14 right-handed normal subjects were tested binocularly and monocularly in a task in which they were required to reach out and grasp oblong blocks of different sizes at different distances. Although the typical binocular advantage in reaching and grasping was observed, the overall head movement scores did not differ between these testing conditions. In experiment 2, seven right-handed enucleated patients were compared to seven age and sex-matched control subjects (tested under binocular and monocular viewing conditions), on the same task as used in experiment 1. While no differences were found in the kinematics of reaches produced by the enucleated patients and the con-trol subjects, the patients did produce larger and faster <b>resultant</b> head <b>movements,</b> composed mainly of lateral and vertical movements.

A heretofore unreported, repeating pattern of northward drift of precipitation maxima is detected on Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM satellite) time-latitude distributions of daily accumulations over the eastern tropical Atlantic. Corresponding 3 -hourly TRMM accumulations show that the northward drifting envelopes of precipitation during August 2006 are often comprised of individual swaths propagating towards the southwest, presumably as mesoscale squall lines. The implied northward drift on the time-latitude distribution is a component of a <b>resultant</b> northwestward <b>movement.</b> The study examines the entire available record of TRMM precipitation observations, 1998 - 2010, to summarize TRMM maxima propagation over the eastern tropical Atlantic. Meridional displacements of precipitation maxima are most prevalent in June-September 2006, occurring less frequently during other summers. An investigation of geopotential and circulation fields, limited to two case studies, suggests mechanisms to {{explain some of the}} observed propagation of TRMM maxima. In one event, northward drift of the precipitation envelope is consistent with the corresponding displacement of the intertropical convergence zone trough, although the southwest propagation of individual mesoscale convection maxima does not correspond to any synoptic feature on reanalysis circulation or reanalysis downscaled by a regional model. One speculation is that southwestward propagation of precipitation maxima could be caused by regeneration of convection at outflow boundaries of mature thunderstorms...|$|R

These ten were all the "late reoperations" for squint which were done during the four year period 1972 to 1976 by one consultant (C. I. P.).

Strain gauges were implanted along the saggital and across the squamosal-parietal sutures using the Macaca nemestrina as an experimental model. This monkey model was chosen because the morphology of the sutures under investigation and their anatomical relationship to the muscles of mastication resemble those observed in man. Parameters of resultant strain were recorded at these sutures during stimulation of selected masticatory muscles and during chewing. A two-way analysis of variance was used to compare the differences in strain between the squamosal-parietal and sagittal sutures. A Student-Newman-Keuls Test was used to identify differences in strain at the squamosal-parietal suture {{as a result of the}} independent contraction of the six muscles tested. ^ The direction and magnitude of the strain across the beveled squamosa-parietal suture was found to be markedly different in direction and greater in magnitude from that strain recorded across the butt-ended sagittal suture. The potential capability of the squamosal-parietal suture to absorb stress during mastication and its anatomical proximity to the temporomandibular joint suggest a functional relationship between this patent suture and the temporomandibular joint.

40|$|Poor upper-limb {{coordination}} is {{a common}} difficulty for children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). One hypothesis is that deviant muscle timing in proximal muscle groups results in poor postural and movement control. The relationship between muscle timing, arm motion and children 2 ̆ 7 s upper-limb coordination deficits has not previously been studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between functional difficulties with upper-limb motor skills and neuromuscular components of postural stability and coordination. Sixty-four children aged 8 - 10 years, 32 with DCD and 32 without DCD, participated in the study. The study investigated timing of muscle activity and <b>resultant</b> arm <b>movement</b> during a rapid, voluntary, goal-directed arm movement. Results showed that compared to children without DCD, children with DCD took significantly longer to respond to visual signals and longer to complete the goal-directed movement. Children with DCD also demonstrated altered activity in postural muscles. In particular, shoulder muscles, except for serratus anterior, and posterior trunk muscles demonstrated early activation. Further, anterior trunk muscles demonstrated delayed activation. In children with DCD, anticipatory function was not present in three of the four anterior trunk muscles. These differences support the hypothesis that in children with DCD, altered postural muscle activity may contribute to poor proximal stability and consequently poor arm movement control when performing goal-directed movement. These results have educational and functional implications for children at school and during activities of daily living and leisure activities and for clinicians assessing and treating children with DCD.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} little {{consensus}} as to whether age-related visuomotor adaptation effects are readily observable. Some studies have found slower adaptation, and/or reduced overall levels. In contrast, other methodologically similar studies have found no such evidence of aging effects on visuomotor adaptation.

The present study describes the use of a viewing window paradigm {{to examine the effects of}} aging in a visuomotor transformation task. METHODS: Two groups of participants, a young adult control group (age range 18 - 33 years old, mean age = 22) and an older adult group (age range 62 - 74, mean age = 68) completed a viewing window task that was controlled by the user via a computer touchscreen. Four visuomotor "flip" conditions were created by varying the relationship between the participant's <b>movement,</b> and the <b>resultant</b> on-screen <b>movement</b> of the viewing window: 1) No flip 2) X-Axis and Y-axis body movements resulted in the opposite direction of movement of the viewing window. In each of the 3) Flip-X and 4) Flip-Y conditions, the solitary X- or Y-axes were reversed. Response times and movement of the window were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Older participants demonstrated impairments in performing a required visuomotor transformation, as evidenced by more complex scanning patterns and longer scanning times when compared to younger control participants. These results provide additional evidence that the mechanisms involved in visuomotor transformation are negatively affected by age...|$|R
40|$|Thinking about {{curriculum}} {{stands to}} gain from the creative engagement afforded by the global civilizational encounters that will define the twenty first century. Pedagogically this means a constant pushing at the boundaries of how we think about education {{both in terms of}} content and also in terms of human existential demands for meaning. This pushing requires that we step outside of the colonizing mindset of educational imperialism and engage with deep dialogue across civilizational terrain that is challenging, complex, uncomfortable but also deeply rich in possibilities. Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari have highlighted how Western philosophy and, as a result, Western pedagogy are in fact geophilosophically confined to a Greek and totalizing vision of being that limits human cultural invention. The <b>resultant</b> intellectual <b>movements</b> of humanism and Enlightenment reason have been unilateral and failed to engage with local and normative forms of meaning making that affirm human relationships with context. In this globalizing context, as traditions encounter one another, there are an increased range of preferences on offer. Such encounters are sources of great vitality for the curricula field and can result {{in a wide range of}} hybrid possibilities. Understanding the geophilosophical orientation of current educational practice opens up the educational space to increased diversity. As Noel Gogh notes: Deleuze and Guattari’s geophilosophy enlarges the field of concepts and signs that we can deploy to account for difference, which in turn multiplies the possibilities for analyses, critiques, and interventions. Such a broadening of our repertoires of representation and performance may be particularly useful when we encounter remarkable difference (difference that puzzles, provokes, surprises or shocks us) … (2007, p. 286...|$|R
