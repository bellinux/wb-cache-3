5|$|Biological {{control is}} first {{recorded}} around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, were intentionally placed in citrus plantations to control beetles and caterpillars. Also in China, ducks {{were used in}} paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to control locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in citrus plantations in California to control scale insects, and other biological control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>chemicals</b> and damage to the environment began to emerge, and biological control had a renaissance. Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although {{a renewed interest in}} traditional and biological pest control developed {{towards the end of the}} 20th century and continues to this day.|$|E

The use of concrete surface treatments with waterproofing materials {{to prevent the}} access of aggressive substances is an important way of enhancing concrete durability. The most common surface treatments use polymeric resins based on epoxy, silicone (siloxane), acrylics, polyurethanes or polymethacrylate. However, epoxy resins have low <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> ultraviolet radiation while polyurethanes are sensitive to high alkalinity environments. Geopolymers constitute a group of materials with high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>chemical</b> attack that {{could also be used}} for coating of concrete infrastructures exposed <b>to</b> harsh <b>chemical</b> environments. This article presents results of an experimental investigation on the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>chemical</b> attack (by sulfuric and nitric acid) of several materials: OPC concrete, high performance concrete (HPC), epoxy resin, acrylic painting and a fly ash based geopolymeric mortar. Three types of acids, each with high concentrations of 10 %, 20 % and 30 %, were used to simulate long term degradation by chemical attack.

[...] Other factors include allergenicity; speed of drying; <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>chemicals,</b> moths, and mildew; melting point and flammability; retention of static electricity; and the propensity to become stained and to accept dyes. [...] Different factors may be more significant than others for different knitting projects, {{so there is no}} one [...] "best" [...] yarn. [...] The resilience and propensity to (un)twist are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting. [...] More resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch. [...] A key factor in knitting is stitch definition, [...] corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn. [...] Smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.|$|E
