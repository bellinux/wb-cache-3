In CDS parlance, this is termed a credit event, and that triggers the settling of outstanding contracts for the derivatives, which are used to hedge or speculate on the potential risk that a company will default on its bonds. The two GSEs have approximately US$1.5 trillion in bonds outstanding, and since the market in {{credit default swap}}s is not public, there is no central <b>reporting</b> <b>mechanism</b> to verify how many credit default swaps are linked to those bonds.

40|$|Abstract. Comparative {{analysis}} of <b>reporting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> based on XML technology {{is presented in}} the paper. The analysis was carried out as the {{part of the process of}} selecting and implementing of <b>reporting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for a cadastre information system. The reports were designed for two versions of the system, i. e. for the internet system based on PHP technology and the fat client system in two-layer client-server architecture. The reports for the internet system were prepared using XSLT for HTML output and using XML-FO for PDF output and compared with reports implemented using Free PDF library. Each solution was tested by means of the Web Application Stress Tool in order to determine what limits in scalability and efficiency could be observed. As far as the desktop system is concerned three versions of <b>reporting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> based on Crystal Reports, Microsoft Reporting Services and XML technology were accomplished and compared with the mean execution time as the main criterion...|$|R

Distributing security bulletins maintained by cloud or service providers {{is an example of}} notifying other stakeholders about an incident. Incident or vulnerability <b>reporting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are also useful when an outsider detects an incident or identifies a vulnerability. These two methods can be developed and deployed independently of the cloud platform. Security bulletins are provided by the security team who handles security related tasks. Also, <b>reporting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are delivered by means of ticketing and reporting tools. Direct and real-time communication among stakeholders is a complement to the above mentioned methods.|$|R
