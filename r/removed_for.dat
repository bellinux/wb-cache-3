5|$|In July 2005 {{the statues}} adorning the {{monument}} underwent a restoration. DeKalb County appropriated US$15,000 {{for the project}} which, among other tasks, repaired a split seam {{in one of the}} soldier statues and a crack in the other sculpture's base. The project took approximately six months; the statues were <b>removed</b> <b>for</b> the duration of the restoration work and reinstalled in March 2006. During the restoration it was revealed that the statues, thought to be bronze, were actually copper. The work, the first in the 110-year history of the memorial, was completed at a cost of $16,500. Three months after the work was completed one of the statues was <b>removed</b> <b>for</b> a second time because the metal began to oxidize.|$|E
