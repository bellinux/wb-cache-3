40|$|The Opposition Effect (OE) is the {{non-linear}} {{increase in}} the intensity of light scattered from a surface as phase angle approaches 0 deg. It is seen in laboratory experiments and in remote sensing observations of planetary surfaces. Understanding the OE is a <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>fitting</b> photometric models which produce meaningful results about regolith texture. Previously we have reported measurements from the JPL long arm goniometer and we have shown that this instrument enables us to distinguish between two distinct processes which create the opposition surges, Shadow Hiding (SHOE) and Coherent Backscattering (CBOE). SHOE arises because, as phase angle approaches zero, shadows cast by regolith grains on other grains become invisible to the observer. CBOE results from constructive interference between rays traveling the same path but in opposite directions. Additional information {{is included in the}} original extended abstract...|$|R

Finally, we verify the prioritization of requirements based on goal-oriented use case approach by calculating prioritization about use cases using the Use Case points proposed by Karner [5]...|$|E
40|$|NADH is a {{naturally}} fluorescent metabolite associated with cellular respiration. Exploiting the different fluorescence lifetime of free and bound NADH {{has the potential}} to quantify the relative amount of bound and free NADH, enhancing understanding of cellular processes including apoptosis, cancer pathology, and enzyme kinetics. We use the phasor- fluorescence lifetime image microscopy approach to spatially map NADH in both the free and bound forms of live undifferentiated and differentiated myoblast cells. The phasor approach graphically depicts the change in lifetime at a pixel level without the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>fitting</b> the decay. Comparison of the spatial distribution of NADH in the nucleus of cells induced to differentiate through serum starvation and undifferentiated cells show differing distributions of bound and free NADH. Undifferentiated cells displayed a short lifetime indicative of free NADH in the nucleus and a longer lifetime attributed to the presence of bound NADH outside of the nucleus. Differentiating cells displayed redistribution of free NADH with decreased relative concentration of free NADH within the nucleus whereas the majority of NADH was found in the cytoplasm. © 2012 Biophysical Society...|$|R
30|$|Mitigating the {{incidence}} of ankle sprains during physical training is desirable due to the high frequency of their occurrence. For example, ankle braces {{have been shown to}} be beneficial to paratroopers for reducing ankle injuries [62, 63]. When evaluating the potential use of ankle braces by recruits, Davidson et al. [60] deemed them to be unsuitable due to the ongoing cost, the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> individual <b>fitting</b> and their ineffectiveness under extreme conditions. Additionally, ankle braces may cause a tighter fit in the boot shaft region and subsequently restrict motion at the ankle joint. Instead, Davidson et al. [60] advocated the use of wobble boards to build ankle stability and strength. Further research into the boot shaft and its influence on the occurrence of ankle sprains is required to address this issue.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel feature {{detector}} for selecting local textures that {{are suitable for}} accurate multi-camera surface reconstruction, and in particular planar patch fitting techniques. This approach {{is in contrast to}} conventional feature detectors, which focus on repeatability under scale and affine transformations rather than suitability for multi-camera reconstruction techniques. The proposed detector selects local textures that are sensitive to affine transformations, which is a fundamental <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> accurate patch <b>fitting.</b> The proposed detector is evaluated against the SIFT detector [11] on a synthetic dataset and the fitted patches are compared against ground truth. The experiments show that patches originating from the proposed detector are fitted more accurately to the visible surfaces than those originating from SIFT keypoints. In addition, the detector is evaluated on a performance capture studio dataset to show the real-world application of the proposed detector...|$|R

30|$|The {{report of}} the FOCUS work group on {{degradation}} kinetics [60] describes kinetic models to meet the <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> registration of pesticides in the EU. The three-compartment model consists of an input compartment (parent compound), a metabolite compartment (sometimes further compartments of secondary metabolites) and an output compartment (sink) including evolved CO 2 and NER. Disappearance of the test substance is described by primary degradation and loss to the sink compartment, which is also fed by reaction of metabolite(s). Thus, mineralization and formation of NER are not distinguished as separate processes. However, simulation tests provide time series of NER and evolved 14 CO 2, which can explicitly be considered <b>for</b> <b>fitting</b> kinetic model parameters.|$|R
