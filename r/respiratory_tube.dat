40|$|SummaryTo {{meet the}} extreme oxygen demand of insect flight muscle, {{tracheal}} (<b>respiratory)</b> <b>tubes</b> ramify {{not only on}} its surface, as in other tissues, but also within T-tubules and ultimately surrounding every mitochondrion. Although this remarkable physiological specialization has long been recognized, its cellular and molecular basis is unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila tracheoles invade flight muscle T-tubules through transient surface openings. Like other tracheal branching events, invasion requires the Branchless FGF pathway. However, localization of the FGF chemoattractant changes from all muscle membranes to T-tubules as invasion begins. Core regulators of epithelial basolateral membrane identity localize to T-tubules, and knockdown of AP- 1 γ, required for basolateral trafficking, redirects FGF from T-tubules to surface, increasing tracheal surface ramification and preventing invasion. We propose that tracheal invasion is controlled by an AP- 1 -dependent switch in FGF trafficking. Thus, subcellular targeting of a chemoattractant can direct outgrowth to specific domains, including inside the cell...|$|R
40|$|Cells {{experience}} different oxygen concentrations {{depending on}} location, organismal developmental stage, and physiological or pathological conditions. Responses to reduced oxygen levels (hypoxia) {{rely on the}} conserved hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF- 1). Understanding the developmental and tissue-specific responses to changing oxygen levels has been limited {{by the lack of}} adequate tools for monitoring HIF- 1 in vivo. To visualise and analyse HIF- 1 dynamics in Drosophila, we used a hypoxia biosensor consisting of GFP fused to the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of the HIF- 1 homologue Sima. GFP-ODD responds to changing oxygen levels and to genetic manipulations of the hypoxia pathway, reflecting oxygen-dependent regulation of HIF- 1 at the single-cell level. Ratiometric imaging of GFP-ODD and a red- fluorescent reference protein reveals tissue-specific differences in the cellular hypoxic status at ambient normoxia. Strikingly, cells in the larval brain show distinct hypoxic states that correlate with the distribution and relative densities of <b>respiratory</b> <b>tubes.</b> We present a set of genetic and image analysis tools that enable new approaches to map hypoxic microenvironments, to probe effects of perturbations on hypoxic signalling, and to identify new regulators of the hypoxia response...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOrgan size {{typically}} increases dramatically during juvenile growth. This growth {{presents a}} fundamental tension, as organs need resiliency to resist stresses while still maintaining plasticity to accommodate growth. The extracellular matrix (ECM) {{is central to}} providing resiliency, but how ECM is remodeled to accommodate growth is poorly understood. We investigated remodeling of Drosophila <b>respiratory</b> <b>tubes</b> (tracheae) that elongate continually during larval growth, despite being lined with a rigid cuticular ECM. Cuticle is initially deposited with a characteristic pattern of repeating ridges and valleys known as taenidia. We find that for tubes to elongate, the extracellular protease Mmp 1 is required for expansion of ECM between the taenidial ridges during each intermolt period. Mmp 1 protein localizes in periodically spaced puncta that are in register with the taenidial spacing. Mmp 1 also degrades old cuticle at molts, promotes apical membrane expansion in larval tracheae, and promotes tube elongation in embryonic tracheae. Whereas work in other developmental systems has demonstrated that MMPs are required for axial elongation occurring in localized growth zones, this study demonstrates that MMPs can also mediate interstitial matrix remodeling during growth of an organ system...|$|R

40|$|SummaryFine tubes form inside cells as {{they reach}} their target tissues in {{epithelial}} ducts and in angiogenesis [1 – 4].

Conversely to the above-mentioned model, we find that the intracellular lumen arises by growth of an apical membrane inwards the cell.

5000|$|The {{parasitic}} mites {{are either}} just {{visible to the}} naked eye or one needs a microscope to see them clearly. The distinct body segmentation characteristic of most arthropods is greatly reduced in the Acari. At the left of the diagram is an anterior section bearing the mouthparts (gnathosoma or capitulum), and at right, a posterior section comprising the main body (idiosoma). Mouthparts are characterized by a central pair of chelicerae, a ventral hypostome, and a lateral pair of palps. Chelicerae are protrusible, cutting or piercing structures essential to feeding. Palps are of sensory function during feeding and do not penetrate the host's skin. Acarines have no antennae and, except for some genera of ticks, are without eyes. A tube for ingesting food and secreting saliva is formed by apposition of both the chelicerae and the hypostome. The main body bears three pairs of legs in the larvae and four pairs in the nymphs and adults. The legs are multiple-jointed and operate by contraction of their internal muscles. The distal segment of the legs, the tarsus, is equipped with a terminal claw or pair of claws and sometimes with an adhesive pad or sucker that enables the mite to crawl up smooth surfaces. The internal organs (or viscera) include a tubular gut with a posterior anus, paired excretory tubes (Malpighian tubules) that empty out into the anus, paired <b>respiratory</b> <b>tubes</b> (tracheae) that carry atmospheric air directly up against the viscera, paired salivary glands with ducts to the mouthparts, female or male reproductive organs (ovary or testes), and a central nervous ganglion that acts as a simple brain.|$|R

50|$|The <b>respiratory</b> <b>tube</b> is {{also known}} in LACM 128319, {{preserved}} as cartilaginous tracheal rings. Only the posterior-most end of the tracheal tube - {{at the end of}} the neck near the pectoral girdle - is known.

Snakes, which are closely related to mosasaurs, have only one functional lung with the second often being vestigial or absent. Unlike terrestrial lizards, however, the bronchi separate in front of the area of the forelimbs rather than at the level of the limbs.Skin impressions are known from Platecarpus, preserved in LACM 128319 as soft impressions and phosphate material. Scales on the tip of the snout and the top of the skull are somewhat hexagonal in shape and do not touch one another. The scales on the jaws are longer and rhomboidal in shape, overlapping one another. The scales on the snout indicate that the nostrils were placed far in front of the skull at its tip and faced laterally as in most squamates and archosaurs. The body scales are all rhomboidal in shape and form tightly connecting diagonal rows that overlap each other at their posterior edges. They are generally the same size throughout the entire length of the body. The caudal scales on the tail are taller and larger than those of the rest of the body, although those covering the lower surface of the tail are more similar to body scales.Internal organs, or viscera, may also be preserved in the specimen as reddish areas. One is located in the thoracic cavity low in the ribcage, while the other is located in the upper portion of the abdominal cavity just behind the ribcage. The reddish areas were analysed with mass spectrometry and were shown to contain high levels of compounds made of iron and porphyrin. These substances are evidence of hemoglobin decomposition products that may have formed in the organs as they decomposed. Based on its position, the organ in the thoracic cavity is probably the heart or liver, or even both of those organs. The organ in the abdominal cavity may be a kidney, although it is in a more anterior position than the kidneys of monitor lizards, mosasaurs' closest living relatives. The anterior position of the kidneys may have been an adaptation toward a more streamlined body, as their presumed position is similar to that of cetaceans.|$|E
40|$|An {{isolated}} {{tracheo-oesophageal fistula}} could {{be caused by}} close proximity of the epithelia of both organs (O'Rahilly & Müller, 1984; Kluth et al. 1987) at certain embryonic stages, the most frequent location being the tracheal bifurcation. Thus the relative position and degree of separation between the digestive and the <b>respiratory</b> <b>tubes</b> throughout their development may be relevant to {{the origin of this}} anomaly. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse along the different segments of the tracheo-oesophageal septum (TES) where the closest relationship between both lumina occurred and what degree of separation was present at each segment. Computer imaging techniques were applied on cross sections of a graded series of normal human embryos (Carnegie stages (CS) 13 – 23). In addition, the differentiation of the primitive TES was also studied (from CS 12) by light microscopy. Between CS 13 and 16 both tubes tended to separate (phase of separation), principally at the proximal segments of the laryngopharyngeal and the tracheo-oesophageal portions of the TES. During this phase the separation between the trachea and oesophagus was wider than between the larynx and pharynx. From CS 17 to CS 23 the digestive and respiratory lumina reached their widest separation at different levels of the laryngopharyngeal portion. Below these levels they tended to come closer together, principally at the proximal segment of the tracheo-oesophageal portion, but also at the distal part of the laryngopharyngeal portion. During this phase of approximation they reached their closest relationship at the proximal (CS 17) and the distal (from CS 18) segments of the tracheo-oesophageal portion. When finally the distal segment of the trachea (which includes the bifurcation) comes closest to the oesophagus, the coats of both organs have already undergone an appreciable differentiation. According to these observations, the origin of the most frequent isolated tracheo-oesophageal fistula at the bifurcation region could not be explained from the normal development of the TES...|$|R

40|$|In mammals, motile cilia cover many organs, such as fallopian <b>tubes,</b> <b>respiratory</b> tracts {{and brain}} ventricles.

To identify the mechanisms involved in this process, we analysed motile cilia of mouse brain ventricles, using biophysical and molecular approaches. Our results highlight an original orientation mechanism for ependymal cilia whereby basal bodies first dock apically with random orientations, and then reorient in a common direction through a coupling between hydrodynamic forces and the planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Vangl 2, within a limited time-frame. This identifies a direct link between external hydrodynamic cues and intracellular PCP signalling.

40|$|SummaryMany organs contain {{epithelial}} tubes that transport gases or liquids [1]. Proper {{tube size}} and shape is crucial for organ function, but the mechanisms controlling tube diameter and length are poorly understood. Recent studies of tracheal (<b>respiratory)</b> <b>tube</b> morphogenesis in Drosophila show that chitin synthesis genes produce an expanding chitin cylinder in the apical (luminal) extracellular matrix (ECM) that coordinates the dilation of the surrounding epithelium [2, 3]. Here, we describe two genes involved in chitin modification, serpentine (serp) and vermiform (verm), mutations in which cause excessively long and tortuous tracheal tubes. The genes encode similar proteins with an LDL-receptor ligand binding motif and chitin binding and deacetylation domains. Both proteins are expressed and secreted during tube expansion and localize throughout the lumen in a chitin-dependent manner. Unlike previously characterized chitin pathway genes, serp and verm are not required for chitin synthesis or secretion but rather for its normal fibrillar structure. The mutations also affect structural properties of another chitinous matrix, epidermal cuticle. Our work demonstrates that chitin and the matrix proteins Serp and Verm limit tube elongation, and it suggests that tube length is controlled independently of diameter by modulating physical properties of the chitin ECM, presumably by N-deacetylation of chitin and conversion to chitosan...|$|E

The rate of disphagia increases due to elderly subjects and brain injuries in our society Majority of these patients have hidden aspiration. Electromyographic assessment of swallowing can produce indicators of recovery and treatment effectiveness. This study tries to indicate pattern and recruitment of muscle activity in swallowing by surface electromyography. Methods and Materials: Twenty healthy subjects (20 - 50) and ten subjects with swallowing dysfunction contribute at this study. Activities of bilateral orbicularis oris, buccinator, sternocleidomastoid and anterior region of throat muscles recorded during three stage of liquid swallowing include water, juice and honey by surface electrodes. Value of activity (RMS), duration of activity (Dur), median (Mdf) and band (Banf) frequency of above muscles were measured. Results: Healthy subjects indicated increase of RMS, Dur, &Mdf and Banf of muscles, following increase of sweeten and viscose of liquid (P< 0. 05). Patients had more increase of this findings at oral muscles markedly, whereas Dur of throat muscle showed more increase in time (P< 0. 05). Comparison of between two groups indicated patients have more Dur time especially at throat muscles (P< 0. 05) and in contras reduce of activities and frequency parameters than healthy subjects (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Extreme environments can impose strong {{ecological}} and evolutionary pressures {{at a local}} level. Ectotherms are particularly sensitive to low-temperature environments, which {{can result in a}} reduced activity period, slowed physiological processes and increased exposure to sub-zero temperatures. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the behavioural and physiological responses that facilitate survival in low-temperature environments. In particular, we asked: 1) do high-altitude common frog (Rana temporaria) adults extend the time available for larval growth by breeding at lower temperatures than low-altitude individuals?; and 2) do tadpoles sampled from high-altitude sites differ physiologically from those from low-altitude sites, in terms of routine metabolic rate (RMR) and freeze tolerance? Breeding date was assessed as the first day of spawn observation and local temperature recorded for five, paired high- and low-altitude R. temporaria breeding sites in Scotland. Spawn was collected and tadpoles raised in a common laboratory environment, where RMR was measured as oxygen consumed using a closed <b>respiratory</b> <b>tube</b> system. Freeze tolerance was measured as survival following slow cooling to the point when all container water had frozen. Results: We found that breeding did not occur below 5 °C at any site and there was no significant relationship between breeding temperature and altitude, leading to a delay in spawning of five days for every 100 m increase in altitude. The relationship between altitude and RMR varied by mountain but was lower for individuals sampled from high- than low-altitude sites within the three mountains with the highest high-altitude sites (≥ 900 m). In contrast, individuals sampled from low-altitudes survived freezing significantly better than those from high-altitudes, across all mountains. Conclusions: Our results suggest that adults at high-altitude do not show behavioural adaptations in terms of breeding at lower temperatures. However, tadpoles appear to have the potential to adapt physiologically to surviving at high-altitude via reduced RMR but without an increase in freeze tolerance. Therefore, survival at high-altitude may be facilitated by physiological mechanisms that permit faster growth rates, allowing completion of larval development within a shorter time period, alleviating the need for adaptations that extend the time available for larval growth...|$|E

For a considerable part of clinically significant species this form of existence provides optimal conditions for reaching of pathogenic and colonizational potential, and also encourages saving of metabolically inactive part of population which is characterized by a low level of sensitivity to antibiotics impact. The latter plays a significant role in formation of chronic persistent infections resistant to antibiotics treatment. Members of microbial group are united basing on the principle which excludes antagonism, determines their nutritional, energetic and another connections between them and environment. Such a connection of microorganisms community behavior received a special definition of “quorum sensing”. Quorum sensing is an ability of some bacteria (probably, also another microorganisms) to communicate and coordinate their behavior through secretion of substances which are the signals for coordination of certain behavior or interaction between bacteria of the same type or subtype depending on their growth tightness. When the concentration of excreted signaling agents reaches a borderline value the group of bacteria starts working as a single organism. Furthermore, signaling agents for Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms differ. For instance, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa microorganism a signaling molecule of quorum sensing is acyl homoserine lactone, and biofilm created by this pathogen produces pyocyanin which functions as an electronic transporter in current generation. A large-scale investigation of P. aeruginosa biofilm morphology, mechanisms of its production and degradation, peculiarities of formation under different conditions and impact of various factors are at the infancy stage. According to undivided opinion of scientists who investigate this problem the main source of nosocomial diseases and persistence factor of their causative agents in hospital ecosystems from air and water to inner surfaces of catheters and body systems are represented by biofilms. Bacteria of P. aeruginosa type are human opportunistic pathogens which being a part of biofilm may cause different nosological forms of pyoinflammatory diseases with severe course and high fatality in immunocompromised patients. These microorganisms are able to contaminate external and internal surfaces of catheters, probes, <b>respiratory</b> <b>tubes,</b> lenses, and form biofilm on them. The given information determines reasonability of searching the methods of control of biofilm production in P. aeruginosa cultures which can be used to increase the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in blue pus infection and/or decontamination of medical equipment, and another objects of hospital environment. One of the methods to control biofilms produced by P. aeruginosa on abiotic surfaces from different materials is impact of antiseptics and decontaminants. Modern decontaminants are represented by a wide spectrum of chemical compounds of different classes which have a common ability to destroy microorganisms even in low concentrations. At present the impact of bacteria on separate elements of biofilm formation is considered {{to be one of the}} most perspective targets for the action of new antimicrobial medicines. Numerous investigations of recent 40 years demonstrated that the process of biofilm formation is complex and multistage. Currently the principal directions of development of new antimicrobial preparations are the following: development of antiadhesive coatings and preparations able to interrupt the function of eternal structures of cells in charge of adhesion (fimbriae, adhesins); development of preparations that block synthesis or destabilize matrix of biofilm; development of preparations that cause cell adhesion deficiency in microcolony, and block cell fission; development of preparations that block intercellular signaling (quorum sensing), and cause disconnection of cells from biofilm and their transition into plankton existence or resist pathogenicity factor expression. Nowadays the influence of certain physical factors on biological properties of biofilms is studied as well. At the present time the new technology that is photodynamic therapy is in intensive progress. Low intensity electromagnetic radiation has widespread application practically in all areas of medicine. In fact, under the influence of light emitting diode radiation metabolic and functional properties of biological system variety can be significantly changed. According to a number of investigators a direct method of light emitting diode radiation effect provides direct influence on cellular structure elements, moreover it has been proved that membrane structures of cell are the most sensitive to optical radiation effect. It was found that under influence of light emitting diode radiation a breakdown of daily biofilms with inhibition of plankton cells production capacity was observed. All the above allows to assess current problem of medical science and practice that is process of biofilm formation in microorganisms particularly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Analysis of literature sources shows practicability of research line of specific subject that is proved by crisis of antibiotic therapy observed for now and characterized not only by multitude of resistant microorganisms but also by absence of preparations and infection pathology therapeutic regimen that have assuring effectiveness and therefore search for alternative control methods is critical and challenging...|$|R
40|$|A {{nosocomial}} {{epidemic of}} multiply resistant (MR) Klebsiella pneumoniae characterized by resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin {{occurred in a}} Veterans Administration hospital from 1975 to 1977. A total of 66 infected or colonized patients were observed in a 2 -year period; there were 43 urinary tract infections, 13 wound or soft tissue infections, 8 pneumonias, and 6 patients with only asymptomatic stool colonization. Four patients had both pneumonia and a urinary tract infection. There were five secondary bacteremias. The majority of MR K. pneumoniae strains were type 30, but types 17, 21, and 23 and nontypable organisms were also recovered. Other gram-negative bacilli with the same antibiotic resistance pattern were isolated from 14 patients. Seven MR K. pneumoniae and three resistant Escherichia coli isolates were shown to transfer resistance to E. coli K- 12. MR K. pneumoniae-infected patients were seriously ill, had long hospitalization times (mean, 67 days), and were in close geographic proximity to other cases. Compared with controls, cases more frequently had prior antibiotic treatment and urinary catheters, but not <b>respiratory</b> instrumentation, nasogastric <b>tubes,</b> or antacid treatment. The apparent {{source of the outbreak}} was traced to an index case who entered the hospital with an MR K. pneumoniae urinary tract infection. Asymptomatic gastrointestinal carriage without infection elsewhere was infrequent (1. 6 % of cultured patients), but 78 % of patients with MR K. pneumoniae infections at other sites also had the organism in their stools. Hospital antibiotic usage was unchanged before and during the outbreak. The identification of an index case and relative lack of asymptomatic stool carriers are unique features of this plasmid-mediated MR K. pneumoniae epidemic. Although this MR K. pneumoniae outbreak appeared to be controlled by the use of isolation techniques, a simultaneous increase in gentamicin resistance among other gram-negative organisms was observed...|$|R
40|$|Di(2 -ethylhexyl) {{phthalate}} (DEHP) is an aromatic diester {{used primarily}} to soften and plasticize the rigid polymer polyvinyl chlo-ride (PVC); DEHP may represent between 20 and 40 % {{of the finished}} weight of the plastic (Jaeger and Rubin 1973). Among other properties, DEHP imparts to PVC flexi-bility, strength, optical clarity, and resistance to broad-range temperature variations (Shea 2003). In its pure form, DEHP is a clear, oily liquid, which is highly lipophilic (fat soluble) and poorly soluble in water. In PVC plastic, DEHP resides in the PVC matrix as a semisolid and readily migrates out of the plastic into blood or other lipid-containing solutions {{in contact with the}} plastic, a phenomenon observed with blood stored in PVC bags (Peck and Albro 1982; Rock et al. 1984). Because of its versatile properties, DEHP is also found in many commercial and household products such as vinyl floor and wall coverings, furniture, raincoats, and shower curtains, as well as cos-metics, personal care products, and food pack-aging [Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) 2002]. DEHP {{has been used as a}} plasticizer in a variety of medical products, such as bags containing blood, plasma, intravenous fluids, and total parenteral nutrition, tubing associated with their administration, nasogastric tubes, enteral feeding tubes, umbilical catheters, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cir-cuit tubing, hemodialysis tubing, <b>respiratory</b> masks, endotracheal <b>tubes,</b> and examination gloves. The rate of DEHP leaching varies not only with the type of solution in contact with the plastic material but also with storage and temperatures at the time of use, storage time, and percent DEHP in the plastic product (Marcel 1973). The leaching rate of DEHP has been studied most rigorously for banked blood and plasma and, as reported, varies between 0. 25 to 0. 40 mg/ 100 mL/day for whole blood stored> 21 days at 4 °C and 6 mg/unit of platelet concentrate stored at room temperatur...|$|R
