Unlike herbaceous peonies with fleshy roots, which are propagated by division, tree peonies have woody stems and extensive root systems that are impractical for division. Their woody stems have few stored reserves and stem cuttings fail before roots are produced. <b>The</b> problem <b>of</b> keeping <b>the</b> <b>scion</b> alive long enough to produce roots (generally a year) is solved by grafting a tree peony shoot on an herbaceous peony <b>root</b> section; <b>the</b> section <b>of</b> <b>root</b> sustains <b>the</b> <b>scion</b> with its ample stored energy. (In contrast, Itoh peony hybrids, which are crosses between herbaceous and tree peonies, are best propagated by stem cuttings, which root easily.) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} was attempted {{to investigate a}} cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scion</b> death in green pepper grafting system. A tobamovirus particle examined in <b>the</b> rootstock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample but not in <b>the</b> <b>scion</b> showing necrosis. <b>The</b> virus isolated from the rootstock was identified as Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), pepper tobamovirus pathotype P 1. 2.

Green pepper varieties ``Long green mart`` and ``Daechan`` represented resistance to the virus showing local lesions only on the inoculated leaves and ``Manitda`` was systematically infected. In the experiment with grafting ``Long green mart`` or ``Daechan`` onto the those rootstocks, <b>the</b> upper leaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scions</b> first showed vein necrosis and wilt symptoms 7 days after inoculation with PMMoV- 2 on <b>the</b> cotyledon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rootstock, following to <b>the</b> <b>scion</b> stem necrosis and then only <b>the</b> <b>scion</b> death. <b>The</b> virus was detected in the rootstock but not in <b>the</b> <b>scion.</b> However, ``Manitda`` <b>of</b> susceptible variety in the grafting system showed mottle symptom on <b>the</b> leaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scion</b> but not necrosis on the plant.
