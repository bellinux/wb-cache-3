40|$|Abstract — In this article, we {{investigate}} real-time estimation of flow states, average velocity and stage (water depth), in open channels using the measurements obtained from Lagrangian sensors (drifters). One-dimensional Shallow Water Equations (SWE), {{also known as}} Saint-Venant equations, are used as the mathematical model for the flow. After linearizing and discretizing the PDEs using an explicit linear scheme, we construct a linear state-space model of the flow. The Kalman filter is then used to estimate the states by incorporating the measurements obtained from passive drifters. Drifters which are equipped with GPS <b>recievers</b> move with the flow and report their position at every time step. The position of the drifters at every time step are used to approximate the average velocity of the flow at the corresponding locations and time step. The method is implemented in simulation on {{a section of the}} Sacramento river in California using real data and the results are validated with a two-dimensional simulation of the river. Finally, the performance of the method using Lagrangian sensors is compared to the case of using Eulerian sensors. I...|$|R

The most important market for Free 2 move is to provide other developers with Bluetooth modules. Free 2 move has recieved some inquiries from previous customers about a system that would allow communication between two or more persons. After recieving this, Free 2 move started to evaluate the grounds for such a protocol and also how the transmisison time slots should be distributed among the parties. The result was planned to manage an infinite number of users and the possibility for two users to talk simultaneously. The goal of the project was to develop a prototype of a <b>reciever</b> with functionality according to a specification and protocol developed by Free 2 move.

40|$|In a pulsed UWB system, either {{coherent}} receivers or transmit-reference (TR) receivers {{can be used}} {{to demodulate}} the signals. For coherent receivers, which are typically based on a Rake Structure, the large number of resolvable multipaths is a major challenge for channel estimation and receiver complexity. TR receivers can effectively collect energy from all the received multipath components with much smaller complexity, but show reduced performance. Current modulation formats are tuned to either coherent or TR receivers, but cannot interoperate with both of them. In this paper, we propose an innovative modulation scheme that enables the useage of TR and coherent <b>recievers</b> in the same wireless network. The modulation allows demodulation by TR receivers, {{while at the same time}} enabling a coherent receiver to fully exploit all available signal energy, and actually to perform slightly better (by 1. 8 dB) than a coherent receiver working with conventional BPSK modulation; this additional gain can be interpreted as a coding gain of a trellis-coded modulation scheme.

40|$|Background: Stress {{as one of}} the {{prevalent}} diseases of the century, is the body non-responsive status to any request that can reduce the forces and affect activities and efforts. Nursing and midwifery students are experiencing multiple stressors during their study. They stress not only from theoretical training environments, that also from hospital stressors. According to negative effects of stress over academic performance of nursing students, stress management could be taught via different methods including traditional and active teaching methods. In traditional teaching, the teacher througout a one-way relationship with students is transferring knowledge and students act as knowledge <b>recievers.</b> In traditional teaching, the teacher is responsible for the education topic, transferring information, assessment of students’ learning status, and strengthening students’ favorable behaviors. The active learning includes methods in which students play more roles than just listening and participate in information process and practice. Objective: The aim of current study was to investigate the effect of traditional teaching compared to the active teaching of stress management on academic performance in nursing students. Methods: The study population consisted of all 3 rd-semester nursing undergraduate level students from Alborz Medical University. Participant including 50 students were randomly assigned to two 25 -individual groups. The first group received traditional teaching (pamphlet, explaining, lecturing) and for the second group active teaching methods (brain storming, group discussion, ask questions, role play, role-play replacement…) were performed for 8 hours. All students completed the DASS 42 questionnaire. Findings: Independent t-test results indicated significant difference between students’ level of stress before and after traditional and active teaching of stress management. Knowing that both traditional and active teachings could reduce students’ stress, though active teaching was more effective. Moreover, active teaching compared to traditional method led to a better students’ academic performance. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that compared to the traditional method the active learning reduced the students’ anxiety and depression. Teaching stress management especially via an active learning is a suitable approach to improve students’ academic performance and to decrease the negative effects of anxiety, stress, and depression.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an new method for deriving a shared-earth velocity model for P-P ans P-SV reflections measured with ocean bottom cable (OBC) data. The data {{have the potential}} to reveal lithological and fluid information about the rocks in the subsurface. The S waves recorded on OBCs are usually SV waves that have been converted on refraction of downgoing P-waves from the source. Conventional preocessing of OBC data separates the P-waves and SV-waves on the basis of particle motion: P-waves on the vertical component and SV-waves on the horizontal components. The P-waves are then processed in the conventional way, using procedures based on common mid point (CMP) gathers that have been well established for decades and are very sucessfulin determining subsurface structure. The SV waves are conventionally processed in a similar proceedure, based on common- conversion point (CCP) gathers, that requires the P-wave to S-wave velocity ratio, gamma, to be knowna priori; initiallythis must be guessed. the result of processing these two data sets is two seismic time sections: one a P-wave section and the other a converted wave section. By subjectively correlating events in these two sections it is possible to estimate the S-wave velocities. This may lead to further iterations in the converted wave processing. my aim is to remove the need for any guesswork in the estimate of gamma and to eliminate the subjective correlation step. The basic earth model underlying my approach is of discrete homogenous isotropic elastic layers separted by interfaces at which reflections occur. I invert the reflection travel times of the common-shot gathers or common <b>recievers</b> gathers to find the layer velocities and the positions of the interfaces in depth, working from the top downwards. I start with a travel time inversion scheme developed by Guangpin Li that assumes the interfaces are plane, but locally dipping. This gives an initial estimate of the ray paths and the interfaces. We thwn assume that the interfaces can be described as locally parabolic which gives better inversion results. For the P-wave data, the P-wave velocities and the interface geometries are the output of the inversion. thes P-wave velocities, but not he interface geometry, are used for the converted wave inversion, the output of which is S wave velocities and interface geometry. The interface geometry must be the same for both inversions: this shared-earth modal is the criterion for determining which converted-wave refractions correspond with the P-wave reflections. I have developed a processing flow based aroud this inversion scheme, that requires a number of new steps, including separation of P-waves and S-waves, manually picking travel time curves in shot gatheres, and parameterising the picked data using cubic polynomials. The output of the processing flow are P- and S- wave interval-velocity in depth models {{that can be used for}} pre-depth stack migration. The processing scheme I develop is very simple compared with traditional schemes for generating interval-velocity depth models. Tests of the model building flow on both P-P and P-SV synthetic data yield good results. However, the initial model affects the final result and it is clear that, in some cases, the inversion drives the solution to a local, rather than a global,eroor minimum. I propose a brute-force solution for this problem: give the inversion a range of velocities in any layer and for each velocity find the minimum-error interface; then choose the velocity that gives the least error. I apply the new processing flow to real data provided by Shell from the Guillemot field in the North Sea. the results are good, but there are still small eroors in the velocity model which i attribute to limitations in the way we have chosen to parameterise the earth. These errors can be reduced by updating the velocity field based on the residual moveout of reflection events in the migrated common image gathers. The method needs to be extended to layers that may have vertical and horizontal gradients. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
