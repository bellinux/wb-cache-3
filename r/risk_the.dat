Early exposure is strongly associated with an increased <b>risk.</b> <b>The</b> size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E

40|$|Target of {{the work}} is to study the Latvian trade sector {{external}} and internal risks, perform risk identification, classification and assessment. In the work are used scientific research methods – analysis and synthesis methods, economic analysis method of enterprises, the special coefficient method and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> ranking method. <b>The</b> authors had studied the Latvian trade sector in the period from 2004 to 2010. In Latvian trade sector from 2004 to 2006 was observed increment of turnover, but from 2007 was observed decline of turnover. In Latvian trade sector is monopolistic competition. Many enterprises offer a market differentiated trade services. Small and medium companies are merging into trade cooperation and chain stores. The authors had studied average financial indexes of the Latvian trade sector enterprises. Average financial risk coefficient of Latvian trade sector enterprises had increased during the period from 2006 to 2009. The authors have created classification of Latvian trade sector economic and financial risks and classification of the trade technological process <b>risks.</b> <b>The</b> authors have created the algorithms of classification and assessment of the trade sector enterprises’ <b>risks.</b> <b>The</b> economic <b>risks</b> are <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of <b>the</b> country’s economic slowdown, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of increment of taxes, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of reduction in consumer’s solvency, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of demand’s instability and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of insufficiency of credit resources. <b>The</b> financial <b>risks</b> are <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of unpaid credit, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of financial instability, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of insufficiency of own capital, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of liquidity and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of debtors. <b>The</b> trade technological process <b>risks</b> are <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of organization of selling goods, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of accounting, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of ordering goods, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of acceptance of goods and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of transportation of goods. In order to develop their business strategies, enterprises need to identify, classify and assess the Latvian trade sector risks. Enterprises can use the authors created algorithms of classification and assessment of <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> to produce their own risk management systems...|$|R
5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical <b>risk.</b> <b>The</b> DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E
5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own <b>risk.</b> <b>The</b> shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not <b>risk</b> <b>the</b> major units of the fleet south of 55° 30' North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines.

The development was funded by the Rangers football pools operation, which was the largest club-based scheme in Britain. The first phase of the plan, which began in 1978, was the removal of the east terracing and its replacement with the Copland Road stand. The same process was repeated on the west side of the ground a year later, with the two identical stands each holding 7,500 seats. The redevelopment was completed in 1981 with the replacement of the Centenary Stand by the 10,300 capacity Govan Stand.|$|E
5000|$|Risk {{analysis}} is more easily achieved if, after identification, <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> {{are placed in}} proper perspective within the RBS by categorizing <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> in <b>the</b> various levels. <b>Risk</b> analysis involves <b>the</b> use of techniques for prioritizing <b>the</b> <b>risk,</b> determining <b>the</b> probability of <b>the</b> <b>risk,</b> and calculating <b>the</b> impact of <b>the</b> <b>risk.</b> At no point should the project manager or risk manager decide that {{the total number of}} identified <b>risks</b> should cause <b>the</b> cancellation of the project.

Fortunately for North Vietnam, many U.S. bombing advocates (including Air Force Chief of Staff McConnell) did not want to <b>risk</b> <b>the</b> one aircraft capable of delivering a lot of bombs in bad weather – the B-52.
