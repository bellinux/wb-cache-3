5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks,</b> such as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Repetitive</b> {{workplace}} <b>tasks</b> {{are associated}} with fatigue induced changes to shoulder muscular behavior, which can alter glenohumeral joint kinematics and lead to chronic injury. However, accessible and reliable methods to detect shoulder muscle fatigue in the workplace are scarce. The overall purpose of this thesis was twofold. First to determine if changes in upper extremity joint angle across individuals during a workplace emulative <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> exhibit features that may be visually identifiable, and second, to characterize the relationship between potentially visually identifiable changes in thoracohumeral elevation and traditional indicators of shoulder muscle fatigue. Twenty-seven, young healthy individuals performed a seated repetitive manuals materials handling task requiring them to lift and lower a weighted bottle between two target locations to exhaustion. During the last five lift motions of each 2 -minute interval during the <b>repetitive</b> <b>task,</b> a symbolic motion structure representation (SMSR) algorithm was used to identify the basic spatial-temporal structure of the time series upper extremity joint angle data (i. e. torso, thoracohumeral, elbow and wrist), followed by measures of selected shoulder muscle electromyography (EMG) mean power frequency (MPF) and ratings of perceived fatigue and discomfort (RPF/RPD). Joint angle SMSRs characterize motion as a sequence of directional changes in joint angle time series data, which are easier to visually identify by ergonomists, in comparison to joint angle magnitudes. Changes in joint angle SMSRs occurred across upper extremity joints for most participants (at least 24 of 27) in this <b>repetitive</b> <b>task.</b> A weak positive linear relationship existed between the onset of changes in thoracohumeral elevation SMSR and the onset of shoulder muscle fatigue (as identified by {{a decline in the}} EMG MPF from the infraspinatus muscle) (R 2 = 0. 275, p = 0. 02). Participants who varied the thoracohumeral elevation SMSR, in comparison to those who did not, exhibited a 7. 45 % greater decrease in anterior deltoid EMG MPF (p = 0. 304), indicative of higher levels of muscle fatigue, throughout the <b>repetitive</b> <b>task.</b> In principle, the results of this thesis indicate that upper extremity kinematic changes in a <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> may be visually identifiable as directional changes in joint motion identified by the SMSR algorithm. The relationship between anterior deltoid muscle fatigue and variability in thoracohumeral elevation SMSRs throughout the <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> provide a link between potentially visually identifiable directional changes in thoracohumeral elevation joint motion (SMSR) and shoulder muscle fatigue accumulation. These initial findings can inform future research endeavors aimed at developing heuristic guidelines for visually identifying variations in thoracohumeral joint angles as a more accessible method to identify local shoulder muscle fatigue in ergonomics assessments...|$|R

The aims of this study were to investigate muscle activity during <b>repetitive</b> <b>task,</b> to compare muscle activity between genders and to determine the correlation between muscles and time. Biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and upper trapezius muscles were identified as a significant muscle in the <b>repetitive</b> light <b>task</b> experiment. Surface electromyography (SEMG) measurements for each muscle mentioned above were taken from ten subjects in the duration of one hour experiment. The results indicated that anterior deltoid is the highest affected muscle by the tasks. There was a significantly increase of root mean square (RMS) between {{the beginning and the end}} of the experiment, that indicated muscle fatigue.

25|$|In {{the days}} when human muscles were the only power source {{available}} aboard ship, shanties served practical functions. The rhythm of the song served to synchronize {{the movements of the}} sailors or to pace the labor as they toiled at <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks.</b> Singing helped to alleviate boredom and to lighten, perhaps, the psychological burden of hard work.

25|$|Throughout most {{of human}} {{prehistory}} and history, listening to recorded music was not possible.

Manual labor often included singing by the workers, which served several practical purposes. It reduced the boredom of <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks,</b> it kept the rhythm during synchronized pushes and pulls, and it set the pace of many activities such as planting, weeding, reaping, threshing, weaving, and milling.

25|$|Henry Ford {{revolutionized}} the automobile manufacturing process by employing interchangeable parts on assembly lines—the beginning of industrial mass production. In 1908, the Ford Motor Company released the Ford Model T which could generate 20 horsepower, was lightweight, {{and easy to}} repair. Demand for the car was so great, he had to relocate his assembly plant to Highland Park, Michigan in 1912. The new plant was a model of industrial efficiency for the time: it was well lit and ventilated, employed conveyors to move parts along an assembly line, and workers' stations were orderly arranged along the line. The efficiency of the assembly line allowed Ford to realize great gains in economy and productivity; in 1912, Ford sold 6,000 cars for approximately $900 and by 1916 approximately 577,000 Model T automobiles were sold for $360. Ford was able to scale production rapidly because assembly-line workers were unskilled laborers performing <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks.</b> Ford hired European immigrants, African-Americans, ex-convicts, and the disabled and paid comparatively high wages, but was quick to dismiss anyone involved in labor unions or radical political associations.|$|E

40|$|Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) {{is common}} after stroke and {{individuals}} with USN have greater disability than individuals without USN. Existing interventions for USN must be examined more closely and new interventions {{should be considered}} to identify interventions that show the most promise for reducing disability associated with USN. The focus of this dissertation was three-fold. First, we examined {{the state of the}} science related to interventions for USN after stroke, and articulated a scientific rationale for examining <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> practice. Second, we examined the association between USN and changes in impaired arm function over time. Third, we conducted a Phase II pilot clinical trial examining the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> practice among adults with USN after stroke. 	The findings highlight the complexities of impairments associated with USN (impaired arm use, impaired arm function, inattention). We proposed a new conceptual model that may be useful in conceptualizing and examining new intervention approaches to USN. We found that individuals with USN have greater impairments in arm function than individuals without USN at the onset of stroke rehabilitation, and that the trajectory of motor recovery is attenuated for individuals with USN in the next 6 months. We also determined that it is feasible to recruit and retain individuals with chronic USN and hemiparesis to participate in an intensive <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> practice program and that the intervention was tolerable for participants. Finally, we found that individuals with USN experience small, yet statistically reliable improvements in arm use, arm function, and attention after participating in a <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> practice program. 	Future studies should prospectively examine variability in the trajectories of motor recovery, attention, and disability among individuals with USN from the onset of stroke through the first year or two after stroke to inform the refinement of sample selection criteria, intervention design and timing, as well as outcome assessment. These data may be used in future studies to explore additional interventions that address impaired arm use, impaired arm function, and inattention associated with USN. ...|$|R
40|$|Loss of {{functional}} movement {{is a common}} consequence of stroke for which {{a wide range of}} interventions has been developed. In this Review, we aimed to provide an overview of the available evidence on interventions for motor recovery after stroke through the evaluation of systematic reviews, supplemented by recent randomised controlled trials. Most trials were small and had some design limitations. Improvements in recovery of arm function were seen for constraint-induced movement therapy, electromyographic biofeedback, mental practice with motor imagery, and robotics. Improvements in transfer ability or balance were seen with <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> training, biofeedback, and training with a moving platform. Physical fitness training, high-intensity therapy (usually physiotherapy), and <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> training improved walking speed. Although the existing evidence is limited by poor trial designs, some treatments do show promise for improving motor recovery, particularly those that have focused on high-intensity and repetitive task-specific practice...|$|R
25|$|Sea shanties are {{a type of}} work song {{traditionally}} sung by sailors. Derived {{from the}} French word 'chanter', meaning 'to sing', they may date from {{as early as the}} 15th century, but most recorded examples derive from the 19th century. Shanties were usually slow rhythmic songs designed to help with collective tasks on labour-intensive sailing and later steam ships. Many were call and response songs, with one voice (the shantyman) singing a lead line {{and the rest of the}} sailors giving a response together. There were derived from varied sources, including dances, folk songs, polkas, waltzes and even West African work-songs. Since different songs were useful for different tasks they are traditionally divided into three main categories, short haul shanties, for tasks requiring quick pulls over a relatively short time; halyard shanties, for heavier work requiring more set-up time between pulls; and Capstan shanties, for long, <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks</b> requiring a sustained rhythm, but not involving working the lines. Famous shanties include, the 'Drunken Sailor' and 'Blow the Man Down'. There was some interest in sea shanties in the first revival from figures like Percy Grainger. In the second revival A. L. Lloyd attempted to popularise them, recording several albums of sea songs from 1965.|$|E

Review methods: Included studies were randomized/quasi-randomized trials in adults after stroke where an active motor sequence aiming to improve functional activity was performed repetitively {{within a single}} training session. We used Cochrane Collaboration methods, resources, and software. Results: We included 14 trials with 17 intervention-control pairs and 659 participants.

A discussion of the factors that influence the values of the OCRA index and ULRA’s <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> indicator shows that both similarities and differences in the results produced by the two methods can arise from the concepts that underlie them.
