5|$|Currently, it {{is unclear}} whether waves are an {{efficient}} heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves have been found to dissipate or <b>refract</b> before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of two quasars with a {{separation}} of less than 5 arcseconds, the quasar pair 4C 11.50 {{is one of the}} visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) does not have enough mass to <b>refract</b> light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a lensed image, although it does have a true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and {{are in the process of}} merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's supermassive black hole.|$|E

25|$|In the SOFAR channel, {{the speed}} of sound is lower than that in the layers above and below. Just as light waves will <b>refract</b> towards a region of higher index, sound waves will <b>refract</b> towards a region where their speed is reduced. The result is that sound gets {{confined}} in the layer, much the way light can be confined in a sheet of glass or optical fiber. Thus, the sound is confined in essentially two dimensions. In two dimensions the intensity drops in proportion to only the inverse of the distance. This allows waves to travel much further before being undetectably faint.|$|E
3000|$|Figure  2 {{displays}} {{the effect of}} the embedded porous fraction (ɛ[*]=[*]r/R) on the variation of energy shares of reflected and <b>refracted</b> waves with incident direction θ 0. It is clear that all the reflected and <b>refracted</b> waves are significantly affected by ɛ except the reflected P wave on which the effect of ɛ is almost insignificant. Near normal and grazing incidence, most of the incident energy is reflected back {{in the form of the}} P wave. The <b>refracted</b> P 1 wave is strengthened with the decrease in ɛ. The <b>refracted</b> SV wave is strengthened with an increase in ɛ for θ 0  ∈ (40 °,  85 °). For θ 0  ∈ (0,  30 °), the <b>refracted</b> P 2 and P 3 waves are getting stronger with an increase in ɛ, while beyond 65 ° an inverse effect of ɛ is noticed on these waves. A significant effect of ɛ is noticed on the interaction energy beyond 40 °. The effect of frequency on the reflected and <b>refracted</b> waves with incident direction θ 0 is exhibited in Fig.  3. The energy shares of reflected and <b>refracted</b> SV waves increase with the increase in frequency for θ 0  ∈ (50 °,  82 °). However, the reflected P wave does not show a noticeable change with frequency. The variational patterns of <b>refracted</b> (P 1, P 2) waves are almost alike, that is, it increases with the increase in frequency beyond 40 °. The <b>refracted</b> P 3 wave is strengthened with the increase in frequency for θ 0  ∈ (0,  62 °). The major effect of frequency is observed on the interaction energy beyond 40 °. The impact of size (r) of embedded sphere on the variation of energy shares with incident direction θ 0 is shown in Fig.  4. It is clearly visible from the figure that the effect of r on the reflected waves is negligible. However, a significant effect of r is observed on the interaction energy and <b>refracted</b> waves except the <b>refracted</b> SV wave. The <b>refracted</b> (P 1, P 2) waves are strengthened, and the P 3 wave weakens with a decrease in r beyond 40 °. The effect of pore-fluid viscosity η on the energy shares is shown in Fig.  5. The impact of η is almost insignificant on the reflected P wave. Further, it is observed that the variational pattern of reflected and <b>refracted</b> SV waves is almost alike with respect to η. No impact of η is observed on the reflected and <b>refracted</b> SV waves below 50 ° and beyond 85 °. A significant impact of η is found on all the <b>refracted</b> longitudinal waves and interaction energy. The <b>refracted</b> P 2 wave is strengthened with a decrease in η. At grazing incidence, a negligible impact of η is found on all the reflected and <b>refracted</b> waves. The variation of energy shares with incident direction θ_ 0 in the presence and absence of WIFF is shown in Fig.  6. In the presence of WIFF, the <b>refracted</b> P 1, P 2 waves strengthen in comparison with the absence of WIFF for θ_ 0 ∈ (20 ^∘, 89 ^∘ [...]). A small impact of the presence of WIFF is observed on the reflected P wave in the range θ_ 0 ∈ (50 ^∘, 85 ^∘ [...]). The reflected and <b>refracted</b> SV waves strengthen a lot in the absence of WIFF in comparison with the presence of WIFF for θ_ 0 ∈ (40 ^∘, 85 ^∘ [...]). A small interaction between two dissimilar waves in DP 2 materials is observed in the absence of WIFF.|$|R
25|$|In 1666, Isaac Newton {{argued that}} the faults of the <b>refracting</b> {{telescope}} were fundamental because the lens <b>refracted</b> light of different colors differently. He concluded that light could not be <b>refracted</b> through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could {{be made in the}} <b>refracting</b> telescope. However, he was able to demonstrate that the angle of reflection remained the same for all colors, so he decided to build a reflecting telescope. It was completed in 1668 and is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose the}} {{decoupled}} internal-field expansion (IFE) method to discuss refractions in the photonic crystal (PhC). This method decouples the full wave in the PhC and classifies them {{into two categories}} including the forward-propagating and backward-propagating waves denoted by the index n. A triangular-PhC case is demonstrated and {{both positive and negative}} refractions are discussed by this method. The incident angle of 10 ° results in the positive <b>refracted</b> wave with the <b>refracted</b> angle about 8 °, which approximately corresponds to the forward wave of n= 0 order. The negative <b>refracted</b> waves, which exist in the left and right edge regions, propagate almost parallel to the interfaces between the PhC and outside media. Meanwhile, due to the interaction between the negative <b>refracted</b> wave and the nearest few rows of air cylinders, the reflected wave and another weaker negative <b>refracted</b> wave are created. Finally, the weaker negative <b>refracted</b> waves from both edge regions interfere with each other in the middle region. It is found out that the negative <b>refracted</b> waves in edge regions as well as the interfered wave in the middle region can be constructed by two n=- 1 forward and backward waves. On the other hand, the positive <b>refracted</b> wave is composed of the n= 0 forward wave dressed other n≠ 0 forward waves, the propagation angle is affected by these dressed waves, especially near the edge region. Finally, another case proves this point of view explicitly...|$|R

25|$|The first {{classification}} {{is a type}} 1 jetty. This type of jetty {{is significantly}} longer than the surf zone width and the waves break at the shore end of the jetty. The effect of a Type 1 jetty is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the jetty. These waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. An example of a Type 1 jetty is Mission Beach, San Diego, California. This 1000-meter jetty was installed in 1950 {{at the mouth of}} Mission Bay. The surf waves happen north of the jetty, are longer waves, and are powerful. The bathymetry of the sea bottom in Mission Bay has a wedge shape formation that causes the waves to <b>refract</b> as they become closer to the jetty. The waves converge constructively after they <b>refract</b> and increase the sizes of the waves.|$|E
50|$|A <b>refracting</b> {{telescope}} (also {{called a}} refractor) {{is a type}} of optical telescope that uses a lens as its objective to form an image (also referred to a dioptric telescope).

Although large <b>refracting</b> telescopes were very popular {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, for most research purposes the <b>refracting</b> telescope has been superseded by the reflecting telescope which allows larger apertures. A refractor's magnification is calculated by dividing the focal length of the objective lens by that of the eyepiece.|$|R
