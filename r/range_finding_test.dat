Effect concentration fifty (EC- 50) of hexavalent chromium for plant dry matter (PDM) Jatropha was higher than for PDM Pterocarpus. No significant effect was found for aerial plant parts of Jatropha. Compost amendment was preferable when Jatropha was planted in hexavalent chromium polluted soil because Jatropha could remediate higher concentration than Pterocarpus.

40|$|Some of {{the factors}} {{affecting}} colonisation of a colonisation sampler, the Standard Aufwuchs Unit (S. Auf. U.) were investigated, namely immersion period, whether anchored on the bottom or suspended, {{and the influence of}} riffles. It was concluded that a four-week immersion period was best. S. Auf. U. anchored on the bottom collected both more taxa and individuals than suspended ones. Fewer taxa but more individuals colonised S. Auf. U. in the potamon zone compared to the rhithron zone with a consequent reduction in the values of pollution indexes and diversity. It was concluded that a completely different scoring system was necessary for lowland rivers. Macroinvertebrates colonising S. Auf. U. in simulated streams, lowland rivers and the R. Churnet reflected water quality. A variety of pollution and diversity indexes were applied to results from lowland river sites. Instead of these, it was recommended that an abbreviated species - relative abundance list be used to summarise biological data for use in lowland river surveillance. An intensive study of gastropod populations was made in simulated streams. Lynnaea peregra increased in abundance whereas Potamopyrgas jenkinsi decreased with increasing sewage effluent concentration. No clear-cut differences in reproduction were observed. The presence/absence of eight gastropod taxa was compared with concentrations of various pollutants in lowland rivers. On the basis of all field work it appeared that ammonia, nitrite, copper and zinc were the toxicants most likely to be detrimental to gastropods and that P. jenkinsi and Theodoxus fluviatilis were the least tolerant taxa. 96 h acute toxicity tests of P. jenkinsi using ammonia and copper were carried out in a flow-through system after a variety of static <b>range</b> <b>finding</b> <b>tests.</b> P. jenkinsi was intolerant to both toxicants compared to reports on other taxa and the results suggested that these toxicants would affect distribution of this species in the field...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report (the second {{one of a series}} in which the {{methodology}} for hazard/risk assessment of the use of pesticides for birds and mammals will be presented) is to give a method for taking into account the avoidance behaviour in the evaluation of LC 50 studies and to provide a concept for the use of food avoidance behaviour in the environmental hazard/risk assessment of pesticides used in agriculture for birds. An analysis is made of the standard dietary LC 50 test and of 3 types of food avoidance tests. It is concluded that the standard dietary LC 50 test provides most of the information necessary to understand the repellent properties of a pesticide. It is recommended to measure the food consumption daily, to provide information about the learning abilities of the species tested (when does food avoidance appear). A method is proposed to calculate the No Repellent Concentration (NoRC). The NoRC is the concentration in the treated food at which the birds in the test will eat the same amount of treated food as the amount of (untreated) food in the conrol group. Data of the <b>range</b> <b>finding</b> <b>tests</b> can be used to design the LC 50 test (which doses will be tested) to provide a better estimation of the NoRC value. These small alterations of the standard LC 50 test make other repellency tests with birds superfluous, because the standard LC 50 test is providing enough information about the repellent properties of the substance. Those repellency tests can be used to provide information about the edibility of the granulates and seeds (coated or pillorized, but not treated with a substance), which results in less suffering of test animals. ...|$|R

The EC 50 dose of sodium arsenite was considered at which 50 % of earthworms exhibited rejection to the spot on filter paper in the spot rejection test. The LD 50 of sodium arsenite resulting in mortality in 50 % of Eisenia fetida was studied with contact filter paper bioassay (24 hrs) and soil bioassay (14 days). In the <b>range</b> <b>finding</b> <b>test,</b> there was no mortality in control and 0. 1 mg/ml but 100 % mortality was observed at doses of 1 mg and above after 24 hours. Thus, for further study smaller doses intervals in the range between 0 - 1 mg/ml was selected for spot rejection, contact filter paper and soil bioassay. The percent mortality in each test was computed and was subjected to regression analysis to get a linear dose response curve and estimation of EC 50 and LD 50. The EC 50 was estimated as 0. 3 mg/ml of sodium arsenite concentration to Eisenia fetida. The 24 hrs- LD 50 was estimated as 0. 4 mg/cm 2 in filter paper and 14 days-LD 50 as 5 mg/kg in soil bioassay. Thus {{it can be concluded}} that Eisenia fetida exhibit sign of toxicity in environmental soils which are containing 1 mg/kg and higher doses of sodium arsenite...|$|E

The {{distance}} to the target in these range finders is usually calculated by determining the time interval between the peaks in the resulting power fluctuations that are produced by the self-mixing effect. In this study we propose {{the use of a}} method that utilises the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that proves to have better performance than the traditional peak spacing methods used by other researchers. A <b>range</b> <b>finding</b> system has been built using a VCSEL and the FFT to measure a range of distances from 20 cm to 1 m with a maximum error of 1. 5 % and a resolution of 5 mm. This is the first time to our knowledge that such a <b>range</b> <b>finding</b> system has been built with a VCSEL...|$|R
