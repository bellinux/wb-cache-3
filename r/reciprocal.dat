5|$|The Lineweaver–Burk plot or double <b>reciprocal</b> plot is {{a common}} way of {{illustrating}} kinetic data. This is produced by taking the <b>reciprocal</b> of {{both sides of the}} Michaelis–Menten equation. As shown on the right, this is a linear form of the Michaelis–Menten equation and produces a straight line with the equation y = mx + c with a y-intercept equivalent to 1/Vmax and an x-intercept of the graph representing −1/KM.|$|E
5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by <b>reciprocal</b> selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent <b>reciprocal</b> selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E
5|$|Familiar {{examples}} of equid hybrids are the mule, {{a cross between}} a female horse and a male donkey, and the hinny, {{a cross between a}} female donkey and a male horse. Pairs of complementary types like the mule and hinny are called <b>reciprocal</b> hybrids.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with sums of <b>reciprocals</b> in number theory. We first give a brief background and introduction to metric number theory, in particular the areas of Diophantine approximation and continued fractions. We then review sums of <b>reciprocals</b> and their significance and usefulness in certain fields of mathematics as a motivation for their study. The Three Distance theorem, {{also known as the}} Steinhaus conjecture, is then discussed and we use it to develop a new technique for obtaining bounds for sums of <b>reciprocals,</b> making constants explicit...|$|R

Recent archeological work, for example, indicates that Capernaum, a city important in Jesus' ministry, was poor and small, {{without even a}} forum or an agora.

5|$|Not all co-evolved {{interactions}} between species involve conflict. Many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved. For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between {{plants and the}} mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil. This is a <b>reciprocal</b> relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system.|$|E
