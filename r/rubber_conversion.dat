It can solve the wheeled vehicle the question which in the soft wet slippery location work ability drops. Based on the loader the <b>rubber</b> <b>conversion</b> track wheel design analysis results, has carried on the overall concept design to the loader track wheel. This plan uses the middle brace structure, the design absorption of shock stretching device, has solved the problem which track wheel bearing power small, the vibration and the caterpillar band tighten. Through to the loader track wheel straight line travel, climbing power, obstacle negotiation ability, changes ability the simulation analysis, has carried on the confirmation to the design proposal. The simulation result indicated that the loader track wheel road surface compatible, the climbing and obstacle crossing ability are good, change nimbly...|$|E

50|$|LiteFoot ATV {{rubber tracks}} are a track {{conversion}} system for ATVs manufactured by Mattracks Inc. Tracks are bolted {{in place of}} tires. Mattracks launched the LiteFoot ATV track conversion systems in 2002, adding to the Mattracks <b>rubber</b> track <b>conversion</b> product line up.|$|R
50|$|Mattracks {{was started}} by the company’s CEO, Glen Brazier. The company {{developed}} out of a product conceived from a drawing by his 11-year-old son, Matt. The <b>rubber</b> track <b>conversion</b> system was first manufactured in Thief River Falls, Minnesota in 1992. Later, production was moved to its current location {{in the community of}} Karlstad, Minnesota.|$|R
50|$|Mattracks, Inc. was {{incorporated}} in 1995, {{at that time}} the company employed six people, manufacturing and marketing the original model of the Mattracks <b>rubber</b> track <b>conversion</b> system. The original Mattracks system was sold primarily in U. S. markets as well as in Canada. Mattracks added sales staff in 1999 to address growing interests in their products from the international market.|$|R

To study of ancient fresco restoration techniques, A novel algorithm of local statistic enhancement image is proposed in this paper for the reparation of ancient fresco. The modified amplified function and the <b>rubber</b> band <b>conversion</b> algorithm are used as the jugement criterion, and the optimal paremeters are searched by the genetic algorithm (GA). Experimental {{results show that the}} quality of images is improved compared with the traditional. I...|$|R

Thesis takes {{a closer look at}} construction of <b>rubber</b> track undercarriage <b>conversion</b> systems which can be mounted on an off-road vehicle, its history and solutions of modern manufacturers. Second part introduces design of such undercariage, 3 D Autodes Inventor 2015 model and technical documentation of chosen parts...|$|R
40|$|The study aims to {{determine}} {{factors that influence}} <b>rubber</b> land <b>conversion</b> into palm oil plantation. The population in this research is the whole farmers whose rubber plantation have conservated into palm oil plantation {{in the village of}} Kuantan Sako Kecamatan Kuantan Sako. Sampling is taken by purposive sampling techigue. Data is collected through interview and observation. Data is analized then using descriptive analysis. The research found that there is influence factors to land convertion from rubber plantation into palm plantations, namely: economic, environmental, and technical aspects. It is adviced to government to pay attention the expantion of palm oil plantation accordance with te spatial area that has set the government, to avoid global warming...|$|R
50|$|Note {{that there}} are some non-powered tracked {{transports}} (i.e. trailers that roll on tracks rather than wheels), which have two idler wheels rather than a drive sprocket. There are also certain pieces of equipment, such as the Caterpillar D9 bulldozer, Tucker Sno-cat and Mattracks <b>rubber</b> track <b>conversion</b> kits, which configure their tracks {{in the shape of a}} triangle, or pyramid (when viewed from the side), with the drive sprocket at the tip of the pyramid. In this configuration, there are two idler/roadwheels and one drive sprocket (as well as a number of small, load-bearing roadwheels). In very rare cases, the vehicle lacks an idler wheel at all; in Northern regions, one way people got better traction in deep snow was to take a simple three-axle truck, and install a simple continuous track around the rear wheels, thus forming a basic half-track system which featured two drive wheels, and no idler or road wheels. One almost never sees this on true tracked vehicles, however, as the second drive wheel is redundant.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{agent-based}} modelling approach (LB-LUDAS model) {{was applied}} to simulate and visualize the temporal and spatial scale effects of the Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) scheme on the trade-offs between goods and services in the rubber agroforest landscapes in Jambi Province, (Sumatra) Indonesia. The PES scheme under investigation {{is a form of}} eco-certification of biodiversity-friendly rubber agroforests, as an economic incentive to keep <b>rubber</b> agroforests from <b>conversion</b> into monoculture plantations. Within the model, we integrated the concept of PES conditionality, where biodiversity performance measures were set for household agents to qualify for incentives. On the other hand, species richness, carbon sequestration, and natural succession sub-models are imbedded in the landscape agents. During the simulation, we looked at three different price scenarios to determine how they will affect the land-use decision of the agents and the ecosystem services supply. The main results showed that PES for rubber agroforests could offer synergies among carbon emission reduction, biodiversity and livelihoods when compared to the existing land-use practices. At the same time, the scheme could reduce the trade-offs resulting from possible land-use/cover change. The results of the simulation were validated using a role-playing game testing responses to external agents...|$|R
40|$|Pacific Island Countries {{including}} Fiji {{have large}} tract of forest areas and plantation forestry mainly for log production. With the current increases in world {{oil prices and}} Fiji’s dependence on oil for its transport and energy sector, Fiji is looking at renewable energy sources from forest biomass to minimise reliance on oil for energy production and also to utilise forest residues arising from annual harvesting operations. Fiji‘s current harvesting system is mainly semi-mechanised with manual felling, delimbing and <b>conversion.</b> <b>Rubber</b> tiered skidders are mainly used for tree hauling from the cut-over areas to the landings although in native forest logging tracked bulldozers are used. Current log supply volume form the forest totals to 300, 000 tonnes per annum {{and is expected to}} increase to 500, 000 tonnes from 2010. Fiji Pine Limited, the owners of the plantations, also see forest biomass sale as a source of revenue especially with the planned increase in log supply volume. Independent power producers will soon be demanding biomass for their renewable energy production. This research will compare conventional with integrated harvesting on Pinus caribaea plantations, establishing production estimates and costs for biomass supply. This research is to be undertaken for a PhD degree at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The forest residue production research based on commercial harvesting operations {{will be the first to}} be conducted for Pacific Island Countries and hence it is hoped the research findings can be widely applied...|$|R
