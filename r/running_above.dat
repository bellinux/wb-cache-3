In 1902, a committee of the West End Board of Trade announced their support for a subway line from the Battery to Coney Island via Atlantic or Hamilton Avenues in front of the Rapid Transit Commission. On April 10, 1905, a citizens' committee was created to aid the creation of the subway line.|$|E
25|$|The Frederick G. Gardiner Expressway, {{commonly}} known as the Gardiner Expressway or simply the Gardiner, is a municipal expressway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Running close to the shore of Lake Ontario, it extends from the foot of the Don Valley Parkway (DVP) in the east, just past the mouth of the Don River, to the junction of Highway 427 and the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) in the west. East of Dufferin Street, the roadway is elevated, <b>running</b> <b>above</b> Lake Shore Boulevard east of Bathurst Street.|$|E
25|$|Blue Line {{cars are}} unique among rapid transit {{vehicles}} in Boston, {{in that they}} use both third rail power and pantograph current pickup from overhead catenary wires. Trains switch between the two modes at Airport station, near where the line transitions between running in a tunnel and <b>running</b> <b>above</b> ground. Previously, the switchover was made underground at Maverick station. The overhead pantograph was implemented to avoid third rail icing that frequently occurs in winter. Third rail power {{is used in the}} original Blue Line tunnels, which are smaller than most modern subway tunnels.|$|E

25|$|A third {{line was}} planned. It {{was to use}} Canadian National Railway (CN) tracks passing under the Mount Royal to reach the {{northwest}} suburb of Cartierville from the city centre. Unlike the previous two lines, trains were to be partly <b>running</b> <b>above</b> ground. Negotiations with the CN and municipalities were stalling as Montreal was chosen in November 1962 to hold the 1967 Universal Exposition (Expo 67). Having to make a choice, the city decided that a number 4 line linking Montreal to the South Shore suburbs following a plan {{similar to those of}} the early century was more necessary.|$|E
25|$|West of {{the summit}} a broad ridge descends steeply to Worm Gill, a craggy bowl scooped out on the {{northern}} side above the tributary of Bleaberry Gill. Running due north between this corrie and Silver Cove is the ridge of Iron Crag, making the whole summit area resemble an inverted 'T' in plan. A narrow and steep sided col at 1,575ft provides Iron Crag with considerably more prominence than its parent, a small tarn lying on the northern slope. The rock face giving Iron Crag its name overlooks Silver Cove, but is not particularly prominent. From this top the ridge swings west again, the rough northern flanks <b>running</b> <b>above</b> the shore of Ennerdale Water. The main features here are Mart Knott, Stair Knott and Boat How. The ridge now meets {{the headwaters of the}} River Calder and divides to embrace the valley, Crag Fell to the north and Lank Rigg to the south.|$|E
25|$|The only {{waterway}} still <b>running</b> <b>above</b> {{ground is}} the man-made New River, constructed in 1619 to bring water into London from Hertfordshire. However, two natural rivers still flow through Harringay beneath the ground. These {{are just two}} of the many springs and streams that used to flow through this part of London from the high ground to the west, down into the River Lea. Stonebridge Brook ran above ground meandering eastwards just {{to the north of}} the old Harringay House. It crossed the estate, running roughly beneath present-day Effingham and Fairfax Roads, ran along Green Lanes for a short way and then eastwards north of St Ann's Road and on to the River Lea. Although still flowing underground today, the Harringay section was fully culverted by 1885. Hermitage Brook flowed roughly along the southern boundary of the western part of Harringay and then, staying close to its southern edge, under where the Arena Shopping Park stands today. It was eventually culverted and now flows underground just to the south of the shopping park.|$|E

The coat of arms of the (now abolished) Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council was Shrewsbury's shield {{with the addition of}} Atcham Bridge <b>running</b> <b>above</b> the loggerheads. Shrewsbury Town F.C. historically used the loggerheads, but from 1986 till 1992 had a Celtic shrew and from 2007 to 2015 had a badge depicting a lion rather than a loggerhead. A new loggerheads badge embedded in a circular shape returned for 2015-16 season. (A loggerhead, in heraldry, means a leopard's head – its naming derived from the carving of such faces on the ends of logs, including battering rams). The flag of Shropshire, and other county crests etc., also uses the three loggerheads.|$|E
500|$|The {{upper level}} of Route139 (also known as State Highway and Hoboken Avenue Viaduct) begins at an {{intersection}} with County Route501 (Kennedy Boulevard), which connects to Bayonne and Union City. The road {{heads to the}} southeast through urban residential and commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road, coming to an intersection with Collard Street. Just past this, the route becomes a four-lane divided road, which is separated by ventilation bays from the lower roadway, with the eastbound lanes <b>running</b> <b>above</b> the lower level of Route139. It continues between the Heights district {{to the north and}} the Journal Square district to the south. It crosses several streets, including County Route646 (St. Pauls Avenue), County Route617 (Summit Avenue), County Route663 (Central Avenue), and County Route644 (Oakland Street). The road meets Concord Street, where there is an eastbound left lane exit and a westbound intersection. [...] After the intersection with Palisade Avenue, the upper level of Route139 splits and merges with the lower level with a westbound ramp, which has a westbound entrance from the local Hoboken Avenue, and an eastbound ramp.|$|E
500|$|The area {{immediately}} inland {{includes the}} Gordano Valley, {{which has been}} designated as a national nature reserve. The valley runs roughly north-east to south-west, between Carboniferous limestone ridges extending along the coastline between Clevedon and Portishead, and another ridge extending between Clevedon and Easton in Gordano. The area includes the villages of Clapton in Gordano, Weston in Gordano, Easton in Gordano, Walton in Gordano, Portbury and Sheepway. [...] The M5 motorway runs along {{the south side of}} the valley, splitting briefly into two levels– the south-west-bound level <b>running</b> <b>above</b> the north-east-bound carriageway. [...] The Gordano motorway service station is at the eastern end of the valley, near the Royal Portbury Dock and the Avonmouth Bridge. [...] There is no river Gordano– much of the valley is reclaimed land barely above sea level, drained by ditches (known locally as [...] "rhynes"). The rhynes previously managed by the now amalgamated Gordano Valley Internal Drainage Board are now the responsibility of the North Somerset Internal Drainage Board. An area comprising a total of [...] has been designated as a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest, for ornithological, entomological and stratigraphic interest, notification originally having taken place in 1971. Several sites in the valley are managed by the Avon Wildlife Trust as nature reserves. These include Weston Big Wood, Clapton Moor, Weston Moor and Walton Common. The name Gordano comes from Old English and is descriptive of the triangular shape of the whole valley from Clevedon to Portishead, being the ablative singular of the Latinised form of Gorden meaning muddy valley.|$|E

500|$|Roebling first {{signed on}} as a {{surveyor}} for the Beaver River canal system, launching his career {{with a string of}} canal and railroad projects. [...] Aside from writing articles in engineering journals, Roebling designed his own wire cables and started his own company to manufacture them; the John A. Roebling Company was the first wire rope manufacturer in the United States. [...] Gradually gaining fame for his civil engineering, Roebling finally got to build suspension bridges. [...] His first bridge was the Allegheny Suspension Aqueduct in Pittsburgh. [...] The structure, completed in 1845, was the first suspension aqueduct {{in the world and the}} first large American suspension bridge that had multiple spans. [...] Furthermore, it was the first suspension structure built with modern cable spinning techniques—Roebling's own invention. [...] Earlier bridge building techniques involved fabricating the main cables at a factory, transporting them to the bridge site, and then stretching the heavy cables over the gap to erect them over the bridge. [...] Roebling, during his experiments with wire ropes, conceived and patented a new construction method for these main cables. [...] A long linethe traveler ropeformed a loop around two horizontal wheels, one on each side of the gorge. [...] A lightweight wheel, [...] "the traveling wheel", was attached to this line, and a wire threaded around this wheel. [...] Like a belt in a mechanical system, the traveler rope and its wheel moved across the gap as the horizontal wheels turned, pulling the wire along. [...] The traveling wheel effectively hauled two lengths of the same wire (<b>running</b> <b>above</b> and under the traveling wheel) across the gap at a time. [...] The lengths of wire were collected and bound at intervals to form thicker strands, which were later compressed together into the main cables. which supported themselves and later the proportional weight of the bridge as they were formed. [...] The method became the standard for suspension bridge construction, and remained unchanged for many years. [...] In the 20th century, suspension bridges were still built with this pulley winding system, albeit with more sophisticated equipment.|$|E

2500|$|The whole terrace has a timber-framed façade with brick nogging (infilling) {{and covered}} with black glazed {{mathematical}} tiles. These were laid in an interlocking pattern to mimic brick, and were frequently used in Brighton in the late 18th century. The glazing produced an iridescent effect which reflected sunlight in a visually pleasing way, and also coped better than bricks with sea-spray and other weathering effects. The houses were originally built with bow windows, but after critics argued that this spoilt the visual effect of the concave curve of the crescent, they were replaced (except at numbers 12 and 14) by canted bay windows with three sides.

6000|$|February 23.--I {{must not}} let the great {{hospital}} at the Patent-office pass away without some mention. A few weeks ago the vast area of the second story of that noblest of Washington buildings was crowded close with rows of sick, badly wounded and dying soldiers. They were placed in three very large apartments. I went there many times. It was a strange, solemn, and, with all its features of suffering and death, a sort of fascinating sight. I go sometimes at night to soothe and relieve particular cases. Two of the immense apartments are fill'd with high and ponderous glass cases, crowded with models in miniature of every kind of utensil, machine or invention, it ever enter'd {{into the mind of}} man to conceive; and with curiosities and foreign presents. Between these cases are lateral openings, perhaps eight feet wide and quite deep, and in these were placed the sick, besides a great long double row of them up and down through the middle of the hall. Many of them were very bad cases, wounds and amputations. Then there was a gallery <b>running</b> <b>above</b> the hall in which there were beds also. It was, indeed, a curious scene, especially at night when lit up. The glass cases, the beds, the forms lying there, the gallery above, and the marble pavement under foot--the suffering, and the fortitude to bear it in various degrees--occasionally, from some, the groan that could not be repress'd--sometimes a poor fellow dying, with emaciated face and glassy eye, the nurse by his side, the doctor also there, but no friend, no relative--such were the sights but lately in the Patent-office. (The wounded have since been removed from there, and it is now vacant again.) ...|$|E
