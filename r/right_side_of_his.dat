5|$|Evers {{suffered}} a stroke in August 1942, which paralyzed the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body. He remained bedridden or {{confined to a wheelchair}} for most of the next five years. Evers died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1947 at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany, and is buried in Saint Mary's Cemetery in Troy.|$|E
5|$|No tells Bond that he {{is working}} with the Russians and has built an {{elaborate}} underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from Cape Canaveral. He had previously been a member of a Chinese tong, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation. The tong's leaders had No's hands cut off as a warning to others, and then shot. Because No's heart was on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body, the bullet missed it and he survived.|$|E
5|$|The first Guardian video shows {{one officer}} lunge at Tomlinson from behind, strike {{him across the}} legs with a baton and push his back, causing him to fall. On 8 April Channel4 News {{released}} their own footage, which showed the officer's arm swing back to head height before bringing it down to hit Tomlinson on the legs with the baton. Another video obtained by The Guardian on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands in his pockets, when the police approach him. After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along the ground on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing a noise as his head hit the ground.|$|E
25|$|An {{autopsy report}} found {{that he had been}} hit on both the left and <b>right</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body. He had been wounded in the head, abdomen, upper-right {{shoulder}} and arm.|$|R
5000|$|Sheriff Dan Duck (aka Cousin Dan) {{is an old}} {{cousin of}} Donald {{who happens to be}} sheriff of a Western town called Bent Spur Gulch. Dan {{originally}} has thick, dark-grey eyebrows, a long, dark-grey mustache and long, dark-grey hair on the left and <b>right</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. He is generally shown holding a crutch. He appeared in two comic stories, [...] "Daredevil Deputy" [...] by Jack Bradbury, where he asks Donald to replace him while he recovers from [...] "a touch of rheumatism", and [...] "Trigger Gulch Gang" [...] by Tony Strobl, where he has only a brief appearance on the first page.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Mr. and Mrs. Clarence H. Matson, July 14, 1931. Mr. Matson {{can be seen}} at left seated on the arm of a wooden chair or small bench. He {{can be seen from the}} knees up wearing a suit, tie, and round glasses. The top <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head is completely bald, while hair can be seen on the left and <b>right</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. <b>His</b> <b>right</b> hand is positioned on top of the arm chair, while his left arm can be seen wrapped behind Mrs. Matson. Mrs. Matson can be seen seated on the right arm of the same chair. She can be seen wearing a floral-patterned dress, a watch on her left arm, a right on her left ring finger, a necklace with a large broach, and glasses. Her hair is wavy and short. Her left arm can be seen in her lap, while her right arm is visible on the small of Mr. Matson's back. What appears to be a purse or briefcase can be seen on the chair near Mr. Matson...|$|R
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{represents a}} man, estimated {{by some to}} be 45years of age, standing turned to the viewer's right, looking at the viewer with a commanding expression. In his uplifted right hand he holds a baton with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache and wears a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring. He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur collar and, over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set in rich pendants, hangs on his right shoulder. A full light from the left falls on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face. The background is brownish-grey.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising {{on the right side of}} Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—one on Friday, and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, {{while the second}} session lasted 45 minutes. The third and final session lasted 60 minutes. In the first practice session, Clint Bowyer was fastest, placing ahead of Biffle in second, and Johnson in third. Gordon was fourth fastest, and Edwards placed fifth. Kurt Busch, David Ragan, Jeff Burton, Keselowski and Kevin Harvick rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Max Papis damaged {{the right-hand side of}} his car when he hit the turn two wall; Jamie McMurray, David Reutimann and Mike Bliss also hit the turn two wall. Bliss went to a back-up car because the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car was heavily damaged. John Andretti's engine failed during the early phase of the session, and Andretti changed engines. Burton switched to a back-up car after he collided with the turn two outside wall.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{an injury}} {{early in the}} 2002–03 season, Beckham was unable to regain his place on the Manchester United team, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær having {{replaced}} him on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> midfield. <b>His</b> relationship with his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing room following an FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw ...|$|R
50|$|The {{painting}} contains numerous {{references to}} the works of Diego Velázquez (specifically The Surrender of Breda), a Spanish painter who had died 300 years earlier, and who influenced both Dalí's painting and his moustache. Dalí borrows the spears from that painting and places them on the <b>right</b> hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work. Within these spears, Dalí has painted {{the image of a}} crucified Christ, which was based on a drawing by the Spanish mystic, St. John.|$|R
5000|$|Kane {{originally}} {{had a pair}} of cybernetic arms which provided him with superhuman strength. After he was sent to Cable's 40th Century alternate future his bionics were modified so that he gained new cybernetic appendages, which included synthetic-organic liquid metal arms, hands, and shoulders. The left and <b>right</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> torso have also been replaced by synthetic-organic metal parts, although the middle section is still organic. Ordinarily the metal parts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body appear as flesh, but he can cause the metal to appear by willing a [...] "synthorg transfer." [...] Kane also has bionic legs and a bionic left eye. Kane's artificial hands are detachable and can be shot from his arms. He can also fire plasma from his metal arms. The arms can also produce large organic metal shields for protection. He can see in the infrared portion of the spectrum and project holograms from his eyes. His bionic parts contain a wide variety of devices, most of which have yet to be identified. He can generate electricity from his metal parts to shock an assailant. The bionic parts are self-repairing.|$|R
5|$|In March 1909, Riley was {{stricken}} {{a second}} time with Bell's palsy, and partial deafness, the symptoms only gradually eased {{over the course of}} the year. Riley was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion. On July 10, 1910 he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the news from the press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke, which served only to further depress him. With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue. By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began to recover his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. George Ade worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.|$|E
5|$|Sérurier {{was born}} at Laon on 8 December 1742, the son of Mathieu-Guillaume Sérurier. The family formed part of the minor provincial nobility, his father holding the title Seigneur de Sort and the job of mole-catcher to the king's {{breeding}} stud. After 1750 his father's title became Seigneur de Saint-Gobert. Sérurier got a good education and was of sober character. He received a commission as lieutenant in the Laon militia battalion on 25 March 1755, his uncle being the unit's commander. He transferred to the Soissons militia battalion on 12 June 1758. When he heard that the Laon battalion was called {{to serve in the}} Seven Years' War he switched back to his old unit on 30 November 1758. After sustaining a bayonet wound, he transferred into the Mazarin Infantry Regiment as a cadet on 1 October 1759. At the Battle of Warburg on 31 July 1760, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick surprised the French under Louis Nicolas Victor de Felix d'Ollieres, Count Du Muy. While defending a critical post, Sérurier was hit on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face by a bullet, which broke his jaw and left a lasting scar. The injury also cost him most of his teeth. He was promoted to second lieutenant on 25 April 1762.|$|E
25|$|He has a {{circular}} scar on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face, just above his lip. In {{the early days}} of his film career, Hung was involved in a street fight outside a Kowloon nightclub, and was stabbed with a broken cola bottle.|$|E
50|$|Duguid's {{status with}} the Colchester fans was {{demonstrated}} {{when he was}} voted the club's best ever player in a poll to mark the centenary of the Professional Footballers' Association. He made nearly 450 appearances for the U's in midfield or on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> defence in <b>his</b> first stint with the club.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} there was tense silence, then Thurid, with a roar of rage sprang for my throat; just as Xodar had upon {{the deck of the}} cruiser. The results were identical. I ducked beneath his outstretched arms, and as he lunged past me planted a terrific <b>right</b> on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jaw.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{was upon}} me, {{reaching}} for my throat, and precisely as I {{had done that}} day in the courtyard of the Temple of Issus I did here in the garden of the palace of Salensus Oll. I ducked beneath his outstretched arms, and as he lunged past me I planted a terrific <b>right</b> upon the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jaw.|$|R
25|$|In April 2011, Brown {{had surgery}} to remove a basal-cell {{carcinoma}} from the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nose. In December 2012, media outlets reported that Brown was being treated for early stage (the precise stage and grade was not stated) localized prostate cancer with a very good prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Fifteen {{years later}} Schneerson {{suffered}} a serious stroke while praying {{at the grave}} of his father-in-law. The stroke left him unable to speak and paralyzed on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body. During this time, the hope that Schneerson could be revealed as the Messiah (Moshiach) became more widespread.|$|E
25|$|Foye {{was born}} with a {{condition}} called situs inversus that caused him to be born with his organs reversed, meaning his heart is on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body and his liver is on the left. Foye has two daughters, Paige Christine Foye and Penny Carter Foye.|$|E
50|$|Many {{scholars}} {{believe the}} idea of the Black Taj belongs to fiction rather than history. The traces which are identified as the foundations of the 2nd Taj are actually the enclosing wall of a garden founded by Babur. The irregular position of Shah Jahan's cenotaph in comparison to Mumtaz Mahal's, is similar to that at the tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah, and thus should not be of any striking significance. Besides, according to Islamic law, bodies are buried with their faces towards Mecca and legs towards the south, and the husband is placed on the <b>right</b> hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife. The interpretation that the cenotaph of Shah Jahan was not meant to be placed here appears to be superfluous.|$|R
5000|$|Lynn {{sought out}} Li Ao, a {{critical}} author who was writing for Wenshing Magazine, and this began the crucial human <b>rights</b> and protest <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life. Li Ao introduced Lynn to Presbyterian and other ministers such as Milo Thornberry who were secretly collecting {{information on the}} abuses of the regime. Lynn met as well Hsieh Tsung-min and Peng Ming-min, who had issued a Taiwan statement of [...] "self-salvation" [...] in 1964, and gone to jail for it.|$|R
50|$|Clark was {{involved}} in the fatal crash of V8 Supercar driver Mark Porter at Mount Panorama Circuit. In an effort to avoid the stalled Porter, he slid his car sideways whilst travelling at high speed. The front <b>right</b> hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car hit the driver's <b>side</b> door <b>of</b> Porter's car, crushing the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the car. The front right hand of Porter's car also hit the drivers door of Clark, critically injuring him. Marshals were quick to arrive at the scene where one, unable to open the driver's door on Porter's car, opened the rear door in an attempt to check his condition. Both drivers were unconscious at the time. The race was called to an immediate stop and all racing was suspended for two hours while police combed for clues as to what happened.|$|R
25|$|In {{the fifth}} {{game of the}} 1948 season, Hirsch {{sustained}} a fracture on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> skull after being kicked in the head during {{a game against the}} Cleveland Browns. Hirsch did not return to action during the 1948 season, totaling 101 receiving yards and 93 rushing yards in five games.|$|E
25|$|The autopsy {{revealed}} {{a number of}} fragment wounds on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. He also had many fragment wounds {{on the front of}} his right shoulder and upper chest; two major fragments had gone straight through his chest. He had a lacerated lung and much internal bleeding. The autopsy also showed that he {{had been shot in the}} head at close range, most likely after he was already dead.|$|E
25|$|The right-front {{wheel and}} {{suspension}} {{are believed to}} have been sent back into the cockpit, striking Senna on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> helmet, forcing his head back against the headrest. In addition, a piece of the upright assembly, most likely a tie rod, penetrated the helmet visor, which was a new, thinner version, above his right eye. Senna sustained fatal skull fractures, brain injuries and a ruptured temporal artery.|$|E
50|$|Tomax and Xamot - Twin {{brothers}} who lead the Crimson Guard, {{and are the}} respectable corporate face of Cobra. When not engaged in dangerous field missions, Tomax and Xamot {{are said to be}} found wearing suits and ties, managing Cobra's business affairs. The brothers share an empathic connection. While this is often useful, as it allows them to communicate wordlessly and finish each other's sentences, it is also a liability, as they feel each other's pain during fights. Tomax and Xamot are mirror images of each other, except for Xamot having a scar on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> (cartoon) <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face, portrayed on the left side in the 1985 action figure. The twins run a corporation named Extensive Enterprises and are known more for their skills in the boardroom rather than on the battlefield.|$|R
5000|$|With a right oblique strain, the Cardinals placed Adams on the 15-day {{disabled}} list on April 26, retroactive to April 22. [...] As the season progressed, teams {{began to notice}} his pull-hitting tendencies and often employed an extreme infield shift on him that left one or no fielders on the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the second base bag. He also had difficulty hitting off-speed pitches from left-handed pitchers. Because he often grounded out to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the bag, <b>his</b> batting average began to precipitously decline. In June, he batted just [...]179 and [...]205 in August.|$|R
50|$|This rock cut Jain {{temple was}} built by Western Ganga King Rajamalla II during the end of 9th century. This temple is seen in a hillock named Vijayadri (as per {{inscription}} of Rajamalla II) located northern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Thun Andar Shiva temple. Inside the rock cut, recently a new Mahaveerar statue is kept and worshipped by nearby Tamil Jains. On {{the top of the}} rock facing east, relief sculptures of Mahaveerar, Parshavanthar and Bahubali are seen.On the either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Bahubali, <b>his</b> sisters Brahmi and Saundari are seen.

25|$|Identification of the Romanovs {{was made}} {{based on the}} {{clothing}} worn and by papers found in their pockets. The White Army investigators had no medical or dental records, and eleven weeks in the mine had substantially altered the victim's physical appearance. The autopsy revealed that Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich had a bruise {{on the left side}} of his head, but his death had been caused by a gunshot wound to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|E
25|$|On January 26, 2006, West Virginia Hospitals {{announced}} that McCloy had been transferred from Ruby Memorial to its HealthSouth Mountainview Regional Rehabilitation Hospital in Morgantown, and {{was under the}} care of a rehabilitation specialist.

Rose removed the three bullets that had entered Tippit's chest and head, noting that there was massive hemorrhaging {{as a result of}} penetration of the lung and liver, as well as a large amount of damage to his brain.|$|E
500|$|On January 27, 1967, Grissom, White and Chaffee were {{participating}} in a [...] "plugs-out" [...] countdown demonstration test at Cape Kennedy {{in preparation for the}} planned February 21 launch. Chaffee was sitting at the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the cabin. <b>His</b> main role was to maintain communications with the blockhouse. A momentary power surge was detected at 23:30:55 GMT, which was believed to accompany an electrical short in equipment located on the lower left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the cabin, the presumed ignition source for the fire. At 23:31:04 GMT, a voice was heard declaring, [...] "'ve got a fire in the cockpit." [...] Most investigative listeners believe that voice was Chaffee's.|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} deep red puckers in it, one {{just below the}} collar bone, and the other about half-way down on the <b>right</b> <b>side.</b> The skin <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body was {{extremely}} white up to the brown line <b>of</b> <b>his</b> neck, and the angry crinkled spots looked the more vivid against it. From above I could see {{that there was a}} corresponding pucker in the back at one place, but not at the other. Inexperienced as I was, I could tell what that meant. Two bullets had pierced his chest; one had passed through it, and the other had remained inside.|$|R
