40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} the in situ modulation of potassium channels in a semi-intact {{preparation of the}} Drosophila retina. In whole-cell recordings of photoreceptors, rapidly inactivating Shaker channels are characterized by a conspicuously negative voltage operating range; together with a delayed rectifier, these channels are specifically modulated by the putative efferent neurotransmitter serotonin. Contrary to most potassium channel modulations, serotonin induced a <b>reversible</b> <b>positive</b> shift in the voltage operating range, of + 30 mV for the Shaker channels and + 10 – 14 mV for the delayed rectifier. The maximal current amplitudes were unaffected. Modulation was not affected by the subunit-specific Shaker mutations fShE 62 and T(1;Y) W 32 or a null mutation of the putative modulatory subunit eag. The modulation of both channels was mimicked by intracellularly applied GTPγS...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{complete}} bipartite matching problem {{with the objective of}} finding an optimal matching that maximizes a certain generic predefined utility function on the set of all matchings. After proving the NP-hardness of the problem using reduction from the 3 -SAT problem, we propose a randomized algorithm based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique for solving this. We sample from Gibb's distribution and construct a <b>reversible</b> <b>positive</b> recurrent discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) that has the steady state distribution same as the Gibb's distribution. In one of our key contributions, we show that the constructed chain is `rapid mixing', i. e., the convergence time to reach within a specified distance to the desired distribution is polynomial in the problem size. The rapid mixing property is established by obtaining a lower bound on the conductance of the DTMC graph and this result is of independent interest...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the property of}} pre-expansivity for cellular automata (CA) : it is the property of being expansive on asymptotic pairs of configurations (i. e. configurations that differ in only finitely many positions). Pre-expansivity therefore lies between expansivity and pre-injectivity, two important notions of CA theory. We show that there exist one-dimensional positively pre-expansive CAs which are not positively expansive {{and they can be}} chosen <b>reversible</b> (while <b>positive</b> expansivity is impossible for reversible CAs). We show however that no bi-dimensional CA which is linear over an Abelian group can be pre-expansive. We also consider the finer notion of k-expansivity (expansivity over pairs of configurations with exactly k differences) and show examples of linear CA in dimension 2 and on the free group that are k-expansive depending on the value of k, whereas no (positively) expansive CA exists in this setting...|$|R

We observe systematic broadening of glass transition temperature (Tg) as the thickness of the polymer film reduces below the radius of gyration but the change in the average Tg was found to be very small. Existence of <b>reversible</b> negative and <b>positive</b> thermal expansion below and above Tg increased the sensitivity of our thickness measurements performed using energy dispersive x-ray reflectivity. A simple model of Tg variation as a function of depth expected from sliding motion could explain the results.

40|$|Glycoalkaloids, the biologically active {{secondary}} metabolites {{produced by}} Solanaceae plants, are natural defenses against animals, insects and fungi. In this paper, {{the effects of}} glycoalkaloids present in extracts of Solanaceae plants (potato, tomato and black nightshade) or pure commercial glycoalkaloids on the coleopteran Zophobas atratus F. were evaluated by in vitro and in vivo bioassays using heart experimental models. Each tested extract induced a dose-dependent cardioinhibitory effect. The perfusion of Zophobas atratus semi-isolated heart using the highest potato and tomato extract concentration (1 mmol/L) caused irreversible cardiac arrests, while extract from black nightshade produced fast but reversible arrests. Pure commercial glycoalkaloids caused similar but less evident effects compared with extracts. Our {{results showed that the}} bioactivity of tested compounds depended on their structure and suggested the existence of synergistic interactions when combinations of the main glycoalkaloids of potato and black nightshade were used for trials. Surprisingly, injection of tomato and potato extracts in 1 -day old pupae of Zophobas atratus induced <b>reversible</b> <b>positive</b> chronotropic effects and decreased the duration of the both phases (anterograde and retrograde) of the heart contractile activity. Furthermore, these extracts affected the amplitude of the heart contractions...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper {{it has been}} shown that the nonpolar-polar anionic detergents can be divided into two main groups. One chemically characterized by a relatively long chain of non-polar alkyl groups, which in solution are in contact with one end of a muscle and, locally adhering to it, produce a permanent negative injury potential. This is generally accompanied by a loss of excitability. The second group, distinguished by a relatively short chain of non-polar alkyl groups acts reversibly, ordinarily preserves the excitability and, in contrast to the first group, produces locally a reverse positive potential. For reasons mentioned before, this appears likely to correspond to an increased activity. These concepts have been tested in this second paper. The measurements of the resting potentials of muscles have been supplemented by measurements on frog sciatics with the result that there are brought about, again by the detergents with long alkyl chains, regular irreversible negative resting potentials and with the short chain compounds <b>reversible</b> <b>positive</b> potentials are aroused. Furthermore, in addition there appeared the hardly expected result that muscle stimulated in the presence of short chain detergents responded with an even higher contraction. We have endeavored to explain this on the basis of general considerations concerning the physical chemistry of the excitatory process. More direct evidence of this rise of excitability under the influence of the short chain non-polar-polar detergents will be presented in the next papers on studies concerning chronaximetric measurements on nerve, referring particularly to the semidetergents, and concerning the effects of detergents in general upon the heart beat of a clam...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} that two principlal bacterial communities expressing {{different levels of}} heterotrophic activity might coexist in an estuarine ecosystem (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal) and could quickly respond to tidal fluctuations of environmental factors was experimentally tested in diffusion chambers by swapping the dissolved components of the natural water between the two communities and comparing their reactivity against the unaltered controls. The results for ectoenzymatic activity (Leuaminopeptidase and β-glucosidase), glucose incorporation and biomass production after transference of the marine bacterial community to brackish water showed maxima {{in the range of}} 241 – 384 % of the control values. The opposite transference of the brackish-water bacterial community to marine water produced maximal decreases to 0. 14 – 0. 58 % of the control values. In a reverse experiment, designed as the return to the initial conditions after 2 hours of the first exposure, the marine community rapidly re-acquired the characteristic low profile of activity. Contrastingly, the negative effects of 2 hours of exposure to marine water on the activity of the brackish water bacteria persisted, at least for 4 hours, after return to their own water. The apparent short-term irreversibility of the decline in activity of the brackish water bacteria when exposed to marine water, in parallel with the quick and <b>reversible</b> <b>positive</b> response of the marine water bacteria to the brackish water, suggests the development of two distinct bacterioplankton communities adapted to the environmental conditions prevailing at distinct sections of the estuary. The reactivity to environmental changes demonstrated by the two communities allows the prediction of estuarine profiles of bacterial activity steeper than those expected from the conservative transport of bacterial cells associated with tidal currents...|$|E
40|$|The {{reversible}} electrical variations hitherto {{described for}} {{plants and animals}} consist in a <b>reversible</b> loss of <b>positive</b> potential at a stimulated spot by which it becomes more negative. In this paper we describe changes which consist in a reversible loss of negative potential at a stimulated spot whereby it becomes more positive. We suggest that this be called a positive variation. The stimulation was produced in all cases by pinching or bending the cell. This produced a compression wave which traveled along the cell, producing a negative variation at a spot which was positive and a positive variation at a spot which was negative (due to application of 0. 1 M KCl). The response produced by the compression wave differs in several respects from an ordinary propagated negative variation and may be termed a positive mechanical variation...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{macroeconomic}} {{history of}} emerging market economies is coloured with economic crises of all kinds, ranging from debt-crises, through hyperinflationary periods to currency crises to name but a few. Much of the empirical literature notes that alongside fast-paced structural change this {{has resulted in}} volatile business cycles and a difficult environment for stabilisation policy. Both short- and long-run output dynamics are shaped by the multidimensional exposure of EMEs to economic shocks. The paper uses an SVAR analysis and finds {{that in spite of}} high degrees of output volatility, the conduct of stabilisation policy has sometimes been successful in dampening short-run output fluctuations. However, even when stabilisation has been successful, the effect on overall output volatility has been negligible when compared to supply-side shocks. The results show that economic crises are associated with large negative supply shocks which are only counteracted by stabilisation policy to a very small extent. These crisis-related supply shocks, in turn, have large negative effects on potential GDP growth, which are only <b>reversible</b> when <b>positive</b> supply shocks regain lost ground. Given the institutional origin of the economic crises, the paper suggests that for stabilisation policy to become more effective in lowering output volatility and maintaining long-term growth potential, it must be supported by appropriate supply-side measures which insulate EMEs against large negative supply shocks and help them to recover in the wake of economic crises.

Gene reporters for bioluminescence, fluorescence, radionuclide, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been described but these suffer variously from limited depth penetration, spatial resolution, and sensitivity. We describe here a gene reporter, based on the organic anion transporting protein Oatp 1 a 1, which mediates uptake of a clinically approved, Gd(3 +) -based, hepatotrophic contrast agent (gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid). Cells expressing the reporter showed readily <b>reversible,</b> intense, and <b>positive</b> contrast (up to 7. 8 -fold signal enhancement) in T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance images acquired in vivo.

40|$|SummaryThe insulin {{receptor}}-related receptor (IRR), {{an orphan}} {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} of the insulin receptor family, can be activated by alkaline media both in vitro and in vivo at pH > 7. 9. The alkali-sensing property of IRR is conserved in frog, mouse, and human. IRR activation is specific, dose-dependent and quickly <b>reversible</b> and demonstrates <b>positive</b> cooperativity. It also triggers receptor conformational changes and elicits intracellular signaling. The pH sensitivity of IRR is primarily defined by its L 1 F extracellular domains. IRR is predominantly expressed in organs that {{come in contact with}} mildly alkaline media. In particular, IRR is expressed in the cell subsets of the kidney that secrete bicarbonate into urine. Disruption of IRR in mice impairs the renal response to alkali loading attested by development of metabolic alkalosis and decreased urinary bicarbonate excretion in response to this challenge. We therefore postulate that IRR is an alkali sensor that functions in the kidney to manage metabolic bicarbonate excess...|$|R
40|$|The main {{application}} of SPECT-CT in Nuclear Cardiology is for attenuation correction AC. The nonuniform attenuation, scatter and distance-dependant resolution are confounding factors inherent in SPECT imaging. The specific effects on myocardial images, due to subdiaphragmatic, {{or to the}} breast tissue attenuation present as irreversible or <b>reversible</b> false <b>positive</b> defects - artifacts. They can decrease the specificity of the examinations and increase the inconclusive interpretations. SPECT-CT permits fast creation of attenuation maps (within seconds). The AC improves the diagnostic accuracy, the normalcy rate in patients with low probability of coronary artery disease (CAD), the viability detection and the detection of stenoses in multiple vascular distributions. In order to avoid AC generated artifacts an adequate quality control is mandatory: of body truncation, of patient’s motion, of accurate registration of attenuation maps and emission data. Incorrect fusion of SPECT and CT images can cause serious mistakes. The reduction of equivocal interpretations offers additional benefit {{in the use of}} stress-only imaging for patients with low pretest likelihood of CAD, or rest-only imaging in patients with acute chest pain. The review of low-dose CT scan adds important unexpected findings of concomitant extracardiac pathology (e. g. pleural and pericardial effusions, mediastinal masses and pulmonary lesions). Recent equipment development made it possible to introduce, in clinical practice, hybrid SPECT/CT cameras that perform not only CT AC but which also acquire high quality CT-images for the purpose of coronary calcium scoring and CT coronary angiograms.

40|$|Several organic soluble N-based ligands {{and their}} copper {{complexes}} were firstly investigated as catalysts to depolymerise organosolv lignin in the organic solvent, dimethylformamide (DMF) and an ionic liquid (1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium xylenesulfonate, [emim][ABS]). The results of screening depolymerisation reactions in DMF and [emim][ABS] showed {{that all the}} copper–amine complexes catalysed lignin depolymerisation more efficiently in ionic liquids than in DMF. Among the seven types of ligands, copper complexes with two types of ligands (E) -N-(pyridin- 2 -ylmethylene) aniline and (E) - 4 -methoxy-N-(pyridin- 2 -ylmethylene) aniline depolymerised the lignin more efficiently than the others. These two copper complexes with the N-based ligand were further studied to determine the most efficient conditions for the depolymerisation of the lignin. The most effective depolymerisation by conditions involved treatment at 180 °C for 12 h in [emim][ABS]. Cyclic voltammetric {{studies were carried out}} to investigate the reversible potential associated with the copper centers of their complexes with these N-based ligands.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the effect of sodium chloride (NaCl) or calcium chloride (CaCl₂) on the formation and stability of n-dodecane/non-ionic surfactant/aqueous nanoemulsions produced by the Phase Inversion Temperature (PIT) method. It is because there are only few works done to investigate the effect of electrolyte on the production of nanoemulsions, especially those produced by the PIT method. Furthermore, in this research, the ability for ageing nanoemulsions to reverse their physical properties to freshly-prepared state has also been investigated [...] The nanoemulsions were produced by heating aqueous-continuous emulsions (O/W) to oil-continuous (W/O) emulsions, followed by a quenching process to produce O/W nanoemulsions. Pure milliQ water and concentration from 0. 001 M to 0. 1 M NaCl or CaCl₂ were used as continuous phase. The non-ionic surfactants used were polyoxyethylene (4) lauryl ether (Brij 30) and sorbitan monooleate (S 80). The stability was determined by dynamic light scattering technique by measuring the growth of the droplet size and size distribution (PdI) before the nanoemulsions were phase separated, which was determined by visual observation. The reversibility testing was done by measuring the droplet size and PdI as a function of temperatures for a three-day ageing nanoemulsion system. Droplet size as small as 65 nm was produced from a brine system while there was 77 nm in a pure milliQ water system, with PdI lower than 0. 2. The PIT temperature was found to be depressed when: (1) oil or surfactant concentration increased; (2) HLB number of surfactant system decreased; and (3) NaCl or CaCl₂ was added. The transitional temperature (∆Ttrans[trans in subscript]), a temperature difference between the temperature for producing O/W and W/O emulsions, has linked with the stability of the nanoemulsions. The largest ∆Ttrans [trans in subscript] in a emulsion system with low oil concentration (R= 0. 2) appeared at 7 wt% Brij 30 at pure milliQ water system but at 6 wt% Brij 30 at NaCl system, showing that the surfactant concentration used to produce the most stable nanoemulsions was reduced by the aid of compression effect from NaCl. When the oil concentration increased, more NaCl was needed to produce stable nanoemulsions. Nanoemulsions produced by a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic non-ionic surfactant was extremely unstable, with a big difference in PIT temperature and ∆Ttrans [trans in subscript]compared to a pure surfactant system. It was found that NaCl was a better electrolyte than CaCl₂ to produce nanoemulsions with smaller droplet sizes and PdI and higher stability. For the most stable nanoemulsions, 20 °C was better than 10 °C, to keep the sample from phase separation for more than 30 days. Additionally, the addition of CaCl₂ was found to have no difference in the production of nanoemulsions by adding it either before or after the emulsification process. It has been found that only system with NaCl appeared {{to have the ability to}} revert the droplet size and PdI, from ageing to freshly-prepared nanoemulsions. Furthermore, the reversibility ability was governed by phase inversion process as only system experiencing heating process could be reverted. However, nanoemulsions with high stability were partially reversible, where only droplet size was <b>reversible.</b> The <b>positive</b> effects (increasing stability, smaller droplet size and PdI, and reversibility ability) from the addition of NaCl could only be achieved at certain electrolyte and surfactant concentrations.
