It has received several different names, according to the country where it was adopted: mass radiography, miniature chest radiograph (United Kingdom and United States), roentgenfluorography (Germany), <b>radiophotography</b> (France), schermografia (Italy), photoradioscopy (Spain) and photofluorography (Sweden).|$|E
50|$|Abreugraphy was {{not used}} in other {{countries}} so intensively as in Brazil {{and a few other}} Latin America countries. It received several different names, according to the country where it was adopted: mass radiography, miniature chest radiograph (United Kingdom and United States), roentgenfluorography (Germany), <b>radiophotography</b> (France), schermografia (Italy), photoradioscopy (Spain) and photofluorography (Sweden). The importance of abreugraphy was outlined by the creation of the Brazilian Society of Abreugraphy, in 1957, and the publication of the Revista Brasileira de Abreugrafia.|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis is an {{infectious}} disease {{which more than}} 8 million people are taken ill with throughout the world every year. During the last decade more than 30 million people succumbed to it. The Czech Republic succeeds in decreasing the number of TB cases, despite of it the physicians warn how dangerous is still this infectious disease. Basic diagnostic examination in pulmonary TB is an X-ray examination. <b>Radiophotography,</b> so called štítovka" enacted remarkable part in combating TB. This apparatus was used in past for collective X-ray examination. The disadvantage of this technique is substantionally higher radiation load. In my work I dealt mostly with contemporary possibilities of radiodiagnostics in pulmonary TB examination (with regard to <b>radiophotography).</b> I carried out measurement of entering surface kerma {{with the help of}} water phantom in different work places, with different types of machines. In my thesis I compared examination techniques, both from the point of diagnostic yield, and from the point of patients´ radiation load. X-ray diagnostics participates in big rate in medical irradiation, which is the most important part in human irradiation from artificial radiation sources. Implementation of new diagnostic methods (especially computer tomography) resulted in important expansion of diagnostic possibilities. On the other hand, historical equipment still functions, e. g. cabin machines for imaging from the photographic plate. The most important factors affecting radiation load of patients is modern machine equipment, regular running of tests of long-term stableness and working steadiness, as well as protective aids use. In every work place with sources of ionizing radiation a permanent supervision on respecting of radiation protection rules must be ensured...|$|E
