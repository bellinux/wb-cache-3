25|$|During {{this time}} period, women's {{clothing}} was much thinner {{than in the}} eighteenth century so warmer outerwear became important in fashion, especially in colder climates. Coat-like garments such as pelisses and redingotes were popular, as were shawls, mantles, mantelets, capes and cloaks. The mantelet was a short cape that was eventually lengthened and made into a shawl. The <b>redingote,</b> another popular example, was a full-length garment resembling a man's riding coat (hence the name) in style, that could be made of different fabrics and patterns. Throughout the period, the Indian shawl was the favoured wrap, as houses and the typical English country house were generally draughty, and the sheer muslin and light silk dresses popular during this time provided less protection. Shawls were made of soft cashmere or silk or even muslin for summer. Paisley patterns were extremely popular at the time.|$|E

2500|$|In men's fashion, {{the long}} <b>redingote</b> {{of the era}} of Louis-Philippe (the name came from the English term [...] "riding-coat") was {{gradually}} replaced by the jacquette, and then the even shorter veston. [...] The shorter jacket allowed a man to put {{his hands into his}} pockets. [...] The trousers were wide at the waist, and very narrow at the cuffs. Men wore a neutral-colored vest, usually cut low to show off highly decorated shirts with frills and buttons of paste jewellery. [...] Men had gloves, but carried them in their hands, according to Gaston Jolivet, a prominent fashion observer of the time, in order [...] "to prove to the population that they had the means to buy a pair of gloves without using them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Women's fashion {{during the}} Empire {{was set to}} a large degree by the Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais and her {{favorite}} designer, Hippolyte Leroy, who was inspired by the Roman statues of the Louvre and the frescoes of Pompeii. Fashions were also guided by a new magazine, the Journal des Dames et des Modes, with illustrations by the leading artists of the day. The antique Roman style, introduced during the Revolution, continued to be popular but was modified because Napoleon disliked immodesty in women's clothing; low necklines and bare arms were banned. The waist of the Empire gowns was very high, almost under the arms, with a long pleated skirt down to the feet. Corsets were abandoned, and the preferred fabric was mousseline. The main fashion accessory for women was the shawl, inspired by the Orient, made of cashmere or silk, covering the arms and shoulders. Napoleon's military campaigns also influenced fashion; after the Egyptian campaign, women began to wear turbans; after the Spanish campaign, tunics with high shoulders; and after the campaigns in Prussia and Poland, Polish furs and a long coat called a pelisse. They also wore jackets inspired by military uniforms, with epaulettes. In cold weather women wore a <b>redingote,</b> from the English word [...] "riding coat", borrowed from men's fashion, or, after 1808, a witchoura, a fur coat with a hood.|$|E
2500|$|Frock coats (in French <b>redingotes)</b> {{increasingly}} replaced tail coats for informal day wear. [...] They were calf length, {{and might}} be double-breasted. Shoulder emphasis fell lower on the arm; shoulders were sloped and puffed sleeve heads gradually shrank and then disappeared. Waistcoats or vests were single- or double-breasted, with rolled shawl or (later) notched collars, and extremely tight through the waist. Waistcoats were sometimes worn two at time, in contrasting colors. Corsets or corset-like garments were worn by many men to draw in the waistline. [...] The most fashionable coats had padded shoulders and chests, a feature that disappeared after about 1837.|$|R

Her sports suits were uniquely cut in soft colored tweeds and were worn with dark crape shirts. The short sleeves on these shirts were also widened. Borea's day clothes featured {{a number of}} shades of gray-green. These were accentuated with buttons and scarves of yellow or guardsman's red. Bishop violet was a prominent color of Borea's evening wear designs. A nubby woolen, woven with bear's hair, was featured in the designer's sports wear. Her wool daytime frocks had velvet belts and trimmings. Highlights included pine-cone rosettes, which replaced sports buttons. Pheasant feathers were exhibited as trimming.|$|R

5000|$|The usage {{began to}} be more {{official}} during the Third Republic (1870-1940). The Hôtel de Ville in Paris (city hall) displayed a statue of [...] "Marianne" [...] wearing a Phrygian cap in 1880, and was quickly followed by the other French cities. In Paris, where the Radicals had a strong presence, a contest was launched for the statue of Place de la République. It was won by the Morice brothers (with Léopold Morice producing the sculpture and the architect François-Charles Morice designing the pedestal), in 1879, with an academical Marianne, with an arm lifted towards the sky and a Phrygian cap, but with her breasts covered. Aimé-Jules Dalou lost the contest against the Morice brothers, but the City of Paris decided to build his monument on the Place de la Nation, inaugurated for the centenary of the French Revolution, in 1889, with a plaster version covered in bronze. Dalou's Marianne had the lictor's fasces, the Phrygian cap, a bare breast, and {{was accompanied by a}} Blacksmith representing Work, and allegories of Freedom, Justice, Education and Peace: all that the Republic was supposed to bring to its citizens. The final bronze monument was inaugurated in 1899, in the turmoil of the Dreyfus Affair, with Waldeck-Rousseau, a Radical, in power. The ceremony was accompanied by a huge demonstration of workers, with red flags. The government's officials, wearing black <b>redingotes,</b> quit the ceremony. Marianne had been reappropriated by the workers, but as the representative of the Social and Democratic Republic (la République démocratique et sociale, or simply La Sociale).|$|R

6000|$|And at Lyons {{there was}} not militiaman, a royalist, {{volunteer}} or a pariah out of the streets {{who was willing to}} fire that first and [...] "single shot": and though Marshal Macdonald swore ultimately that he would do it himself, his determination failed him at the last when surrounded by his wavering troops he found himself {{face to face with the}} conqueror of Austerlitz and Jena and Rivoli and a thousand other glorious fights, with the man in the grey <b>redingote</b> who had created him Marshal of France and Duke of Tarente on the battlefields of Lombardy, his comrade-in-arms who had shared his own scanty army rations with him, slept beside him round the bivouac fires, and round whom now there rose a cry from end to end of Lyons: [...] "Vive l'Empereur!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted a}} hand {{that was not}} too steady to his brow and scanned the road leading to the fort. Even as he spoke four figures emerged from the woods,--undoubtedly the gentlemen who had held the council at the inn that afternoon.

He wore a long, double-breasted, claret-colored <b>redingote</b> that fitted his slim figure to perfection, and his gait was the easy gait {{of a man who}} goes through the world careless of its pitfalls. So intently did I stare that I gave no thought to those who followed him.

60|$|On Tuesday, {{eleventh}} of December, the King's Trial has emerged, very decidedly: {{into the}} streets of Paris; {{in the shape of}} that green Carriage of Mayor Chambon, within which sits the King himself, with attendants, {{on his way to the}} Convention Hall! Attended, in that green Carriage, by Mayors Chambon, Procureurs Chaumette; and outside of it by Commandants Santerre, with cannon, cavalry and double row of infantry; all Sections under arms, strong Patrols scouring all streets; so fares he, slowly through the dull drizzling weather: and about two o'clock we behold him, 'in walnut-coloured great-coat, <b>redingote</b> noisette,' descending through the Place Vendome, towards that Salle de Manege; to be indicted, and judicially interrogated. The mysterious Temple Circuit has given up its secret; which now, in this walnut-coloured coat, men behold with eyes. The same bodily Louis who was once Louis the Desired, fares there: hapless King, he is getting now towards port; his deplorable farings and voyagings draw to a close. What duty remains to him henceforth, that of placidly enduring, he is fit to do.|$|E
60|$|The sight brought Caron to {{a sudden}} halt, and he sat his horse observing them and {{wondering}} how it chanced that these men should find themselves {{so far from the}} army. Three of them showed signs of having been recently wounded. One carried his arm in a sling, another limped painfully and by the aid of a stick, whilst the head of the third was swathed in bandages. But most remarkable were they by virtue of their clothes. One fellow--he of the bandaged head--wore a coat of yellow brocaded silk, which, in spite of a rent in the shoulder, and sundry stains of wine and oil, was unmistakably of a comparative newness. Beneath this appeared the nankeens and black leggings of a soldier. Another covered his greasy locks with a three-cornered hat, richly laced in gold. A third flaunted under his ragged blue coat a gold-broidered waistcoat and a Brussels cravat. A valuable ring flashed from the grimy finger of a fourth, who, instead of the military white nankeens, wore a pair of black silk breeches. There was one--he of the injured arm--resplendent in a <b>redingote</b> of crimson velvet, whilst he of the limp supported himself upon a gold-headed cane of ebony, which was in ludicrous discord with the tattered blue coat, the phrygian cap, and the toes that peeped through his broken boots.|$|E
6000|$|After {{an early}} dinner, Paul {{found his way}} to the little theatre. He had already been struck by a highly colored poster near the Bahnhof, {{purporting}} that a distinguished German company would give a representation of [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin," [...] and certain peculiarities in the pictorial advertisement of the tableaux gave promise of some entertainment. He found the theatre fairly full; there was the usual contingent of abonnirte officers, a fair sprinkling of English and German travelers, but apparently none of his own countrymen. He had no time to examine the house more closely, for the play, commencing with simple punctuality, not only far exceeded the promise of the posters, but of any previous performance of the play he had witnessed. Transported at once to a gorgeous tropical region--the slave States of America--resplendent with the fruits and palms of Mauritius, and peopled exclusively with Paul and Virginia's companions in striped cotton, Hathaway managed to keep a composed face, until the arrival of the good Southern planter St. Clair as one of the earlier portraits of Goethe, in top boots, light kerseymere breeches, <b>redingote</b> and loose Byron collar, compelled him to shrink into the upper corner of the box with his handkerchief to his face. Luckily, the action passed as the natural effect upon a highly sympathetic nature of religious interviews between a round-faced flaxen-haired [...] "Kleine Eva" [...] and [...] "Onkeel Tome," [...] occasionally assisted by a Dissenting clergyman in Geneva bands; of excessive brutality with a cattle whip by a Zamiel-like Legree; of the sufferings of a runaway negro Zimmermadchen with a child three shades lighter than herself; and of a painted canvas [...] "man-hunt," [...] where apparently four well known German composers on horseback, with flowing hair, top boots, and a Cor de chasse, were pursuing, {{with the aid of a}} pack of fox hounds, [...] "the much too deeply abused and yet spiritually elevated Onkeel Tome." [...] Paul did not wait for the final apotheosis of [...] "der Kleine Eva," [...] but, in the silence of a hushed audience, made his way into the corridor and down the staircase. He was passing an open door marked [...] "Direction," [...] when his attention was sharply attracted by a small gathering around it and the sounds of indignant declamation. It was the voice of a countryman--more than that, it was a familiar voice, that he had not heard for three years--the voice of Colonel Harry Pendleton! ...|$|E
