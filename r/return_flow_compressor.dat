The current investigation deals with a numerical based analysis {{for the effects of}} aspect ratio for single stage subsonic axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> through CFD analysis using commercial code AxStream. The investigation aims to identify the effect of varying aspect ratio for single stage axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> with fixed aspect ratio through the stage and change the AR for IGV and stator blade while AR for rotor blade are same. First the analysis has been carried out for the single stage axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> having an AR 2 through the stage (IGV, Rotor &stator) and then rotor blade AR 2 kept constant and change the AR 3 for stator blade and IGV. The study has predicted for estimating the performance characteristics, such as power, pressure rise and diffusion factor of the compressor stage is presented.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the design}} for the mixed <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> {{is based on the}} results of a S 2 through flow {{aerodynamic}} design program and a general arbitrary curved blade design method for axial, centrifugal/mixed compressors. Three different mixed <b>flow</b> <b>compressors</b> with different circulation distributions were studied. The results show that different circulation distributions should be utilized from blade hub to tip. For blade hub, more loading in posterior area should be chosen, while for blade tip more loading in frontal area of the blade is available. With this loading distribution, the separation flow in blade hub is controlled,along with the reduction of separation flow in blade tip. The performance of the mixed <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> can be boosted with a more homogeneous distribution of aerodynamic parameters from blade hub to tip, a more homogeneous flow field and a higher pressure recovery coefficient...|$|R

In design of Axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> the work presented comprises of basic flow parameters and dimensions of parts, this makes the further design process quite simple and the results will be helpful to take further changes or improvement at the time of detailed design. The objective of work presented is to design Axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> by using mean line method for a given mass flow rate and required pressure ratio. The parameters determined also include thermodynamic properties of the working fluid, stage efficiency, number of rotor and stator blades, tip and hub diameters, blade dimensions (chord, length and space) for both rotor and stator, Mach number, flow and blade angles (blade twist). The same parameters are also determined for all five stages. The twist of the blades can be calculated along the blade length at any required number of sections selected by the designers to obtain smooth blade twist profile. NACA 65410 profiles is used to generate coordinates of the blade. Further, in the process the first stage of axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> blade is developed using Solid works modeling.

40|$|LecturePg. 77 - 92 Operating and {{maintaining}} key rotating equipment in a petrochemical service and tight economic constraints requires an indepth evaluation in performance deterioration of key gas turbines and axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> parameters. By upgrading the required instrumentation on a gas turbine and an axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor,</b> and indepth performance simulation and evaluation {{can be made}} {{in order to determine the}} overall thermodynamic performance and mechanical deterioration of the train. With the proper instrumentation, critical parameters in the gas turbine such as component efficiencies, power, head, turbine firing temperature, heat rate, and heat balance can be computed. On the axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor,</b> section efficiencies, head, power, flow, and head coefficients can be computed. By understanding all the performance parameters and obtaining a good running history on these parameters, one can easily determine the condition of the rotating equipment at any given time. Based on these results, operation and maintenance techniques can be instituted. Major rotating equipment overhaul intervals can be identified by closely monitoring the performed deterioration parameters of any gas turbine or axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor.</b> This enables the unit to be operated with confidence through a planned major overhaul. On a separate occasion, a costly emergency shutdown was avoided by constantly monitoring the mechanical and thermodynamic performance of the compressor train until operations created an outage time. The outage time was based on preparation to minimize the downtime, as well as take into consideration product delivery schedules. Detail analysis of the gas turbine and axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> train computer simulation is presented to enable the reader to fully evaluate their own compressor train under various operating parameters such as molecular weight, speed, and varying inlet conditions, both process as well as ambient...|$|R

40|$|Deterministic {{stresses}} {{are used}} to describe the unsteady effects on the flow field in multistage axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressors.</b> In this paper, a circumferentially non-uniform mixing plane method implemented with deterministic stresses is used for the flow prediction inside the rear stage of an axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> in a multistage environment. The deterministic stress field is calculated with an overlapped solution approach for the same flow passage and implemented with the Navier-Stokes equations in order to provide continuous interfaces. The aerodynamic boundary condition is simplified with the application of a repeating stage model where only the mass flowrate and stage exit average static pressure are required. Two computational cases for the third stage of the Cranfield low-speed research compressor, one with the mixing plane model and the second with the mixing plane model in combination with deterministic stresses, are examined and compared with each other and also with corresponding experimental data. It is shown that the implementation of the deterministic stresses is beneficial for the flow prediction but the improvement in accuracy for low-speed axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> rear stages is not significant...|$|R

40|$|Fouling is {{the most}} {{important}} performance degradation factor, so it is necessary to accurately predict the effect of fouling on engine performance. In the previous research, {{it is very difficult to}} accurately model the fouled axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor.</b> This paper develops a new performance calculation method of fouled multistage axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> based on experiment result and operating data. For multistage compressor, the whole compressor is decomposed into two sections. The first section includes the first 50 % stages which reflect the fouling level, and the second section includes the last 50 % stages which are viewed as the clean stage because of less deposits. In this model, the performance of the first section is obtained by combining scaling law method and linear progression model with traditional stage stacking method; simultaneously ambient conditions and engine configurations are considered. On the other hand, the performance of the second section is calculated by averaged infinitesimal stage method which is based on Reynolds’ law of similarity. Finally, the model is successfully applied to predict the 8 -stage axial <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> and 16 -stage LM 2500 - 30 compressor. The change of thermodynamic parameters such as pressure ratio, efficiency with the operating time, and stage number is analyzed in detail...|$|R

This is a common operating problem experienced by almost all operators of gas turbines. The effect of compressor fouling is a drop in air <b>flow</b> and <b>compressor</b> isentropic efficiency, which then manifests itself as a drop in power output and thermal efficiency. In some cases, fouling can also result in s urge problems as its effect is to move the compressor surge line to the right, i. e., towards the operating line. The mechanisms are discussed for fouling, the aerodynamic and thermodynamic effects, types of foulants, detection methods, and control techniques. A brief discussion on turbine fouling is also made...|$|R
