40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} av ailable at: [URL] wind-erodible {{fraction of the}} soil (EF) (percentage of aggregates < 0. 84 mm in diameter) is a key parameter to estimate the soil susceptibility to wind erosion. The standard method for EF determination is the dry sieving {{by means of a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>sieve.</b> Flat sieving with a set of sieves {{and the use of the}} equation EF = (29. 09 + 0. 31 sand + 0. 17 silt + 0. 33 sand/clay – 2. 59 organic matter– 0. 95 CaCO 3) / 100, R 2 = 0. 67, Fryrear et al., 1994) are two alternative ways of determining EF. As the flat sieving has still not been contrasted against the standard <b>rotary</b> <b>sieve</b> method nor the Fryrear et al. equation tested for soils other than US soils, we estimated EF with both dry sieving methods and tested the equation for soils of semiarid regions of Central Aragon (NE Spain) and the Semiarid Pampas (centre of Argentina), two regions prone to wind erosion. Results showed that EF values obtained with the flat sieve were comparable with those obtained using the standard <b>rotary</b> <b>sieve</b> indicating that the flat sieving technique is suitable for EF determinations. The estimation of EF with the model proposed by Fryrear et al. (1994) did not fit with measured EF values, indicating that this model is not useful for predicting EF in Spanish and Argentinian soils. This was attributed to the high CaCO 3 contents of Spanish soils and the low sand/clay ratios and high organic matter contents of some Argentinean soils. The equation EF = 9. 98 + 6. 91 sand/clay + 14. 1 /organic matter (r = 0. 933; P < 0. 001) was proposed to predict EF in the studied soils.

40|$|Development of a {{high-speed}} and high-yield water-powered fish evisceration system (FES) to efficiently preprocess small fish and bycatch for producing minced fish meat is described. The {{concept of the}} system is propelling fish in a stream of water through an arrangement of cutting blades and brushes. Eviscerated fish are separated from the viscera and water stream in a dual screen <b>rotary</b> <b>sieve.</b> The FES processed head off fish, weighing 170 – 500 g, at the rate of 300 fish/min when used with an automatic heading machine. Yields of mince produced from walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma; and Pacific whiting, Merluccius productus; processed by the FES ranged between 43 % and 58 %. The maximum yield of minced muscle from fish weighing over 250 g was 52 %, and the yield of 250 g was 58 %. Test results indicated that surimi made from minced meat recovered from fish processed with the FES was comparable in quality to commercial grade surimi from conventional systems. Redesigned for commercial operation in the Faeroe Islands (Denmark), the system effectively processed North Atlantic blue whiting, Micromesistius poutassou, with an average weight of 110 g at a constant rate of 500 – 600 fish/min, producing deboned mince feeding a surimi processing line at a rate of 2. 0 t/h. Yields of mince ranged from 55 % to 63 % from round fish. Surimi made from the blue whiting mince meat produced by the FES was comparable to surimi commercially produced from blue whiting by Norway and France and sold into European markets...|$|E
40|$|In {{composite}} agricultural {{materials such}} as grass, tee, medicinal plants; leaves and stems have a different drying time. By this behavior, after leaving the dryer, the stems may have greater moisture content than desired, while the leaves one minor, which can cause either the appearance of fungi or {{the collapse of the}} over-dried material. Taking into account that a lot of grass is dehydrated in forced air dryers, especially rotary drum dryers, this research was developed in order to establish conditions enabling to make a separation of the components during the drying process in order to provide a homogeneous product at the end. For this, a rotary dryer consisting of three concentric cylinders and a circular sieve aligned with the more internal cylinder was proposed; so that, once material enters into the dryer {{in the area of the}} inner cylinder, stems pass through sieve to the middle and then continue towards the external cylinder, while the leaves continue by the inner cylinder. For this project, a mixture of Ryegrass and White Clover was used. The characteristics of the components of a mixture were: Drying Rate in thin layer and in rotation, Bulk density, Projected Area, Terminal velocity, weight/Area Ratio, Flux through <b>Rotary</b> <b>sieve.</b> Three drying temperatures; 40 °C, 60 ° C and 80 ° C, and three rotation speeds; 10 rpm, 20 rpm and 40 rpm were evaluated. It was found that the differences in drying time are the less at 80 °C when the dryer rotates at 40 rpm. Above this speed, the material adheres to the walls of the dryer or sieve and does not flow. According to the measurements of terminal velocity of stems and leaves of the components of the mixture, the speed of the air should be less than 1. 5 m s- 1 in the inner drum for the leaves and less than 4. 5 m s- 1 in middle and outer drums for stems, in such way that only the rotational movement of the dryer moves the material and achieves a greater residence time. In other hand, the best <b>rotary</b> <b>sieve</b> separation efficiencies were achieved when the material is dry, but the results are good in all the moisture contents. The best rotary speed of sieve is within the critical rotational speed, i. e. 20 rpm. However, the rotational speed of the dryer, including the sieve in line with the inner cylinder should be 10 rpm or less in order to achieve the greatest residence times of the material inside the dryer and the best agitation through the use of lifting flights. With a finite element analysis of a dryer prototype, using an air flow allowing speeds of air already stated, I was found that the best performance occurs when, through a cover, air enters the dryer front of the Middle cylinder and when the inner cylinder is formed in its entirety through a sieve. This way, air flows in almost equal amounts by both the middle and external cylinders, while part of the air in the Middle cylinder passes through the sieve towards the inner cylinder. With this, leaves do not adhere to the sieve and flow along drier, thanks to the rotating movement of the drums and the showering caused by the lifting flights. In these conditions, the differences in drying time are reduced to 60 minutes, but the residence time is higher for the stems than for leaves, therefore the components of the mixture of grass run out of the dryer with the same desired moisture content.

50|$|The {{starting}} material is tartar {{with a minimum}} tartaric acid content 68 %. This is first dissolved in water or in the mother liquor of a previous batch. It is then saponified with hot caustic soda to pH 8, decolorized with activated charcoal, and chemically purified before being filtered. The filtrate is evaporated to 42 °Bé at 100 °C, and passed to granulators in which Seignette's salt crystallizes on slow cooling. The salt is separated from the mother liquor by centrifugation, accompanied by washing of the granules, and is dried in a <b>rotary</b> furnace and <b>sieved</b> before packaging. Commercially marketed grain sizes range from 2000 μm to < 250 μm (powder).|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a fibrous mineral detection methodology, {{which is based}} on the use of alternating <b>rotary</b> motion <b>sieving</b> equipment. The equipment was redesigned to meet additional requirements with respect to initial ones. Under this methodology, the fine fraction passing through the sieves was recovered and analysed to determine the sedimentology, mineralogy and morphology of the potentially particulating fraction. Reliance was made on the following analytical techniques: laser granulometry, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS) and polarised and phase contrast light microscopy (PLM, PCLM) for fibrous mineral identification and Walton-Beckett / whole field fibre counting. The samples for the analyses came from known areas with fibrous minerals, e. g. Lauria (Basilicata), and less known areas, e. g. the Natural Reserve of Mt. Rufeno (Latium) and Biancavilla (Sicily). With this methodology, fibres may be directly detected in both farmed and unfarmed soil with fibrous minerals and the process may be repeated in the various stages of farming or during works for creation of fire barriers or lanes, hydrogeological restoration etc. The goal is to identify risks arising from the natural occurrence of asbestos upon atypical activities, such as farming and forestry. With regard to exposure, consideration was given to fibrous minerals not currently classified in the relevant legislation, thus going beyond the search for asbestiform minerals in quarry sites located in ophiolite outcrop areas...|$|R
40|$|Winter wheat–summer fallow is the {{conventional}} cropping system employed on> 1 · 5 million ha within the Columbia Plateau of eastern Washington and northern Oregon. Wind erosion contributes to poor air {{quality in the}} region, yet little is known concerning the magnitude of soil and PM 10 (particulate matter of ≤ 10 µm in aerodynamic diameter) loss from agricul-tural lands. Therefore, loss of soil and PM 10 was assessed from a silt loam in eastern Wash-ington during 2003 and 2004. Field sites were maintained in fallow using conventional tillage practices in 2003 (9 ha field) and 2004 (16 ha field) and instrumented to assess horizontal soil flux and PM 10 concentrations at the windward and leeward positions in the field during high-wind events. Soil flux was measured using creep and airborne sediment collectors while PM 10 concentrations were measured using high-volume PM 10 samplers. Aggregate size distribution of parent soil and eroded sediment was characterized by <b>rotary</b> and sonic <b>sieving.</b> Six high-wind events occurred over the two year period, with soil loss ranging from 43 kg ha− 1 for the 12 – 22 September 2003 event to 2320 kg ha− 1 for the 27 – 29 October 2003 event.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{three levels of}} soil {{moisture}} content (10 - 12, 13 - 15 and 16 - 18 % d. b.) and three levels of plowing depth (15, 20 and 25 cm) on draft, specific draft, and drawbar power requirements of a 3 - bottom disk plow and on soil pulverization and inversion in a clay loam soil were investigated. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 3 factorial. Except in soil inversion, the effect of soil moisture {{on all of the}} performance parameters mentioned, was highly significant. Mean values of draft, specific draft and drawbar power requirements and clod mean weight diameter were minimized at 13 - 15 % and 16 - 18 % soil moisture contents, respectively. The effect of plowing depth was highly significant only on draft and drawbar power requirement of disk plow, {{in such a way that}} the mean values of these two parameters were significantly increased with plowing depth, while specific draft showed only a mild decreasing trend. In order to provide a quantitative index to express the degree of soil pulverization by tillage implements, a tractor-pulled <b>rotary</b> <b>sieve</b> was designed and fabricated. With this apparatus, in-field determination of soil clod mean weight diameter (MWD) following plowing was possible. The results showed that the effect of soil moisture content on MWD was highly significant, such that, plowing at 10 - 12 % moisture content produced the largest clods, whereas the effect of plowing depth on MWD was not significant. The decreasing trend of MWD with soil moisture content persisted to the highest moisture level studied (16 - 18 %), in which the average clod MWD (33. 8 mm) was about 72 % smaller than those formed at 10 - 12 % moisture content. The effects of plowing depth and soil m. c. on soil inversion by disk plow were not significant and the overall soil inversion was about 54 % which was in agreement with those reported by other researchers...|$|E
