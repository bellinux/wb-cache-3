30|$|To {{resolve the}} {{abovementioned}} problems and challenging issues, the user <b>reputations</b> <b>in</b> social media {{need to be}} estimated upon concrete user features. Moreover, previous works hint that writing styles of social media users can be such objective features (Koppel et al. 2009). Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic approach that adopts the writing styles of users as objective features for estimating user <b>reputations</b> <b>in</b> social media. Nevertheless, following research gaps are identified through the literature reviews: first, no study has been made on an automated classification of user <b>reputations</b> <b>in</b> social media by using writing style analysis; second, when a way of defining user reputations into Good and Bad classes is given, it is unclear which writing style feature and classification technique will be better for this study; third, there is no reference on how to define the classes of user <b>reputations</b> <b>in</b> social media for the better performance.|$|R

Moreover we establish that the timescales for the buildup and decay of <b>reputations</b> <b>in</b> the case of private information are much longer that those involving public information.

40|$|Abstract. <b>In</b> {{decentralized}} interaction-based <b>reputation</b> systems, nodes {{store information}} about the past interactions of other nodes. Based on this information, they compute <b>reputations</b> <b>in</b> order to take decisions about future interactions. Computing the reputations with the complete history of interactions is inefficient due to its resource requirements. Furthermore, the complete history of interactions accumulates old information, which may impede the nodes from capturing the dynamic behavior of the system when computing <b>reputations.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we propose a scheme for {{reducing the amount of}} history maintained <b>in</b> decentralized interaction-based <b>reputation</b> systems based on such elements as the age of nodes, and we explore its effect on the computed reputations showing its effectiveness in both synthetic and real-world graphs...|$|R
