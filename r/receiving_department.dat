50|$|When the <b>receiving</b> <b>department</b> is not involved, it is {{typically}} called a two-way check or two-way purchase order. In this situation, the purchasing department issues the purchase order receipt not required. When an invoice arrives against the order, the accounts payable department will then {{go directly to}} the requestor of the purchase order to verify that the goods or services were received. This {{is typically}} what is done for goods and services that will bypass the <b>receiving</b> <b>department.</b> A few examples are software delivered electronically, NRE work (non-reoccurring engineering services), consulting hours, etc.|$|E

5000|$|The company {{contracted}} SEPRA Arquitectos for {{the design}} of new editorial offices in 1960, while retaining its Plateresque Florida Street headquarters. Inaugurated in 1969, the drab, two-story building (with three underground floors) was enlarged by the addition of four floors to the existing building, and La Nación relocated its headquarters to this new structure upon its completion in 1979. Flanked by leafy Roma Square to the south, the building's shipping and <b>receiving</b> <b>department</b> was shifted to the opposite, Eduardo Madero Avenue side. [...] The publisher was joined by industrial conglomerate Techint and Banco Santander Río in a US$40 million investment {{for the construction of a}} new office building. Designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum in 2000, the Postmodern addition was built on steel columns around the existing building, which allowed for its ongoing use while construction continued. Built by Estudio Aisenson contractors, Bouchard Plaza was inaugurated in 2004 with 26 stories and 100 meters (328 feet) in height; its 65,000 m² (700,000 ft²) made it one of the largest office buildings by floor area in the country.|$|E
5000|$|Semyon Lobanov He is {{physically}} big, and often intimidates people (most often his fellow intern Levin). He is often violent, having {{no qualms about}} hurting people, particularly those who annoy him. He is a former boxer (master of sports) {{and in one of}} the episodes he engages into a boxing match with his patient while the staff of the hospital makes bets. Lobanov often tries to make some money on the side, indulging in somewhat illegal or morally ambiguous activities and always fails due to his irresponsibility and laziness. At the start of the show, he was the only married intern, and his wife, Olga, was a lawyer (in one episode, it was mentioned that she graduated cum laude). The two of them had trouble conceiving a child, and it was revealed that Lobanov's slow-moving sperm was to blame for this. Lobanov's reluctance to quit smoking or drinking led to a rift between him and his wife, and the two filed for divorce in Season 3. In the 180th episode, Lobanov's daughter has been born. In the latest episodes he works in the <b>receiving</b> <b>department</b> and rarely appears in the series.|$|E

The unmarked {{cardboard}} boxes, {{stored for}} weeks on a parts rack, were {{taken over to}} SabreTech's shipping and <b>receiving</b> <b>department</b> and left {{on the floor in}} an area assigned to ValuJet property.Step 3. Continental Airlines, a potential SabreTech customer, was planning an inspection of the facility, so a SabreTech shipping clerk was instructed to clean up the work place. He decided to send the oxygen generators to ValuJet's headquarters in Atlanta and labelled the boxes [...] "aircraft parts". He had shipped ValuJet material to Atlanta before without formal approval. Furthermore, he misunderstood the green tags to indicate [...] "unserviceable" [...] or [...] "out of service" [...] and jumped {{to the conclusion that the}} generators were empty.Step 4. The shipping clerk made up a load for the forward cargo hold of the five boxes plus two large main tires and a smaller nose tire. He instructed a co-worker to prepare a shipping ticket stating [...] "oxygen canisters - empty". The co-worker wrote, [...] "Oxy Canisters" [...] followed by [...] "Empty" [...] in quotation marks. The tires were also listed.Step 5. A day or two later the boxes were delivered to the ValuJet ramp agent for acceptance on Flight 592. The shipping ticket listing tires and oxygen canisters should have caught his attention but didn't. The canisters were then loaded against federal regulations, as ValuJet was not registered to transport hazardous materials. It is possible that, in the ramp agent's mind, the possibility of SabreTech workers sending him hazardous cargo was inconceivable ...|$|E

40|$|In central Jönköping, on Munksjöns {{northern}} waterside {{a shopping}} centre will be built, {{on the block}} Atollen. The construction will begin in autumn of 2007 and will be finished according to plan in 2009. Atollens goal is to counteract the competition from external retailers and strengthen the retail trade in the city centre, leading to more attractive and competitive city centre. Atollen {{will not be a}} shopping centre in traditional style and design, it will be focused on shopping and experience. The shopping centre shall be a natural venue with a wide and exclusive store mix, concentrated against trend conscious customers. This will be created {{with the help of a}} futuristic design and architecture, with light, open and transparent spaces. Atollens central location and design have led to the choice of placing the <b>receiving</b> <b>department</b> in the shopping centres basement. This will lead to a more complex <b>receiving</b> <b>department</b> for Atollens units. The objective of this thesis is to analyse the <b>receiving</b> <b>department</b> and the internal logistics effects on sales and tenants ability to pay. To achieve the objective a status report has been established of Atollens commercial parts and the internal logistic flow, from plans and blueprints. The thesis work has been carried out with help of interviews, literature studies and visits to shopping centres in benchmarking purposes. The analysis of the <b>receiving</b> <b>department</b> and the internal logistics has been carried out from the areas garage entrance, <b>receiving</b> <b>department,</b> storage/depot and logistic walkway. The analysis has identified a number of problems that can arise in Atollen and potentially lead to a goods supply that is not optimal for the shopping centres units. The thesis works conclusion is based on how the authors consider the problems that can arise affect sales and tenants ability to pay in Atollen. The conclusion also presents recommendations of how to avoid that these problems arise. The recommendations involves delivery control, extension of logistic walkway, installation of goods lifts, displays and reference, delivery instructions, security and shop interior.
