Bailouts are expensive, both for residents of the nation being bailed out and for parties providing the bailout funds. Because the IMF, which is subsidized by most nations (including the United States), is almost always involved in country debt bailouts, we all share the burden. Yet bailouts are virtually inevitable under the existing international framework; defaults are likely to have systemic consequences, whereas an orderly debt restructuring is currently impractical. This article analyzes and compares debt restructuring alternatives to bailouts. Under a free-market option, sovereign debtors and their creditors attempt to consensually negotiate a debt <b>restructuring,</b> <b>aided</b> by collective-action clauses and by exchange offers with exit consents. Under a statutory option, sovereign debtors and their creditors would be bound by an international convention that sets forth a process to facilitate debt restructuring.

Subsidies to enterprises during transformation were high, often transparent, and above the European Union average. During 1997 - 2003 registered state aid reached 362 bn. CZK. More than 90 percent of the total registered state aid went to awards the rescue and restructuring of enterprises. It can be roughly estimated that during 1997 - 2000 state aid was twice as high as officially registered. Share of state aid to enterprises in public debt increased and reached 70 percent by 2003.

40|$|Although the {{positive}} externalities {{associated with higher}} education favour substantial government support, sound arguments also favour student contributions to the costs of post-secondary education, based on both the private benefits obtained and the regressive impact of general subsidies for higher education. At the same time, the central role that higher education performs {{as a vehicle for}} social mobility and the general reluctance of private lenders to finance individual investments in higher education suggest that governments also have an important role to play in the area of student assistance - ensuring that higher education is accessible to all students on the basis of merit, irrespective of financial ability. The need for a well-designed student assistance program is more important than ever. Among many proposals for a <b>restructured</b> student <b>aid</b> system, {{one of the most promising}} is to replace existing 2 ̆ 7 mortgage-style 2 ̆ 7 student loads with a financing arrangement involving repayment obligations that depend on the student 2 ̆ 7 s income after graduation. To the extent that this 2 ̆ 7 income-contingent 2 ̆ 7 approach reduces the risk to borrowers with respect to their investments in higher education, it will likely lessen the reluctance that students exhibit with respect to such borrowing. Moreover, where funding covers both the direct costs of higher education as well as living expenses, income-contingent financing programs may enhance accessibility by making higher education effectively free at the point of purchase - offsetting the 2 ̆ 7 sticker shock 2 ̆ 7 associated with increased tuition fees as well as living costs which generally exceed the direct costs of higher education. Finally, collection through the income tax should reduce the incidence of nonpayment and dramatically lessen the costs of administering student financial aid. This paper proposes an income-contingent financing program (ICFP) for Ontario to replace the current system of mortgage-style loans, automatic debt remission, and interest and debt relief available under the Ontario Student Assistance Program. Part 1 reviews the current system of government-provided student aid in Ontario, providing an essential foundation for our subsequent proposal for an ICFP. Part 2 examines the experience with ICFPs in Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK, in order to derive lessons relevant to the design of an ICFP for Ontario. Part 3 considers the essential features of an ICFP, canvassing the competing arguments and making specific recommendations informed by our review of the current system in Ontario and the international experience with ICFPs...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} financial aid and enrollment at a women's college. A historical {{review of literature}} coupled with the examination of previous studies provided background information on the topic. Two student groups {{were used in the}} analysis, which included individuals who were awarded financial aid and did not enroll, as well as, individuals who were awarded financial aid and did enroll. Only students who initially applied to the College during the 2002 - 03 and 2004 - 05 academic years were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed to determine: (1) financial aid and its affect on enrollment (2) ranking of the six college choices on the FAFSA (3) financial aid applicants and income levels (4) relationship between income and scholarship recipients (5) <b>restructuring</b> of financial <b>aid</b> packaging policies. The results found that financial aid does influence enrollment for both student groups. Financial aid was the primary reason for attendance for the students who enrolled, but influenced the other group not to enroll. Students indicated majors and cost as factors that influenced them to enroll at other colleges. Eighty percent of enrolled students listed the College on the FAFSA as their first choice, while 30 % of the students who did not enroll had the College listed first. College ranking on the FAFSA provides a good indication as whether the student might enroll. Family incomes of students who did not enroll were greater than $ 50, 001 per year. For the students who did enroll their annual family income was less than $ 50, 000. Income was also compared to scholarship recipients and it was determined the majority of the enrolled students who were awarded a scholarship had family incomes of $ 50, 000, or less per year. The majority of scholarship recipients for the students who did not enroll had family incomes greater than $ 50, 001. It was recommended based on the analysis for the College to increase the two top scholarship awards, because these awards are given to the most academically capable students. The majority of scholarship awards now being offered are at the lowest academic interval, which indicates more of the brightest students need to be encouraged to enroll...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the recent financial crisis on EU state aid policy and regulation. The crisis necessitated the granting of significant amounts of government aid to banks that had encountered financial difficulties. The thesis describes the changes that the crisis produced in the legal framework for controlling state aid to distressed financial institutions in the EU. The analysis includes a discussion of certain significant state aid decisions concerning state aid to banks during the crisis. The thesis also discusses whether the Commission’s actions during the crisis departed significantly from the state aid control policy that the Commission had developed prior to the crisis. The theoretical framework of the thesis is based on discussions concerning the economic rationale for controlling state aid. Usually it is argued that state aid needs to be controlled because it has the potential of decreasing the economic efficiency of undertakings, which results in welfare losses for the economy as a whole. State aid control is also deemed necessary in order to secure a level playing field for actors from different Member states and thus to foster market integration. However, state aid control may also be justified in order to promote aid that corrects market failures or aid that aims to promote certain equity objectives. Thus, the aims pursued by state aid policy are multiple and have at times conflicted with one another. The promotion of financial stability, the stated aim of granting state aid to banks during the recent crisis, can be understood as a case of using aid in order to address a market failure (the financial instability resulting from a bank’s bankruptcy) and thus as an efficient use of state aid. The legal rules applied to the control of state aid in normal times are briefly described in the thesis. It is observed that so called rescue and <b>restructuring</b> (R&R) <b>aid</b> is usually considered {{to be one of the}} most harmful forms of aid and the Commission has thus in the past underlined that it should only be granted in exceptional situations. The analysis of the Commission’s decisional practice concerning aid to banks prior to the crisis clearly shows that the Commission has been willing to apply standard state aid rules to banks as well, yet however taking into account the specific significance of the banking sector for the economy as a whole. This might be understood to imply that the safeguarding of financial stability is not an aim that was completely foreign to state aid policy even prior the crisis. Banks that received aid prior to the recent crisis were also subject to strict remedies aimed at addressing potential distortions of competition, such as asset reductions, branch closures and behavioural constraints. The thesis then moves on to discuss the crisis legal framework put in place by the Commission from late- 2008 onwards. The content of these so called Crisis Communications is discussed. It is observed that even though the Commission did at certain points depart significantly from the standard legal framework for granting R&R aid to undertakings (most notably by introducing the distinction between fundamentally sound and unsound undertakings), the basic characteristics of state aid control regulation remained in place throughout the crisis. The amendments to the standard regime also gradually became less significant, as the crisis regime evolved with the adoption of the Restructuring Communication in August 2010. This continuity in the Commission’s approach is evidenced also by the analysis of certain key decisions by the Commission during the crisis, which shows that the aided banks had to accept remedies that resemble closely the ones applied already prior to the crisis, the former being in certain cases even harsher. It is clear that the Commission was not willing to let significant distortions of competition arise as a result of maintaining financial stability. In the final chapter of the thesis the recent development of EU banking regulation is briefly described. This development aims to make sure that in the future financial crises will not be dealt with government aid but instead with resources granted by the financial institutions themselves. As a conclusion, it is argued that the Commission was in its actions during the crisis trying to pursue two distinct policy aims, namely the safeguarding of financial stability and the avoidance of distortions of competition. This dual policy aim might also explain why the Commission’s actions have attracted some criticism, since the aim of promoting financial stability does not fit easily together with state aid control’s traditional policy objective, the promotion of competition...|$|R
