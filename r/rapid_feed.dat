40|$|BACKGROUND: Sham feeding {{has been}} shown to hasten the return of GI {{function}} following colorectal surgery, before the advent of enhanced recovery after surgery protocols. Few data exist regarding the efficacy of sham feeding in the modern era, with <b>rapid</b> postoperative <b>feeding.</b> OBJECTIVE: We sought to perform a meta-analysis on the effect of sham feeding in colorectal surgery, with a separate analysis on trials that used <b>rapid</b> postoperative <b>feeding.</b> DATA SOURCES: Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and PubMed were searched by using the terms gum OR sham feeding OR chew* AND (colorect* OR resect*). STUDY SELECTION: All studies were randomized controlled trials (in any language) performed on adults, comparing standard care with gum chewing following colorectal resection. From 439 citations, 10 articles were included. INTERVENTION: The intervention was sham feeding by means of gum chewing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were time to return of flatus, time to first bowel movement, complication rates, length of hospital stay, readmission rates, and reoperation rates. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials (n = 612) were included. Sham feeding resulted in a reduction in time to flatus of 31 minutes (p = 0. 003) and time to first bowel movement of 30 minutes (p = 0. 05). Sham feeding also resulted in a reduction in length of stay by 0. 5 days (p = 0. 007), and a reduction in complication rates (relative risk = 0. 687, p = 0. 017), although this appeared to be associated with publication bias. Analysis of trials that used <b>rapid</b> postoperative <b>feeding</b> (n = 282) revealed no difference in postoperative GI function. LIMITATIONS: This review was limited by the heterogeneity of postoperative feeding regimes, in addition to limited reporting by trials of postoperative morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Sham feeding following colorectal surgery is safe, results in small improvements in GI recovery, and is associated with a reduction in the length of hospital stay. It confers no advantage if patients are placed on a <b>rapid</b> postoperative <b>feeding</b> regime...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{importance}} {{has been}} recognized to nest construction and larval food transport to the nest as a precondition for the eusociality of insects (Evans, 1958; Hunt, 1991). Most adult hymenopterans feed on liquids, although bees and a few wasps may also feed on pollen. Adult Aculeata are not herbivores, detritivores, or even carnivores in the strict sense. It is safe to affirm that nectar or nectar-like liquids, and body fluids from preys or carrion are the typical, in fact nearly exclusive, sources of adult nourishment (Hunt, 1991). Characteristics of the internal anatomy reflecting this diet are the distensible crop (that serve as a liquid reservoir) and restrictive proventriculus (that serve as a valve to facilitate <b>rapid</b> <b>feeding</b> while regulating flow into the midgut).

40|$|A {{new unit}} {{operation}} is presented that utilizes a <b>rapid</b> <b>feed</b> pressure swing cycle {{in a bed}} packed with catalyst and adsorbent to effect both reaction and separation. This hybrid device combines features of a cyclic-steady-state pressure swing adsorber with those of a flow-forced catalytic reactor. Feed sequences for the periodic separating reactor (PSR) are those of rapid, single-bed pressure swing adsorbers (PSA). Only the case of extremely fast reactions is considered here. A perturbed reaction-sorption equilibrium model is formulated and solved for isothermal operation for different equilibrium constants and reaction stoichiometries. The capacity and separation performance for an equilibrium-limited PSR (EPSR) can be of the same order of magnitude as PSA alone.

40|$|Esophageal {{obstruction}} or “choke” is {{a relatively}} common occurrence in the equine industry. It often results from improper mastication, consuming feed too quickly, dehydration or a decrease in saliva production. Esophageal obstruction is a medical emergency during which a horse cannot dislodge a bolus of feed from the esophagus and must wait for human intervention or for the block to be softened and moved by peristalsis. This condition may result {{in the formation of}} ulcers, esophageal rupture, aspiration pneumonia, and possibly death. Grazing muzzles have been shown to slow the rate of forage intake. We hypothesized that grazing muzzles could also be used to decrease the rate of pelleted feed intake and so possibly reduce the risk of equine esophageal obstruction in horses fed large meals of pelleted feed. The objective of this research was to compare the rate of pelleted feed intake for horses wearing grazing muzzles to those wearing no muzzle. Utilizing a crossover design, horses were randomly assigned to three groups with each horse receiving each treatment. Treatments were as follows: No Muzzle (NM), Easy Breath Grazing Muzzle (EBGM), or Tough 1 Nylon Grazing Muzzle (TNGM). Eight adult stock-type horses age 5 ± 1 years, were offered 2. 27 kg of pelleted concentrate to consume in a 10 -minute period once daily. The study was comprised of three periods (5 days each) with a two-day resting period between each. Horses were weighed daily and no significant change in bodyweight was observed. Data for daily intake were analyzed using the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS with significance established at P 3 ̆c 0. 05. Both the EBGM and the TNGM reduced rate of intake (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) during a 10 -minute feeding interval as compared with NM.

In Exp. A, either randomized complete block designs or completely randomized designs were used. Pretreatment PUN {{was used as a}} covariate. Results indicated that the true ileal digestible lysine requirements were 16. 5 +/- 0. 2, 18. 0 +/- 0. 5, 20. 2 +/- 1. 5, 16. 7 +/- 0. 8, and 14. 4 +/- 7. 2 g/d/pig at 33, 52, 72, 93, and 113 kg body weight, respectively. The precision of the estimation decreased when pigs reached the finishing period. To increase the precision, three trials in Exp. C were conducted. Repeated 5 x 5 Latin square designs were used and feed intakes were limited to 90 % of the ad libitum levels. The estimated true ileal digestible lysine requirements were 19. 9 +/- 0. 57, 17. 0 +/- 0. 47, and 18. 1 +/- 0. 64 g/d/pig at the body weight ranges of 59 to 78, 78 to 95, and 96 to 115 kg, respectively. The last requirement might be overestimated because of a <b>rapid</b> <b>feed</b> consumption during the trial period. Compared with Exp. A, the precision of the lysine requirement estimation increased in Exp. C.;From the lysine requirements obtained in Exp. A and C, the lean growth rates of individually penned PIC barrows were calculated to be 334, 372, 404, 414, 340, 327, and 276 g/d at 33, 52, 69, 72, 87, 93, and 113 kg body weight, respectively.

In the solemn calm of the awakening morn that note was heard by Gabriel, beating with unusual violence and rapidity.

40|$|Enhanced {{biological}} {{phosphorus removal}} (EBPR) {{is a popular}} modification of the activated sludge process, and has been studied and applied for decades. It was hypothesized that the bacteria responsible for EBPR, polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), have an advantage over their competitors, the glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs). Because research EBPR systems have been primarily sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), which include <b>rapid</b> <b>feed</b> addition and relatively high substrate concentrations, while full scale systems often include complete mix reactors, which yield generally lower substrate concentrations due to instantaneous dilution of influent, evaluating this hypothesis has both fundamental and applied implications. The primary objectives of this research were to (1) evaluate the effects of carbon substrate (acetate) concentrations on PAO/GAO competition in conjunction with variable pH and temperature, and (2) evaluate whether GAOs tend to be causes of PAO failure or opportunists arising after PAO failure laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) EBPR systems were operated with synthetic feed, and acetate as the main carbon source for more than 650 days. Experimental variables with respect to reactor operation include pH, temperature, and rate of acetate addition during each cycle feeding phase. Consistent with previous research, PAOs were dominant at higher pH values (7. 4 - 8. 4) when acetate was added rapidly (Stage 1), and when pH was decreased, EBPR failed (Stage 2). When the rate of acetate addition was then slowed to maintain low concentrations in the reactors (Stage 3), PAOs were able to once again dominate the system, supporting the hypothesis that PAOs may be favored by low acetate concentrations. Returning the system to an increased rate of acetate addition again led to PAO failure (Stage 4). PAO failure in Stages 2 and 4 {{did not appear to}} be caused by GAOs, based on measurements of acetate concentrations, and it appeared that high acetate concentrations at low pH were themselves inhibitory to PAO metabolism. Batch tests with chemical inhibitors indicated that PAOs and GAOs likely use different transport systems to take up acetate, which provide PAOs the ability to scavenge low acetate concentrations through their particular transport mechanism, and inhibition was increased at lower acetate concentrations. Lower acetate concentrations did not provide an advantage of PAOs over GAOs when the temperature was increased from 22 °C to 29 °C. Lower acetate concentrations may be advantageous to EBPR process performance, as they increased the biomass polyphosphate content by 50 % relative to higher acetate concentration conditions (22 °C, pH = 7. 4 - 8. 4).

50|$|Another {{factor that}} {{influences}} vigilance is the benefit {{that is expected}} from foraging {{in the absence of}} predation. This is dependent {{on the quality of the}} food as well as the energetic state of the individual. If there is much to be gained from feeding, foragers may forgo vigilance. Similarly, if hungry animals have a higher chance of dying from starvation than from predation, it is more beneficial to sacrifice vigilance to fulfill their energy requirements. When three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are deprived of food, they prefer to feed in locations with a high density of water fleas. The cost to this choice is that the sticklebacks must concentrate on picking out the prey due to the 'predator confusion effect' where many moving targets make it difficult for predators to pick out individual prey. This choice means that the sticklebacks are less able to scan for predators however the risk of starvation is relatively higher than the risk of predation. Similarly, juncos that have been deprived of food exhibit lower levels of vigilance, instead focusing on <b>rapid</b> <b>feeding</b> which is a behaviour incompatible with scanning.|$|R

Effective vaccines against most tick-borne pathogens are not currently available. In this study, we characterized a tick histamine release factor (tHRF) from Ixodes scapularis and addressed the vaccine potential of this antigen {{in the context of}} tick engorgement and B. burgdorferi transmission. Results from western blotting and quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR showed that tHRF is secreted in tick saliva, and upregulated in Borrelia burgdorferi-infected ticks. Further, the expression of tHRF was coincident with the <b>rapid</b> <b>feeding</b> phase of the tick, suggesting a role for tHRF in tick engorgement and concomitantly, for efficient B. burgdorferi transmission. Silencing tHRF by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly impaired tick feeding and decreased B. burgdorferi burden in mice. Interfering with tHRF by actively immunizing mice with recombinant tHRF, or passively transferring tHRF antiserum, also markedly reduced the efficiency of tick feeding and B. burgdorferi burden in mice. Recombinant tHRF was able to bind to host basophils and stimulate histamine release. Therefore, we speculate that tHRF might function in vivo to modulate vascular permeability and increase blood flow to the tick bite-site, facilitating tick engorgement.

40|$|Symbioses {{involving}} sulfur-oxidizing {{bacteria and}} invertebrate hosts require {{a source of}} reduced sulfur, a source of O- 2, and transport mechanisms that ensure them a supply of both. We investigated these mechanisms using the symbiosis between the sessile ciliate Zoothamnium niveum (Hemprich and Ehrenberg 1831) and bacteria living on its surface. The stalked colonies of Z niveum grow on peat walls around the openings of centimeter-scale conduits created when mangrove rootlets decompose. Using in situ, time-series measurements with fast-responding amper-ometric microelectrodes, {{we found that the}} conduits were charged with H 2 S by diffusion from the decaying rootlets during periods of low boundary-layer flow speed. During these times, the feeding current of the zooids transported oxygenated seawater from outside the peat wall toward the ectobiotic bacteria. During periods of high flow speed, H 2 S-rich seawater from the conduits was drawn along the colonies and over the bacteria. We conclude that this symbiosis exploits a combination of two transport mechanisms: (1) venting of H 2 S-rich seawater due to pulsating boundary-layer current over ciliate groups and (2) the continuous and <b>rapid</b> <b>feeding</b> current generated by the host's cilia. This discovery raises the possibility that other systems in which pockets of decay are exposed to pulsating flow could support similar symbioses...|$|R

Results: A total of 161 patients were recruited. Postoperative morbidity was equivalent between groups, with no complications related to gum chewing. There was no difference between groups with respect to the primary outcomes of time to flatus and bowel motion. There was less perception of pain in the intervention group on days 2 to 5, and no difference with respect to all other secondary outcomes.

By means of observation, experiment and optimality modelling, the extent of mass changes during incubation and nestling rearing are described, and the fitness consequences of mass changes discussed. An understanding of the causes and consequences of mass changes in swallows is developed from laboratory investigations of short term mass changes in canaries Serinus canarius, and from carcass analysis of breeding sand martins R. riparia, and swallows. Parent: offspring resource allocation was investigated during incubation in swallows. A model is developed which assumes that fitness is maximised in individuals which spend most time on the nest {{as a result of}} maximising the difference between net gain while foraging and clutch reheating costs, measured in units of energy. The model is tested, and the most frequently observed inattentive period proves, to be similar to that predicted to be the most energetically profitable. The early decline in swallow body mass during nestling rearing is likely to represent a 'programmed' anorexia in females during the brooding phase, whereby mass loss is beneficial in reducing flight costs and releasing energy available for work. After termination of brooding, however, mass losses were associated with <b>rapid</b> <b>feeding</b> rates to the brood for both sexes, and were judged to be potentially costly in terms of adult survival. (ii) By concurrent monitoring of resources for parents and offspring, investment in self-maintenance relative to investment in offspring is calculated, and the results interpreted in the wider context of lifehistory tactics and parental investment theories. Both sexes of swallow invested more in 'self' relative to 'offspring' when food was scarce or when feeding broods of small metabolic mass. Females appeared to risk their body mass falling to lower levels than that of their mates when feeding conditions were poor. overall, the study showed that {{the costs and benefits of}} mass changes in swallows differed according to the stage of the breeding cycle, and that detailed knowledge of the causes of mass changes allows insight into the evolution of reproductive strategies of birds of both sexes in relation to individual quality and resource availability...|$|R

40|$|The {{degree of}} {{plasticization}} of the alloscutal cuticle of a 'hard' (ixodid) tick, Amblyomma hebraeum, and a 'soft' (argasid) tick, Ornithodoros moubata, was assessed throughout the blood-feeding period. Cuticle viscosity was calculated from rate of creep of cuticle under constant load using a Maxwell model. Feeding-related plasticization (i. e. increased rate of extension under a constant load) occurred in A. hebraeum {{but not in}} O. moubata. Maxwell viscosity of unfed A. hebraeum cuticle was relatively high (similar to 720. GPa. s) but was significantly lower in feeding ticks. Small partially fed ticks displayed a viscosity of similar to 108 GPa. s. Still lower values (42 GPa. s) were observed in {{the largest of the}} engorged ticks. Following cessation of feeding, there was a significant but limited reversal in viscosity back to similar to 100. GPas. The water content of cuticle of unfed A. hebraeum (23. 4 % of wet mass) rose sharply after the onset of feeding and reached a plateau value of 34. 0 % at a fed/unfed weight ratio of 3 and beyond. Ixodid ticks lay down new endocuticle during the feeding period. The observed increase in cuticle hydration suggests that both old and new cuticles are hydrated during feeding. Monoamines may {{play an important role in}} controlling cuticle viscosity. Dopamine (DA) injected into partially fed A. hebraeum caused plasticization. 5 -Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5 -HT), which induces plasticization in the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus, had no statistically significant effect on tick cuticle. Octopamine (OA) and tyramine both caused cuticle stiffening (i. e. opposed plasticization). This suggests a possible inhibitory effect but co-injection of OA with DA did not reduce DA-induced plasticization. The mechanism leading to plasticization of tick cuticle may involve a change in cuticular pH. The viscosity of tick cuticle loops was highest at pH. 8. 0 (389 GPa. s) and fell precipitously in the acidic range to a low value of 2. 2. GPa. s at pH 5. 5 - 5. 7. A cuticular pH of similar to 6. 5 would account for the lowest viscosity observed under physiological conditions (42. 4 GPa. s for large, day 0, engorged ticks). The V-ATPase inhibitor, concanamycin A, was a potent inhibitor of DA-induced plasticization. These results are consistent with a model in which DA acts to cause plasticization through transport of H+ ions into the cuticle. Measurement of cuticular ion (Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) content did not suggest that plasticization is caused by any of these ions. Taken together, our results suggest that the mechanism of cuticular plasticization in feeding A. hebraeum is related to hydration, and involves the transport of H+ ions into the sub-cuticular space by cells in the hypodermis. Feeding-induced plasticization was not observed in the <b>rapid</b> <b>feeding</b> tick, O. moubata...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of larval fishes is a chronically understudied, critically important field, which offers broad insight into a defining {{period in the}} life history of fishes. Examinations of development {{shed light on the}} behavior and ecology of fishes at a stage wherein they are difficult to observe directly. We cleared and stained 36 specimens of the soft sculpin, Psychrolutes sigalutes, in an effort to link morphological development to preexisting studies on their behavioral shifts with growth. <b>Rapid</b> {{development of}} <b>feeding</b> structures suggests a fish that quickly grows into a highly capable hunter, well-suited to its lengthy transitional feeding period in the plankton. Given the intense focus of development on hunting, we believe that transforming P. sigalutes may be the apex predators in their habitat, possibly responsible for the top-down control of local ichyhtoplankton...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-precision {{machining}} {{is rarely}} {{used in the}} production industry due to high costs {{as a consequence of}} disproportionally long primary and secondary processing times. In this context, the implementation of innovative machine technologies presents a suitable approach to increase productivity and reduce manufacturing costs. This paper introduces the implementation of an electromagnetic linear guide within a two-axis positioning stage for ultra-precision and micro machining. Using analytical models and FEM simulations, an optimised design for the guide's structure and magnet configuration is developed with regard to the intended application in ultra-precision high performance cutting. The new guide system provides frictionless operation for <b>rapid</b> and precise <b>feed</b> movements. Stiffness and damping of the electromagnetic guide can be adjusted to current process requirements. Fine positioning of the levitating carriage within the air gap enables an increase of the overall position accuracy. DFG/FOR/ 184...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{versatile}} {{functions of}} glucose in the metabolism, perpetuation of the glucose level in blood is {{of paramount importance}} for all higher organisms. Insulin therefore {{plays a major role in}} the metabolic circle and the distribution of metabolites. Based on a special metabolism of glucose, adult cattle got lower insulin-levels. Therefore a gap arises between milk yield on one hand and fertility on the other hand in cows with a high milk yield. The genetic determination and adaption to the environment can be simulated by using metabolic tests like the glucose-tolerance-test. Content of this thesis is the evaluation of insulin parameters of the glucose-tolerance-test with young cattle. The influences of feeding and environment have been modulated specifically and effects of body condition and age have been examined. Aim was the standardization of the glucose-tolerance-test. This test could be used in the estimation of breeding values to add focus on the breeding goal of a long life. The examined blood serum samples were taken from eighteen young cattle which were tested with the glucose-tolerance-test weekly between the age of 9, 2 to 14, 8 months. The tested animals were six bulls, six bullocks and six heifers, mainly Holstein-Frisian. The ratios given varied between a high and a low content of energy. With some single tests the influence of protein, stress caused by noise and stress caused by food jealousy were tested. With every animal 23 glucose-tolerance-tests were carried out. 434 single tests were evaluated. Beside the glucose-tolerance-test, mass and back fat thickness were recorded in every test. As expected the increase of mass was higher in bulls than at heifers. Heifers showed a significant increase in back fat thickness. The bullocks were neutral with a mass close to the heifers and the back fat thickness near to the bulls. The concentration parameters of base-insulin and insulin were not reproducible 63 minutes after the giving of glucose. The parameters for the amplitude of the serum-insulin-curve varied individually. For standardization and to lower the numbers of taking samples the minutes 14 and 28 after glucoseinfusion can be recommended. The gender of the animals influences the reaction within the glucose-tolerance-test. Therefore the bullocks showed the highest insulin-answer and the bulls the lowest. Besides the well known supporting nature of estrogen on the insulin-answer, the testosterone seems to have a suppressing one. The glucose-insulin-system increases as well. But the examined age showed an overlapping with protein-anabolic effects in bulls and adipocyte proliferation in heifers. The <b>rapid</b> <b>feeding</b> of protein caused no effects on the insulin-level. Constant stress enforces the insulinlevel and the insulin-answer. Short-term-stress has no influence because cattle tend to fast anastasis with stress. With respect to the age of the examined animals the results of the glucose-tolerance-test were stable. Animals aged between the 10 th and the 15 th month can be recommended for testing under the condition of a well balanced feeding and standardized adequate animal housing. The low reproducibility of insulin-parameters reflects the function of insulin as a heavily cross-linked variable...|$|R
