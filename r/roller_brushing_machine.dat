5000|$|The SCS process feeds {{hot rolled}} sheet steel, either as {{individual}} blanks or as a continuous strip that is uncoiled, into the SCS [...] "brushing machine". Within the machine the steel is passed between sets of rotating <b>roller</b> <b>brushes</b> that spin on an axis perpendicular to the sheet's direction of travel. The <b>roller</b> <b>brush</b> exterior is an engineered abrasive, similar to Scotchbrite, that makes contact with the steel under pressure. Each <b>roller</b> <b>brush</b> spins against the steel at a speed of 900 to 1000 revolutions per minute, [...] "scrubbing away" [...] the outer layers of mill scale - hematite and magnetite - {{and most of the}} inner layer, wustite. The remaining wustite layer is only a few micrometres thick and highly polished to a smooth surface. Three such <b>roller</b> <b>brushes</b> are typically applied to each surface of the steel sheet, for a total of six <b>roller</b> <b>brushes</b> per SCS <b>brushing</b> <b>machine.</b> Numerous spray nozzles within the <b>brushing</b> <b>machine</b> provide water to rinse the removed scale and any other debris from the steel surface and to cool the friction heat generated in the brushes. The water is filtered and re-used in this closed-loop rinsing/filtering system.|$|R

50|$|Of course, hobbyists prefer {{cabinets}} with original artwork in {{the best}} possible condition. Since machines with good quality art are hard to find, one of the first tasks is stripping any old artwork or paint from the cabinet. This is done with conventional chemical paint strippers or by sanding (preferences vary). Normally artwork cannot be preserved that has been painted over and is removed with any covering paint. New paint can be applied in any manner preferred (<b>roller,</b> <b>brush,</b> spray). Paint used is often just conventional paint with a finish matching the cabinet's original paint.|$|R

40|$|Servo {{control of}} motors has {{important}} applications m {{such areas as}} robotics, numerically controlled machines and 2 ̆ 7 fly by wire* aircraft systems. The development of high power high coercivity magnetic alloys, such as samarium cobalt, {{has led to the}} advent of the brushless dc machine, which offers a more advantageous alternative to the <b>brush</b> <b>machine.</b> The brushless DC machine eliminates the need for brush contacts, through the use of electronic commutation. It has better thermal characteristics, as the rotor does not carry any current, and the rotor moment of inertia tends to be smaller than an equivalent <b>brush</b> <b>machine.</b> To achieve servo performance with a brushless dc machine requires the control of the motors torque angle. This thesis proposes digital control schemes for torque angle control, presents a simulation of the motor system with the schemes implemented, and concludes that digital schemes are more advantageous than analog control schemes, in the context of torque angle control of a brushless DC system...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} whether {{patients should be}} advised to perform toothbrushing before or after an acidic challenge to minimize enamel and dentin wear by brushing abrasion. METHODS: The study was a two-period crossover design (A and B, each 14 days) in which three enamel and dentin specimens were fixed in intraoral appliances of 10 volunteers. The following regimens were performed {{three times a day}} with at least 4 hours in between: A: 20 -second brushing treatment in an automatic <b>brushing</b> <b>machine,</b> 5 minutes intraoral exposure of the specimens, extraoral erosion of enamel and dentin specimens for 40 seconds or B: Extraoral erosion for 40 seconds, 5 minutes intraoral exposure of the specimens, 20 -second brushing treatment in an automatic <b>brushing</b> <b>machine.</b> Enamel and dentin loss {{at the end of each}} 14 -day regimen was assessed by profilometry and statistically analyzed by t-test. RESULTS: For all volunteers, mean enamel and dentin wear was significantly lower when brushing treatment was performed before erosion (A: enamel: 2. 3 +/- 1. 0 microm, dentin: 4. 1 +/- 1. 6 microm) than when brushing was applied after erosion (B: enamel: 6. 4 +/- 3. 0 microm, dentin: 15. 3 +/- 6. 8 microm).
