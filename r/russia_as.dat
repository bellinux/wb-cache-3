5|$|In early 1996 a {{group of}} Moscow academics, journalists and intellectuals {{suggested}} that Vladimir Bukovsky should run for President of <b>Russia</b> <b>as</b> an alternative candidate to both incumbent President Boris Yeltsin and his main challenger Gennady Zyuganov of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. However, no formal nomination process was initiated.|$|E

5|$|Since {{establishing}} {{and maintaining the}} structure of the administrative divisions of the federal subjects is not explicitly specified in the Constitution of <b>Russia</b> <b>as</b> the responsibility of the federal government, this task falls within the scope of the responsibilities of the Republic of Adygea itself. Changes to the administrative-territorial structure of the republic are authorized by the State Council.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ultimate}} power officially rested {{with the}} country's {{government in the}} form of Sovnarkom and the Executive Committee (VTSIK) elected by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets (ARCS), the Communist Party was de facto in control in <b>Russia,</b> <b>as</b> acknowledged by its members at the time. By 1918, Sovnarkom began acting unilaterally, claiming a need for expediency, with the ARCS and VTSIK becoming increasingly marginalised, so the soviets no longer had a role in governing Russia. During 1918 and 1919, the government expelled Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from the soviets. Russia had become a one-party state.|$|E

5|$|Anton Rubinstein was {{a famous}} Russian pianist who had lived, {{performed}} and composed in Western and Central Europe before he returned to Russia in 1858. He saw <b>Russia</b> <b>as</b> a musical desert compared to Paris, Berlin and Leipzig, whose music conservatories he had visited. Musical life flourished in those places; composers were held in high regard, and musicians were wholeheartedly devoted to their art. With a similar ideal in mind for Russia, he had conceived {{an idea for a}} conservatory in Russia years before his 1858 return, and had finally aroused the interest of influential people to help him realize the idea.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native <b>Russia</b> <b>as</b> their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{logistical}} problems, the new Polish Commander-in-Chief Jan Krukowiecki, who {{had replaced}} Dembiński in mid-August, ordered a sortie {{on the right}} bank. Like his predecessor, Krukowiecki was a conservative and believed the main aim of the November Uprising was {{the return of the}} status quo ante with the tsars of <b>Russia</b> <b>as</b> kings of Poland, but respecting the constitution and Polish laws. Unlike Skrzynecki, he believed foreign intervention to be unrealistic, and wanted to force the Russians to return to peace talks by defeating the Russian forces, breaking the siege or defeating the assault attempts.|$|E

5|$|In 1919 Horrocks {{was posted}} to <b>Russia</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} Allied {{intervention}} in the Russian Civil War. After landing at Vladivostok on 19 April, he was briefed at British headquarters. The White Army under Admiral Kolchak, {{with the help of}} released Czechoslovak Legion prisoners, had driven the Red Army out of Siberia. However, Kolchak's Czech troops were returning home, and the British military contingent was urgently trying to replace them with Russians. To accomplish this, the British had just two infantry battalions and two small administrative missions, one charged with training and arming the Russians with British war-surplus equipment, and the other with improving the White Army's communications.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most of them, from the thirteenth century onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion domes existed in <b>Russia</b> <b>as</b> early as the thirteenth century, although they presumably could not be widespread. These findings demonstrated that Russian onion domes could not be imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Matlock became {{interested}} in <b>Russia</b> <b>as</b> a Duke University undergraduate, and after studies at Columbia University and a stint as a Russian-language instructor at Dartmouth College, entered the Foreign Service in 1956. His 35-year career encompassed much of the Cold War period between the Soviet Union and the United States. His first assignment to Moscow was in 1961, and {{it was from the}} embassy there that he experienced the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, helping to translate diplomatic messages between the leaders. The next year he was posted to West Africa, and he later served in East Africa, during the post-colonial period of superpower rivalry.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, 2017 the British paper The Guardian {{reported}} {{that hundreds of}} banks had helped launder KGB-related funds out of <b>Russia,</b> <b>as</b> uncovered by an investigation named Global Laundromat. NatWest was listed among the 17 banks in the UK that were “facing questions over what they knew about the international scheme and why they did not turn away suspicious money transfers,” as the bank processed $1.1 million in Laundromat cash. Other banks facing scrutiny under the investigation included HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the long}} term, Tchaikovsky's {{influence}} over the Belyayev composers was not as great. Though they remained more eclectic in their musical approach and focused more on absolute music than The Five had done, they continued writing overall in a style more akin to Rimsky-Korsakov than to Tchaikovsky. Even Glazunov backed away from echoing Tchaikovsky strongly in his mature work, instead amalgamating nationalistic and cosmopolitan styles in an eclectic approach. The Belyayev composers also spread the nationalist musical aesthetic to <b>Russia</b> <b>as</b> a whole and were themselves an influence on composers well into the Soviet era.|$|E

5|$|Stewart {{spent the}} next two years working in <b>Russia</b> <b>as</b> a tutor, {{teaching}} English. He learned the Russian language and wrote a book describing his experiences and the country, Provincial Russia. Returning to England, he took up an appointment as Assistant Lecturer in Classics at the University of Liverpool. In 1912, he accepted a professorship teaching classics at Canterbury College, in Christchurch, New Zealand. At the college, later to become the University of Canterbury, he acquired a reputation for his energy and wit. In his leisure time, he often went climbing in the Southern Alps.|$|E
5|$|The {{energy sector}} is {{represented}} by the Kola Nuclear Power Plant near Polyarnye Zori, which produces about half of all energy, and a network of seventeen hydroelectric and two thermal power stations, generating the other half. The energy surplus, accounting for about 20% of the total generated energy, is transferred to the unified energy system of <b>Russia,</b> <b>as</b> well as exported to Norway and Finland via the NORDEL system.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} {{situation}} reigned in <b>Russia.</b> <b>As</b> early as April 1918, some Romanian volunteer groups joined {{up with the}} Bolshevik Red Army, taking their orders from Commissar Béla Kun, but some of their members continued to serve the nationalist cause. In June 1918, a number of Romanian prisoners who had {{signed up for the}} Volunteer Corps were cut off from Romania by the Russian Civil War and left to fend for themselves. Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia hoping to be repatriated together with the Romanian consulate, while others took to areas controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden. The various groups were monitored by French public opinion, and plans were drafted to merge them into the Romanian Legion on the Western Front, or even to have them open up a new Eastern Front.|$|E
