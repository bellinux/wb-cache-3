5|$|The <b>rail</b> <b>network</b> radiates {{from the}} state capital, Melbourne, with main interstate links to Sydney and to Adelaide, as well as major lines running to {{regional}} centres, upgraded {{as part of the}} Regional Fast Rail project. The <b>rail</b> <b>network</b> reached a peak in 1942 but steadily declined, as branch and cross country lines were closed until the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|From 1936, NSB took {{delivery}} of Class 65 multiple units, replacing El 1 {{as the primary}} hauler on the electrified commuter <b>rail</b> <b>network.</b> Class 65 were the first that were optimized for local traffic, with wide doors and turnable seats. NSB took {{delivery of}} 49 units until 1952, although they were also used outside the commuter <b>rail</b> <b>network.</b> The Østfold Line was upgraded to double track and put into service in four sections: from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924, from OsloØ to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929, from Ljan to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and from Kolbotn to Ski on 14 May 1939. The Østfold Line was also the next line to be electrified, which opened in sections between 1936 and 1940. NSB took into use El 8 locomotives on the line.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{objectivity}} of urban <b>rail</b> transit <b>network</b> evaluation and achieve the sub-file of quality level of preliminary planning, a comprehensive evaluation method for urban <b>rail</b> transit <b>network</b> was proposed based on TOPSIS, then the evaluation model of urban <b>rail</b> transit <b>network</b> was constructed. This method was applied to Xi’an urban <b>rail</b> transit <b>network</b> planning. The result shows that case- 4 is best one among the four urban <b>rail</b> transit <b>network</b> planning of Xi’an and consistent with the passenger flow prediction. The evaluation model for urban <b>rail</b> transit <b>network</b> based on TOPSIS is objective, which involves few parameters, simple operation, science evaluation and provides a basis of decision for urban <b>rail</b> transit <b>network</b> planning...|$|R

5|$|Newport News' {{location}} next to Hampton Roads {{along with}} its <b>rail</b> <b>network</b> has provided advantages for the city.

5|$|The prime rail statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act. The Act {{establishes}} the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure as the integration agency for Victoria's transport system. The Act also establishes {{and sets the}} charters of the State agencies charged with providing public transport rail services and managing network access for freight services, namely the Director of Public Transport and V/Line. In addition, the Act creates VicTrack which owns the public <b>rail</b> <b>network</b> and associated infrastructure. Another important statute is the Rail Management Act 1996 which confers powers on rail operators and provides for a rail access scheme for the State's <b>rail</b> <b>network.</b> As a result of recent changes to the Transport Integration Act, {{the responsibilities of the}} Director of Public Transport are being progressively assumed by the new Public Transport Development Authority, a major initiative of the Bailieu Government.|$|E
5|$|Trolley buses {{gradually}} made way for motor buses {{until the}} last electric tram or bus service ran on 12 July 1963 leaving only the Glenelg tramline as a remnant of a once extensive light <b>rail</b> <b>network.</b> Except for the Glenelg Type H, the trams were sold or scrapped.

5000|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>networks</b> {{often do}} not overbook {{reserved}} seats. With many networks, including the UK and French systems, a contrast is offered between advance-purchase tickets, which do guarantee a (specific) seat and are therefore often non-refundable, and [...] "walk-on" [...] tickets purchased {{on the day of}} travel, which do not; these passengers may be forced to stand or take a tip-up seat in a vestibule. <b>Rail</b> <b>networks</b> face less pressure in this than airlines, which cannot allow passengers to stand. <b>Rail</b> <b>networks</b> accordingly {{often do not}} have a centralised booking system; as passengers can stand, tickets can be sold from automated machines and clerks with no knowledge of how many people intend to board a train. In addition, <b>rail</b> <b>networks</b> {{have to deal with the}} unpredictable nature of season ticket holders, who have purchased a right to make unlimited use of a route; these passengers may often be allowed to join any train but not guaranteed a seat.|$|R

5|$|In May and June 2015 cyclists {{were allowed}} to board the trams with their bikes, during a trial period which was {{supported}} by cycle campaign groups Spokes and Pedal on Parliament. Following this, Edinburgh trams became the first light <b>rail</b> <b>network</b> in the UK to permit the carriage of bikes on a permanent basis, with up to two bicycles being allowed per tram outwith peak hours (7.30am to 9.30am, and 4pm to 6.30pm) and excluding the festival period (7−31 August) and other large events.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main Victorian <b>rail</b> <b>network</b> of the Victorian Railways and successors, a number of narrow gauge private railways and tramways have also existed for logging and mining purposes.
