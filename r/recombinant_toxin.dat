Due {{to the large}} size and poor stability of the proteins, the active recombinant TcdA and TcdB {{have been difficult to}} produce. Results The toxin genes tcdA and tcdB were amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA from a toxigenic strain as a template, and cloned into a shuttle vector pHis 1522. The sequences of both tcdA and tcdB genes in the vector have been verified by DNA sequencing. The constructs were transformed into B. megaterium protoplasts and the protein expression was controlled under a xylose promoter. The <b>recombinant</b> <b>toxins</b> (rTcdA and rTcdB) were purified from bacterial crude extracts.

40|$|Brown spider (Genus Loxosceles) bites are {{normally}} associated with necrotic skin degeneration, gravitational spreading, massive inflammatory response at injured region, platelet aggregation causing thrombocytopenia and renal disturbances. Brown spider venom has a complex composition containing many different toxins, {{of which a}} well-studied component is the dermonecrotic toxin. This toxin alone may produce necrotic lesions, inflammatory response and platelet aggregation. Biochemically, dermonecrotic toxin belongs to a family of toxins with 30 - 35 kDa characterized as sphingomyelinase-D. Here, employing a cDNA library of Loxosceles intermedia venom gland, we cloned and expressed two recombinant isoforms of the dennonecrotic toxin LiRecDT 2 (1062 bp cDNA) and LiRecDT 3 (1007 bp cDNA) that encode for signal peptides and complete mature proteins. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed a structural relationship for these toxins compared to other members of family. Recombinant molecules were expressed as N-terminal His-tag fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and were purified to homogeneity from cell lysates by Ni 2 + chelating chromatography, resulting in proteins of 33. 8 kDa for LiRecDT 2 and 34. 0 kDa for LiRecDT 3. Additional evidence for related toxins containing sequence/epitopes identity comes from antigenic cross-reactivity using antibodies against crude venom toxins and antibodies raised with a purified dennonecrotic <b>toxin.</b> <b>Recombinant</b> <b>toxins</b> showed differential functionality in rabbits: LiRecDT 2 caused a macroscopic lesion with gravitational spreading upon intradermal injection, while LiRecDT 3 evoked transient swelling and erythema upon injection site. Light microscopic analysis of skin biopsies revealed edema, a collection of inflammatory cells in and around blood vessels and a proteinaceous network at the dermis. Moreover, differential functionality for <b>recombinant</b> <b>toxins</b> was also demonstrated by a high sphingomyelinase activity for LiRecDT 2 and low activity for LiRecDT 3 as well as greater in vitro platelet aggregation and blood vessel permeability induced by LiRecDT 2 and residual activity for LiRecDT 3. Cloning and expression of two <b>recombinant</b> dermonecrotic <b>toxins</b> demonstrate an intraspecific family of homologous toxins that act in synergism for deleterious activities of the venom and open possibilities for biotechnological applications for <b>recombinant</b> <b>toxins</b> as research tools for understanding the inflammatory response, vascular integrity and platelet aggregation modulators.

40|$|Many animal toxins may {{target the}} same {{molecules}} {{that need to}} be controlled in certain pathologies; therefore, some toxins have led to the formulation of drugs that are presently used, and many other drugs are still under development. Nevertheless, collecting sufficient toxins from the original source might be a limiting factor in studying their biological activities. Thus, molecular biology techniques have been applied in order to obtain large amounts of <b>recombinant</b> <b>toxins</b> into Escherichia coli. However, most animal toxins are difficult to express in this system, which results in insoluble, misfolded, or unstable proteins. To solve these issues, toxins have been fused with tags that may improve protein expression, solubility, and stability. Among these tags, the SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) {{has been shown to be}} very efficient and can be removed by the Ulp 1 protease. However, removing SUMO is a labor- and time-consuming process. To enhance this system, here we show the construction of a bicistronic vector that allows the expression of any protein fused to both the SUMO and Ulp 1 protease. In this way, after expression, Ulp 1 is able to cleave SUMO and leave the protein interest-free and ready for purification. This strategy was validated through the expression of a new phospholipase D from the spider Loxosceles gaucho and a disintegrin from the Bothrops insularis snake. Both <b>recombinant</b> <b>toxins</b> showed good yield and preserved biological activities, indicating that the bicistronic vector may be a viable method to produce proteins that are difficult to express...|$|R

Several K(v) 1. 3 channel blockers have been characterized from scorpion venom, {{all of which have}} an alpha/beta scaffold stabilized by 3 - 4 intramolecular disulfide bridges. Chemical synthesis is commonly used for producing these disulfide-rich peptides but this approach is time consuming and not cost effective for production of mutants, fusion proteins, fluorescently tagged toxins, or isotopically labelled peptides for NMR studies. Recombinant production of K(v) 1. 3 blockers in the cytoplasm of E. coli generally necessitates oxidative refolding of the peptides in order to form their native disulfide architecture. An alternative approach that avoids the need for refolding is expression of peptides in the periplasm of E. coli but this often produces low yields. Thus, we developed an efficient Pichia pastoris expression system for production of K(v) 1. 3 blockers using margatoxin (MgTx) and agitoxin- 2 (AgTx 2) as prototypic examples. The Pichia system enabled these toxins to be obtained in high yield (12 - 18 mg/L).

40|$|AbstractPnTx 3 - 4 is a toxin {{isolated}} from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer that blocks N-, P/Q-, and R-type voltage-gated calcium channels and has great potential for clinical applications. In this report we used the SUMO system to express large amounts of recombinant PnTx 3 - 4 peptide, which was found in both soluble and insoluble fractions of bacterial extracts. We purified the <b>recombinant</b> <b>toxin</b> from both fractions and showed that the recombinant peptide showed biological activity similar to the native PnTx 3 - 4. In silico analysis of the primary sequence of PnTx 3 - 4 indicated that the peptide conforms to all the criteria of a knottin scaffold. Additionally, circular dichroism spectrum analysis of the recombinant PnTx 3 - 4 predicted that the toxin structure is composed of approximately 53 % turns/unordered, 31 % α-helix and 16 % β-strand, {{which is consistent with}} predicted model of the PnTx 3 - 4 knottin scaffold available at the knottin database ([URL] These studies provide the basis for future large scale production and structure-function investigation of PnTx 3 - 4...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming {{bacterium}} {{that can}} reside in animals and humans. C. difficile infection causes {{a variety of}} clinical symptoms, ranging from diarrhea to fulminant colitis. Disease is mediated by TcdA and TcdB, two large enterotoxins released by C. difficile during colonization of the gut. In this study, we evaluated the ability of <b>recombinant</b> <b>toxin</b> fragments to induce neutralizing antibodies in mice. The protective efficacies {{of the most promising}} candidates were then evaluated in a hamster model of disease. While limited protection was observed with some combinations, coadministration of a cell binding domain fragment of TcdA (TcdA-B 1) and the glucosyltransferase moiety of TcdB (TcdB-GT) induced systemic IgGs which neutralized both toxins and protected vaccinated animals from death following challenge with two strains of C. difficile. Further characterization revealed that despite high concentrations of toxin in the gut lumens of vaccinated animals during the acute phase of the disease, pathological damage was minimized. Assessment of gut contents revealed the presence of TcdA and TcdB antibodies, suggesting that systemic vaccination with this pair of recombinant polypeptides can limit the disease caused by toxin production during C. difficile infection...|$|E
40|$|In the {{previous}} study, rLj-RGD 3, a <b>recombinant</b> <b>toxin</b> protein which contains three RGD motifs, {{was reported to}} not only inhibit the proliferation of an ovarian cancer cell line, HeyA 8 cells, by inducing apoptosis, but also block their adhesion, migration and invasion processes. However, whether rLj-RGD 3 could also suppress the tumor growth in HeyA 8 xenografted mice has not been reported yet. In the present study, rLj-RGD 3 was intraperitoneally injected in the nude mice bearing HeyA 8 tumors. Compared with the control group (normal saline), rLj-RGD 3 inhibited the tumor growth significantly in the HeyA 8 xenografted mice in a dose-dependent manner without affecting their body weights. Based on the H&E, Hoechst 33258 and TUNEL staining assays, as well as western blot analysis, rLj-RGD 3 reduced the weight and volume of the solid tumors, probably by disturbing the tissue structure, inducing apoptosis and suppressing the FAK/PI 3 K/AKT pathway. Most importantly, rLj-RGD 3 was found to prolong the survival days of the ovarian tumor xenografted mice, which suggested rLj-RGD 3 might act as an effective and safe drug to treat ovarian cancer patients...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} type A {{has been}} shown to be the causative agent of a wide variety of enteric diseases in humans and animals, including bovine enterotoxemia. Enterotoxemia is a sudden death syndrome with necro-hemorrhagic lesions in the small intestine, which mainly affects suckling calves and veal calves [Muylaert et al., 2010 Vet. Rec. 167 : 64 – 65]. Predominantly veal calves of beef cattle breeds are affected, and losses due to enterotoxemia may be responsible for up to 20 % of total mortality [Lebrun et al., 2010 Vet. Rec. 167 : 13 – 22, Pardon et al., 2012 BMC Vet. Res. 8 : 26]. Recently, α toxin has been proposed as an essential factor for induction of enterotoxemia in veal calves, which introduces the possibility to use it as a vaccine [Verherstraeten et al., 2013 Vet. Res. 44 : 45]. The use of only the main toxin instead of the whole arsenal of extracellular toxins and enzymes eliminates irrelevant or even immunosuppressive components and therefore may induce a stronger, protective immune response. In this study, we have compared a commercial multivalent vaccine with native α toxin, formalin-inactivated α <b>toxin,</b> and <b>recombinant</b> C-terminal domain of α toxin as vaccine candidates. The native and <b>recombinant</b> α <b>toxin</b> were capable of stimulating higher levels of immune responses compared with the formalin inactivated α toxin and the multivalent vaccine. In addition, the sera from calves immunized with the native and <b>recombinant</b> α <b>toxin</b> also showed higher inhibitory activity against the α toxin in a bioassay. These results suggest that the <b>recombinant</b> α <b>toxin</b> is a potential vaccine candidate against bovine enterotoxemia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBrown spider dermonecrotic toxins (phospholipases-D) are {{the most}} well-characterized {{biochemical}} constituents of Loxosceles spp. venom. Recombinant forms are capable of reproducing most cutaneous and systemic manifestations such as dermonecrotic lesions, hematological disorders, and renal failure. There is currently no direct confirmation for a relationship between dermonecrosis and inflammation induced by dermonecrotic toxins and their enzymatic activity. We modified a toxin isoform by site-directed mutagenesis to determine if phospholipase-D activity {{is directly related to}} these biological effects. The mutated toxin contains an alanine substitution for a histidine residue at position 12 (in the conserved catalytic domain of Loxosceles intermedia <b>Recombinant</b> Dermonecrotic <b>Toxin</b> — LiRecDT 1). LiRecDT 1 H 12 A sphingomyelinase activity was drastically reduced, despite the fact that circular dichroism analysis demonstrated similar spectra for both toxin isoforms, confirming that the mutation did not change general secondary structures of the molecule or its stability. Antisera against whole venom and LiRecDT 1 showed cross-reactivity to both <b>recombinant</b> <b>toxins</b> by ELISA and immunoblotting. Dermonecrosis was abolished by the mutation, and rabbit skin revealed a decreased inflammatory response to LiRecDT 1 H 12 A compared to LiRecDT 1. Residual phospholipase activity was observed with increasing concentrations of LiRecDT 1 H 12 A by dermonecrosis and fluorometric measurement in vitro. Lipid arrays showed that the mutated toxin has an affinity for the same lipids LiRecDT 1, and both toxins were detected on RAEC cell surfaces. Data from in vitro choline release and HPTLC analyses of LiRecDT 1 -treated purified phospholipids and RAEC membrane detergent-extracts corroborate with the morphological changes. These data suggest a phospholipase-D dependent mechanism of toxicity, which has no substrate specificity and thus utilizes a broad range of bioactive lipids...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant streptococcal {{pyrogenic}} exotoxin C (SPE-C) is {{a potent}} superantigen that stimulates VJ 32 -bearing human T cells, but is inactive in mice. SPE-C binds with high affinity to both human HLA-DR and murine I-E molecules, but not to routine I-A molecules in a zincdependent fashion. Competition binding studies with other <b>recombinant</b> <b>toxins</b> revealed that SPE-C lacks the generic low affinity major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (x-chain binding site common to all other bacterial superantigens. Despite this, SPE-C cross-links MHC class II to induce homotypic aggregation of class II-bearing B cells. Nondenaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography revealed that both wild-type and recombinant SPE-C exist in a stable dimer at neutral or alkaline pH. These data support a recent crystal structure of SPE-C and reveal yet another mechanism by which bacterial superantigens ligate and cross-link MHC class II. acterial superantigens (SAgs) 1 produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes simultaneously bind to MHC class II antigens and T cell receptor molecules via the V[3 domain and stimulate large numbers of T cells (1 - 3) ...|$|R
