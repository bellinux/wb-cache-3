5|$|Reaction to the {{character}} varied, with some, including Spider-Man's creator, Stan Lee, approving {{the creation of a}} positive <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> non-white children, to displeasure at the replacement of Peter Parker, with some decrying it as a publicity stunt motivated by political correctness, a charge Alonso denied. Alexandra Petri of The Washington Post called for {{the character}} to be judged on the quality of its stories, which have garnered positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|A {{group that}} opposed the hippie {{movement}} {{managed to keep}} Guldy off the mayoral ballot in 1975. He became a write-in candidate for village trustee, with his friend, poet George Montgomery, running for mayor. Montgomery lost the election to Raivo Puusemp, a sculptor from SoHo. After his election, Puusemp chided Guldy for being a poor <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the village youth. Puusemp was not a native of Rosendale and had not lived there long. By early July 1975, Puusemp had appointed a village dog warden after a dog bit a child and was allowed to run about the streets unrestrained.|$|E

5|$|Comfort, however, {{asserts that}} McClintock was well {{regarded}} by her professional peers, {{even in the}} early years of her career. Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist, Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock. A recent biography for young adults by Naomi Pasachoff, Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics, provides a new perspective, based on the current literature.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{consider}} Lara Croft {{a significant}} game character in popular culture. She holds six Guinness World Records, {{has a strong}} fan following, and is among the first video game characters to be successfully adapted to film. Lara Croft is also considered a sex symbol, {{one of the earliest}} in the industry to achieve widespread attention. The character's influence in the industry has been a point of contention among critics; viewpoints range from a positive agent of change in video games to a negative <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> young girls.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, Coulter {{began dating}} her manager Richard Harrison, and in August 2010, the couple {{went public with}} their relationship. Before meeting Harrison, Coulter was {{considered}} a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> curvy girls and stated that {{she was proud of}} being a size 14 woman. She has since lost over 30 kilograms, which has transformed her into a size 8. The couple announced their engagement in the 7 January 2013 issue of New Idea magazine. After two years of being engaged, Coulter and Harrison married at the Château Bouffémont in Paris, France on 5 August 2015. Coulter appeared {{on the cover of the}} 17 August 2015 issue of New Idea in her wedding dress.|$|E
30|$|The results {{indicated}} that the leadership of supervisors, but not of teachers’, is positively related to the empowering ILT of the VET-students. This is in line with previous research underlining supervisors as central <b>role</b> <b>models</b> <b>for</b> students. The goal of belonging is a driving force in perception and mental representation (Fiske and Taylor 2013), and since VET is intended to prepare students for professional work and not for further studies, the students’ goal of belonging may be more directed toward a future work context, where supervisors at the training companies are prime <b>role</b> <b>models</b> <b>for</b> leadership, than toward an educational context, where teachers at the schools are prime <b>role</b> <b>models</b> <b>for</b> leadership.|$|R

She began her education at a local one-room school, and gained local attention for her softball skill. In order to attend high school, she lived with her older sister in the neighboring town, where the school was located, and then began to drive every day despite being only 14. She graduated from Stanberry High School in 1941, aged 16.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{the first}} openly non-heterosexual {{character}} {{in the history of}} televised Doctor Who. The popularity of the character amongst multiple audiences directly influenced the development of the spin-off series Torchwood. The character became a figure of the British public consciousness, rapidly gaining fame for portrayer John Barrowman. As an ongoing depiction of bisexuality in mainstream British television, the character became a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> young gay and bisexual people in the UK. Jack is featured in various Doctor Who and Torchwood books and has action figures created in his likeness.|$|E
5|$|Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Janet Jackson, {{released}} on September 19, 1989, by A Records. Although label executives wanted material similar to her previous album, Control (1986), Jackson insisted on creating a concept album addressing social issues. Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media, exploring racism, poverty, and substance abuse, in addition to themes of romance. Although its primary concept was met with mixed reactions, its composition received critical acclaim. Jackson came {{to be considered a}} <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> youth because of her socially conscious lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Jenner's gender {{transition}} {{is the subject}} of I Am Cait, initially an eight-part TV documentary series, which premiered on E! in July 2015 to an audience of 2.7 million viewers. Jenner is an executive producer of the show. The show focuses on Jenner's transition and how it affects her relationships with her family and friends. The show also explores how Jenner adjusts to what she sees as her job as a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the transgender community. In October 2015, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2016. The show tied for best Outstanding Reality Program at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history. He has invented {{a completely new}} and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the generations to come.|$|E
5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce {{has long been}} viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up as a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> putting his faith into action. More broadly, {{he has also been}} {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition, and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E

5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with little help from George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible. At all times he was much {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor act as a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> his people. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, died before him in 1817 and so he was succeeded by his younger brother, William.|$|E
5|$|Niels Bohr {{and his son}} Aage, a {{physicist}} who acted as his father's assistant, arrived on 30 December {{on the first of}} several visits as a consultant. Bohr and his family had escaped from occupied Denmark to Sweden. A De Havilland Mosquito bomber brought him to England where he joined Tube Alloys. In America, he was able to visit Oak Ridge and Los Alamos, where he found many of his former students. Bohr acted as a critic, a facilitator and a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> younger scientists. He arrived at a critical time, and several nuclear fission studies and experiments were conducted at his instigation. He {{played an important role in}} the development of the uranium tamper, and in the design and adoption of the modulated neutron initiator. His presence boosted morale, and helped improve the administration of the laboratory to strengthen ties with the Army.|$|E
5|$|Turner marketed Real Adventures {{through a}} {{substantial}} diversity of products, considering its Quest campaign a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> future shows. Galoob acquired figurine licensing rights in 1995 {{and created a}} product line of vehicles, figures, and Micro Machines for fall 1996 release. Turner felt that Galoob's commitment legitimized the Quest marketing plan, and next secured partnership with Pizza Hut and food retailers. Pillsbury included $3mail-in rebates for future Quest videos, display contests, and instant coupon offers on over 20million packages. Campbell Soup Company released six holographic miniature posters on {{the same number of}} SpaghettiOs cans; the posters were awarded in Converting in 1997. General Mills outfitted boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch with offers for T-shirts and other items. Over five thousand Pizza Hut restaurants held a two-month-long give-away of figurines with meals during the show's launch. Galoob failed to build popularity for its toys outside the United States, and discontinued the line in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe {{is widely}} popular in Asia, {{particularly}} Japan. In 2000, TV Asahi {{identified him as}} the swimmer {{likely to be the}} most successful at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, so they selected him as the event's marketing figurehead. In the lead-up, Thorpe visited Japan to promote Asahi in a series of television events, and upon returning for the competition, he was mobbed at the airport by youthful crowds 25m deep; hundreds camped outside the Australian team's hotel. He was also praised by older sections of Japanese society as a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> youth, due to what they interpreted as his humility and work ethic. It was estimated that more than 80% of the Japanese public watched his races on television. In 2002, {{in the wake of a}} tourism slump after 11 September terrorist attacks, Thorpe agreed to be an ambassador for the Australian Tourism Commission in Japan. The high-profile campaign included a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The marketing drive resulted in an upturn in Japanese tourism to Australia, which was credited to Thorpe. In 2005, Yakult released a 'Thorpedo' energy drink—which featured a picture of the swimmer on the bottle—in Japan. This was part of an equity deal with the So Natural food group, in which Thorpe was given a 5% stake in the company—at the time worth A$1.1m—in return for the use of his name and image on their products. The 15-year deal covers East and Southeast Asia and Thorpe's share in the venture could increase to 50% depending on its success.|$|E
