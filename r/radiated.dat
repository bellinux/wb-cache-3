For a star in equilibrium, the energy generated at the core must be at least equal to the energy <b>radiated</b> at the surface.

5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective.

5000|$|Connections {{between the}} {{imperial}} <b>radiate</b> crown and {{the cult of}} Sol are postulated. Augustus was posthumously depicted with <b>radiate</b> crown, as were living emperors from Nero (after AD 65) to Constantine. Some modern scholarship interprets the imperial <b>radiate</b> crown as a divine, solar association rather than an overt symbol of Sol; Bergmann calls it a pseudo-object designed to disguise the divine and solar connotations {{that would otherwise be}} politically controversial but there is broad agreement that coin-images showing the imperial <b>radiate</b> crown are stylistically distinct from those of the solar crown of rays; the imperial <b>radiate</b> crown is depicted as a real object rather than as symbolic light. Hijmans argues that the Imperial <b>radiate</b> crown represents the honorary wreath awarded to Augustus, perhaps posthumously, to commemorate his victory at the battle of Actium; he points out that henceforth, living emperors were depicted with <b>radiate</b> crowns, but state divi were not. To Hijmans this implies the <b>radiate</b> crown of living emperors as a link to Augustus. His successors automatically inherited (or sometimes acquired) the same offices and honours due to Octavian as [...] "saviour of the Republic" [...] through his victory at Actium, piously attributed to Apollo-Helios.

The rotation mechanism of the optical system is a novel solution– there are no electric motors; it uses a revolving magnetic field instead.

5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles.

This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965.

30|$|A <b>radiating</b> {{cable or}} leaky feeder is a coaxial cable where the outer {{conductor}} has been slotted, allowing radiation to occur along the cable length for uniform coverage. Thus, <b>radiating</b> cables {{are used to}} distribute radio waves in sites where common antennas fail, besides being used as part of wireless systems such as radio detection systems and wireless indoor-positioning systems [5, 6]. In recent years, the use of <b>radiating</b> cables has increased especially to provide cellular coverage in train and underground stations for which either macrocell penetration or an indoor distributed antenna system is not suitable. The coverage footprint provided by a <b>radiating</b> cable can normally be better shaped, thus filling in coverage holes in specific corridor scenarios much better than antennas and better containing leakage [3]. As prices are coming down in the manufacturing and installation of <b>radiating</b> cables, indoor radio solutions that include <b>radiating</b> cable are thus a very viable alternative nowadays. However, as stated in [3], antennas are more suitable to provide coverage {{in areas where the}} installation of <b>radiating</b> cables is much harder or unfeasible. On the other hand, the installation of <b>radiating</b> cables is a more sophisticated procedure and more costly than that of antenna installation. If coverage is to be focused on a specific area, the radiation characteristics of directional antennas can be utilized to maximize such coverage in the desired location, something that is much harder to achieve with the use of <b>radiating</b> cables. In summary, although <b>radiating</b> cables are a good alternative for some specific indoor environments such as corridors, there are other instances where antennas still are the preferred choice.|$|R
