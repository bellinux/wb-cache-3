5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to <b>rise</b> <b>at</b> the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|In 1932–33 the English team, led by Douglas Jardine and jointly {{managed by}} Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet, toured Australia {{and won the}} Ashes in an acrimonious contest that {{became known as the}} Bodyline series. The English team used {{contentious}} bowling tactics where the English pace bowlers Harold Larwood, Bill Voce and Bill Bowes bowled the ball roughly on the line of leg stump. The deliveries were often short-pitched, designed to <b>rise</b> <b>at</b> the batsman's body, with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch deflections off the bat. Intended to be intimidating, the tactics proved difficult for batsmen to counter and were physically threatening. The primary target of Bodyline was Donald Bradman, who had overwhelmed the English bowling in the 1930 Ashes series. Leading English cricketers and administrators feared that Bradman would be unstoppable on good Australian batting wickets in 1932–33, and looked for possible weaknesses in his batting technique.|$|E

5|$|Leading the 2008 Texas Longhorn {{football}} team, McCoy and the Longhorns {{began the}} season with eight straight wins, including a win over then #1 Oklahoma, #6 Oklahoma State and #11 Missouri. His performance helped the Longhorns <b>rise</b> <b>at</b> one point to the #1 ranking in the national polls, although UT lost to Texas Tech University and finished ranked third in the BCS standings. In 2008 McCoy set school records for most career touchdown passes, most touchdown passes in a season, most total touchdowns by a Texas player, most career wins, and most career passing yards. In addition to setting passing records, McCoy led the team with 561 yards rushing and eleven rushing touchdowns, establishing {{a reputation as a}} dual threat quarterback. McCoy was named the 2008 AP Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Solsticial {{alignments}} {{also can}} be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the Island of the Sun (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in Lake Titicaca, the Sun was seen to <b>rise</b> <b>at</b> the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the Inca ruling elite. Ordinary pilgrims stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.|$|E
5|$|The planned {{buildings}} {{included a}} government center occupying all of Wallace Field, which extends from Rizal Park {{to the present}} Taft Avenue. The Philippine Capitol was to <b>rise</b> <b>at</b> the Taft Avenue end of the field, facing toward the sea. Along with buildings for various government bureaus and departments, it would form a quadrangle with a lagoon {{in the center and}} a monument to José Rizal {{at the other end of}} the field. Of Burnham's proposed government center, only three units—the Legislative Building and the buildings of the Finance and Agricultural Departments—were completed when World War II erupted.|$|E

5|$|The two tallest {{buildings}} of the Dayton skyline are the Kettering Tower at 408ft (124m) and the KeyBank Tower at 385ft (117m). Kettering Tower was originally Winters Tower, the headquarters of Winters Bank, and the building was renamed when Winters merged with BankOne. KeyBank Tower was {{formerly known as the}} MeadWestvaco Tower before KeyBank gained naming rights to the building in 2008. Dayton is the site of five skyscrapers that <b>rise</b> <b>at</b> least 328ft (100m) in height. The most recently completed high-rise in the city is the Miami Valley Hospital Southeast Tower, which was constructed in 2010 and rises 246feet (75m).|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of horse}} and foot {{soldiers}} {{immersed in a}} sea of spears and lances populate the foreground. The two armies are distinguished by their dress, anachronistic though it is: whereas Alexander's men clad themselves and their horses in full suits of heavy armour, many of Darius' wear turbans and ride naked mounts. The bodies of the many fallen soldiers lie underfoot. A front of Macedonian warriors in the centre pushes against the crumbling enemy force, who flee the battlefield on the far left. The Persian king joins his army on his chariot of three horses, and is narrowly pursued by Alexander and his uniformly attired Companion cavalry. The tract of soldiers continues down the gently sloped battlefield to the campsite and cityscape by the water, gravitating toward the mountainous <b>rise</b> <b>at</b> the scene's centre.|$|E
5|$|Vega {{can often}} be seen near the zenith in the mid-{{northern}} latitudes during the evening in the Northern Hemisphere summer. From mid-southern latitudes, {{it can be seen}} low above the northern horizon during the Southern Hemisphere winter. With a declination of +38.78°, Vega can only be viewed at latitudes north of 51°S. Therefore, it does not <b>rise</b> <b>at</b> all anywhere in Antarctica or in the southernmost part of South America, including Punta Arenas, Chile (53°S). At latitudes to the north of +51°N, Vega remains continually above the horizon as a circumpolar star. Around July 1, Vega reaches midnight culmination when it crosses the meridian at that time.|$|E
50|$|The Pipp Brook is a left-bank {{tributary}} of the River Mole, Surrey, England that descends steeply northward then flows east. It <b>rises</b> <b>at</b> two main springs in the Greensand Ridge, receives the Milton Brook which <b>rises</b> <b>at</b> a tri-forked source lower than its own, turns east descending less rapidly before discharging approximately half-way along the Mole's meandering northward course.|$|R

5|$|With the {{precedent}} {{set by the}} towers of Canary Wharf and with the encouragement of former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, a renewed trend for building tall {{has been established in}} recent years. As of September 2016, there were 79 structures under construction or proposed in London that will <b>rise</b> <b>at</b> least 100 metres in height, including the South Bank tower, which has been increased in height by 11 storeys, architecturally topping out in 2016. 1 Undershaft, planned to form the centrepiece of the City of London's skyscraper cluster, is the tallest skyscraper currently proposed for London. Also in the City, a skyscraper at 100–112 Leadenhall Street, to be designed by SOM architects, is {{in the early stages of}} design and planning.|$|E
5|$|At first, the laborers {{walked the}} seven {{kilometers}} from Auschwitz I {{to the plant}} each day, but as this meant they had to <b>rise</b> <b>at</b> 03:00, many arrived exhausted and unable to work. The camp at Monowitz (also called Monowitz-Buna or Auschwitz III) was constructed and began housing inmates on 30 October 1942, the first concentration camp to be financed and built by private industry. In January 1943 the ArbeitsausbildungLager (labor education camp) was moved from the parent camp to Monowitz. These prisoners were also forced {{to work on the}} building site. The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks per hour for unskilled workers, four for skilled workers. Although the camp administrators expected the prisoners to work at 75 percent of the capacity of a free worker, the inmates were only able to perform 20 to 50 percent as well. Site managers constantly threatened inmates with transportation to Birkenau for death in the gas chambers as a way to try to increase productivity. Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Birkenau reduced the prisoner population of Monowitz by nearly a fifth each month; numbers were made up with new arrivals. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. Though the factory had been expected to begin production in 1943, shortages of labor and raw materials meant start-up had to be postponed repeatedly. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945.|$|E
