40|$|Aim To explore {{successional}} processes {{associated with}} <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> expansion in Eucalyptus-dominated woodland savanna vegetation in north-eastern Australia. Location Iron Range National Park and environs, northeast Queensland, Australia. This remote region supports probably the largest extent of lowland (< 300 m) rainforest remnant in Australia. Rainfall (c. 1700 mm p. a.) occurs mostly between November and June, with some rain typically occurring {{even in the}} driest months July-October. Methods (1) Sampling of <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> seedling distributions, and other vegetation structural attributes, in fifteen 10 x 10 m quadrats distributed equi-distantly between mature <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> margins (range: 70 - 840 m), at each of 10 sites which were open-canopied vegetation in 1943. (2) Assessment of relationships between <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> seedling densities and structural characteristics, including distance-to-rain forest-margin, canopy height, stem density. (3) Assessment of lifeform and dispersal spectra for defined vegetation structural types. Results Rates of <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> invasion {{were found to be}} substrate-mediated. Transects established on hematite schist, diorite, riverine alluvium, and granite developed closed canopies (termed phase III sites) by 1991. The remainder (four transects on poorly drained colluvial/alluvial sediments; one on dune sands) continued to occur either as grassy woodland (phase I), or with developing <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> understoreys (phase II). <b>Rain</b> <b>forest</b> seedlings were observed at maximum sampled distances from mature <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> margins at all sites. Lifeform and dispersal spectra data illustrated that: (1) the proportions of woodland trees, shrubs and graminoids declined with successional phase, with concomitant increases in <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> primary trees and all other lifeform categories save <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> trees; (2) the proportions of major dispersal syndromes did not vary between successional phases, neither for <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> nor woodland taxa. Main conclusions <b>Rain</b> <b>forest</b> seedling distribution data for phases I and II sites illustrate three successional processes: margin extension - seedling density significantly negatively correlated with distance from mature <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> margins at two sites; nucleation - seedling densities significantly positively correlated with tall trees at two sites; and irruption - seedling densities at two sites neither correlated with distance from mature <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> margins, nor with measured vegetation structural features. The observation of irruptive <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> regeneration at these sites, combined with decadal-scale <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> canopy development at the five remaining sites, illustrates that under conditions conducive to growth (moisture, substrate), low fire disturbance, and maintenance of diverse dispersal processes (high frugivore richness), <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> can rapidly invade regional landscapes...|$|R

5|$|The {{evergreen}} {{forests in}} Wayanad mark the transition zone between {{the northern and}} southern ecologic regions of the Western Ghats. The southern ecologic regions are generally wetter and more species-rich. At lower elevations are the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, with Cullenia the characteristic tree genus, accompanied by teak, dipterocarps, and other trees. The moist forests transition to the drier South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests, which lie in its rain shadow to the east.

40|$|Tropical <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> {{expansion}} and savanna woody vegetation thickening {{appear to be}} a global trend, but there remains uncertainty about whether there is a common set of global drivers. Using geographic information techniques, we analyzed aerial photography of five areas in the humid tropics of northeastern Queensland, Australia, taken in the 1950 s and 2008, to determine if changes in <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> extent match those reported for the Australian monsoon tropics using similar techniques. Mapping of the 1950 s aerial photography showed that of the combined study area (64, 430 ha), 63 % was classified as eucalypt forests/woodland and 37 % as <b>rain</b> <b>forest.</b> Our mapping revealed that although most boundaries remained stable, there was a net increase of 732 ha of the original <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> area over the study period, and negligible conversion of <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> to eucalypt forest/woodland. Statistical modeling, controlling for spatial autocorrelation, indicated distance from preexisting <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> as the strongest determinant of <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> expansion. Margin extension had a mean rate across the five sites of 0. 6 m per decade. Expansion was greater in tall open forest types but also occurred in shorter, more flammable woodland vegetation types. No correlations were detected with other local variables (aspect, elevation, geology, topography, drainage). Using a geographically weighted mean rate of <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> margin extension across the whole region, we predict that over 25 % of tall open forest (a forest type of high conservation significance) would still remain after 2000 years of <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> expansion. This slow replacement is due to the convoluted nature of the <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> boundary and the irregular shape of the tall open forest patches. Our analyses point to the increased concentration of atmospheric CO 2 as the most likely global driver of indiscriminate <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> expansion occurring in northeastern Australia, by increasing tree growth and thereby overriding the effects of fire disturbance...|$|R

40|$|Aim To explore {{rates of}} <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> {{expansion}} and associated ecological correlates in Eucalyptus-dominated woodland savanna vegetation in north-eastern Australia, {{over the period}} 1943 - 91. Location Iron Range National Park and environs, north-east Queensland, Australia. This remote region supports probably the largest extent of lowland ( 60 %) over distances up to 1500 m from mature <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> margins; on less favourable substrates (diorite, granites), probability of expansion was negligible at sites more than 400 m from mature margins. Main conclusions (i) <b>Rain</b> <b>forest</b> expansion was associated primarily with release from burning pressure from c. the 1920 s, following major disruption of customary Aboriginal lifestyles including hunting and burning practices. (ii) Decadal-scale expansion of <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> at Iron Range supports extensive observations from the palaeoecological literature concerning rapid <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> invasion under conducive environmental conditions.

40|$|Although <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> is {{characterized}} as pyrophobic, pyrophilic giant eucalypts grow as <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> emergents in both temperate and tropical Australia. In temperate Australia, such eucalypts depend on extensive, infrequent fires to produce conditions suitable for seedling growth. Little is known, however, about constraints on seedlings of tropical giant eucalypts. We tested whether seedlings of Eucalyptus grandis experience edaphic constraints {{similar to their}} temperate counterparts. We hypothesized that phosphorous addition would alleviate edaphic constraints. We grew seedlings in a factorial experiment combining fumigation (to simulate nutrient release and soil pasteurization by fire), soil type (E. grandis <b>forest</b> versus <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> soil) and phosphorus addition as factors. We found that phosphorus was the principal factor limiting E. grandis seedling survival and growth in <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> soil, and that fumigation enhanced survival of seedlings in both E. grandis <b>forest</b> and <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> soil. We conclude that similar to edaphic constraints on temperate giant eucalypts, mineral nutrient and biotic attributes of a tropical <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> soil may hamper E. grandis seedling establishment. In <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> soil, E. grandis seedlings benefited from conditions akin to a fire-generated ashbed (i. e., an "ashbed effect") ...|$|R
40|$|Premise of research.  <b>Rain</b> <b>forest</b> {{ecosystems}} globally are {{synonymous with}} biodiversity, yet these vegetation communities vary widely in structure and composition. Historical biogeography and environment {{are thought to}} have significantly impacted Australian <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> diversity and composition. <b>Rain</b> <b>forest</b> in Australia is extensively fragmented, and detailed vegetation mapping is used as a tool for conservation and land management planning. In Queensland, a regional ecosystem (RE) vegetation classification scheme is used by land managers. However, there has been no assessment to date of how evenly <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> RE types are conserved at a regional scale, whether those conserved are the best representatives of biodiversity, and whether there are significantly distinctive RE types that are relatively poorly conserved or not recognized for their significance to biodiversity conservation. Methodology.  Our phylogeny for South East Queensland (SEQ) <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> species, which encompasses 95 % of <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> species based on a unified three-marker DNA barcode, along with species lists were used for assessment of both species richness and phylogenetic diversity of RE types. We mapped the distribution of the most diverse and the most distinctive <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> ecosystem types. Pivotal results.  We found that there is enormous variation in phylogenetic diversity within and among <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> RE types in SEQ, with some depauperate in species richness. We identified the <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> RE types in SEQ containing the highest diversity as well as those significantly sampling a wide part of the SEQ <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> species pool compared with other RE types with similar species richness. Conclusions.  This study confirms that different RE types are not equivalent and so should not be considered as such in any conservation planning processes. Conservation assessment of ecosystems needs to take into account distinctiveness and diversity among types in order to gain better representativeness and complementarity across all RE types...|$|R

5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the wet season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E
40|$|Aim To explore: (1) the {{relative}} influences of site conditions, especially moisture relations, on pathways {{and rates of}} monsoon <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> seedling and sapling regeneration, especially of canopy dominants, in northern Australia; and (2) contrasts between regeneration syndromes of dominant woody taxa in savannas and monsoon <b>rain</b> <b>forest.</b> Location Four monsoon <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> sites, representative of regional major habitat and vegetation types, in Kakadu National Park, northern Australia. Methods A decadal study involved: (1) initial assessment over 2. 5 years to explore within-year variability in seed rain, dormant seed banks and seedling (< 50 cm height) dynamics; and (2) thereafter, monitoring of seedling and sapling (50 cm height to 5 cm d. b. h.) dynamics undertaken annually in the late dry season. On the basis of observations from this and other studies, regeneration syndromes of dominant monsoon <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> taxa are contrasted with comparable information for dominant woody savanna taxa, Eucalyptus and Corymbia especially. Results Key observations from the monsoon <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> regeneration dynamics study component are that: (1) peak seed rain inputs of <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> taxa were observed in the wet season at perennially moist sites, whereas inputs at seasonally dry sites extended into, or peaked in, the dry season; (2) dormant soil seed banks of woody <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> taxa were dominated by pioneer taxa, especially figs; (3) longevity of dormant seed banks of woody monsoon <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> taxa, including figs, was expended within 3 years; (4) seedling recruitment of monsoon <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> woody taxa was derived mostly from wet season seed rain with limited inputs from soil seed banks; (5) at all sites <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> seedling mortality occurred mostly in the dry season; (6) <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> seedling and sapling densities were consistently greater at moist sites; (7) recruitment from clonal reproduction was negligible, even following unplanned low intensity fires. Main conclusions By comparison with dominant savanna eucalypts, dominant monsoon <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> taxa recruit substantially greater stocks of seedlings, but exhibit slower aerial growth and development of resprouting capacity in early years, lack lignotubers in mesic species, and lack capacity for clonal reproduction. The reliance on sexual as opposed to vegetative reproduction places monsoon <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> taxa at significant disadvantage, especially slower growing species on seasonally dry sites, given annual-biennial fires in many north Australian savannas...|$|R

5|$|The normal {{reaction}} of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding, falling, swimming, running, jumping, burrowing or rolling, {{according to the}} animal's capabilities. Escape paths are often erratic, {{making it difficult for}} the predator to predict which way the prey will go next: for example, birds such as snipe, ptarmigan and black-headed gulls evade fast raptors such as peregrine falcons with zigzagging or jinking flight. In the tropical <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and gliding. Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the sonar clicks of bats. Among fish, the stickleback follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating merganser duck.|$|E
