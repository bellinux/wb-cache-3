5|$|In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, {{a veteran}} of World War I and a history buff, began searching the strait for <b>remains</b> of the battle. In 1932 he found the <b>remains</b> of Royal Savages hull, which he {{successfully}} raised in 1934. Stored for more than fifty years, the <b>remains</b> were sold by his son to the National Civil War Museum. As of March 2009, the <b>remains</b> were in a city garage in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The city of Plattsburgh, New York, has claimed ownership of the <b>remains</b> and would like them returned to upstate New York.|$|E
5|$|The charred <b>remains</b> {{were found}} by the Soviets. By 11 May, Hitler's dentist, Hugo Blaschke, dental {{assistant}} Käthe Heusermann and dental technician Fritz Echtmann confirmed that the dental <b>remains</b> belonged to Hitler and Braun. The Soviets secretly buried the <b>remains</b> at the SMERSH compound in Magdeburg, East Germany, along with the bodies of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their six children. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team with detailed burial charts secretly exhumed five wooden boxes of <b>remains.</b> The <b>remains</b> were thoroughly burned and crushed, after which the ashes were thrown into the Biederitz river, {{a tributary of the}} nearby Elbe.|$|E
5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} <b>remains</b> of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's <b>remains</b> were interred later than the others {{due to the fact}} that he was buried in Milan. Thus, the diocese had to apply for permission to allow for some of his <b>remains</b> to be transported back to Hong Kong; the request was eventually granted.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} were made to locate the <b>remains</b> of Yagan's body, which were believed to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of Belhus. A remote sensing survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no <b>remains</b> were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful. Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that Dreamtime spirits can reunite the <b>remains.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also {{on display}} are the <b>remains</b> of the {{elaborate}} hypocaust heating system, which served the sweat rooms.|$|E
5|$|Although {{commercial}} {{areas are}} growing rapidly, agriculture <b>remains</b> {{a foundation of}} the economy in the rural areas of the southern part of El Hatillo. The business sector <b>remains</b> mostly underdeveloped, causing heavy employee movement {{in and out of the}} municipality – a problem that has made the transportation infrastructure of El Hatillo very congested.|$|E
5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of <b>remains</b> from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal <b>remains</b> from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal <b>remains</b> at Trinidad. Artefact <b>remains</b> found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Any building, {{structure}} or work {{above or below}} the surface of the land, any cave or excavation; any site comprising the <b>remains</b> of any such building, {{structure or}} work or any cave or excavation; and any site comprising or comprising the <b>remains</b> of any vehicle, vessel or aircraft or other movable structure or part thereof... (Section 61 (7)).|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were <b>remains</b> of shellfish, which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} dry land was once under the sea. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the <b>remains</b> of shellfish. However, in both cases, the fossils were complete <b>remains</b> of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.|$|E

5|$|At {{the request}} of Natalee's father, Alabama judge Alan King {{declared}} Holloway legally dead in absentia on January 12, 2012. On August 16, 2017, Holloway's father announced that he and a private investigator had recently discovered human <b>remains</b> {{and that they were}} being DNA-tested to determine whether they belonged to his daughter. Final results revealed that the human <b>remains</b> did not belong to Natalee.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the former}} casino {{building}} was completed, in 1908, Agustín Ross Edwards and Evaristo Merino reported to historiographer José Toribio Medina {{the existence of}} indigenous <b>remains</b> in the cave now called the Gruta de la Virgen. Medina asked Argentinean ethnographer Félix Faustino Outes to inspect the <b>remains,</b> and subsequently Medina wrote the book Los Restos Indígenas de Pichilemu (The Indigenous <b>Remains</b> of Pichilemu), using the report Faustino Outes gave him.|$|E
5|$|Berlin {{surrendered}} on 2 May. Records in the Soviet archives obtained {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union state that the <b>remains</b> of Hitler, Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, the six Goebbels children, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg. The <b>remains</b> from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the Elbe. According to Kershaw, the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army found them, and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler's <b>remains.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bobcat <b>remains</b> have {{occasionally}} {{been found}} in the resting sites of male fishers.|$|E
5|$|Bregowine died in 764 and was {{originally}} {{buried in the}} baptistry in Canterbury, but his <b>remains</b> were moved to the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1123. This followed an attempt in around 1121 to remove his <b>remains</b> to another monastery, which came to nothing. The <b>remains</b> were placed by the altar of St Gregory in the south transept, after having been briefly placed in the north transept. Bregowine was later considered a saint, with a feast day of 26August, although Florence of Worcester, a 12th-century writer, recorded his death date as 24August. Other sources record the death date as 25August. His life was later written by Eadmer in the 12thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Buildings from Bath's pre-Norman period either {{no longer}} exist, or their <b>remains</b> are below street level. Archaeological {{sites in the}} central area of the city have {{supplied}} some details about how they may have looked, while the lower areas of the Roman Baths reveal significant <b>remains</b> from the Roman period.|$|E
5|$|By October 2, 2001, {{the search}} for {{evidence}} and <b>remains</b> was complete and the site {{was turned over to}} Pentagon officials. In 2002, the <b>remains</b> of 25 victims were buried collectively at Arlington National Cemetery, with a five-sided granite marker inscribed with the names of all the victims in the Pentagon. The ceremony also honored the five victims whose <b>remains</b> were never found.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} <b>remains,</b> the body of Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead. Emma Restall Orr, a neo-druid, has questioned whether the body should be displayed at all. This {{is part of a}} wider discussion about the scientific treatment of human <b>remains</b> and museum researchers and archaeologists using them as information sources.|$|E

5|$|Few dinosaur <b>remains</b> {{have been}} found in Scandinavia. The {{mainland}} of western Denmark is an unlikely region to find dinosaur <b>remains,</b> since the Mesozoic sediments there are marine Maastrichtian chalk. Fossils of non-dinosaurian marine animals, including mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, {{have been found}} in these deposits. Mesozoic deposits in Scania, Sweden, are much richer in fossils, including those of dinosaurs. The Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea was part of the same land mass as Scania (the Scandinavian-Russian continent), and has a similar geology. The southwestern part of the island is the only place in Denmark which has yielded dinosaur <b>remains.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flight 710 was {{the second}} fatal and {{write-off}} accident of a Dash 7, and <b>remains</b> the deadliest. It {{was at the time}} the third-deadliest aviation accident in Norwegian history, after the 1961 Holtaheia Vickers Viking crash and Braathens SAFE Flight 239 in 1972. It has since become the fourth-deadliest by Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801. It <b>remains</b> the deadliest accident in Northern Norway.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a return}} by Pakistan in 1992, England toured the West Indies {{over the winter}} of 1993–94. The teams met March 25 at the Queen's Park Oval and England were reduced to 46 all-out by Curtly Ambrose. It <b>remains</b> the lowest total made in a Test match at the ground, and with 66 wickets Ambrose <b>remains</b> the most {{successful}} bowler there.|$|E
5|$|Following the drilling, a hole {{opens up}} in the object's {{interior}} wall. Inside, Quatermass and the others find the <b>remains</b> of insect-like aliens resembling giant three-legged locusts, with stubby antennae on their heads giving the impression of horns. As Quatermass and Roney examine the <b>remains,</b> they theorise the aliens {{may have come from}} a planet habitable five million years ago– Mars.|$|E
5|$|Funerary art is {{any work}} of art forming, or placed in, a {{repository}} for the <b>remains</b> of the dead. The term also encompasses cenotaphs ("empty tombs"), tomb-like monuments which do not contain human remains; and communal memorials to the dead (such as war memorials), {{which may or may}} not contain human <b>remains.</b>|$|E

5|$|His grave bears a one-word epitaph: Undefeated. It is {{understood}} {{that after the}} war, Hans-Joachim Marseille's <b>remains</b> were brought from Derna and reinterred in the memorial gardens at Tobruk; {{it was there that}} his mother visited his grave in 1954. His <b>remains</b> are now in a small clay coffin (sarcophagus) bearing the number 4133.|$|E
