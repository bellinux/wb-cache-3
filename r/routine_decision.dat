Specifically the paper focuses on professionals' assessments of whether patients {{are at increased risk}} of inheriting a gene that predisposes the individual to developing cancer. By analysing professionals' talk and actions whilst assessing risk, the paper develops an understanding of both routine and complex decision making. Whilst some decisions were unproblematic, {{there were a number of}} situations in which geneticists appear to challenge the decision rules. Such situations occur when faced with a borderline case, an interesting case, when the patient appears particularly anxious or when the rules themselves are judged to be inadequate. Whilst decision support technologies are able to assist clinical decision making they are not relied upon by geneticists above and beyond their own knowledge. Thus, when knowledge is uncertain the decisions that clinicians make are not a consequence of the standard application of scientific protocols but are locally determined according to experience, circumstance and case. This suggests that the transfer of decision support technologies to general practice or to the general public are unlikely to be effective, given the importance of clinical experience to the risk assessment process...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{question}} the widely, if tacitly, held perspective that exceptional and immensely publicized instances {{of child abuse}} and neglect offer little guidance or understanding in improving the efficacy of child protective services (CPS). Using insights from Carl Jung, Max Weber and Henry Mintzberg, we argue that not only do such archetypical cases and the attendant moral outrage serve as catalysts for legislative and judicial actions; they also motivate structural and procedural changes in CPS operations. We propose extending to CPS a risk model commonly considered in the fields of environmental science, food safety and chemical engineering, where risk is conceptualized as a function of both technical hazard and moral outrage. We point out, however, that unlike in these non-CPS fields where the typical response is to 'manage' outrage via public education or public relations campaigns and to allow outrage to influence only the more immediate and exceptional decisions following an outrageous event, in the CPS field where children are the focal point, exceptional decision processes also seep into <b>routine</b> <b>decision</b> making by necessity.

40|$|The {{debate on}} the {{benefits}} of trust or distrust in groups has generated a substantial amount of research that points to the positive aspects of trust in groups, and generally characterizes distrust as a negative group phenomenon. Therefore, many researchers and practitioners assume that trust is inherently good and distrust is inherently bad. However, recent counterintuitive evidence obtained from face-to-face (FtF) groups indicates that the opposite might be true; trust can prove detrimental, and distrust instrumental, to decision-making in groups. By extending this argument to virtual teams (VTs), we examined the value of distrust for VTs completing routine and non-routine decision tasks, and showed that the benefits of distrust can extend to short-term VTs. Specifically, VTs seeded with distrust significantly outperformed all control groups in a non-routine decision-making task. In addition, we present quantitative evidence to show that the decision task itself can significantly affect the overall levels of trust/distrust within VTs. In addition to its practical and research implications, the theoretical contribution of our study is that it extends to a group level, and then to a VT setting, a theory of distrust previously tested in the psychology literature in the context of completing non-routine and <b>routine</b> <b>decision</b> tasks at an individual level. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

40|$|PURPOSE Technology could {{transform}} <b>routine</b> <b>decision</b> making by anticipating patients’ information needs, assessing where patients are with decisions and preferences, personalizing educational experiences, facilitating patient-clinician information exchange, and supporting follow-up. This study evaluated whether patients and clinicians will use {{such a decision}} module {{and its impact on}} care, using 3 cancer screening decisions as test cases. METHODS Twelve practices with 55, 453 patients using a patient portal participated in this prospective observational cohort study. Participation was open to patients who might face a cancer screening decision: women aged 40 to 49 who had not had a mammogram in 2 years, men aged 55 to 69 who had not had a prostate-specific antigen test in 2 years, and adults aged 50 to 74 overdue for colorectal cancer screening. Data sources included module responses, electronic health record data, and a postencounter survey. RESULTS In 1 year, one-fifth of the portal users (11, 458 patients) faced a potential cancer screening decision. Among these patients, 20. 6 % started and 7. 9 % completed the decision module. Fully 47. 2 % of module completers shared responses with their clinician. After their next office visit, 57. 8 % of those surveyed thought their clinician had seen their responses, and many reported the module made their appointment more productive (40. 7 %), helped engage them in the decision (47. 7 %), broadened their knowledge (48. 1 %), and improved communication (37. 5 %).

40|$|Background: Acquiring and {{discarding}} {{objects are}} <b>routine</b> <b>decision</b> processes for most people. Despite the ubiquitous {{need to make}} such decisions, {{little is known about}} how they are made and what goes wrong when individuals acquire and fail to discard so many items that many areas of their home become unlivable (i. e., clinical hoarding). We hypothesize that clinical hoarding reflects a normal variation in the tendency to acquire and retain objects, only just at a more extreme level. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we examined 89 nonclinical, undergraduate students ’ performance on a novel experimental paradigm that measures decisions about acquiring and discarding everyday objects. To test our hypothesis, and validate our task as a possible research tool for studying hoarding, we related decisions on the task to a variety of measures known to correlate with clinical hoarding. The paradigm was sensitive to individual differences, as subjects varied widely in the quantity of objects they chose to acquire and retain under an increasing pressure to discard. In addition, we replicated expected relationships from the clinical hoarding literature between acquisition and retention tendencies and self-report measures of hoarding, indecisiveness, and obsessive-compulsive behavior. Results: Our data suggest that decisions about objects, even in a nonclinical undergraduate population, vary widely and are influenced by the same variables that influence clinical hoarding, but to a less extreme degree. Conclusions: Future research with this experimental task can separately investigate the role of acquisition, retention, impulsivity, and sensitivity to constraints in clinical hoarding to inform our understanding of this disorder.

40|$|Decisions {{processes}} are {{the glue that}} binds together the information and material ® ow networks in an organization. Decisions about what information to collect and how to process it determine how information ® ows into an information network at the points where this network originates on the material ® ow network. Similarly, decisions about how to use information and what actions to take on material ® ows determine how information will impact those material ® ows at points where the information network points into the material ® ow network. Thus, a critical aspect of creating useful simulation models is appropriately modeling decision processes. Increasingly, decision making is automated as computers take over more <b>routine</b> <b>decision</b> making activities in business processes, but many decisions continue {{to be made by}} humans.
