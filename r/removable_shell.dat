50|$|Georg Christian Carl Henschel {{founded the}} factory in 1810 at Kassel. His son Carl Anton Henschel founded another factory in 1837. In 1848, {{the company began}} {{manufacturing}} locomotives. The factory became the largest locomotive manufacturer in Germany by the 20th century. Henschel built 10 articulated steam trucks, using Doble steam designs, for Deutsche Reichsbahn railways as delivery trucks. Several cars were built as well, one of which became Hermann GÃ¶ring's staff car. In 1935 Henschel was able to upgrade its various steam locomotives to a high-speed Streamliner type with a maximum speeds of up to 140 km/h {{by the addition of}} a <b>removable</b> <b>shell</b> over the old steam locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The Nokia Lumia 525 {{launched}} as {{the successor}} to the Nokia Lumia 520 with nearly the same specifications and appearance. The Lumia 525 doubles the RAM from 512 MB to 1 GB, therefore making it compatible with more demanding games and apps. The back shell is also now glossy instead of matte. It is offered in black, white, orange, and yellow colors which can be swapped via <b>removable</b> <b>shells.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Lumia 950 XL has a {{polycarbonate}} {{frame with}} a <b>removable</b> back <b>shell,</b> allowing {{access to the}} battery as well as SIM and microSD card slots. The phone is available in two colors, black and white, although third-party replacement shells are available in different colors and materials.|$|R
50|$|For {{the safety}} equipment, all DTM cars seating uses <b>removable</b> carbon-fibre <b>shell</b> driver's seat with 6-point seat belts. The {{steering}} wheel of all DTM cars are free design per one manufacturer with multiple buttons (similar to Formula One). All DTM cars are also equipped with Bosch Motorsport DDU 8 data display units since 2012 season.|$|R
50|$|The phone {{features}} {{a range of}} back 'Shells' which will allow users to customize the look of their phone as well as adding functionality such as wireless charging (with {{the addition of a}} separate accessory case). A <b>removable</b> rear <b>shell</b> gives the device the benefit of easy replaceability (particularly in instances of damage). Action keys (volume, power and dedicated camera key) reside on the right, with a 3.5mm headphone jack mounted atop the device, and Micro-USB port at its base.|$|R
5000|$|The Ion {{is notable}} for being highly customizable: it is {{sheathed}} in a <b>removable</b> polymer <b>shell,</b> which comes {{in several different}} colors. This shell can also be replaced with aftermarket [...] "body kits" [...] to change {{the appearance of the}} Ion, similar to the kits available for the Tippmann A5 marker and others. These body kits also affect the performance of the gun and accessibility of the bolt. Body kits such as the lucky and deadlywinds are BOB ( [...] bolt out the back) allow for easy access and cleaning of the bolt. In addition to these body kits, several aftermarket replacement parts (such as triggers and feednecks) are available.|$|R
50|$|Miche Base Bags were {{available}} in four sizes and various colors. Base Bags featured different internal pocket layouts and <b>removable</b> handles. <b>Shells</b> could be purchased separately or with a Base Bag, and attached to the Base Bag using magnets. The exteriors of the Classic and Petite Base Bags incorporated a silk and polyester blend in their hard-sided construction, while the Demi and Prima sizes were made of softer materials. Shell materials varied depending on the style, but were generally made from faux leather, canvas or cotton. The Miche line also included other specialty bags that were not interchangeable as well as coin purses and wallets. New Shells and accessories were released monthly.|$|R
50|$|Some {{acoustic}} {{problems were}} soon observed in Severance Hall shortly after its opening. These were attributed {{in part to}} the use of velvet curtains for the boxes, thick carpeting throughout much of the hall, {{and the fact that the}} stage, designed for theatrical productions, had a large, sound-absorbing fly space above it. In addition, the <b>removable</b> stage <b>shells</b> created for the orchestra to play within were constructed of non-sound-reflective materials, which also allowed sound from the hall's original organ to be heard from its position above the stage's fly space. The 6,025-pipe Ernest M. Skinner organ was a massive instrument for its day, but its positioning outside the auditorium itself was something of an experiment and limited choices for addressing the auditorium's dry acoustics.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} {{generation}} N60 series Hilux Surf and export specification 4Runner introduced in 1984, Toyota, instead of developing an entirely new model, modified the existing Hilux (N50/N60/N70) with short-bed pickup body. The Hilux had undergone a major redesign in 1983 for the 1984 model year. Changes included {{the removal of the}} panel with integrated rear window from behind the front seats, the addition of rear seats, and a removable fiberglass canopy. The implementation was borrowed from both the second generation Ford Bronco, and the Chevrolet K5 Blazer, both short-bed trucks with <b>removable</b> fiberglass <b>shells</b> over the rear sections and having bench seats installed in the back. Like the Bronco and the Blazer, the Hilux Surf/4Runner also did not have a wall attached to the front section behind front seats as the regular Hilux did. In that sense, all three vehicles were not conventional pickup trucks with a fiberglass shell included.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1978, Ford {{redesigned}} their Ford Bronco {{and based}} it upon the F-150. The Bronco was now nearly {{similar to the}} F-150 {{with the addition of}} a <b>removable</b> camper <b>shell.</b> The new Bronco incorporated design characteristics which eliminated leaky roofs and body flex associated with other full size removable top utility vehicles of the era. This allowed Ford to compete better with the Chevrolet Blazer by offering a larger and more luxurious SUV while minimizing production costs since many (especially the most complex and expensive) parts were shared with the F-series trucks. The Bronco was only offered with the 351M and 400 V8 engines. Often when people modify 78-79 Bronco's, they will replace the standard Ford 351M or 400M V8 with the larger Ford 460 engines. It is also common to add lift kits and larger tires on the trucks to make them more suitable for off-road/trail use.|$|R
40|$|The XV- 15, N 703 NA Tiltrotor Research Aircraft {{located at}} the NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California, {{currently}} uses a set of composite rotor blades of complex shape known as the advanced technology blades (ATBs). The main structural element of the blades is a D-spar constructed of unidirectional, angled fiberglass/graphite, with the aft fairing portion of the blades constructed of a fiberglass cross-ply skin bonded to a Nomex honeycomb core. The blade tip is a <b>removable</b> laminate <b>shell</b> that fits over the outboard section of the spar structure, which contains a cavity to retain balance weights. Two types of tip shells are used for research. One is highly twisted (more than a conventional helicopter blade) and has a hollow core constructed of a thin Nomex-honeycomb-and-fiberglass-skin sandwich; the other is untwisted with a solid Nomex honeycomb core and a fiberglass cross-ply skin. During initial flight testing of the blades, {{a number of problems}} in the composite structure were encountered. These problems included debonding between the fiberglass skin and the honeycomb core, failure of the honeycomb core, failures in fiberglass splices, cracks in fiberglass blocks, misalignment of mated composite parts, and failures of retention of metal fasteners. Substantial time was spent in identifying and repairing these problems. Discussed here are the types of problems encountered, the inspection procedures used to identify each problem, the repairs performed on the damaged or flawed areas, the level of criticality of the problems, and the monitoring of repaired areas. It is hoped that this discussion will help designers, analysts, and experimenters in the future as the use of composites becomes more prevalent...|$|R
