40|$|The {{presence}} of psychrotrophic enterotoxigenic Bacillus cereus in <b>ready-to-serve</b> meats and meat products {{that have not}} been subjected to sterilization treatment is a public health concern. A study was undertaken to determine the survival, growth, and diarrheal enterotoxin production characteristics of four strains of psychrotrophic B. cereus in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and beef gravy as affected by temperature and supplementation with nisin. A portion of unheated vegetative cells from 24 -h BHI broth cultures was sensitive to nisin as evidenced by an inability to form colonies on BHI agar containing 10 micrograms of nisin/ml. Heat-stressed cells exhibited increased sensitivity to nisin. At concentrations as low as 1 microgram/ml, nisin was lethal to B. cereus, the effect being more pronounced in BHI broth than in beef gravy. The inhibitory effect of nisin (1 microgram/ml) was greater on vegetative cells than on spores inoculated into beef gravy and was more pronounced at 8 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. Nisin, at a concentration of 5 or 50 micrograms/ml, inhibited growth in gravy inoculated with vegetative cells and stored at 8 or 15 degrees C, respectively, for 14 days. Growth of vegetative cells and spores of B. cereus after an initial period of inhibition is attributed to loss of activity of nisin. One of two test strains produced diarrheal enterotoxin in gravy stored at 8 or 15 degrees C within 9 or 3 days, respectively. Enterotoxin production was inhibited in gravy supplemented with 1 microgram of nisin/ml and stored at 8 degrees C for 14 days; 5 micrograms of nisin/ml was required for inhibition at 15 degrees C. Enterotoxin was not detected in gravy in which less than 5. 85 log 10 CFU of B. cereus/ml had grown. Results indicate that as little as 1 microgram of nisin/ml may be effective in inhibiting or retarding growth of and diarrheal enterotoxin production by vegetative cells and spores of psychrotrophic B. cereus in beef gravy at 8 degrees C, a temperature exceeding that recommended for storage or for most unpasteurized, <b>ready-to-serve</b> meat products...|$|E

40|$|Existing legal {{regulations}} in Germany guarantee the observance {{of the maximum}} mean daily nitrate and nitrite intake as proposed by the WHO. From a technological point of view, the nitrate and nitrite content {{of most of the}} meat products can be further reduced without impairing the preserving action of these food additives. On account of the high nitrate level in some kinds of vegetables, human nitrate intake can be reduced in a most efficient way by nitrate reducing measures during vegetable production and processing. Attention has to be paid on the occurrence and behaviour of amino-groups containing compounds as potential precursors of N-nitrosamines. Such precursors are especially formed by fermentation reaction.

This was a cross-sectional study on food ethnography in three steps: a market survey on availability of fonio, a food consumption survey on utilisation of fonio, and on beliefs on and attributes of fonio. The study covered the pre-harvest and post-harvest periods and involved key informants, food vendors, and women of reproductive age in households. Fonio, as all cereals, is available year-long on markets in Bamako, and is abundant from September to May before most of the common cereals mature. More than two-thirds (68 %) of the women reported having consumed fonio one to three times a month. Fonio was more consumed as snack (djouka) on working days (62 %) than on weekend and special event days, suggesting that encouraging the development of <b>ready-to-serve</b> fonio-based products would help increase the consumption of fonio among women in urban area.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the combined effect of Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) and refrigeration (7 ± 1 °C) on shelf-life extension of <b>ready-to-serve</b> pizza. Quality assessment {{was based on}} sensory and biochemical indices determination. The gaseous atmospheres used were: atm 1 : air (control); atm 2 : 100 % CO 2, atm 3 : 100 % N 2 and atm 4 : 50 % CO 2 / 50 % N 2. Moisture content, water activity, pH, titratable acidity, free fatty acids, peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid, tyrosine content, lycopene content, color profile (L*= lightness of the product; a*= redness of the product; b*= yellowness of the product; total color difference; relative yellowness) were monitored. Sampling was carried out at predetermined time intervals namely 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days. The results indicated that MAP with 100 % CO 2 more significantly inhibited the lipolytic oxidation, reduced proteolysis, effectively prevented total acidity (less decrease in pH) and have preservative effect on color indices and hence extended shelf life than did other treatments. Results {{of the present study}} show that the limit of sensory acceptability was only reached for the aerobically stored samples somewhat before days 15 of storage.

It has been observed {{that a majority of}} kinnow producers sell their orchards to the pre-harvest contractors / traders at different stages. The aggregate post-harvest losses from orchards to consumers in kinnow in two different markets ranges from 14. 87 per cent in Delhi market to 21. 91 per cent in Bangalore market. It has indicated the necessity of establishing kinnow processing industries for development of value-added <b>ready-to-serve</b> (RTS) quality products, minimizing post-harvest losses and providing remunerative price to the producers. The results have emphasized that efforts should be made to adopt improved packaging techniques, cushioning material and cold storage facilities at the retail level. The producer’s share in consumer’s price as estimated by old method has been found higher in local market than Bangalore and Delhi markets, largely because of lower marketing costs and profit margins of traders. The inclusion of marketing loss in the estimation of marketing margins, price spread and efficiency has indicated that the old estimation method unduly over-states the farmers ’ net price and profit margins to the market middlemen.

40|$|Java {{has been}} {{successful}} particularly for writing applications in the server environment. However, isolation of multiple applications has not been efficiently achieved in Java. Many customers require that their applications are guarded by independent OS processes, but starting a Java application with a new process results in a long sequence of initializations being repeated each time. To date, {{there has been no}} way to quickly start a new Java application as an isolated OS process. In this paper, we propose a new isolation approach called Clone-able JVM to eliminate this startup overhead in Java. The key idea is to create a new Java application by copying, or cloning, the already-initialized image of the primary JVM process. Since the clone is already initialized, it can begin actual operations immediately as a new isolated process. This cloning abstraction can support new scenarios for Java, such as user isolation and transaction isolation. We implemented a prototype of the Cloneable JVM by modi-fying a production JVM on Linux, which provides a new API for cloning constructed on the Isolate API defined in JSR 121. Using this cloning API, several Java applications, including a large pro-duction J 2 EE application server, were modified to demonstrate the isolation scenarios. Evaluations using these prototypes showed that new <b>ready-to-serve</b> Java applications can start up as a new process in less than 5 seconds, which is 4 to 170 times faster than starting these applications from scratch...|$|E
