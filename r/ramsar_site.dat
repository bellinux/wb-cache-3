5|$|George Tennant {{incorporated}} the southern section into his Tennant Canal. The northern branch over the Crymlyn Bog was derelict by 1918. It branches northwards in Crymlyn Burrows and terminates at the Crymlyn Bog nature reserve, now a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The SSSI covers {{an area of}} , and has been designated {{because of the presence}} of fen and wet woodland habitats. It is also a <b>RAMSAR</b> <b>site</b> and a Special Area of Conservation. Rare flora and fauna include slender cottongrass, the fen raft spider, and groupings of rare and scarce invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century saw {{a revival}} as local tourism {{developed}} {{and there are}} now two caravan parks. The census of 2001 recorded 135people in the Reculver area, {{nearly a quarter of}} whom were in caravans at the time. The Reculver coastline is within a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Special Protection Area and a <b>Ramsar</b> <b>site,</b> including most of Reculver Country Park, which itself includes much of Bishopstone Cliffs local nature reserve. While nationally scarce plants and insects are found there, the location is also important for migrating birds and is of significant geological interest.|$|E
5|$|The arena was {{designed}} by Niels Torp, and Biong & Biong, and opened on 19 December 1992. The complex cost 230 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The localization was controversial, as it is located at Åkervika, a <b>Ramsar</b> <b>site.</b> It is Norway's national venue for speed skating and bandy, and holds annual ISU Speed Skating World Cup races, as well as regular world championships. It has among other things hosted tournaments of the World Allround Speed Skating Championships, European Speed Skating Championships, World Single Distance Championships, World Sprint Speed Skating Championships, UCI Track Cycling World Championships, Speedway Grand Prix and World Rally Championship.|$|E

25|$|The estuary is hugely {{important}} for birdlife {{and has been}} designated both as an SSSI and as a <b>Ramsar</b> <b>site</b> accordingly. Its value lies in the huge expanses of mud which are exposed between tides and the extensive saltmarsh developed on both sides but principally on the right bank {{north and south of}} Neston.|$|E
25|$|There are 15 Sites of Special Scientific Interest on Lewis in {{the biology}} category, {{spread across the}} island. Additionally, the Lewis Peatlands are {{recognised}} by Scottish Natural Heritage as a Special Protection Area, Special Area of Conservation and a <b>Ramsar</b> <b>site,</b> showing their importance as a wetland habitat for migratory and resident bird life.|$|E

25|$|The {{crossing}} {{passes over}} mudflats in the Severn Estuary {{with part of}} the eastern approach viaduct sited on the English Stones, a rocky outcrop uncovered at low tide. The estuary wetlands are home to migrating birds such as the ringed plover, redshank and whimbrel, while the Eurasian curlew, dunlin and grey plover winter in the area. The birds feed on ragworm, lugworm and other invertebrates. Saltmarsh is found along {{the fringes of the}} coast. Beds of eelgrass occur on the more sheltered mud- and sandbanks. In 1976, in recognition {{of the importance of the}} estuary as a wetland used by migrating birds, an area of 247 km2 (95 sq miles) was designated a <b>Ramsar</b> <b>site.</b> In 1988 the Severn Estuary was designated a Special Protection Area. The same year an area of 99 km2 (38 sq miles) was notified as a SSSI and designated as such the following year; in 1995, this was extended to cover the whole of the <b>Ramsar</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{peninsula}} contains several significant wetlands, many {{of which}} form part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula <b>Ramsar</b> <b>Site</b> and are of international significance {{for the protection of}} waterbirds and the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot.

25|$|No {{species of}} plants, birds, amphibians, reptiles, molluscs, crustaceans, or mammals are endemic on Diego Garcia {{or in the}} {{surrounding}} waters. Several endemic fish and aquatic invertebrates are present, though. All plants, wildlife, and aquatic species are protected to one degree or another. In addition, much of the lagoon waters are protected wetlands as a designated <b>Ramsar</b> <b>site,</b> and {{large parts of the}} island are nature preserves.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the base}} has been listed as a {{cultural}} heritage. This includes the runways, the taxiway and the road network, the remaining buildings from the Second World War and Marka. An important aspect when listing was {{that many of the}} structures had not been modified since the war. Slevdalsvannet Nature Reserve is situated southwest of the runway. A former lake, it has since been drained. It remains an important wetland area for migratory birds and is part of a <b>Ramsar</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
25|$|North American birders were {{estimated}} to have spent as much as US$32 billion in 2001. The spending {{is on the rise}} around the world. Kuşcenneti National Park (KNP) at Lake Manyas, a <b>Ramsar</b> <b>site</b> in Turkey was estimated to attract birders who spent as much as US$103,320,074 annually. Guided bird tours have become a major business with at least 127 companies offering tours worldwide. An average trip to a less-developed country costs $4000 per person and includes about 12 participants for each of 150 trips a year. It has been suggested that this economic potential needs to be tapped for conservation.|$|E
