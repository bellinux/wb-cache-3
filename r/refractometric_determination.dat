40|$|Summary: A micro-method of agarose gel {{electrophoresis}} requiring I— 3 ml of cerebrospinal fluid for quantitative analysis of cerebrospinal fluid proteins is described. After concentration of CSF to about 50 μΐ by ultrafiltration and <b>refractometric</b> <b>determination</b> of protein, approximately 20 - 40 ^g of total protein are used for electrophoresis. Photometric scanning of the electrophoretic pattern at two different wavelengths permits quantitative evaluation. The pherograms are analysed {{by means of a}} modified DU-PONT analog computer. Factors which influence quantitative electrophoresis are examined. In cerebrospinal fluid of normal children 15 protein fractions ar...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the quantification of selected bioactive substances in chokeberry juices, in the extracts of chokeberry and in chokeberry tea. In the theoretical part, there is a botanical description of chokeberry, (Aronia melanocarpa). Furthermore, the chemical properties of aronia and their use in the food, cosmetics industry and in the medicine. At {{the end of the}} theoretical part there are presented manual methods for determination of simple saccharides and briefly described selected extraction methods. The experimental part contains the determination of these chemical characteristics of analyzed aronia products: pH, titratable acidity, <b>refractometric</b> <b>determination</b> of dry matter, reducing sugars according to Bertrand's method and gravimetric determination, total phenolics and total anthocyanins. The highest phenolic content 319, 54 mg·dm- 3 were determined in a sample of aronia tea for 10 min digestion. The highest concentration of anthocyanin dyes was also determined in this tea – 889, 49 mg·dm- 3...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} quick and easy semiquantitative tests for the detection of serum immunoglobulins that are commonly used for to trace the foals with the failure of passive immunity transfer. We compared the four most employed methods – zinc sulphate turbidity tests using photometric or visual reading, glutaraldehyde test and <b>refractometric</b> <b>determination</b> of total protein concentration in serum. Radial immunodiffusion test was used as a reference method. Thirty-eight blood serum samples from foals were used for quantitative estimation of immunoglobulins. The tested methods were correlated with reference method and their availability for tracing of cases of unsuccessful passive transfer immunogobulins was evaluated. The results obtained so far have not allowed us to recommend without reservation any of the compared methods as a reliable test for the determination of blood serum Ig concentrations in newborn foals. On the other hand, the practical usefulness of two of the tested methods (visual reading of turbidity, refractometry) for rapid field identification of hypogammaglobulinaemic foals was confirmed. Of the two, we prefer the refractometric method (sensitivity: 94. 11; specificity: 83. 30 and predictive value: 88) for common use because it is quicker and easier than other methods. This study pointed out the critical points of the mentioned problem, which have to be studie...|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} {{procedure is}} described for decoloration and purification of Japan wax by adsorption on silica gel column. The {{progress of the}} adsorption fractionations {{was followed by the}} <b>refractometric</b> examination and <b>determinations</b> of iodine values, saponification values, and melting points of the eluted fractions. The free fatty acids and pigments of Japan wax were strongly absorbed by the silicagel and not eluted bY the petroleum ether - carbon tetrachloride mixture. Japanic acid was also absorbed on the chromatographic column. 1. 木蝋を四塩化炭素石油エーテル等量混液に溶解し温時シリカゲルを吸着剤とするクロマトグラフ吸着分析を行つた. 2. その結果木蝋中の色素及び遊離脂肪酸は殆んど大部分吸着され白色中性で融点の高い木蝋を得た. 3. 液体クロマトグラフ法により流下した濾液を分取して木蝋を各溜分に分ちその各々について各種恒数を測定した...|$|R
