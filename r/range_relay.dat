40|$|SummarySignaling {{networks}} {{respond to}} diverse stimuli, but {{how the state}} of the signaling network is relayed to downstream cellular responses is unclear. We modeled how incremental activation of signaling molecules is transmitted to control apoptosis as a function of signal strength and dynamic range. A linear relationship between signal input and response output, with the dynamic range of signaling molecules uniformly distributed across activation states, most accurately predicted cellular responses. When nonlinearized signals with compressed dynamic <b>range</b> <b>relay</b> network activation to apoptosis, we observe catastrophic, stimulus-specific prediction failures. We develop a general computational technique, “model-breakpoint analysis,” to analyze the mechanism of these failures, identifying new time- and stimulus-specific roles for Akt, ERK, and MK 2 kinase activity in apoptosis, which were experimentally verified. Dynamic range is rarely measured in signal-transduction studies, but our experiments using model-breakpoint analysis suggest it may be a greater determinant of cell fate than measured signal strength...|$|E

According to the different features on mobility and relay <b>range,</b> <b>Relay</b> Station (RS) can be classified into three types: Fixed RS (FRS), Nomadic RS (NRS) and Mobile RS (MRS). Since a relay-based WiMAX network includes different types of RSs, how to efficiently construct the relay-based WiMAX and how to determine an optimal routing path between a Mobile Station (MS) and the MR-BS become two important issues. This paper thus {{proposed a}}n IEEE 802. 16 j-conformed relay-based adaptive cost-based routing approach, in which a multihop optimal path is selected in terms of link bandwidth, path length and channel condition.

30|$|For {{distance}} {{range of}} 70 m < d < 100 m, {{it is observed}} that the source-destination overlapping reduces but still encompasses relays to allow for beneficial relay transmission. Interestingly, in this <b>range,</b> <b>relays</b> offer better throughput improvement opportunities because of the combined rates being better than the direct transmission rates of 1 - 2 Mbps. These higher combined rates compensate for the overhead time in CoopMACI. Thus, CoopMACI performs better than UtdMAC (by 0.13 Mbps) at a distance of about 80 m because of improved throughput through the relay path. In this range, UtdMAC initiates direct transmission at the low rate of 1 Mbps. The backup relay also receives information from the source at this lower rate. In case of direct transmission failure, backup transmission entails larger transmission time compared to CoopMACI. In this range, IrcMAC again performs considerably better than both the protocols because of reliable instantaneous rate transmission.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The delay-limited {{capacity}} of the half-duplex relay channel is analyzed for several cooperative protocols under a long-term average total transmit power constraint. It is assumed that the source and the relay have access to partial channel state information {{in the form of}} channel amplitudes. Non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAF), compress-and-forward (CF) and opportunistic decode-and-forward (ODF) protocols are compared with optimal resource allocation, i. e., at each channel state, the source and the relay transmit with the minimum total power allocation required to achieve the target rate. A hybrid opportunistic protocol is proposed in which CF or ODF with optimal resource allocation is chosen at each channel state. Numerical results demonstrate that, while the hybrid protocol offers the best delay-limited capacity, ODF follows the hybrid scheme closely for a wide <b>range</b> of <b>relay</b> locations and average power constraints.

30|$|Link break {{prediction}} {{can also}} be based on packet loss monitoring carried out by potential relay nodes. In a proposed routing protocol [16], relay nodes, which are neighbors of the sender and receiver of the monitored link, overhear packet transmissions. When a relay node notices that a packet has reached its maximum number of retransmissions, it assumes that, due to mobility, the transmitter and the receiver are now out of their coverage <b>ranges.</b> The <b>relay</b> node then warns the transmitter in order to recover the route and proposes itself as an alternative next hop to the receiver. However, in real deployments, {{it is difficult to}} assure the presence of a relay node for each pair of nodes. In addition, although this mechanism can detect packet losses due to any phenomena, under high-load conditions (where collisions and retransmissions are very frequent), it may lead to network instability due to a high amount of route recoveries. Packet overhearing under these conditions could also burden the resources of the nodes. The mechanism has only been evaluated under mobility and very low load conditions [16].|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Wireless mesh {{networking}} (WMN) {{is regarded as}} a low-cost technology for rapid wireless network deployment. However, in a single-channel WMN, the overlapped transmission <b>ranges</b> between <b>relaying</b> mesh points could introduce serious interference. Using multiple radios over multiple channels can decrease the interference and improve the capacity of a WMN, but it increases the cost of a mesh point. One possible solution to balance between interference, hence performance, and cost is utilizing fewer radios that switch among multiple channels instead of using per-channel radios. In this paper, we propose a channel-switching method, called the traffic-aware switching scheme (TRASS), for a mesh point with a limited number of radios. TRASS utilizes the existing IEEE 802. 11 mechanisms, i. e., hybrid-coordinationfunction-controlled channel access and power saving, to avoid packet loss during channel switching. A TRASS mesh point monitors the occupied channel time to schedule radios that switch among channels. The implemented TRASS demonstrates 75 % throughput improvement by (2, 1), i. e., two-channel single-radio, over (1, 1).

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{years has}} {{witnessed}} a {{growing interest in}} the applications of unattended wireless sensor networks. Typically sensors collect data about their surrounding and forward that data to a gateway (sink). Due to the limitation of the energy supply that these miniaturized sensors have, almost all of the proposed routing protocols have aimed at energy efficiency as the ultimate objective and considered relaying data to a stationary gateway. However, many new issues have been posed by the increasing interest in applications that demand certain quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Such issues even get more challenging when the gateway is mobile. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware approach for routing delay-constrained data. The approach pursues multi-hop packet relaying to minimize transmission energy and employs Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) packet scheduling methodology along with leaky bucket constrained data sources in order to provide soft real-time guarantees for data delivery. Such employment of WFQ at each node provides a service differentiation between two different classes of traffic, namely real-time and non-real-time traffic and divides the outgoing link capacity among such classes accordingly. In the case of a mobile gateway, uninterrupted data flow for both types of traffic is achieved by dynamic adjustment of the route setup to react to the gateway's departure out of transmission <b>range</b> of <b>relaying</b> nodes. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for popular performance metrics. ...|$|R
