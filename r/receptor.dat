5|$|A <b>receptor</b> for tomato systemin was {{identified}} as a 160KDa leucine-rich repeat <b>receptor</b> like kinase (LRR-RLK), SR160. After being isolated it was found that was very similar in structure to BRI1 from A. thaliana, the <b>receptor</b> that brassinolides bind to on the cell membrane. This was the first <b>receptor</b> which was found to be able to bind both a steroid and a peptide ligand and also to be involved in both defensive and developmental responses. Recent studies have found that the initial conclusion that BRI1 is the <b>receptor</b> for tomato systemin may be incorrect. In cu3 mutants of tomato, a null allele with a stop codon present in the extracellular LRR domain of BRI1 prevents the <b>receptor</b> from being localised correctly and it also lacks the kinase domain, required for signalling. These mutants are insensitive to brassinolide yet still respond to tomato systemin by producing protease inhibitors and causing an alkalisation response. This led Holton et al. to suggest that there is another mechanism by which systemin is perceived. Further investigation showed that binding of systemin to BRI1 does not cause the <b>receptor</b> to become phosphorylated, as when brassinolides bind, suggesting that it does not transduce a signal. When BRI1 is silenced in tomato, the plants have a similar phenotype to cu3 mutants yet are still able to respond normally to systemin, strengthening the view that BRI1 is not the systemin <b>receptor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Albatrellus subrubescens {{contains}} the bioactive compound scutigeral, which has antibiotic activity. This chemical—also {{found in the}} related species A.ovinus—may contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by disturbing the body's intestinal flora. Scutigeral interacts selectively to the dopamine <b>receptor</b> D1 subfamily (the most abundant dopamine <b>receptor</b> in the central nervous system, regulating neuronal growth and development, and mediating some behavioral responses). A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at vanilloid receptors (a <b>receptor</b> found on sensory nerves in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of calcium in the neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia. Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity. One 2003 study reported that scutigeral acts as a weak antagonist on the human vanilloid <b>receptor</b> VR1, while another study published that year {{did not find any}} activity.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine <b>receptor</b> site on the GABAA <b>receptor</b> and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory <b>receptor</b> within the brain. The GABA chemical and <b>receptor</b> system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA <b>receptor</b> {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E
50|$|The main <b>receptors</b> in {{the immune}} system are pattern {{recognition}} <b>receptors</b> (PRRs), Toll-like <b>receptors</b> (TLRs), killer activated and killer inhibitor <b>receptors</b> (KARs and KIRs), complement <b>receptors,</b> Fc <b>receptors,</b> B cell <b>receptors</b> and T cell <b>receptors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>receptors</b> for enkephalin are {{the delta}} opioid <b>receptors</b> and mu opioid <b>receptors.</b> Opioid <b>receptors</b> are {{a group of}} G-protein-coupled <b>receptors,</b> with other opioids as ligands as well. The other {{endogenous}} opioids are dynorphins (that bind to kappa <b>receptors),</b> endorphins (mu <b>receptors),</b> endomorphins, and nociceptin/orphanin FQ. The opioid <b>receptors</b> are ~40% identical to somatostatin <b>receptors</b> (SSTRs).|$|R
50|$|This {{class of}} <b>receptors</b> {{includes}} the metabotropic glutamate <b>receptors,</b> muscarinic acetylcholine <b>receptors,</b> GABAB <b>receptors,</b> and most serotonin <b>receptors,</b> {{as well as}} <b>receptors</b> for norepinephrine, epinephrine, histamine, dopamine, neuropeptides and endocannabinoids.|$|R
5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} <b>receptor</b> agonist on a {{wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this <b>receptor</b> is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this <b>receptor</b> is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible antagonists covalently bind to the <b>receptor</b> target and, in general, {{cannot be}} removed; inactivating the <b>receptor</b> for the {{duration}} of the antagonist effects is determined by the rate of <b>receptor</b> turnover, the rate of synthesis of new receptors. Phenoxybenzamine is an example of an irreversible alpha blocker—it permanently binds to α adrenergic receptors, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves and a right shift in the curve occurs where there is a <b>receptor</b> reserve similar to non-competitive antagonists. A washout step in the assay will usually distinguish between non-competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs, as effects of non-competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of agonist will be restored.|$|E
5|$|LDL {{cholesterol}} normally circulates in {{the body}} for 2.5 days, and subsequently the apolipoprotein B portion of LDL cholesterol binds to the LDL <b>receptor</b> on the liver cells, triggering its uptake and digestion. This process results in the removal of LDL from the circulatory system. Synthesis of cholesterol by the liver is suppressed in the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. In FH, LDL <b>receptor</b> function is reduced or absent, and LDL circulates for an average duration of 4.5 days, resulting in significantly increased level of LDL cholesterol in the blood with normal levels of other lipoproteins. In mutations of ApoB, reduced binding of LDL particles to the <b>receptor</b> causes the increased level of LDL cholesterol. It is not known how the mutation causes LDL <b>receptor</b> dysfunction in mutations of PCSK9 and ARH.|$|E
2500|$|As {{is typical}} of {{phenothiazine}} antipsychotics, levomepromazine is a [...] "dirty drug", that is, it exerts its effects by blocking a variety of <b>receptors,</b> including adrenergic <b>receptors,</b> dopamine <b>receptors,</b> histamine <b>receptors,</b> muscarinic acetylcholine <b>receptors</b> and serotonin <b>receptors.</b>|$|R

50|$|Chemical <b>receptors</b> for {{glutamate}} {{fall into}} three major classes, known as AMPA <b>receptors,</b> NMDA <b>receptors,</b> and metabotropic glutamate <b>receptors.</b> Many synapses use multiple types of glutamate <b>receptors.</b> AMPA <b>receptors</b> are ionotropic <b>receptors</b> specialized for fast excitation: in many synapses they produce excitatory electrical responses in their targets {{a fraction of}} a millisecond after being stimulated. NMDA <b>receptors</b> are also ionotropic, but they differ from AMPA <b>receptors</b> in being permeable, when activated, to calcium. Their properties make them particularly important for learning and memory. Metabotropic <b>receptors</b> act through second messenger systems to create slow, sustained effects on their targets. A fourth class, known as kainate <b>receptors,</b> are similar in many respects to AMPA <b>receptors,</b> but much less abundant.|$|R
5|$|Many viruses, {{including}} HIV {{which needs}} CD4 and CXCR4, need a <b>receptor</b> to attach to and enter into host cells. The host prion, PrPc {{may be a}} <b>receptor</b> protein for an as yet undiscovered TSE virus, explaining why animals lacking host prion do not become infected with experimental prion disease.|$|E
5|$|Neurotransmitters are {{chemicals}} that are released at synapses when an action potential activates them—neurotransmitters attach themselves to <b>receptor</b> molecules on the membrane of the synapse's target cell, and thereby alter the electrical or chemical {{properties of the}} <b>receptor</b> molecules.|$|E
5|$|Non{{benzodiazepine}}s also bind to the benzodiazepine {{binding site}} on the GABAA <b>receptor</b> and possess similar pharmacological properties. While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs possess a common pharmacophore (see figure to the lower-right), which explains their binding to a common <b>receptor</b> site.|$|E
50|$|Ziprasidone {{is a full}} {{antagonist}} of D2 <b>receptors</b> and of 5-HT2A <b>receptors</b> and is {{a partial}} agonist of 5-HT1A <b>receptors</b> and a partial antagonist of 5-HT2C <b>receptors</b> and 5-HT1D <b>receptors.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{neurotransmitter}} receptors: ligand-gated <b>receptors</b> or ionotropic <b>receptors</b> and G protein-coupled <b>receptors</b> or metabotropic <b>receptors.</b> Ligand-gated <b>receptors</b> can be excited by neurotransmitters (ligands) like glutamate and aspartate. These <b>receptors</b> can also be inhibited by neurotransmitters like GABA and glycine. Conversely, G protein-coupled <b>receptors</b> are neither excitatory nor inhibitory. Rather, they modulate the actions of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Most neurotransmitters <b>receptors</b> are G-protein coupled.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chemoreceptor}} {{trigger zone}} {{at the base}} of the fourth ventricle has numerous dopamine D2 <b>receptors,</b> serotonin 5-HT3 <b>receptors,</b> opioid <b>receptors,</b> acetylcholine <b>receptors,</b> and <b>receptors</b> for substance P. Stimulation of different <b>receptors</b> are involved in different pathways leading to emesis, in the final common pathway substance P appears involved.|$|R
5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given <b>receptor,</b> might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal <b>receptor</b> occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for <b>receptor</b> occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the <b>receptor</b> activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a <b>receptor</b> to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid <b>receptor,</b> binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E
5|$|Selective {{glucocorticoid}} <b>receptor</b> modulators (SEGRMs) {{and selective}} glucocorticoid <b>receptor</b> agonists (SEGRAs) {{formerly known as}} dissociated glucocorticoid <b>receptor</b> agonists (DIGRAs) are a class of experimental drugs designed to share many of the desirable anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or anticancer properties of classical glucocorticoid drugs but with fewer side effects such as skin atrophy. Although preclinical evidence on SEGRAMs’ anti-inflammatory effects are culminating, currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|TCDD and dioxin-like {{compounds}} act via {{a specific}} <b>receptor</b> {{present in all}} cells: the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) <b>receptor.</b> This <b>receptor</b> is a transcription factor which is involved in expression of genes; in fact {{it has been shown}} that high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. Genes of enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes. TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene.|$|E

5|$|The {{physiological}} {{function of the}} AH <b>receptor</b> {{has been the subject}} of continuous research. One obvious function is to increase the activity of enzymes breaking down foreign chemicals or normal chemicals of the body as needed. There may be other functions, however, related to growth of various organs or other regulatory functions. The AH <b>receptor</b> is phylogenetically highly conserved transcription factor with a history of at least 500 million years, and found in all vertebrates, and its ancient analogs are important regulatory proteins even in more primitive species. In fact, knock-out animals with no AH <b>receptor</b> are prone to illness and developmental problems. Taken together, this implies the necessity of a basal degree of AH <b>receptor</b> activation to achieve normal {{physiological function}}.|$|E
5|$|The <b>receptor</b> for AtPep1 {{has been}} {{identified}} as a 170KDa LRR-RLK and has been named AtPEPR1. AtPep1 is active at 0.1 nano-molar (nM) concentrations and the <b>receptor</b> saturates at 1nM. An analysis {{of the structure of the}} AtPEPR1 <b>receptor</b> has shown that it is a member of the LRR XI subfamily of LRR-RLKs in A. thaliana which includes the <b>receptor</b> for another peptide hormone CLAVATA3. Transforming tobacco cell cultures with AtPEPR1 allowed them to respond to AtPep1 in an alkalisation assay, whereas normal tobacco did not show such a response. BRI1-associated <b>receptor</b> kinase 1 (BAK1) is an LRR-RLK found in A. thaliana, which has been proposed to function as an adaptor protein that is required for the proper functioning of other RLKs. Yeast two-hybrid assays have shown that AtPEPR1 and its closest analog, AtPEPR2, interact with BAK1.|$|E
5|$|These {{polycyclic}} hydrocarbons also {{activate the}} AH <b>receptor,</b> {{but less than}} TCDD and only temporarily. Even many natural compounds present in vegetables cause some activation of the AH <b>receptor.</b> This phenomenon {{can be viewed as}} adaptive and beneficial, because it protects the organism from toxic and carcinogenic substances. Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH <b>receptor,</b> however, leads to a multitude of adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|As ionotropic <b>receptors,</b> nAChRs are {{directly}} linked to ion channels.
