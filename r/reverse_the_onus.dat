40|$|Consulting {{with the}} public on {{planning}} issues has become an endeavour formalized throughout Western democracies over the past half-century. However, there remains a dichotomy between the legislative minimums for {{this part of the}} planning process and the extraordinary efforts of some municipalities. Inefficiencies emerge as attempts are made by many municipalities to implement the contributions received, exposing the potentially different objectives held by each of the major consultation players. Academics suggest that the rationale for consultation appears to have advanced to the point where its value is beyond question, but that the means and frequency for its conduct are not. The literature on the subject is further split between that which focuses on the process of consultation and that which centres on its outcomes. Correspondingly, the fairness of consultation exercises can be viewed from the procedural and distributive points of view. To date, academic study in this field has largely been conducted along qualitative lines. Using a combination of questionnaires, interviews and a focus group to triangulate data received from the major players, an answer was sought to the hypothesis that consultation players possess distinct objectives for this planning exercise. The results indicated that planners and the public do subscribe to separate views for the purpose of consultation, which bias their paradigms of the other parties. Isolating other factors regarding each of these cohort groups further suggested that time, geography, and education often limit the participation of citizens, while planners feel constrained by time, apathy among participants, the political processes and certain fiscal realities. Therefore, changes to planning legislation are recommended that would indirectly reduce the burden for each of the major players by conducting anticipatory consultation. Such measures would <b>reverse</b> <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> of participating while requiring a lesser investment of staff and resources from municipalities. Future research would test the validity of this approach and engage political figures as the final cohort in the triangle of planning participation...|$|E
40|$|Despite last-minute amendments, {{the federal}} government’s ASIO {{legislation}} {{is bad for}} human rights, argues Jenny Hocking LATE in June the Labor Senator John Faulkner rose in the Senate to give the Labor Party’s imprimatur to the much amended ASIO Bill. In a sudden and unexpected capitulation, the Labor Party announced it was now prepared to support a bill which would grant ASIO the power to detain non-suspects for seven days and to question them {{for a total of}} 24 hours within that seven-day period, a bill which would <b>reverse</b> <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> of proof, remove the right to silence and severely restrict access to independent legal advice while in detention. The intense debate surrounding this bill has been characterised by widespread dissembling, deliberate obfuscation and incompetence. The government’s initial description of the bill as a ‘ 48 -hour’ detention bill {{set the tone for the}} confusion and uncertainty that followed. From the government’s continued references to ‘suspects’ and even to ‘terrorist sympathisers’ it has been not unreasonably assumed that the bill allowed only for the questioning of ‘suspects’ (an error repeated by journalists). What was particularly unsettling in the reintroduction of the bill was to see Senator Faulkner continuing the government’s pattern of dissembling and joining with them in urging the passage of this bill which would trammel our rights so comprehensively. The core concerns over indefinite detention and the erosion of established political and legal rights had, Senator Faulkner claimed, now been dealt with: ‘Gone is the denial of legal representation. Gone is the capacity for ASIO to hold someone indefinitely. Gone is the capacity for ASIO to hold someone in secret. ’ There was just one problem with Senator Faulkner’s triumphant recitation - it was incorrect. It has since been revealed, following questions in the Senate by Greens Senator Bob Brown, that the amended bill could indeed still allow for indefinite detention through a series of rolling warrants each of seven days duration. It is simply extraordinary that somehow this had not been noticed, either by the government or by the Opposition - it had, after all, been one of the core concerns expressed by each of the several extensive parliamentary inquiries into the bill. Further claims made by the Government and Opposition in relation to their agreed amendments must surely now be questioned. It is already clear that Faulkner’s claim that, in the amended bill, ‘gone is the denial of legal representation’ is likewise incorrect. The government’s own description of the amended bill’s provisions for access to legal representation contains the oxymoron that ‘questioning can commence in the absence of a lawyer but the person has a right to a lawyer at all times’. The legal adviser, moreover, could be ejected from the interrogation proceedings by the prescribed authority. Furthermore, there is no indication that the lawyer would be present throughout the entire detention period. Nor does this constitute recognition of a right to independent legal advice since the lawyer would not be of one’s choice since ASIO can apply for ‘particular lawyers’ to be disallowed. There now remains a serious concern that the remaining claim for the amended bill - ‘gone is the capacity for ASIO to hold someone in secret’ - ought to be further examined. Indeed the government’s proposals at this stage specifically indicate that lawyers could be charged with an offence if they communicate information relating to the interrogation process to a third person. It would appear that incommunicado detention may well remain with the latest amendments merely widening by one the limited circle of those aware of the detention but with no one outside that circle able to communicate to family or friends that the detention is taking place. Finally, the amendments in relation to children also require further clarification. In particular, the claim that detained children will have the right to a parent, guardian or other representative must now be fully detailed. What is meant by ‘other representative’ and under what circumstances will this ‘other representative’ be present rather than a parent? The fear of being seen as ‘soft on security’, in a rerun of the older ‘soft on communism’ claim against the Labor Party during the Cold War, was clear when the Prime Minister accused the opposition of endangering Australia’s security following the breakdown of renewed negotiations over these amendments in the last parliamentary sitting day of last year. It was a view reiterated by the Attorney-General on Monday, hinting at a double dissolution trigger ‘if Labor doesn’t pass the bill. The question will be raised about whether they are really genuine about national security’. Equally disturbing was the revelation that the government and opposition alike were apparently unaware that the bill may allow for indefinite detention, highlights the need for further scrutiny of its far-reaching provisions. From its early lack of precision and through its many amendments, this bill has become impenetrable even to its supporters. The Australian people simply deserve better from its major parties.

40|$|The government’s {{major change}} in policy needs to be {{followed}} by changes to the law, argues GEORGE WILLIAMS THE reforms announced this week by the immigration and citizenship minister, Senator Chris Evans, mark a historic shift in Australian immigration policy. They come on top of earlier decisions to scrap temporary protection visas and the Pacific Solution with its “processing centres” on Nauru and Manus Island. The announcement is a mixture of good policy and practical politics. A clear break has been made with the Howard era despite the Rudd government retaining, because of an election promise, a system of mandatory detention for asylum seekers and the excision of parts of Australia. Both are to be retained in name but not in substance. Instead of depriving a person of their liberty as a first resort, and for a potentially indefinite time, detention will now only be permitted as a last resort, and for the shortest practicable time. This is exactly how the detention of any person against their will should be approached. Evans’s changes are not so much a step forward, as a welcome return to the past. They put behind us a bleak period of immigration policy that extended over both the Howard and Keating governments. Before 1992 the minister could decide on a case-by-case basis whether people arriving in Australia without a visa should be detained. Mandatory detention was introduced by the Keating government {{as a response to the}} arrival of Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese asylum seekers between November 1989 and January 1992. It was said that this would assist with the processing of refugee claims and save on the costs of locating people in the community. The 1992 law provided that all unlawful arrivals could be detained for up to 273 days. In 1994, this time limit was removed, leaving no upper limit on the period of detention. A person could only be released after the grant of a visa or because they were to be deported from Australia. After the Tampa “crisis” of 2001, the Howard government developed the Pacific solution, in which areas such as Christmas Island were excised from Australia’s migration zone. The Australian Defence Force was used to intercept vessels containing asylum seekers, who were then transferred to offshore processing centres while their applications were determined. A 2007 report found that the policy cost taxpayers over $ 1 billion. Public pressure led Howard to soften aspects of the policy in 2005. He promised that long-term detainees would be released and agreed to stop the detention of children. The latter followed a damning report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which found that children in detention were suffering from clinical depression, post- traumatic stress and anxiety disorders, and exhibited symptoms which included bed wetting, sleep-walking and night terrors. Some children even became mute, refused to eat and drink, attempted suicide and physically harmed themselves. In an earlier study, nineteen out of twenty children in detention were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and half were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite this evidence, the government tried, unsuccessfully, to return children to detention in 2006 with a law that would have sent all unauthorised people arriving by sea to offshore detention centres. Labor’s reforms are based on seven values, one of which is that children must not be held in an immigration detention centre. Another value does, however, say that the mandatory detention of adults is “an essential component of strong border control,” Fortunately, the basis of this detention will be entirely different from that of the previous government. Howard’s approach was based on deterrence. The system provided for the often harsh detention of unauthorised arrivals, up to 80 per cent of whom were found to be legitimate refugees. It was argued this would act as a disincentive to future arrivals and also to the people-smugglers who transport them. Even though people had not been found guilty of any crime and were often fleeing persecution, they were subjected to what can only be described as a punishment-based system. The fact this was applied even to unaccompanied children indicated the extent and severity of the regime. By contrast, the new policy of mandatory detention is not based on deterrence. It is founded on holding unauthorised arrivals only for so long as is necessary to determine their identity and to protect the security and health of the Australian community. It makes sense to hold a person until, for example, it can be confirmed that they are not a criminal fleeing justice. A person who poses no danger will be released into the community until their visa status has been resolved. This risk-based approach is more compassionate and more consistent with international human rights. It will ensure that people who have arrived in Australia without a visa are not detained for many years even where they pose no threat. While it makes sense to keep mandatory detention, albeit in a radically different form, there is no sound policy reason to continue to excise parts of Australia. This legal fiction was introduced to deprive people arriving by boat of the normal protections of the law and to enable them to be removed to places such as Nauru. Evans has indicated that Labor’s new immigration values will apply in the excised areas, leading to the question of why the excisions are to be maintained. One answer is that it honours, at least in form, an election commitment, and another might lie in Evans’s answer that the new values will apply to excised areas “as much as possible. ” This leaves some disturbing wiggle room and might even allow a return to Howard’s policies if the Rudd government takes too much heat over a large number of boat arrivals. One of the most important changes has received some of the least attention. It is the decision to <b>reverse</b> <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> of proof when it comes to immigration detention. The change means that, instead of arrivals having to show why they should not be detained, it will be up to the Immigration Department to prove it has a sufficient reason to hold them. This shifting of the onus will fundamentally alter many aspects of immigration detention. There will be a presumption in favour of liberty for unauthorised arrivals rather than a presumption they should be detained. This will help to prevent problems such as the large number of cases in which the status of a person, such as Cornelia Rau, could not be determined and they were simply held in detention. At least 247 people, many Australian citizens, have been wrongly held in immigration detention. While the Rudd government has announced a {{major change in}} policy, this needs to be followed up by changes to the law. Until this occurs there will be an awkward mismatch between the law enacted under the Howard government and Labor’s new values, some of which cannot be implemented. Without legal change, it will also be possible for a new government, or even a new minister, to revert to the old ways of mandatory detention and to undo the policy shift. It is not only the law that needs to be changed. We need to know the rights that people will have when they are released into the community pending a decision on their visa. A more effective regime of processing applications should mean this number will be small, but it does still need to be determined whether such people will be able to work. If they cannot, many of them will be destitute and dependent on the goodwill of Australian charities. The government should grasp the nettle by ensuring that such people can earn a decent wage. They should be allowed to live a life of dignity at a time that for them is one of great insecurity and uncertainty. • George Williams is the Anthony Mason Professor at the University of New South Wales and a visiting fellow at the ANU College of Law.

40|$|Why another {{paper on}} {{provocation}} when this partial defence to murder {{is already the}} subject of widespread criticism in the literature? The answer is because the defence is still available in five Australian jurisdictions. Furthermore, there is no consistency across jurisdictions that have reviewed the defence.

Internationally, New Zealand has removed the defence from the statute book but the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States continue to allow the defence. This paper identifies {{the heart of the}} problem as mandatory life sentencing for murder and seeks to argue that the partial defence of provocation is so flawed that it is the sentencing regime that needs to be adjusted especially as 'life' rarely actually means 'for the term of his natural life'. Nevertheless, given vested interests and the difficulty of introducing legal reform, the fallback position taken in this paper is that if the defence of provocation is to be retained then it is necessary to make the defence much more difficult to run by <b>reversing</b> <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> of proof and by narrowing the scope of the defence.
