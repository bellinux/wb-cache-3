40|$|Abstract—The rapid {{development}} of internet technologies {{in recent decades}} has imposed a heavy information burden on users. The popularity of recommender systems has evolved to provide suggestions and recommendations to the user for relevant information from web according to their preferences. Most recommender systems use collaborative-filtering or content-based methods to predict new items of interest for users. While both methods have their own advantages, individually they fail to provide good recommendations in many situations. In this paper, we propose a standard architectural framework Semantic Enhanced Personalizer (SEP) which integrates three recommendation techniques i. e., original, semantic and category-based. This framework fulfills user-based and item-based approach of recommendations. The original <b>recommendation</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> based on contextual information and the ratings provided by users explicitly, while, the semantic and category-based <b>recommendation</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> based on various data mining techniques such as, association rule mining, clustering and similarity measures. This framework overcomes the problem of cold-start and sparsity. Keywords- Recommender system; Data mining; similarity; ratings; SEP I...|$|R

40|$|The present deliverable, as {{the last}} of work package 2 of SafetyNet dealing with risk {{exposure}} data, is the conclusion of four years work. In the light of the progress made from the State of the art to the common framework, including the practical case of the pilot study, its aim is to give recommendations and guidelines to collect and use risk exposure data. The potential users of this guide represent a large group; policy makers at EU and national level, statisticians and experts as well as other stakeholders in the field. To achieve the aims, these recommendations on data collection and use <b>will</b> <b>be</b> structured in two parts. In the first one, general <b>recommendations</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> given; these <b>will</b> <b>be</b> distinguished two steps: one concerning the data already available, for which <b>recommendations</b> <b>will</b> suggest what {{to do in order to}} harmonize data and collection methods; and one exploring the way of obtaining new data. In a second part, more specific <b>recommendations</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> given, for each exposure indicator selected since the state of the art report: population; driver population; vehicle fleet; road length; vehicle-kilometres; and the three traffic and mobility exposure indicators; person-kilometres, number of trips and time in traffic.
