This chapter examines the use of modal adverbs {{of certainty}} in judicial argumentation as attested by the English and Polish versions of the Opinions of Advocates General which represent EU legal discourse. To this end, a parallel corpus approach is used to explore “prototypical” meanings and context-dependent renderings of selected English adverbs in the Polish language and to investigate the effect that omissions of these adverbs have on the argumentative force of the translated texts. The study not only shows conventional and ad hoc meanings of the adverbs analysed, but also reveals differences between the author visibility levels and the rhetorical force of the original English texts and that of their translated Polish equivalents...|$|R

Such a system is widely spread as <b>engagement</b> <b>device</b> in Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) and Dual-Clutch Transmissions (DCT) to manage the energy flow from the engine to the vehicle wheels. These modern transmissions introduce improvements on shifting quality, fuel consumptions, pollutant emissions at relatively low-cost respect to other automatic transmissions. In particular, the passengers’ comfort and moreover the control action {{with regard to the}} clutch engagement, is strongly influenced by the clutch torque characteristic model implemented in the Transmission Control Unit (TCU). Thus, a phenomenological approach to model the torque transmitted by the specific clutch architecture is a critical matter to design robust engagement control strategies. To this aim the controller performance of an actuated dry clutch by taking into account the uncertainty of the frictional phenomena on the clutch torque characteristic has been investigated in this work. The outcomes of this analysis prove the limits related to poor modelling of the influence of operating variables on the clutch torque, even when advanced control algorithms are implemented in the TCU...|$|R

30|$|The {{following}} three chapters {{in connection with}} multimodality constitute Section 8. Delu Zhang in Chapter 14 studies lexicogrammar and text in multimodal discourse analysis. It is suggested that the ways of analyzing multimodal texts should be appropriate for their composition {{in terms of the}} roles of different modes that realize them. The next chapter by Yumin Chen attempts to investigate multimodal construction of dialogic engagement in the context of teaching English as a foreign language. Four types of multimodal resources as <b>engagement</b> <b>devices</b> are identified, i.e. labeling, dialog balloons, jointly-constructed texts and illustrations. In addition, voice interaction is explored in relation to contact/observe, social distance and point of view. These discoveries facilitate the understanding of dialogic process in multimodal pedagogic context. Chapter 16, by Xiran Yang & Jonathan J. Webster, is intended to study meaning-making in Japanese shonen manga, a particular type of multimodal narrative, by relating meaning-making in manga reading to readers’ eye movements. The top-down framework is SFL-based while the bottom-up data are collected through the methodology of eye tracking.

40|$|Atypical {{vocabulary}} {{has been}} reported {{as one of the}} most notable features of the language of adolescents and adults with Williams syndrome (WS), including use of unusual or low frequency words. Two hypotheses were identified regarding the developmental origins of this phenomenon. The intra-lexicon hypothesis views the cause in terms of domain specific anomalies of structure or activation dynamics in the WS lexicon. The extra-lexicon hypothesis views the cause in terms of pragmatic influences, whereby individuals with WS use social <b>engagement</b> <b>devices</b> in their language in service of their ‘‘hyper-social’’ profile (Jones et al., 2000), and domaingeneral deficits to lexical-semantic representations in line with the level of learning disability present in WS. The hypotheses were evaluated using a speeded picture-naming task, in which frequency and semantic category were manipulated as implicit variables. The performance of 16 adolescents and adults with WS was compared with two individually matched control groups, one matched on chronological age (CA) and the other on receptive vocabulary age (RVA). Developmental trajectories were also constructed to assess the relationship between performance and age. Results indicated slower and less accurate naming in the WS group compared with both CA and RVA groups, but frequency and semantic category effects in line with the RVA group. Trajectories were delayed but not atypical. The data support a normal encoding of word frequency (rarity) in the WS lexicon, with rareword usage explained as a pragmatic aspect of the WS social profile. The finding sets bounds on the domain-specificity of the complex developmental pathway between atypical genotype and atypical phenotype in WS...|$|R
30|$|The {{comment in}} Example 4 is {{explicitly}} framed {{with the words}} tongue in cheek, a lexical metaphor which also functions {{as a type of}} engagement, a matter of indicating dialogic position with respect to the audience: the writer declares that what s/he is saying here is not serious. The intertextual parody activated within this segment is also framed in turn and realised by paratextual elements (Genette 1997 : 3) in the use of[*]<angle brackets[*]>[*]which denote html tags being opened and closed. In this way the addressees are positioned as knowledgeable of internet contexts: the use of html tags can be considered to carry (adapted from Maton 2014) an ‘epistemological charge’, by reference to a coding language not everyone might recognise at that time, hence also acting to imply affiliation through knowledge – bearing in mind that this specific electronically-mediated discussion was conducted entirely in ASCII using a text-only delivery. This rhetorical/graphical device deploys strong ‘semantic density’, that is, an example of a high degree of what Maton (2014 : 153 ff) calls ‘epistemological condensation’, in the service of construing a relationship of legitimate knower in the field, and thus as someone {{who is a member of}} that group of cognoscenti who are knowledgeable about internet protocols. Its use here also acts to co-position addressees as members of this group, which in turn acts to defuse any offence which might have been caused. Here of course, discussion on the nature of evaluative stance and its relationship to invoking attitude shades into the realm of the interpersonal in general. The use of intertextual references in this excerpt support the explicit evaluative lexis used, and point to the fact that <b>engagement</b> <b>devices,</b> rather than specifically attitudinal lexis, operate in these texts to invoke evaluative stances towards not only people and objects, but also propositions (c.f.

40|$|The Office of Security of Defense 2 ̆ 7 s Assured Fuels Initiative has {{recently}} been pressing for a single fuel battle space. This endeavor requires modifying many of the vehicle power plants currently in operation throughout the Armed Forces. The RQ- 7 Shadow, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) utilized by the Marine Corp and Army for reconnaissance purposes, is powered by UEL 2 ̆ 7 s AR 741 rotary engine and functions on aviation fuel. One effort underway {{has been focused on}} developing this rotary engine system to operate on heavy fuels using direct injection technology and charge stratification. Although the rotary engine has many advantages over standard reciprocating engines, providing a reliable ignition source for the stratified charge within the sweeping combustion chamber presents challenges. This work made effort to compensate for those challenges by utilizing a pilot flame ignition system. The system incorporated a micro-diesel injector and spark plug recessed within an ignition cavity along the housing of the rotary engine. The pilot flame ignition approach was thoroughly evaluated by conducting a parametric study using computational methods to simulate the combustion process. Gambit meshing software was used to build the 3 D <b>rotary</b> engine <b>mesh.</b> ANSYS Fluent was used to formulate and apply the various numerical models describing the combustion phenomena. And lastly, JMP software was used to perform a response surface analysis in effort to determine the optimal parameter values for the ignition system. The goal of the parametric study was to maximize power output and likewise minimize specific fuel consumption. A total of thirty one cases were performed to complete the study. For the rotary engine operating at 6000 rpm an optimal solution was successfully realized within the design space. The rotary engine model generated 5. 313 horsepower (HP) for the complete cycle of one chamber. The overall equivalency ratio allocated in the combustion chamber for the simulations was 0. 55. This resulted in a specific fuel consumption of 0. 395 lb/hp-h.
