40|$|Ice {{accretion}} is {{a purely}} unsteady phenomenon that is presently approximated by most icing codes using quasi-steady modeling. The accuracy of ice prediction is thus {{directly related to}} the arbitrarily prescribed time span during which the impact of ice growth on both flow and droplets is neglected. The objective of this work is to remove this limitation by implementing a cost-effective unsteady approach. This is done by fully coupling, in time, a diphasic flow (interacting air and droplet particles) with the ice accretion model. The two-phase flow is solved using the Navier-Stokes and Eulerian droplet equations with dual-time stepping in order to improve computational time. The ice shape is either obtained from the conservation of mass and energy within a thin film layer for glaze and mixed icing conditions, or from a mass balance between water droplets impingement and mass flux of ice for <b>rime</b> <b>icing</b> conditions. The iced surface being constantly displaced in time, Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian terms are added to the governing equations to account for mesh movement. Moreover, surface smoothing techniques are developed to prevent degradation of the iced-surface geometric discretization. For rime ice, the numerical results clearly show that the new full unsteady modeling improves the accuracy of ice prediction, compared to the quasi-steady approach, while in addition ensuring time span independence. The applicability of the unsteady icing model for predicting glaze ice accretion is also demonstrated by coupling the diphasic model to the Shallow Water Icing Model. A more rigorous analysis reveals that this model requires the implementation of local surface roughness and that previous quasi-steady validations cannot be carried out using a small number of shots, therefore the need for unsteady simulation...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{a number}} of studies {{dedicated}} to the sensitivity of deep convection simulations to the properties of the <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> species in microphysics schemes, no consensus has been achieved {{on the nature of the}} impact. Considering the need for improved quantitative precipitation forecasts, it is crucial that the cloud modeling community better understands the reasons for these differing conclusions and knows the relevance of these sensitivities for the numerical weather prediction. This study examines the role of environmental conditions and storm type on the sensitivity of precipitation simulations to the nature of the <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> species (graupel or hail). Idealized 3 D simulations of supercells/multicells and squall lines have been performed in varying thermodynamic environments. It has been shown that for simulation periods of sufficient length (. 2 h), graupel-containing and hail-containing storms produce domain-averaged surface precipitation that is more similar than many earlier studies suggest. While graupel is lofted to higher altitudes and has a longer residence time aloft than hail, these simulations suggest that most of this graupel eventually reaches the surface and the surface precipitation rates of hail- and graupel-containing storms converge. However, environmental conditions play an important role in the magnitude of this sensitivity. Storms in large-CAPE environments (typical of storms in the U. S. Midwest) are more sensitive than their low-CAPE counterparts (typical of storms in Europe) to the nature of the <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> species in terms of domain-average surface precipitation. Supercells/multicells are more sensitive than squall lines to the nature of the <b>rimed</b> <b>ice</b> species in terms of spatial precipitation distribution and peak precipitation, disregarding of the amount of CAPE. © 2013 American Meteorological Society...|$|R
