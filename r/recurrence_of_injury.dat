50|$|An injured tendon is {{very slow}} to heal. Partial tears heal by the rapid {{production}} of disorganized type-III collagen which is weaker than normal tendon. <b>Recurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> in the damaged {{region of the}} tendon is common.|$|E
5000|$|Tendinitis is {{inflammation}} of a tendon. Tendons connect muscles to bone and normally have an elastic property {{so that they}} can stretch. Tendinitis occurs when the tendon is overstretched or overloaded, which causes straining (tearing) of individual or multiple fibers and the formation of a lesion. A lesion is strained tendon fibers with associated hemorrhage (bleeding) and edema (fluid retention). Often strained tendons go undetected or may be subclinical before the clinical signs of tendonitis are observed. [...] Tendinitis is characterized by heat, swelling, and pain. Racehorses often experience tendinitis when transitioning from sedentary activity to conditioning work. Thus young horses and those returning to exercise from lay-off are those most expected to suffer from tendinitis. The incidence of tendon injuries is approximately 30% among Thoroughbred racehorses in training, mostly in the SDFT of the forelimbs. Horsemen frequently refer to tendonitis as bowed tendon due to the bowed appearance of the SDFT. [...] Bowed tendons force 25% of racehorses to retire and are the most common non-fatal career-ending injury. [...] Racehorses are so often retired after tendinitis because as many as 70% {{will not be able to}} return to their previous level of performance and more than 66% of them will have a <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b>|$|E

In each case, clinical diagnosis was followed up with biochemical profiling and sonographic investigations. Management consisted of rest from elite level competition and intense rehabilitation to address any potential risk factors for rectus femoris strain. A 4 -week course of acetic acid iontophoresis was administered to the first myositis ossificans lesion on the left thigh; however, as this did not result in any significant changes to the lesion’s dimensions, it was not used on the contralateral lesion. The athlete returned to full sporting capacity 4 months after the first lesion was diagnosed.

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this case report is to {{describe}} and discuss the successful management of osteitis pubis in a semi-elite Australian Rules football player through the utilization of an individualized multi-modal treatment approach provided by a chiropractor. Clinical Features A 20 -year-old male semi-elite Australian Rules football player presented to a chiropractic clinic with groin pain of eight months duration. A clinical diagnosis of osteitis pubis was made through synthesis of the patient history and physical examination. Intervention and Outcome Treatment consisted of high velocity low amplitude spinal manipulative therapy, mechanically assisted adjusting techniques utilizing a hand-held mechanical thrusting instrument and drop piece table, myofascial release and active release soft tissue techniques, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching, and an individually designed rehabilitation program. Resolution of signs and symptoms occurred over four weeks. No <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> was reported over a six-month period. Conclusions This case suggests that the implementation of an individualized multi-modal management approach directed specifically toward an athlete&# 039;s deficiencies and requirements, {{may lead to a}} more rapid recovery from osteitis pubis...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} incidence and severity <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> in Greek team handball and to correlate the endogenous factors, the type of exercise and the environment of team handball with the <b>injuries</b> <b>of</b> players at different levels. The study sample consisted of 216 male team handball players. Each player individually completed a self-reported questionnaire related to the injuries they had sustained for the duration of the previous 24 months. The results showed a high incidence and severity <b>of</b> <b>injuries</b> (42. 6 %) and (64. 2 %) respectively. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>injuries</b> had a correlation with the competitive level, previous injuries and the localization <b>of</b> an <b>injury.</b> The severity <b>of</b> an <b>injury</b> had a correlation with the hospitalization. The time <b>of</b> an <b>injury,</b> (that is, during training or at a match) also had a correlation with the competitive level of the players.

Classification of contu-sions was based on knee range of motion at 12 to 24 hours after the injury (mild,> 90 &deg;; moderate, 45 &deg; to 90 &deg;; severe, < 45 &deg;). The average disability time was 13 days for mild, 19 days for moderate, and 21 days for severe contusions. Myositis ossificans developed in 9 % of cadets and was associated with five risk factors (knee motion less than 120 &deg;, injury occurring during football, previous quadriceps injury, delay in treatment greater than 3 days, and ipsilateral knee effusion). Quadriceps femoris contusion is defined as an external blow to the anterior, medial, or lateral thigh {{in the area of the}} muscle belly of the quadriceps femoris.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Biokinetics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Professional rugby {{union has}} grown to become the third most popular team contact sport in the world. The {{physical}} nature of the game results in a high prevalence of injuries on all levels of play. Injury prevalence as high as 83. 9 injuries per 1000 playing hours has been reported for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. Although research indicates schoolboy rugby union to be safer than professional rugby, injury rates as high as 65. 8 injuries per 1000 playing hours have been reported. These injuries are mostly caused by the tackle situation, with the knee– and shoulder–joints being the most injured site. The risk of injuries in rugby union is heightened by professionalism, previous injuries, higher training demands, intrinsic factors and psychological issues. Due to the professional nature the game has taken on, the management of rugby union injuries has become increasingly more important. This should include prehabilitation or injury prevention programs, rehabilitation up until the final, sport specific phase as well as structured return to play testing. Another important aspect of injury management is the education of coaches, players and other persons involved in the sport. Objectives The first objective {{of the study was}} to observe the prevalence and nature of injuries in South African schoolboy rugby union players. Secondly, the treatment of these injuries was observed as well as the return to play criteria used to determine readiness to return to play after injury. The association between the treatment of injuries and the severity of injuries was then obtained. Lastly re–injury prevalence was compared to treatment received and return to play criteria used to determine readiness. Methods Ten schools from across South Africa partook in the study. The schools were all identified by the NWU–PUK as elite schools due to performances in the previous year (2008). Only the first team squad of each school was participated, amounting to a total number of 194 boys answering questionnaires conducted by the researcher for each of their injuries. The questionnaires included injury severity and site, <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> cause of injury, treatment procedures and criteria used for return to play. Severity was defined in terms of game and training days missed due to injury and are describe as slight (0 – 1 day), minimal (2 - 3 days), mild (4 - 7 days), moderate (8 - 28 days) or severe (> 28 days). The results were then analyzed and presented through descriptive statistics. Statistical significance was indicated by p = 0. 5. Results A total number of 118 injuries were reported amounting to 78. 51 injuries per 1000 playing hours. New injuries accounted for 68. 64 % (n= 81) while recurrent injuries was reported to be 31. 36 % (n= 37). The most frequent site of injury was the knee (n= 26), followed by the shoulder (n= 21). The event leading to injury that was most frequently reported, was the tackle (including making the tackle and being tackled) (n= 49). Most injuries were slight (48 %) but a high rate of moderate and severe injuries (39 %) were reported. These moderate to severe injuries resulted in a minimum total of 360 days missed. Severe injuries were more likely to be treated by a doctor. Treatment by a doctor for severe injuries indicated the only significance in the study (p = 0. 7). No fixed return to play protocol was in place for deciding if a player should be allowed to return to play. Thirteen of the injuries were however investigated through further testing (either through isokinetic or on–field testing). Conclusion Injury prevalence amongst top teams in South African schoolboy rugby union is very high. Rehabilitation does not follow a structured program or guidelines and there is no definite return to play protocols available. Re–injury rates are high, possibly due to the lack of structured rehabilitation and return to play protocols. Master...|$|E

For two years we observed a total of 185 patients who had had primary shoulder dislocation. Excluded from the study were patients who had fractures associated with metabolic disorders that favored neurologic deficit. During the period of study, 98 patients contacted us again after <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> the dislocation: there were 89 patients aged over 60 years and 9 aged below 60 years. All of the patients were evaluated clinically and submitted to EMG in order to verify the condition of the axillary nerve. Four patients (4 %) had neuroapraxia of the axillary nerve. One of these also had neuroapraxia of the radial nerve. Of the four patients, one was a male aged 34 years; the others were all aged over 60 years. In all of the cases, function of the axillary nerve completely recovered after a mean period of 4 months (3 - 5. 3 months) after <b>recurrence.</b> <b>Injury</b> <b>of</b> the axillary nerve can occur at the time <b>of</b> the first <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>injury.</b> However, prevalence is significantly lower than that observed after primary dislocation.
