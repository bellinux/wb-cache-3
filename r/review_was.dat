5|$|In February 2008, a {{cease and desist}} {{was given}} to a writer at CC2K.us after they posted an advance script review for the film. The Latino Review also posted an advance review. At the time CC2K.us {{received}} their cease and desist order, questions were raised why Latino Review's largely positive script <b>review</b> <b>was</b> allowed to stay posted while CC2K was being forced by Fox Searchlight to remove their mainly negative coverage. Although Latino <b>Review</b> <b>was</b> later asked to remove their review, numerous other websites and blogs published their own critiques of the script.|$|E

50|$|Clinical Peer <b>Review</b> <b>is</b> {{the process}} by which health care {{professionals}} evaluate each other’s clinical performance. Clinical peer <b>review</b> <b>is</b> segmented by discipline. No inter-disciplinary models for clinical peer <b>review</b> have <b>been</b> described. Physician Peer <b>Review</b> <b>is</b> most common and is found in virtually all hospitals. Peer <b>review</b> <b>is</b> also done in some settings by other clinical disciplines including nursing and pharmacy. Initially used by Dans, Clinical Peer <b>Review</b> <b>is</b> the best term to collectively refer to all such activity.|$|R

5|$|From time to time, BBRC has re-reviewed {{records that}} it {{previously}} accepted, {{to ensure they}} are acceptable {{in the light of}} improved knowledge of the species in question. These reviews are carried out on a species-by-species basis. Old World warblers have proved particularly in need of re-review. A review of greenish warbler records was initiated in 1983. The purpose of this <b>review</b> <b>was</b> to establish whether records, particular those in late autumn and winter, of drab grey Phylloscopus warblers, which had previously been accepted as greenish warbler, were in fact this species, or were common chiffchaffs of the Siberian race tristis. 48 records between 1958 and 1970 were examined. Of these, 20 were rejected. A review of Arctic warbler records was begun in 1991, with the aim of determining whether any greenish warblers had been mistakenly accepted as Arctics. The <b>review</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1994, although as of 2009, the results had not been published.|$|E
5|$|In July 1957, a defence <b>review</b> <b>was</b> announced, which {{resulted}} in the amalgamation of the North Staffordshire Regiment with the South Staffordshire Regiment, with the new regiment becoming part of the new administrative Mercian Brigade.

Less technically skilled interviewees coped with these challenges by collaborating with other people, but they were less positive about their respective site’s success compared to interviewees whose skills enabled them to work alone. We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R
5|$|It {{is true that}} a {{house that}} is between two {{destroyed}} homes can be undamaged, {{but this is not}} the result of a tornado skipping, as some previously thought. After the 1974 Super Outbreak, Dr. Ted Fujita studied many films of tornadoes from that day. Included in his <b>review</b> <b>was</b> damage and tornado film footage of F4 and F5 tornadoes. Fujita concluded that multiple vortices, highly volatile tornadic satellites transiting within a parent tornado at high speeds, are responsible for making tornadoes appear to skip houses. The phenomenon of satellite tornadoes, where a smaller tornado orbits a larger companion tornado, can also lead to gaps in damage between the two tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the back}} of the cover, the UK album {{contained}} a review of the White Album written for The Observer by Tony Palmer.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, in which the ensemble's battle with the Blue Meanies was compared to three other epic struggles {{in the history of the}} English-speaking world: Beowulf's struggle to save the Heorot mead hall, King John's signing of the Magna Carta and Thomas Jefferson's writing of the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps most important, the Analytical Review {{provided}} {{a forum for}} radical political and religious ideas. Although it aimed at impartiality, its articles were often critical of the British government and supportive of the French revolutionaries. While the journal had low circulation numbers for its day, it still influenced popular opinion and was feared by the conservative government of William Pitt the Younger. In late 1797, the Anti-Jacobin, the self-styled nemesis of the Analytical <b>Review,</b> <b>was</b> founded by supporters {{of the government and}} other reactionary interests; it criticized the radical politics of the Analytical and monitored it for unpatriotic and irreligious sentiments.|$|E

40|$|Background Systematic <b>reviews</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} in evaluating evidence concerning {{the health of}} people with intellectual disabilities. This study conducts a systematic review to identify strengths and gaps in this evidence. Method Electronic literature searches and email requests identified systematic reviews published in English from 2008 to 2013 on the health or health care of people with intellectual disabilities. <b>Reviews</b> <b>were</b> categorized using ICD- 10 chapter headings and information extracted regarding methods, number of studies reviewed and findings. Results Ninety-four <b>reviews</b> <b>were</b> identified: 52 related to ICD- 10 Chapter V: Mental or behavioural disorders, 28 to Chapter XXI: Factors influencing health status and contact with services, and 14 related to other chapters or encompassed multiple chapters. Nine <b>reviews</b> <b>were</b> empty'. No <b>reviews</b> <b>were</b> found for many ICD- 10 chapter headings. Conclusions Systematic <b>reviews</b> <b>are</b> heavily weighted towards mental health, with little coverage of several areas important {{to the health and}} mortality of people with intellectual disabilities...|$|R
5|$|The Accounting <b>Review</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1926. In its early decades, the journal tended to publish articles {{that would be}} of interest to accounting practitioners, but over time it shifted towards a preference for quantitative model building and mathematical rigor. In the 1980s the AAA began to publish two other journals, Issues in Accounting Education and Accounting Horizons, that were more relevant to accounting educators and accounting practitioners respectively, to allow The Accounting Review to focus more heavily on quantitative articles.|$|E
5|$|The Accounting Review, {{launched}} in 1926 by William Andrew Paton, {{is one of}} the oldest academic journals in accounting. The American Association of University Instructors of Accounting, which later became the American Accounting Association, originally proposed that the association publish a Quarterly Journal of Accountics, but the proposal did not see fruition, and The Accounting <b>Review</b> <b>was</b> subsequently born. Paton served as editor and production manager in the journal's first three years.|$|E
5|$|The Analytical <b>Review</b> <b>was</b> {{meant to}} {{enlighten}} {{the public as}} well as to simplify communication between authors separated by great distances; most importantly, the debates between those authors could be read by the public. In granting authors a public forum in which to communicate, periodicals such as the Analytical helped to define authorship—they encouraged the professionalization of writing and granted prestige to writers and journalists.|$|E

Cornwell, {{who later became}} West Virginia's governor, and his brother William B. Cornwell purchased the newspaper in 1890. The newspaper continued to operate from {{the second floor of}} the Wirgman Building until 1895, when the Cornwell brothers relocated the Hampshire Review office and printing plant to the first floor of their new brick building on West Main Street. In the newspaper's printing plant on {{the second floor of the}} Wirgman Building, the Hampshire <b>Review</b> <b>was</b> printed by a hand-operated Benjamin Franklin printing press.|$|E
5|$|The Local Government Act 1958 {{designated}} the south east Lancashire area (which, despite its name, included part of north east Cheshire), a Special Review Area. The Local Government Commission for England presented draft recommendations, in December 1965, proposing a new county {{based on the}} conurbation surrounding and including Manchester, with nine most-purpose boroughs corresponding to the modern Greater Manchester boroughs (excluding Wigan). The <b>review</b> <b>was</b> abolished in favour of the Royal Commission on Local Government before issuing a final report.|$|E
5|$|The {{author of}} the change which {{introduced}} Heartbleed, Robin Seggelmann, stated that he missed validating a variable containing a length and denied any intention to submit a flawed implementation. Following Heartbleed's disclosure, Seggelmann suggested focusing on the second aspect, stating that OpenSSL is not reviewed by enough people. Although Seggelmann's work was reviewed by an OpenSSL core developer, the <b>review</b> <b>was</b> also intended to verify functional improvements, a situation making vulnerabilities much easier to miss.|$|E

5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial <b>review</b> <b>was</b> subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial <b>review</b> <b>was</b> expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E
5|$|A modern <b>review</b> <b>was</b> {{given by}} University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan {{recognizes that the}} film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that {{it seems as if}} he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
