40|$|The {{upper reach}} of the Yangtze River is an ecologically {{sensitive}} region where water loss, soil erosion, and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution are serious issues. In this drainage area, <b>regosol</b> is the most widely distributed soil type. Cultivation on <b>regosol</b> is extensive and total nitrogen (TN) has become a common NPS pollutant.

Furthermore, negative correlations were more obvious on fields with slopes of 5 ° and 25 ° than on other slopes. With increasing rainfall intensity, TN loads rose simultaneously. However, TN concentration in runoff-yielding time presented a decline over time. As far as terrain was concerned, TN loads grew generally but not limitlessly when slopes increased. Similarly, TN concentrations also rose with rising slopes; upward trends were more obvious for steeper slopes.

Nitrogen is a macro-nutrient that is {{the primary}} {{determinant}} in corn crop production that is cultivated on dry land. Corn production can be increased by providing inorganic and organic fertilizer. The purpose of the research is to discover the influence of carbamide (urea fertilizer) and cow manure fertilizer levels on the growth of corn production on <b>regosol</b> dry land. The research was conducted from March-June, 2012, at the Gadjah Mada University (UGM) Agriculture Faculty Tridarma Garden, in Banguntapan. The experimental design uses a Complete Group Random Design (RAKL) which consists of two factors. The first factor provides three different amounts of carbamide (100 kg/ha, 150 kg/ha, and 200 kg/ha). The second factor has three different amounts of cow manure fertilizer (10 t/ha, 15 t/ha, and 20 t/ha). The research findings show that the plant height, leaf width, total plant net weight, blossom period, harvest period, seed weight, chlorophyll level, and N-leaf level {{are influenced by the}} amount of carbamide, while the amount of cow manure fertilizer can repair the physiological and chemical nature of the soil.

Soil resistance to acidification depends on the soil fundamental characteristics such as reaction, texture, content and nature of humus, cation exchange capacity, etc. Based on the calculation of soil buffering capacity indicator for reaction, the vulnerability map to soil acidification in the Zlatna area, Budeni-Izvorul Ampoiului-Mets-Sard-Alba Iulia sector was drawn. Within this area, four classes of soil vulnerability to acidification were designated. Soils with high vulnerability are extended on a small area (2320 ha - 4, 8 %) and are represented by the following soils: Rhodic-dystric Cambisols, Leptirodic-dystric cambisols, Rhodic Cambisols, Rhodic-leptic <b>Regosols,</b> Albic-stagnic Luvisols, Stagnic Luvisols.
