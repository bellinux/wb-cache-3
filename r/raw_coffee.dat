40|$|Many Americans {{are getting}} {{sick of the}} way things have become and the way things are, from the {{government}} {{to the quality of}} food we put into our bodies. We are upon a new frontier, people are changing the way they live and consume. The days of quantity over quality are fading. Many consumers are making purchases and consumption decisions based on more than a simple cost analysis. How and where a given product was produced, whether or not the trade involved of a given product was truly ethical, and what are the environmental implications of getting that product to the final consumer, are all, or should be, just as important factors as cost when making consumer decisions. In the case for coffee, the time for an artisan intervention has arrived. No longer are the days when the masses knew coffee as dry brown grindings that provide a bitter caffeine jolt. With communication technology today and the means available to a small group of westerners, it is now possible to source the best tasting <b>raw</b> <b>coffees</b> directly from the growers and co-op’s themselves. This model of “direct trade” enables the buyer to establish close relationships with producers to further influence and enhance the quality of the coffee grown, as well as enables the buyer and producer, as business partners, to set the price and production standards. The coffee house itself is the perfect medium for exploring the principles and benefits of sustainable business. Not only because of the vast new ways to minimize the environmental impact of retail operations or its ability to rally a counter culture and raise social awareness, but it is an opportunity to find that happy balance between ethics and economics—a way to do something as simple as sell coffee and {{have a positive effect on}} the lives of others, producers and consumers alike.

The supply of Black Ivory coffee depends on the availability of coffee cherries, the appetite of the elephants, the number of beans destroyed through chewing of the beans and the ability of the mahouts and their wives to recover intact beans.

Caffeine is a pharmacologically active substance and depending on the dose, can be a mild central nervous system stimulant, improve cardiac performance, increase brain circulation, and exhibit vasodilator and diuretic effect. It is also increase heartbeat rate, dilate blood vessels and elevate levels of free fatty acids and glucose in plasma. High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) method was validated for determination of the levels caffeine in raw and roasted coffee sample of Ilu Abba bora zone. Shim-pack VP-ODS column was used with water: ethanol 65 : 35 % (v/v) eluent. The detector wavelength was set at 272 nm. Linearity of the method was check from 20 - 100 ppm and the correlation coefficient was 0. 999.

Based {{on a survey}} of 700 Ugandan coffee-producing households conducted in 2008, I analyze a structural model which reflects the increasing complexity of coffee sale mode decisions in coffee marketing given price risk. I find that coffee unit values increase as market sales and levels of coffee processing at sale increase, while unit values decrease with farm gate sales and lower processing levels. Households that sell <b>raw</b> and/or dried <b>coffee</b> cherries at the farm gate have higher average discount rates than households that sell coffee as dried and processed cherries {{in the market and}} at hullers respectively.

40|$|The {{theories}} of monopolistic competition and ¡°love for variety¡± {{contend that the}} differences in firms¡¯ prices and market shares arise from product differentiation, which is linked to firms¡¯ fixed costs. This paper reviews these theories and their implications for prices and market shares of firms from developing countries seeking to expand their exports of processed agricultural goods. The study proposes a model showing {{the role of the}} firms¡¯ costs as a source of product differentiation. Using econometric methods, the model estimates the firms¡¯ residual demand elasticities, which indicate the degree of product differentiation and market power. The model also determines the effects of the firms¡¯ own costs and competitors¡¯ costs on the residual demand and market shares. Case studies for cocoa products and roasted coffee in the U.
