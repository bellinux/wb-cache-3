5|$|Later Sunday morning, Fred Murray {{learned the}} damage to his vehicle would be covered by his auto insurance. He rented a car, dropped Murray off at the university, and {{departed}} for Connecticut. At 11:30 that night, Fred Murray called his daughter Maura to <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> to obtain accident forms from the Registry of Motor Vehicles. They agreed to talk again Monday night to discuss the forms and fill out the insurance claim via phone.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E

Her choice of {{adjectives}} - [...] "excitable," [...] "red," [...] vivid" [...] - all imbue them {{with a sense of}} liveliness. In fact, they are dangerous and alluring like an African cat. Even their color <b>reminds</b> <b>her</b> of her wound, which implicitly suggests it <b>reminds</b> <b>her</b> of her past.|$|R
25|$|Ron Lieberman {{returned}} to the couple's apartment after midnight that night and noticed Philip was not there.

25|$|By the 17th {{century the}} teachings of Luo {{combined}} with other folk beliefs, namely Maitreyan millenarianism and the folk mother goddess. In the new mythological representation of Luo's enlightenment, humans are children of the primordial goddess. Confused by the desires of the material world, they have forgotten their celestial origin, and so the Mother sends emissaries to <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> children the possibility of return to the original condition in the Three Suns, or stages of the world. The three enlightened beings are Dipankara, Gautama and Maitreya the future one.|$|E
25|$|George P. Wilbur, who {{was cast}} as Michael Myers for this film, wore hockey pads under the costume {{to make himself}} look more {{physically}} imposing. During filming, {{the cast and crew}} {{made it a point to}} take it easy on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> that it was just a movie and he was not going to hurt her.|$|E

25|$|Yum-Yum {{is being}} {{prepared}} by her friends for her wedding ("Braid the raven hair"), after which she muses {{on her own}} beauty ("The sun whose rays"). Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo return to <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> of the limited duration of her impending union. Joined by Nanki-Poo and Pish-Tush, they try to keep their spirits up ("Brightly dawns our wedding-day"), but soon Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah enter to inform them of a twist in the law that states that when a married man is beheaded for flirting, his wife must be buried alive ("Here's a how-de-do"). Yum-Yum is unwilling to marry under these circumstances, and so Nanki-Poo challenges Ko-Ko to behead him on the spot. It turns out, however, that Ko-Ko has never executed anyone, not even a Blue bottle, and cannot execute Nanki-Poo, because the ex-tailor is too soft-hearted. Ko-Ko instead sends Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum away to be wed (by Pooh-Bah, as Archbishop of Titipu), promising {{to present to the}} Mikado a false affidavit in evidence of the fictitious execution.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Ron Weasley {{receives}} a Howler from his mother, Molly Weasley, after he steals his father's enchanted car and flies it to Hogwarts with Harry.

500|$|In 1961, the financially {{strapped}} author Pamela [...] "P. L."

Disney has pursued the film rights to her Mary Poppins stories for twenty years, having promised his daughters that he would produce a film based on them.

500|$|In her Life, {{she wrote}} that she taught {{herself from the}} {{instructions}} given in the book, The Third Spiritual Alphabet - by Francisco de Osuna - which relates to Franciscan mysticism. Her starting point was the practice of [...] "recollection", i.e. keeping the senses and the intellect in check and not allowing them to stray. In her meditations, one generally restricts attention to a single subject, principally the love of God. In The Way of Perfection she wrote: [...] "It is called recollection because the soul collects together all the faculties and enters within itself to be with God". She would use devices such as short readings, a scene of natural beauty or a religious statue or picture to <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> to keep her focus. She wrote that in due course, the mind naturally learns to maintain focus on God almost effortlessly.|$|E
