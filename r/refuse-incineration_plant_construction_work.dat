5000|$|The project, {{possibly}} Africa's largest eco-project to date, {{has created}} more jobs in Zimbabwe {{than any other}} in the last 20 years. Green Fuel is also supplying irrigation {{for the first time to}} peasant farmers working in dry areas around the sugar cane fields. It is foreseen that the venture will continue to create employment for more than 8000 people. Already, the venture is sponsoring nearly $2,000,000 every month in salaries alone for 120 full-time employees and hundreds of contract workers from villages dotted around the ARDA estates transforming the lives of people in Chisumbanje, including others at growth points such as Checheche and in towns as far afield as Chipinge and Chiredzi. Zimbabwe does not have personnel experienced in ethanol <b>plant</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> and through job training programmes, Green Fuel has created a set of skilled ethanol plant artisans marketable worldwide thereby empowering the local people through technological transfer. Moreover, the planned construction of the Kondo Dam for increased water volumes needed along the Save River will create more jobs for the rural populace. Further to this, a steel fabricating unit has been established in Harare with a staff of over 100 artisans involved in the manufacture of parts required for the ethanol project. 13 Local commuter bus companies in Chipinge have been contracted to ferry labor from the villages to the project site on a daily basis. More importantly, 30% of the artisans employed in the distillery and boiler sections of the ethanol plant are Zimbabweans previously based outside the country in South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique. Community leaders in Chisumbanje said they are fully behind the project as it will uplift their livelihoods, [...] "We really support the project as we are the first beneficiary in the sense that development will be realised in our once marginalized area. We shall benefit economically, infrastructural and even socially,” said one community leader.|$|R

Taking into account these challenges, we propose a first implementation of interactive 3 D CAD editing tools, based on the X 3 DOM technology and driven by a knowledge layer which utilizes a complete reference data and rules management system. To store the CAD models, a Macro-Parametric Approach has been investigated and a 3 D server has been added to the traditional PDM (Product or Plant Data Management) to execute remotely complex CAD operations. This is a very promising start to deploy lightweight and smart web 3 D CAD editing services for the AEC (Architecture Engineering Construction) and power industries...|$|R

40|$|Book, SectionAlpine rivers have {{undergone}} significant changes {{over the two}} last centuries. Human activities have modified their geometry through engineering measures to gain land for agricultural purposes and settlements, {{as well as through}} active mining to exploit gravel resources. Their sediment and water transfers have also been altered by hydropower- <b>plant</b> <b>construction,</b> control <b>works</b> on high-gradient streams, and catchment land-use changes. The resulting river morphological changes have led to abiotic (e. g., river-bed degradation and narrowing) and biotic (e. g., longitudinal and lateral disconnection) disruption. The current critical management situation (channel instability problems, flood effects, biodiversity decrease) has made river restoration a major issue in the Alps and their surroundings. Such an approach is reinforced by the European Water Framework Directive, which aims to ensure that rivers attain a good ecological status by 2015. In the Alps, space is not always easily available and boundary conditions have changed over the long term. A major challenge in river restoration in the Alpine environment is therefore to identify the processes and key parameters for improving both geomorphological and ecological conditions under often-restricted boundary conditions. Early attempts at river restoration mainly focused on small-scale measures. Today, successful restoration projects in high-energy and bedload-transportdominated conditions must include the full spectrum of scales, striving to initiate selfforming morphodynamics. In this context, we appraise restoration experiences from the Alps, focusing on channel widening and dike enlargement, former channel reconstruction and reconnection, promotion of bedload supply input from floodplains, tributaries, and hillslopes, as well as on bank erosion measures and restoration activities. We discuss the basic arguments behind such actions, their limitations, and research challenges...|$|R
50|$|The Minjur Desalination Plant is {{a reverse}} osmosis, water {{desalination}} plant at Kattupalli village, a northern suburb of Chennai, India, {{on the coast}} of the Bay of Bengal that supplies water to the city of Chennai.

Originally scheduled to be operational by January 2009, the work on the plant was delayed due to Cyclone Nisha in October 2008, which damaged a portion of the completed marine works and destroyed the cofferdam meant for the installation of transition pipes. The trial runs were completed in June 2010 and the plant was opened in July 2010. Water from the plant will be utilised chiefly for industrial purposes such as the Ennore Port and North Chennai Thermal Power Station. However, during droughts, water from the plant will be supplied to public, serving an estimated population of 1,000,000.|$|R
