5000|$|Four-wheel drive Tacomas (also 2WD crew cabs 2000-present) had six-stud {{wheel lug}} patterns, {{which had been}} used on the prior pickups (pre-Tacoma trucks). The truck's frame is fully boxed until {{immediately}} after the <b>rear</b> leaf <b>spring</b> mount <b>bracket</b> where it transitions into a c-frame section. The 3.4 V6's manual transmission was an R150F while the automatic transmission was an A340F (Aisin code is 30-40LE). From 95-97 Single cab Tacomas {{had the option of}} a manual transmission with the 3.4 V6 engine. The aftermarket TRD supercharged 3.4L V6 produced [...] and [...] From 1997 on, the single cabs only got a 2.7 L or a 2.4 L 4-cylinder from the factory. TRD packages started in 1997 (if the V6 engine was selected, a differential locker in the rear came with it).|$|R
500|$|Following {{experience}} of occasional cracks {{appearing in the}} frame plates near the <b>spring</b> <b>brackets,</b> had the second batch of Class 6 Standard Pacifics been built, the chassis would have been rearranged {{to be similar to}} that used on the solitary Class 8 Pacific. This would have resulted in the locomotive riding on three cast steel Combined Frame Stretcher & <b>Spring</b> <b>Brackets</b> carrying the 10 front-most <b>spring</b> <b>brackets</b> and lengthened <b>spring</b> <b>brackets</b> behind the <b>rear</b> driven axle. These Combined Frame Stretcher & <b>Spring</b> <b>Brackets</b> are often referred to as [...] "sub-frames". (Perhaps remarkably, the rearmost <b>spring</b> <b>brackets</b> were not to be integrated into a single cast combined sub-frame/pony truck pivot stretcher. The pony truck pivot stretcher being a separate fabrication).|$|R
500|$|Following {{experience}} of occasional cracks appearing near the <b>spring</b> <b>brackets</b> of the Britannias and Clans, a substantial rearrangement {{took place in}} this area {{that resulted in the}} locomotive riding on three cast steel [...] "sub-frames" [...] carrying the ten front-most <b>spring</b> <b>brackets</b> and lengthened <b>spring</b> <b>brackets</b> behind the <b>rear</b> driven axle. (Perhaps remarkably, these were not integrated into a cast combined sub-frame/pony truck pivot stretcher, the pony truck pivot stretcher being a fabrication.) Had the planned batch of further smaller Pacifics been built, they would have been fitted with this arrangement.|$|R
500|$|Following {{experience}} of occasional cracks appearing near the <b>spring</b> <b>brackets,</b> {{had one or}} more further batches of Class 7 Standard Pacifics been built to complete the intended 91 engines, the chassis would have been rearranged {{to be similar to}} that used on the solitary BR Standard Class 8 Duke of Gloucester and that drawn up by Derby Drawing Office for the 2nd batch of Class 6 Standard Pacifics.

50|$|The M-426 {{appeared}} in March 1967; like the delivery version, it had stiffer <b>rear</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Rear</b> <b>springs</b> were 15 inches {{longer than}} in the {{previous}} model. The brakes had servo assistance.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame is}} U-profile pressed from 8 mm thick steel, with profile height of 250 mm and 90 mm width. Both front and <b>rear</b> leaf <b>springs</b> are 1 500 mm long; the front springs consist of 11 leaves, <b>rear</b> <b>springs</b> have got 16 each.|$|R
50|$|The lowered stance was {{achieved}} using front coils {{with a different}} spring rate, and a 3-leaf <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> pack.|$|R
50|$|The GAZ-24-02 had generous {{interior}} {{area with}} 3 rows of seats and 7-8-passenger seating. Area {{behind the front}} seat could be converted into spacious one-level cargo compartment. 24-02 had heavy-duty <b>rear</b> leaf <b>springs</b> (six leaves {{as opposed to the}} sedan's five) and could carry up to 400 kg, thanks to stiffer <b>rear</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic four-wheel brakes by Lockheed are {{fitted with}} a vacuum servo. The frame passes below the <b>rear</b> <b>springs</b> to allow a low floor without wells within the foorboards.|$|R
50|$|Another version, the Type 17, {{was also}} produced. This used a 2550 mm (100.4 in) wheelbase. It shared its {{hexagonal}} radiator and <b>rear</b> <b>springs</b> with the Type 15.|$|R
2500|$|Chassis {{preparation}} included heavy-duty {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>springs</b> (part of the factory's optional handling package), <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> traction control arms, heavy-duty shock absorbers and a [...] "panhard" [...] type track {{bar in the}} rear to eliminate side sway. Stock wheels and tires were replaced by wide magnesium racing wheels and Goodyear racing tires. The cars were aerodynamically modified: the front ends were lowered, the hoods were slanted down and spoilers were installed below the front bumpers. The car interiors had structure-stiffening roll cages for driver protection, a stock bucket seat modified for additional support, and supplementary engine-monitoring instruments.|$|R
5000|$|The company advertised that [...] "strong {{features}} that make for Palmer-Moore popularity and repeat orders are the Buda four-cycle motor, an internal gear drive rear axle and Palmer's own distinctive <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> construction." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{improved}} handling {{package was}} introduced in 1985 that incorporated a revised front sway bar, gas filled shock absorbers, and lower friction <b>rear</b> <b>springs.</b> A total of 17,814 Grand Wagoneers were built for 1985.|$|R

50|$|Rear {{suspension}} initially used quarter-elliptic <b>rear</b> <b>springs,</b> but buyers frequently squeezed four or {{five people}} into the nominally two-seater car, and in later models the chassis was extended at the rear to allow for more robust semi-elliptic springs.|$|R
50|$|Although the sturdily {{constructed}} chassis {{was based}} on that from earlier Sunbeams, the hitherto characteristic semi-elliptical leaf springs were, at the back, replaced by cantilever <b>rear</b> <b>springs</b> which {{during the second half}} of the decade became a Sunbeam hallmark.|$|R
50|$|The {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} used existing components, but with unique twin <b>rear</b> <b>springs</b> {{to give a}} 1.75-ton payload. Using standard One Ten axles (Dana-designed units built by Salisbury Engineering) led to stability problems, so bespoke units were used, being 12-inches (30 cm) wider than the standard ones.|$|R

Hydraulic steering damper: (Mercedes type) to eliminate road shock.|$|R
50|$|Neither AJS or Matchless {{opted for}} plunger type <b>rear</b> <b>springing,</b> and the Model 16 {{retained}} a rigid rear frame until 1949, when pivoted rear suspension controlled by hydraulically dampened spring units designed and made by Matchless became available.

50|$|When first {{introduced}} into service, the Mitsubishi Shogun was operating above the vehicle maximum plated axle weight.

5000|$|Detail changes. Power {{increased}} from 139 to [...] The rear suspension linkage and <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> rate were replaced, improving handling. Pillion grab rails were added, the gearboxes were made stronger, and new six-piston Tokico front calipers replaced the previous model's four-piston units.
