500|$|Entertainment Weekly put [...] "the kiss in Spider-Man" [...] on its end-of-the-decade [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "There's a {{fine line}} between romantic and corny. And the rain-soaked smooch between Spider-Man and Mary Jane from 2002 tap-dances <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> line. The reason it works? Even if she {{suspects}} he's Peter Parker, she doesn't try to find out. And that's sexy." [...] Empire magazine ranked Spider-Man 437 in its 500 Greatest Movies of All Time list the following year.|$|E
500|$|... "Michael's Birthday" [...] {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews. Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad {{wrote that the}} episode was [...] "simply the best one yet", and that it [...] "was so brilliant and so <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> I can't give it any higher praise". Sciannamea went on to write that [...] "the scenes at the ice rink were hysterical" [...] and The Office [...] "is the best sitcom on TV". M. Giant of Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A". Lindsey Thomas of Rolling Stone magazine named the scene wherein Michael confuses the term [...] "negative" [...] to mean that Kevin has skin cancer as the seventeenth greatest moment in the series. Brendan Babish of DVD Verdict was moderately pleased with the entry and awarded it a [...] "B+". He called the entry a [...] "good episode", but noted that it was helped by [...] "great supporting work from Dwight", who he called [...] "as not only the best supporting character on the show, but perhaps the best in television." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, various legal experts were divided {{on whether the}} law would survive a court challenge, with one law {{professor}} saying it [...] "sits <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> thin line of pure state criminal law and federally controlled immigration law." [...] Past lower court decisions in this area were not always consistent and a decision on the bill's legality from the U.S. Supreme Court is one possible outcome.|$|E

I’ve done it in sparring with some hard kickers to let them know not to kick me anymore. Their legs didn’t break, but they would either take a minute to walk it off or they wouldn’t be kicking me as much. It’s something I’ve definitely been working on, thanks to Longo.” ...|$|E

50|$|On 23 January 2015, the {{president}} of Montenegro Filip Vujanović ordered the Montenegrin ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina to withdraw to Montenegro. The whole cabinet now stays in Podgorica. They cite that it's unacceptable that Bosnia and Herzegovina has such claims. Bosnian officials say that this move is just the confirmation of Montenegrin inability to prove that Montenegro has any <b>rights</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> territory.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{no basis}} for {{imposing}} a hidden legislative presumption on Parliament's intention: the rights in question in this case are created on the international plane, and then recognised by UK law; EU <b>rights</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> plane are altered and removed through the Crown's prerogative powers, {{and that is a}} [...] "significant step along the road to finding the intention in relation to withdrawal".|$|R

60|$|It was this, {{more than}} {{anything}} else, which made Paul resist; for {{even if he had}} no <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> particular spot, they surely had no right to take his papers from him; and besides, they were Johnny's property, not his. Therefore he felt he should defend them all the more strongly.|$|E

"It won't {{do to keep}} on the way we've been goin', Mr. Stubbs," [...] said Toby, as {{he looked}} full in his pet's face--and the old monkey sat as still and looked as grave as it was {{possible}} for him to look and sit--"for we must be going into the woods deeper.

6000|$|So Elspeth {{affected}} not to mind, {{and then}} he deserted her, conscience at rest, which was his nature. But he should have remained with her. The players only gave him the side of their eye, and a horrid fear grew on him {{that they did not}} know he was a Thrums boy. [...] "Dagont!" [...] he cried to put them <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> point, but though they paused in their game, it was only to laugh at him uproariously. Let the historian use an oath for once; dagont, Tommy had said the swear in the wrong place! ...|$|E

"No," [...] {{explained}} Mr. Hartington; [...] "seems they hitched {{a kind of}} nigger minstrel show <b>right</b> <b>on</b> to it--banjos and thingumajigs {{in front}} of the curtain while they was changin' scenes, and they hitched the second act <b>right</b> <b>on</b> to <b>that.</b> Nobody come out of the theatre at all.

25|$|In 2000, lawyers {{representing}} {{the families of}} the sailors killed onboard General Belgrano attempted to sue the British Government in the European Court of Human <b>Rights</b> <b>on</b> the grounds <b>that</b> the attack took place outside the exclusion zone.

6000|$|... "She {{has been}} doing nothing of the kind, and you know she hasn't," [...] said Miss Stanbury, raising her arm {{as though she were}} going to strike her opponent. [...] "But I am quite sure, Mr. Gibson, that you never could have {{authorised}} these young ladies to make such an assertion publicly on your behalf. Whatever there may have been of misunderstanding between you and me, I can't believe that of you." [...] Then she paused for a reply.

Well, p'r'aps I don't know much, but you should remember, lad, that an old salt wi' a compass in his wes'kit-pocket is not the man to lose his reck'nin'. I've got one here as'll put us all <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> score, for I was careful to take my bearin's when we set sail, an' I've been keepin' an eye on our course all the way.

6000|$|The {{other day}} (confided Reginald), when I was killing {{time in the}} {{bathroom}} and making bad resolutions for the New Year, {{it occurred to me that}} I would like to be a poet. The chief qualification, I understand, is that you must be born. Well, I hunted up my birth certificate, and found that I was all <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> score, and then I got to work on a Hymn to the New Year, which struck me as having possibilities. It suggested extremely unusual things to absolutely unlikely people, which I believe is the art of first-class catering in any department. Quite the best verse in it went something like this-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, old man, I {{want you}} to fill {{yourself}} <b>right</b> up <b>on</b> <b>that,</b> 'cause Miss Carter said they was awful good for sick people, an' I 'low they'll straighten you out in pretty nigh less'n no time!" ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Curtis, 50 Cent explained that fans [...] "should {{not expect to}} see guest appearances like you saw on Curtis". He also described Before I Self Destruct as an entirely different concept, which will set up [...] "the next batch of records" [...] in his career. After 50 Cent's collaboration with Akon on [...] "I'll Still Kill", which appeared on Curtis, Akon stated that 50 Cent and himself would be working on each other's upcoming albums due to the successful experience they developed while working <b>on</b> Curtis, and <b>that,</b> when working <b>on</b> songs, [...] "Whoever’s album it feel <b>right</b> <b>on,</b> <b>that’s</b> where we gonna put it".|$|R
6000|$|... "Right, quite <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> {{point we}} agree exactly. I have spared nothing {{to give my}} boys good {{principles}} and good habits, and I am willing to trust them anywhere. Nine times did I whip my Steve to cure him of fibbing, {{and over and over}} again did Mac go without his dinner rather than wash his hands. But I whipped and starved them both into obedience, and now I have my reward," [...] concluded the [...] "stern parent" [...] with a proud wave of the fan, which looked very like a ferule, being as big, hard, and uncompromising as such an article could be.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{can imagine}} how delighted Nutty was when I came in {{and told him that}} I was engaged to you. In his curious way, he took it for granted that I had heard about his {{financial}} operations, and was doing it entirely for his sake, {{to get him out of}} his fix. And while I was trying to put him <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> point he began to console me. You see, Nutty looks on you as the enemy of the family, and it didn't strike him that it was possible that I didn't look on you in that light too. So, after being delighted for a while, he very sweetly thought that he ought to cheer me up and point out some of the compensations of marriage with you. And--Well, that was what you heard. There you have the full explanation. You can't possibly believe it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Oliver {{was of a}} {{good family}} in England; and so, when he made bold to ask the old Gineral for Ruth, he didn't say him nay: and it was agreed, as they was young, they should wait a year or two.

Jest <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>that,</b> the Captain's {{regiment}} was ordered home, and he had to go; and, the next they heard, it was sent off to India. And poor little Ruth she kind o' drooped and pined; but she kept true, and wouldn't have nothin' to say to nobody that came arter her, for there was lots and cords o' fellows as did come arter her. Ye see, Ruth had a takin' way with her; and then she had the name of bein' a great heiress, and that allers draws fellers, as molasses does flies.|$|E

40|$|Within {{reforms of}} loan {{security}} instruments law, Serbian Draft Law <b>on</b> Property <b>Rights</b> and Other Real Rights demonstrates interest for introducing {{new forms of}} non-accessory security rights. Real charge is a new institute in our legislation. It {{is a kind of}} real <b>right</b> <b>on</b> immovable thing <b>that</b> is regulated after the model of the German and Swiss laws, and which is in practice mostly used to secure a receivable, so that it is, to an extent, a personal hypothec. The most important reason for introduction of this institute into the Law was to allow for a security <b>right</b> <b>on</b> immovables <b>that</b> is more flexible than the accessorial hypothec, thus creating the environment conducive {{for the development of the}} secondary market of real loans, facilitating refinancing, and allowing for the extension of the offer of bank products with the reduction of transaction costs...|$|R
