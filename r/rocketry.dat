5|$|Sofy Alvarez-Bareiro, a {{high school}} student from Brooklyn, New York, {{assisted}} the President in gazing at the moon through a telescope. She explained to the President that craters on the moon were caused by impacts from space materials. The Russellville, Alabama-based group Russellville City Schools Engineering Rocket Team attended the event and were personally recognized by President Obama. Team members Chelsea Suddith, Katie Burns, Niles Butts, Andrew Heath, Cristian Ruiz, Cady Studdard and Evan Swinney were requested by the President to stand at the event and speak to the crowd about the <b>rocketry</b> accomplishments, which included achieving victory among contestants at the 2015 International <b>Rocketry</b> Challenge at the Paris Air Show. The students were able to meet celebrities who attended the event, including: Bill Nye, and MythBusters co-hosts Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s {{led many}} European scientists, {{including}} Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States. During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in <b>rocketry,</b> materials science, and aeronautics.|$|E
5|$|While {{recording}} {{an audio}} commentary for that film in 1997, Kneale speculated {{about a possible}} Quatermass prequel set in 1930s Germany. According to The Independent, Kneale conceived a storyline involving the young Quatermass becoming involved in German <b>rocketry</b> experiments in the 1930s, and helping a young Jewish woman to escape the country during the 1936 Berlin Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Parsons and Cameron {{decided to}} travel to Mexico for a few months, both for a {{vacation}} and for Parsons {{to take up a}} job opportunity establishing an explosives factory for the Mexican government. They hoped that this would facilitate a move to Israel, where they could start a family, and where Parsons could bypass the U.S. government to recommence his <b>rocketry</b> career. He was particularly disturbed by the presence of the FBI, convinced that they were spying on him.|$|E
5|$|The Review Board still {{considered}} Parsons a liability {{because of his}} historical Marxist affiliations and investigations by the FBI, and in January 1952 they permanently reinstated their ban on his working for classified projects, effectively prohibiting him from working in <b>rocketry.</b> To make a living he founded the Parsons Chemical Manufacturing Company, which was based in North Hollywood and created pyrotechnics and explosives such as fog effects and imitation gunshot wounds for the film industry, and he also returned to chemical manufacturing at the Bermite Powder Company in Saugus.|$|E
5|$|Apollo set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body. Apollo 8 {{was the first}} manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to <b>rocketry</b> and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in <b>rocketry,</b> where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Parsons {{separated}} from Helen after {{having an affair}} with her sister Sara; when Sara left him for L. Ron Hubbard, he conducted the Babalon Working, a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon to Earth. He and Hubbard continued the procedure with Marjorie Cameron, whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and went through various jobs while acting as a consultant for the Israeli rocket program. Amid the climate of McCarthyism, he was accused of espionage and left unable to work in <b>rocketry.</b> In 1952, Parsons {{died at the age of}} 37 in a home laboratory explosion that attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident, but many associates suspected suicide or assassination.|$|E
5|$|In Nigel Kneale's 1996 radio serial The Quatermass Memoirs, it is {{revealed}} that the Professor was first involved in <b>rocketry</b> experiments in the 1930s, and that his wife died young. The unmade prequel serial Quatermass in the Third Reich, an idea conceived by Kneale in the late 1990s, would have shown Quatermass travelling to Nazi Germany during the 1936 Berlin Olympics and becoming involved with Wernher von Braun and the German rocket programme, before helping a young Jewish refugee {{to escape from the}} country. According to The Quatermass Memoirs, during World War II Quatermass conducted top secret work for the British war effort, which he subsequently refused ever to discuss.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in <b>rocketry,</b> and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
5|$|The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, today {{known as}} DARPA) {{was formed in}} 1958 by President Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, in {{reaction}} to Soviet <b>rocketry</b> advances. US efforts had suffered from massive duplication of effort between the Army, Air Force, and Navy, {{and seemed to be}} accomplishing little in comparison to the Soviets. ARPA was initially handed the mission of overseeing all of these efforts. As the problems with Zeus became clear, McElroy also asked ARPA to consider the antimissile problem and come up with other solutions. The resulting Project Defender was extremely broad in scope, considering everything from minor Zeus system upgrades to far-out concepts like antigravity and the recently invented laser.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in Munich, Germany, Edward {{researches}} <b>rocketry</b> {{with his}} friend Alfons Heiderich, {{a young man who}} resembles Alphonse, in the hopes of returning to his world. Edward rescues a troubled, persecuted Romani woman named Noah from being sold. Noah is taken in by Edward to live with him and Alfons, and begins having visions concerning Edward's life in his world. The next day, Edward meets Fritz Lang, a Jewish film director resembling King Bradley, who persuades Edward into helping him hunt down a dragon he has been seeking for inspiration for his next film. The dragon, which turns out to be homunculus Envy, attacks Edward, but is then weakened and captured by members of the Thule Society.|$|E
5|$|Born in Los Angeles, Parsons {{was raised}} by a wealthy family on Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena. Inspired by science fiction literature, he {{developed}} an interest in <b>rocketry</b> in his childhood and in 1928 began amateur rocket experiments with school friend Ed Forman. He dropped out of Pasadena Junior College and Stanford University due to financial difficulties during the Great Depression, and in 1934 he united with Forman and graduate student Frank Malina to form the Caltech-affiliated Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT) Rocket Research Group, supported by Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory chairman Theodore von Kármán. In 1939 the GALCIT Group gained funding from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to work on Jet-Assisted Take Off (JATO) for the U.S. military. Following American entry into World War II, in 1942 they founded Aerojet to develop and sell their JATO technology; the GALCIT Group became JPL in 1943.|$|E
5|$|By early 1938 the Group {{had made}} their static rocket motor, which {{originally}} burned for three seconds, run for over a minute. In May that year, Parsons was invited by Forrest J Ackerman to lecture on his <b>rocketry</b> work at Chapter Number 4 of the Los Angeles Science Fiction League (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage Ray Bradbury. Another scientist {{to become involved in}} the GALCIT project was Sidney Weinbaum, a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive communist discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the People's Daily World and joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he refused to join the American Communist Party, causing a break in his and Weinbaum's friendship. This, coupled with the need to focus on paid employment, led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding members by late 1938.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hope}} of gaining access to the {{state-of-the-art}} resources of Caltech for their <b>rocketry</b> research, Parsons and Forman attended a lecture {{on the work of}} Austrian rocket engineer Eugen Sänger and hypothetical above-stratospheric aircraft by the institute's William Bollay— a PhD student specializing in rocket-powered aircraft—and approached him to express their interest in designing a liquid-fuel rocket motor. Bollay redirected them to another PhD student named Frank Malina, a mathematician and mechanical engineer composing a thesis on rocket propulsion who shared their interests and soon befriended the pair. Parsons, Forman, and Malina applied for funding from Caltech together; they did not mention that their ultimate objective was to develop rockets for space exploration, realizing that most of the scientific establishment then relegated such ideas to science fiction. While Caltech's Clark Blanchard Millikan immediately rebuffed them, Malina's doctoral advisor Theodore von Kármán saw more promise in their proposal and agreed to allow them to operate {{under the auspices of the}} university's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT). Naming themselves the GALCIT Rocket Research Group, they gained access to Caltech's specialist equipment, though the economics of the Great Depression left von Kármán unable to finance them.|$|E
5|$|The nearly {{continuous}} wars of {{the first}} three decades of the new century resulted in modernization, if not (because of the treasury limitations) enlargement, of the Commonwealth's army. The total military forces available ranged from a few thousands at the Battle of Kircholm, to the over fifty thousands plus pospolite ruszenie mobilized for the Khotyn (Chocim) campaign of 1621. The remarkable {{during the first half of}} the 17th century development of artillery resulted in the 1650 publication in Amsterdam of the Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima book by Kazimierz Siemienowicz, a pioneer also in the science of <b>rocketry.</b> Despite the superior quality of the Commonwealth's heavy (hussar) and light (Cossack) cavalry, the increasing proportions of the infantry (peasant, mercenary and Cossack formations) and of the contingent of foreign troops resulted in an army, in which these respective components were heavily represented. During the reigns of the first two Vasas a war fleet was developed and fought successful naval battles (1609 against Sweden). As usual, fiscal difficulties impaired the effectiveness of the military, and the treasury's ability to pay the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Although Edward has {{the same}} {{background}} and characteristics in the manga and anime, Edward meets different people and fights against variable enemies. In the first anime, Edward learns the secret to destroying a homunculus during his encounter with Greed, whom he kills {{in an effort to}} save Alphonse. When he learns of Scar's creation of a Philosopher's Stone within Alphonse, Edward saves the people of Lior from being sacrificed for its creation. During his battle against the homunculi, Edward is killed by Envy, but Alphonse trades himself for his brothers' revival. In doing so, however, Alphonse's armor with the philosopher's stone within it is used up and he disappears. After being revived, Edward sacrifices his own life to bring back his brother in exchange. As a result, Edward finds himself {{on the other side of}} the Gate, a parallel world, while Alphonse recovers his original body. Determined to return to Alphonse, Edward becomes involved in <b>rocketry</b> research in Germany, with the intention of using that technology to return to his home world. In the feature film, , set two years after the end of the anime, Edward has been living in Germany and looks for a way to return to his world. At the film's end, he decides to stay in the parallel world along with Alphonse so that they may try to protect both worlds.|$|E
5|$|The Parsons family spent mid-1929 {{on a tour}} of Europe before {{returning}} to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the Great Depression their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack's grandfather Walter died. Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching. He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school's newspaper El Universitano and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech) honed his attentions on the study of chemistry. With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the Hercules Powder Company, where he learned more about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion. He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel rocket engine, and with Forman corresponded with pioneer rocket engineers including Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Willy Ley and Wernher von Braun. Parsons and von Braun had hours of telephone conversations about <b>rocketry</b> in their respective countries as well as their own research.|$|E
5|$|When he was twelve, Parsons began {{attending}} Washington Junior High School, {{where he}} performed poorly—something biographer George Pendle attributed to undiagnosed dyslexia—and was bullied for his upper-class status and perceived effeminacy. Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy {{from a poor}} working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and <b>rocketry,</b> with the well-read Parsons enthralling Forman with his literary prowess. In 1928 the pair—adopting the Latin motto per aspera ad astra (through hardship to the stars)—began engaging in homemade gunpowder-based rocket experiments in the nearby Arroyo Seco canyon, {{as well as the}} Parsons family's back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as cherry bombs into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a binding agent to increase the rocket fuel's stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as aluminium foil to make the gunpowder easier to cast. Parsons had also begun to investigate occultism, and performed a ritual intended to invoke the Devil into his bedroom; he worried that the invocation was successful and was frightened into ceasing these activities. In 1929 he began attending John Muir High School, where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in fencing and archery. After he received poor school results, Parsons' mother sent him away to study at a private boarding school in San Diego—the Brown Military Academy for Boys—but he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.|$|E

25|$|<b>Rocketry</b> in the Soviet Union {{also began}} with amateur societies, {{foremost}} was the Group for the Study of Reactive Propulsion (GIRD) headed by Friedrich Zander and Sergei Korolev. From 1931 to 1937 in the Soviet Union, extensive scientific work on rocket engine design {{occurred at the}} Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL) in Leningrad, which was merged with GIRD in 1933 bringing <b>rocketry</b> fully under government control. The well-funded and -staffed laboratory built over 100 experimental engines {{under the direction of}} Valentin Glushko. The work included regenerative cooling, hypergolic propellant ignition, and fuel injector designs that included swirling and bi-propellant mixing injectors. However, Glushko's arrest during Stalinist purges in 1938 curtailed the development.|$|E
