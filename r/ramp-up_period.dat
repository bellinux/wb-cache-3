40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} optimal CO 2 {{transport}} solutions from emission {{sources in the}} Skagerrak/Kattegat region to permanent storage. The goal is to identify and compare different transport solutions and ultimately find the most cost efficient one. The two main modes of transportation for CO 2 are pipelines and ships. Additional equipment such as installations for conditioning for transport, i. e. compression, liquefaction, drying, and intermediate storage, {{is included in the}} costs. Three main transport solution cases are investigated: a pipeline network, ship transport, and a combination of ship and pipelines. A sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the uncertainty of important cost parameters. Further, the effect of <b>ramp-up</b> over <b>periods</b> of 10, 25, 50 years are analysed. The overall costs for transport are estimated to be between 12 and 14 €/tCO 2.

40|$|Production <b>ramp-up</b> is the <b>period</b> of {{time during}} which a {{manufacturing}} process is scaled up from a small laboratory-like environment to high-volume production. During this scale-up, the firm needs to overcome the numerous discrepancies between how the process is specified to operate as written in the process recipe and how it actually is operated at large volume. The reduction of these discrepancies, a process that we will refer to as learning, will lead to improved production yields and higher output. In addition to its learning effort, however, the firm also attempts to change the process recipe itself, which can be in direct conflict with the learning objective. We formalize this intertemporal tradeoff between learning and process change {{in the form of}} a dynamic optimization problem. Our model explains the idea of a 2 ̆ 2 copy-exactly 2 ̆ 2 ramp-up, which freezes the process for some time period, i. e., does not allow for any change in the process. Mathematically, this corresponds to a process improvement policy which delays process changes, thereby exhibiting a nonmonotone trajectory, which we show to be optimal if the initial knowledge level is low, the lifecycle short and demand growth is steep, and learning is difficult...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} {{is to improve the}} focus on the use of Post-curing Methods of Composite Mouldings applied to small boat {{building}} companies and identify some key points which could be used in management decisions about yacht manufacturing. Current methods of post-curing are reviewed, together with the somewhat sparse literature available on stabilisation of mouldings, curing schedules and oven features. The methodology includes industrial visits & interviews, the application of thermodynamics, studies of other industries using composites and advice and guidance from experts in the fields of construction and energy consultancy. The results of the initial investigations are used to inform the design of a temporary oven & build enclosure which is then tested by the use of specially written spreadsheets for cost and energy modelling. Test results cover various sizes of boats from twenty to fifty feet (6 to 15 metres) at curing temperatures of 50 and 80 C based on data from a leading resin supplier in the industry and the stated alternative times for <b>ramp-up</b> and curing <b>periods.</b> The main conclusions (related to the manufacture of boats in the above range) are that in the short term it is cheaper to use additional energy for post-curing than to construct a more efficient build enclosure / oven where costs are being passed on to the customer and {{that it is difficult to}} combine an access structure for working on the mould with the enclosing structure of the temporary oven. Based on the spreadsheets developed by the author, graphs are provided as a ‘rule of thumb’ guide to power consumption and total costs for post-curing boats of various lengths. A detailed analysis of the spreadsheet results concludes that the key pointer is to find a practical way of fixing the insulation on the inside of a temporary structure in order to minimise the total mass to be heated. The report touches on the short-term nature of individual project-based yacht manufacturing and observes that it is difficult to justify long-term investment in more efficient production spaces for post-curing until tax-efficient incentives, such as capital allowances for plant & machinery can be applied to the use of temporary ovens. In the longer term, the report identifies the potential for further work on the development of a standard kit of parts for energy-efficient oven construction which could be erected and dismantled as required at minimum labour cost within a lightweight build enclosure. The incentive for this investment could be a radical shift in the real cost of energy – and a sea change in attitudes towards energy use and generation – over the next decade. Meanwhile, the boatbuilding industry appears to be on a plateau of efficiency for one-off post-cured products, based on the individual efforts of yacht manufacturers to deliver a quality product to their customers at a reasonable cost. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Two {{computational}} {{models have}} been applied to calculate the poloidal flux linkage requirements for the current ramp-up and for the flat-top phase of the proposed International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). For the current ramp-up phase, the TSC code {{has been used to}} simulate the entire current <b>ramp-up</b> <b>period</b> as described in the TAC- 3 Report. The time of the simulation has been extended to cover the full current penetration time, that is, until the loop voltage is a constant throughout the plasma. Sensitivity studies have been performed with respect to current ramp-up time, impurity concentration and to the time of onset of auxiliary heating. A steady state plasma equilibrium code has been used that has the constant loop voltage constraint built in to survey the dependence of the steady state loop voltage on the density and temperature profiles. This calculation takes into account the plasma bootstrap current contribution, including non-circular and collisional corrections. The results can be displayed as contours of the loop voltage on a POPCON-like diagram. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of twist and magnetic helicity in the coronal fields of active regions as they emerge. We use multi-day sequences of SoHO MDI magnetograms to characterize the region’s emergence. We quantify the overall twist in the coronal field, α, by matching a linear force-free field to bright coronal structures in EUV images. At the beginning of emergence all regions studied have α ≃ 0. As the active region grows, α increases and reaches a plateau within approximately one day of emergence. The inferred helicity transport rate is larger than differential rotation could produce. Following Longcope & Welsch (2000) we develop {{a model for the}} injection of helicity into the corona by the emergence of a twisted flux tube. This model predicts a <b>ramp-up</b> <b>period</b> of approximately one day. The observed time-history α(t) is fit by this model assuming reasonable values for the sub-photospheric Alfvén speed.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of coalbed methane (CBM) resources and reserves {{is a complex}} process due to the layered, fractured, and heterogeneous nature of these reservoirs. CBM resource estimation begins by quantifying variations in areal extent, thickness, gas content, and coal density. These then serve as input for determining the gas resource using probabilistic techniques. During this process, {{it is important to}} avoid pitfalls such as generating a resource range that is too narrow or failing to include non-coal lithologies. It is also important to realize, based on numerous examples, that resource estimates are commonly a poor predictor of gas production potential. CBM reserves depend upon demonstrated production which is typically characterized by a dewatering and <b>ramp-up</b> <b>period</b> prior to attaining peak gas rates. Core and log data obtained from appraisal wells provide the gas content and isotherm data necessary to make the first estimates of gas-in-place and potential recovery. This information can be used to initialize screening-level numerical simulation models to understand the critical factors controlling gas production and recommend pilot well types and spacing. Once economic rates are achieved, production forecasts can be generated and compared with gas-in-place estimates to ensure that the reserves numbers are reasonable. After the reservoir is dewatered, material balance and decline curve analyses can be used to estimate reserves {{in a manner similar to}} conventional reservoirs. Throughout this process, as shown by several case studies, care must be taken to avoid common technical and managerial pitfalls that result in erroneous reserves estimates and bad decisions regarding which projects to develop or divest. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{extraction}} sequence {{strategy in}} panel caving operations {{is dependent on}} a number of often conflicting parameters which are either economical or technical. In this context extraction sequence includes where to start cave initiation or undercutting. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a way to assess the extraction sequence, through a case study with two scenarios by considering aspects from both mine planning and geomechanics. The first scenario was to initiate the sequence from a zone with higher grades, but required effectively the development of a new mining block under a high column height. The second scenario was to initiate the sequence from a zone with lower grades but adjacent to an exhausted mining block and under lower in-situ column height. Based on existing mining guidelines, the <b>ramp-up</b> <b>period</b> of the first scenario would be much longer as the extraction rates would be much slower in order to reduce risks associated with high extraction rates including seismicity. On the second option there is a minimum risk associated to the same guidelines, given that the caving status is already connected to surface, which would allow for higher extraction rates. Two different mining plans were developed for each sequence, as well as a technical and economic assessment to compare both scenarios in terms of financial indicators (Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return), in order to select the best alternative.

30|$|Each {{robustness}} test {{focuses on}} a single mutation rule type, and having identified the three major controller operational stages (analysis, planning, and execution), we must execute the tests with the controller {{in each of these}} stages, as it allows us to cover more cases and potentially disclose more robustness problems. Therefore, in each test, we must drive the system from an initial state to a target state by submitting the system to a workload (i.e. changeload) for a given amount of time (<b>ramp-up</b> <b>period</b> in Figure 3). This target state is the one in which the system should be in order to start testing and can correspond to any entry point to any of the three controller stages previously mentioned. With the controller in the target state, we can start applying the changes (of the same type) specified within the changeload during a change period (see Figure 3) and while the controller is on the target state. This period of time should be set to the typical time required to transition from the target controller state for the test to the next state. After this probe mutation, there is a keep time period which is the time required for the system to reach a final state, which marks the end of the current test, and corresponds to the completion of the controller’s execution stage. At most, the keep period should be set to the worst case execution duration found in the adaptation strategies’ specification. The observation period is composed by the change period and the keep time and is used to register any potential deviations from expected controller behaviour.|$|E

A phase I trial in patients with NHL was conducted to determine safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of venetoclax, a selective, potent, orally bioavailable BCL- 2 inhibitor. Patients and Methods A total of 106 patients with relapsed or refractory NHL received venetoclax once daily until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity at target doses from 200 to 1, 200 mg in dose-escalation and safety expansion cohorts. Treatment commenced with a 3 -week dose <b>ramp-up</b> <b>period</b> for most patients in dose-escalation cohorts and for all patients in safety expansion. Results NHL subtypes included mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; n = 28), follicular lymphoma (FL; n = 29), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n = 34), DLBCL arising from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Richter transformation; n = 7), Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (n = 4), and marginal zone lymphoma (n = 3). Venetoclax was generally well tolerated. Clinical tumor lysis syndrome was not observed, whereas laboratory tumor lysis syndrome was documented in three patients. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 103 patients (97 %), a majority of which were grade 1 to 2 in severity. Grade 3 to 4 events were reported in 59 patients (56 %), and the most common were hematologic, including anemia (15 %), neutropenia (11 %), and thrombocytopenia (9 %). Overall response rate was 44 % (MCL, 75 %; FL, 38 %; DLBCL, 18 %). Estimated median progression-free survival was 6 months (MCL, 14 months; FL, 11 months; DLBCL, 1 month). Conclusion Selective targeting of BCL- 2 with venetoclax was well tolerated, and single-agent activity varied among NHL subtypes. We determined 1, 200 mg to be the recommended single-agent dose for future studies in FL and DLBCL, with 800 mg being sufficient to consistently achieve durable response in MCL.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of impact on marine life of {{underwater}} sound generated by anthropogenic activities (such as offshore construction, seismic surveys and sonar searches), various mitigation measures are often put in place. Two commonly adopted mitigation measures are the soft start (or "ramp-up" – the two terms are used interchangeably) and “shut-down”’ procedures. During a soft start procedure the source level of the sound source is increased gradually before use at operational power; the expectation is that nearby animals respond to the increasing sound level by swimming away from the sound source. Soft starts are used out of a precautionary principle, although no clear evidence exists for their effectiveness for mitigation [1, 2]. In order to quantify the possible benefit of a <b>ramp-up</b> <b>period,</b> we derive analytical expressions for sound exposure resulting from the use of a sound source (the "operation") for stationary sources. A methodology is proposed to quantify the efficacy of soft start procedures by assessing the impact on a population of animals, instead of nearby animals that are at highest risk. The simplicity of the resulting expressions makes them suitable for tuning the soft start with the aim of minimizing the environmental cost of the operation. A shut-down procedure might be initiated when one or more animals enter an area where they are considered to be at high risk. An analytical expression is derived for the shut-down zone for stationary and moving sources, ensuring the cumulative exposure that an animal receives from multiple sound events is less than a predefined threshold. Sound exposure is used as a measure of risk on the grounds that increased exposure is thought to increase the risk of hearing impairment and injury in marine mammals [3] and in fish [4]. For simplicity, no hearing-related weighting is used, and spherical spreading propagation conditions are assumed, with no absorption. Except where stated otherwise, the animal is assumed to swim with constant speed and direction (vertical motion is not considered). It is further assumed that sound pressure level does not change significantly from pulse to pulse. The purpose of these simplifying assumptions is to gain insight into the effect on risk of changes in parameters like duration and source level, depending on assumed swim velocity and (where relevant) source platform spee...|$|E
40|$|As a {{component}} of the innovation process and as a follow-up to product development, production ramp-up serves to integrate innovation into industrial production. Although the possibilities of measuring performance in monetary terms are limited during the <b>ramp-up</b> <b>period,</b> intangible potential is created, the effects of which only become visible in later phases and projects. Several scientific studies have indicated that production ramp-up is an important predictor of a firm’s success. Moreover, there are several indications from management practice that, on the one hand, show its relevance and on the other hand, attest to the challenges arising from attempts to cope with production ramp-up. To deal with these issues, suitable models need to be developed which enhance the transparency of production ramp-up and allow for an efficient process of purposeful decision making. One possibility to satisfy these needs is to apply the performance management approach. Performance management aims to accomplish that decisions are made under consideration of both pursued objectives and associated (side) effects. Thus, the goal of this work is the conceptual design of a guideline for developing a ramp-up-specific system of performance management. This process is implemented in the five modular parts A to E. Part A represents {{the state of the art}} of performance management during production ramp-up. Firstly, based on a meta-analysis, a ramp-up-specific catalogue of requirements is developed. By means of this catalogue, five selected articles are analyzed, which show up weaknesses, particularly with regard to the linkaging of ramp-up objectives with a firm’s objectives, the systematic support of continuing enhancement, the consideration of the strategic relevance, the integration of available expert knowledge, and the adequate guidance and support of decision makers during production ramp-up. In Part B, distinctive attributes of production ramp-up are educed: the initially lacking control over production quality, ongoing experience effects, and the varying intensity of production as an image of ramp-up policy. Subsequently, a research map of production ramp-up is drawn – as from a theoretical perspective. To fill the identified research gap, a lean, recursive-dynamic base model is developed. This model is capable of explaining the production ramp-up curve progression through the identified attributes alone. The result facilitates a deeper understanding of production ramp-up, creating the basis of a theory of production ramp-up, and providing a tool of communication for explanatory contributions. Moreover, these theoretical deliberations show up the gap between the special production theories already in existence, and indicate a potential closing of this gap. Part C looks in detail at performance planning as the initial phase of the performance management process. Based on a collection of ramp-up-specific objectives, a hierarchy of objectives is developed, spearheaded by seven fundamental ramp-up objectives. The results meet the demands in the literature for project-independent systems of objectives and business ratios. Expert interviews reveal that the results match firms’ perceptions. Thus, the created systemization of ramp-up goals is not only of theoretical but also of practical value: It offers decision makers an overview of suitable objectives, enabling them to adjust their current objectives and also to gain a qualitative evaluation of the status and effectiveness of objectives. Part D is dedicated to performance regulation. To this end, the CoRuS (Coordination for Ramp-up Success) survey was conducted, which analyzed with the help of structure equation modeling 184 questionnaires from producing firms. The results show a context-robust, significant impact of the activities knowledge management and controlling on ramp-up performance. However, additional variations of the model prove different sets of activities to be effective, depending on contextual factors. Thus, informational groundwork is established for context-specific selection of activities during ramp-up, and decision makers can check and potentially correct their priorities. Part E comes full circle to the state of the art in part A, with a conceptual framework that transforms the foregoing results into a comprehensive but scalable guideline. No default course of action is given, but rather a simplified decision environment to enable an enhanced level of decision rationality. The concept evaluation is based on the design science research approach, e. g. taking the form of a case study, to demonstrate practicability and usefulness. The main contributions of this work are the development of a tool for comparative classification of ramp-up projects, a compatible objective-planning process, a structured presentation of suitable business ratios related to the hierarchy of objectives, and the provision of concrete advice for context-specific and purposeful activities...|$|E
