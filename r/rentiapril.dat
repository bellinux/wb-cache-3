40|$|A {{new method}} is {{reported}} {{for the assessment of}} the HO· scavenging action of therapeutic agents. It is based on the photolysis of zinc oxide and has a detection limit of 3. 3 %. The scavenging order of the compounds tested was penicillamine > <b>rentiapril</b> > ascorbic acid > cysteine > glutathione > thiomalic acid > N-acetylcysteine > myocrysin > methionine. None were as effective as DMSO. argued that these compounds can have an in vivo protective effect where HO· is produced from oxidant producing cells, thus limiting radical induced damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{artificial}} sweetener aspartame (N-L-alpha-aspartyl-L-phenyl-alanine- 1 -methyl ester; Nutrasweet), its decomposition product alpha Asp-Phe {{and the related}} peptide alpha Asp-PheNH 2 were rapidly hydrolysed by microvillar membranes prepared from human duodenum, jejunum and ileum, and from pig duodenum and kidney. The metabolism of aspartame by the human and pig intestinal microvillar membrane preparations was inhibited significantly (> 78 %) by amastatin or 1, 10 -phenanthroline, and partially (> 38 %) by actinonin or bestatin, and was activated 2. 9 - 4. 5 -fold by CaCl 2. The inhibition by amastatin and 1, 10 -phenanthroline, and the activation by CaCl 2 are characteristic of the cell-surface ectoenzyme aminopeptidase A (EC 3. 4. 11. 7) and a purified preparation of this enzyme hydrolysed aspartame with a Km of 0. 25 mM and a Vmax of 126 mumol/min per mg. A purified preparation of aminopeptidase W (EC 3. 4. 11. 16) also hydrolysed aspartame but with a Km of 4. 96 mM and a Vmax of 110 mumol/min per mg. However, <b>rentiapril,</b> an inhibitor of aminopeptidase W, caused only slight inhibition (maximally 19 %) of the hydrolysis of aspartame by the microvillar membrane preparations. Similar patterns of inhibition and kinetic parameters were observed for alpha Asp-Phe and alpha Asp-PheNH 2. Two other decomposition products of aspartame, beta Asp-PheMe and cyclo-Asp-Phe, were essentially resistant to hydrolysis by both the human and pig intestinal microvillar membrane preparations and the purified preparations of aminopeptidases A and W. Although the relatively selective inhibitor of aminopeptidase N (EC 3. 4. 11. 2), actinonin, partially inhibited the metabolism of aspartame, alpha Asp-Phe and alpha Asp-PheNH 2 by the human and pig intestinal microvillar membrane preparations, these peptides were not hydrolysed by a purified preparation of aminopeptidase N. Membrane dipeptidase (EC 3. 4. 13. 19) only hydrolysed the unblocked dipeptide, alpha Asp-Phe, but the selective inhibitor of this enzyme, cilastatin, did not block the metabolism of alpha Asp-Phe by the microvillar membrane preparations...|$|E
