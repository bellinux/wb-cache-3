40|$|Some {{insurance}} {{markets are}} characterized by “advantageous selection”, that is, ex-post <b>risk</b> and <b>coverage</b> are negatively correlated. We show that expectation-based loss aversion as in Kőszegi and Rabin (2006, 2007) provides a natural explanation for this phenomenon when agents face modest-scale risks. More exposure to risk has two competing effects on an agent’s willingness to pay for insurance: a positive effect, as in standard expected utility models; and a negative one, due to a reference effect. We determine conditions under which an insurance provider optimally sets a high price at which only low risk agents buy. Classic economic theory predicts that ex-post <b>risk</b> and <b>coverage</b> are positively correlated in an insurance market (i. e., people that bought more insurance {{are more likely to}} have a bigger damage 1); however, the opposite has been observed in a variety of settings. From the prospective of the insurer, this insurance puzzle is associated with advantageous selection: the agents who buy insurance suffe...|$|R

Using an {{individual data set}} from a heavily regulated automobile insurance market, we arrived at several conclusions, as follows. First, no evidence of adverse selection or moral hazard is found in general: conditional on all the variables observed by insurer, the null hypothesis of independence between <b>risk</b> and <b>coverage</b> is not rejected at reasonable levels of statistical significance. Second, this result is robust {{in the sense that}} it holds under several empirical procedures and different definitions of <b>risk</b> and <b>coverage.</b> Third, we find that unobserved variables do not induce adverse selection: the null hypothesis that consumers in risky regions are more likely to purchase insurance is tested against the alternative and rejected. Our study supports the view that the adverse selection phenomenon exists only to a very limited extent in this market. Copyright The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2006. ...|$|R

50|$|Coverage {{is often}} {{purchased}} by the custom builder or general contractor and may also be {{purchased by the}} property owner. Builder's <b>risk</b> <b>coverage</b> may be necessary to show proof of insurance to comply with local city, county, and state building codes and is often required as a condition to many contracts.However, many architects believe that it is the property owner who should have the builder's risk policy, because they have already paid for the improvements to their land, and if the builder receives the funds directly from a claim, theoretically, he/she could abscond with that benefit. It is far safer for the property owner to obtain the builder's risk policy, because they already own the building, even while it is under construction. If something happens to the under-construction project, then they should be the beneficiary and control how it is spent. Yes, the builder ends up receiving the funds in the end, to rebuild damage, but this method gives the control of the insurance benefit to the owner.|$|E
50|$|Thus, if one {{leaves aside}} <b>risk</b> <b>coverage</b> for simplicity, the neo{{classical}} zero-long-run-profit thesis would be re-expressed in classical parlance as profits coinciding with {{interest in the}} long period (i.e. the rate of profit tending {{to coincide with the}} rate of interest). Profits in the classical meaning do not necessarily disappear in the long period but tend to normal profit. With this terminology, if a firm is earning abnormal profit in the short term, this will act as a trigger for other firms to enter the market. As other firms enter the market, the market supply curve will shift out, causing prices to fall. Existing firms will react to this lower price by adjusting their capital stock downward. This adjustment will cause their marginal cost to shift to the left causing the market supply curve to shift inward. However, the net effect of entry by new firms and adjustment by existing firms will be to shift the supply curve outward. The market price will be driven down until all firms are earning normal profit only.|$|E

This phenomenon can be caused by several reasons, 4 but here we focus on the presence of asymmetric information between insurers and insurees, an issue that has attracted a great deal of attention for more than thirty years. Since the seminal work of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) (henceforth RS), it is well known that when individuals have privileged information on their own health risks, the market will respond by providing a set of contracts, one intended for low <b>risks</b> with low <b>coverage</b> and low premium, and the other contract intended for high <b>risks</b> with full <b>coverage</b> and high premium.|$|R

In the separating equilibrium, the insurer provides a product with high coverage to attract rational type of individual (low risk), and a product with low coverage for overconfident type of individual (high risk). In addition, other types of equilibrium such as adverse selection or linear premium rate are also found. ...|$|R

A consequence was an extremely high default debt. The López Portillo administration then decided to nationalize the banking system on September 1 of the same year, paying 3 trillion pesos (approximately 63 billion dollars at 47 pesos/dollar exchange rate) to acquire public and private credit institutions who had an accumulated debt of 25 billion dollars.

This fund saved twenty of the largest companies of the country from bankruptcy; these companies owed 12 billion dollars through notes with the Banco de México. On November 10, 1986 the FONAPRE (Fondo de Apoyo Preventivo a las Institiciones de Banca Múltiple or [...] "Fund of preventive support to banking institutions") was founded to preserve the financial stability of banks, with the government having banks as trustees. By 1987, a parallel finance industry had been created with brokering firms, investment societies etc. To continue attracting investors, interest rates increased at the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, and with the crash in the New York Stock Exchange, the national banking system was deeply affected and another devaluation came as a result.|$|E
