40|$|Manakins {{are small}} suboscine passerines renowned for {{elaborate}} courtship displays and pronounced sexual dichromatism. We extracted and identified the carotenoid pigments {{found in the}} bright yellow to red feathers of 15 Neotropical manakin species. <b>Rhodoxanthin</b> (4 ', 5 '-didehydro- 4, 5 '-retro-beta,beta-carotene- 3, 3 '-dione) of a deep red hue was widely found in the plumages of these birds. The 4 -keto-carotenoids typically found in red plumages (alpha-doradexanthin, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, etc.) were found in only the Flame-crested Manakin (Heterocercus linteatus) and the Red-headed Manakin (Pipra rubrocapilla). <b>Rhodoxanthin</b> was recently identified in the Pin-tailed Manakin (Ilicura militaris). Hudon etal. (2007) suggested that the Pin-tailed Manakin produces <b>rhodoxanthin</b> endogenously from dietary carotenoids, and this suggestion now finds some support in the pigment's wide and specific distribution in manakins. It is possible that this capacity arose in a common ancestor of manakins and cotingas, given that <b>rhodoxanthin</b> also occurs in the feathers of red cotingas (Phoenicircus spp.). Feathers with <b>rhodoxanthin</b> absorbed longer wavelengths of light than those with 4 -keto-carotenoids, but not in Pipra, which has species with {{one or the other}} type of keto-carotenoids. We found that feathers with <b>rhodoxanthin</b> also contained epsilon,epsilon-caroten- 3 (3 ') -ones (e. g., canary-xanthophyll B and the recently described piprixanthin), which are believed to be intermediates along the <b>rhodoxanthin</b> pathway. Manakins thus have the capability to produce a wide range of carotenoid pigments and bright yellow to red colors, on which natural and sexual selection may act.

40|$|Carotenoids are {{strongly}} absorbing pigments that can self- assemble to form aggregates. These aggregates {{provide an opportunity}} to study exciton-coupling, which is the delocalization of an excitation over multiple molecules. Two zeaxanthin aggregates, previously denoted in our group as "J 1 " and "J 2 ", exhibit red-shifted absorption relative to the monomer, and a third, "H", displays a strongly blue -shifted absorption. Raman scattering cross-sections as a function of excitation wavelength are reported for these three zeaxanthin aggregates and the monomer. The aggregates were modeled as dimers to probe the strength of exciton-coupling, intermolecular geometry, and vibrational displacements. The simulations of J 1 and J 2 suggest that these two aggregates consist of weakly-coupled, card- stacked carotenoids. J 2 was found to have a smaller distance and larger rotation angle between the two chromophores, relative to J 1. The H-aggregate was fit to a strongly coupled card-stacked orientation. The possibility of exciton-coupling in carotenoid-containing feathers was investigated with in situ resonance Raman spectroscopy, coupled with measurements of diffuse reflectance and transmittance. <b>Rhodoxanthin</b> is the major carotenoid pigment in five different feathers, but there is a large variation in color. Red-shifts in the absorption profiles of these feathers correlated with a decrease in the frequency of the ethylenic mode and an increase in intensity of hydrogen-out-of-plane modes. Isomeric effects were found to be insignificant in terms of the color of the feathers. These studies of zeaxanthin and <b>rhodoxanthin</b> allow for a better understanding of exciton-coupling and illustrate how environment and structure affect the photophysics of carotenoid...|$|E
40|$|One {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the oxidation metabolites of zeaxanthin, another was to prepare, purify, and characterize a series of 32 ̆ 7 -alkyl lutein ethers for use as internal standards. Studies have proven that lutein and zeaxanthin are two of the principal carotenoids in human serum and the only carotenoids found in the retina, but their metabolism and transport in the human body are still only poorly understood. In vitro oxidation of zeaxanthin with MnO 2 produced three components. They were characterized by HPLC, UV/Vis, MS, NMR and identified as all-trans <b>rhodoxanthin</b> and its cis-isomers. 32 ̆ 7 -alkyl lutein ethers have been utilized as internal standards for carotenoid analysis in human serum and macular tissue. Nine 32 ̆ 7 -alkyl lutein ethers were prepared by reaction of lutein with the corresponding acidified alcohols. The purified products were characterized by HPLC, UV/Vis, MS for the first time, and the resulting lutein ethers showed similar properties to lutein with increasing retention times as the alkyl chain lengthened. This provides us alternatives in selecting internal standards...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to explore what effect light quality and light intensity and various sugars have on the sexual expression of Eguisetum gametophytes and to determine some characteristics of the red pigment in Eguisetum gametophytes. Light quality and light intensity were employed to seek the presence of a morphogenetic factor involved in the sexual expression of Eguisetum gametophytes. The gametophytes were grown in mass culture in petri dishes and singly in test tubes under red light and white light or under high light intensity and low light intensity. Light quality was employed when the Eguisetum species was Eguisetum hyemale. When the species was Eguisetum arvense, light intensity was employed. A higher percentage of antheridial gametophytes in mass culture in petri dishes than singly in test tubes under either red light or high light intensity would indicate an interaction among the gametophytes due to a diffusible substance and thus would indicate that light quality or light intensity was probably involved in a mechanism which activated a morphogenetic factor determining the sex of Eguisetum gametophytes. In mass culture in petri dishes, the morphogenetic factor activated by either red light or high light intensity would influence the sexual expression of other gametophytes in the same petri dish; whereas, singly in test tubes the gametophytes are isolated from each other so that any morphogenetic factor that is produced could not influence the sexual expression of the gametophytes. The factor would probably be some sort of diffusible substance comparable to the antheridogens of ferns. The results were ambiguous. Mannitol, sucrose and glucose were added separately to Bold 2 ̆ 7 s basal medium to determine what effect these sugars have on the sexual expression of Eguisetwn gametophytes. The results were ambiguous. The red pigment often associated with Eguisetum antheridial production was isolated by column chromatography and some characteristics were determined using visible light spectrophotometry. It is definitely not <b>rhodoxanthin,</b> as reported, but could not be identified other than to be a carotenoid. This study showed that Eguisetum gametophytes are a difficult system with which to experiment. It seems the sensitivity of Eguisetwn spores to light quality and light intensity can vary...|$|E
