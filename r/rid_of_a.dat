5|$|While bishop, Hervey {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a history}} of the refounding of the abbey of Ely, which later became incorporated into the Liber Eliensis. This was a Latin reworking of an Old English book of grants compiled by Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester. He was energetic in recovering the feudal rights of the bishopric against knights who had intruded themselves on the lands, but were not rendering knight service to the bishop. As bishop, he attended a legatine council, or council held by a papal legate, in 1127, and a royal council in 1129, but otherwise his administrative actions remain obscure. The causeway between the island of Ely and Exning, which made it easier for pilgrims to visit the shrine of Saint Ethelreda, was built under Hervey's orders. Insight into his activities as bishop is given in the Pipe Roll of 1130, the first surviving Pipe Roll. In that record, Hervey is recorded as owing King Henry 45 pounds to provide an office for a nephew, 100 pounds on an old settlement with the king, another 100 pounds for the settlement of a case dealing with Ramsey Abbey, Bury St. Edmunds Abbey and the bishop, 240 pounds for the right to be <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surplus of knights, and finally 1000 pounds for the king to allow the bishop's knights to serve castleguard at Ely instead of Norwich.|$|E

These moves include: subdividing an edge; valence-one homotopy (getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> degree-one vertex); valence-two homotopy (getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> degree-two vertex); collapsing an invariant forest; and folding. Of these moves the valence-one homotopy always reduced the PerronFrobenius eigenvalue.|$|E

The University of Massachusetts Amherst, one of Cosby's alma maters, asked Cosby to step down as an honorary co-chairman of the university's fundraising campaign. The Berklee College of Music, which had previously awarded Cosby with an honorary degree, got <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scholarship that it offered in Cosby's name. High Point University in North Carolina also pulled Cosby from its advisory board, and Freed-Hardeman University rescinded its invitation for Cosby to appear at an annual dinner in December.|$|E
25|$|STV {{has some}} {{history in the}} United States. Many cities, {{including}} New York City, once used it {{to break up the}} Democratic Party monopolies on elective office. Cincinnati, Ohio, adopted STV in 1925 to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Republican Party monopoly, but the Republicans returned the city to FPTP in 1957. From 1870 to 1980, Illinois used a semi-proportional cumulative voting system to elect its House of Representatives. Each district across the state elected both Republicans and Democrats year-after-year. Cambridge, Massachusetts, (STV) and Peoria, Illinois, (cumulative voting) continue to use PR. San Francisco had citywide elections in which people would cast votes for five or six candidates simultaneously, delivering some of the benefits of proportional representation.|$|E
25|$|Because R. romandi nests {{can often}} be found on buildings, {{it is common for}} wasp nests to be built in heavily human {{populated}} areas. Their nests do not cause any structural damage, so if the nests are located in out of the way areas, they are best left alone. Attempting to knock them down will induce the aggressive behavior described above, and R. romandi tend to rebuild nests in similar spots. Additionally, paper wasps feed their young on caterpillars, so they can help eliminate common garden and agricultural pests. If one does have to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nest, it is recommended that the job is done by a professional exterminator, or with a fast acting can of insecticide. The best time to get rid of an R. romandi nest is at dawn or after dark when the wasps are most docile.|$|E

Orlov, accompanied by Gustav Orreus and four regiments of troops, arrived in Moscow on September 26, immediately calling an emergency council with local doctors. They confirmed presence of both bubonic and septicemic forms of plague. Orlov established and supervised an executive medical commission charged with developing the ways to check the epidemic. More important, he succeeded in changing public opinion in favor of the state's emergency measures, at the same improving the efficiency and quality of medical quarantine (in particular, varying quarantine duration for different groups of exposed but yet healthy people, and paying them for the quarantine stay).|$|E
25|$|Route26 {{along with}} State Highway Route25 soon became high-use routes to get drivers from Philadelphia to New York via New Brunswick as the large {{high-speed}} roadway. In the 1927 renumbering, a connection from Route26 to Route25 was also assigned, bypassing {{to the south}} of New Brunswick. This route was designated as State Highway RouteS-26, a route completely concurrent with U.S. Route 1. In 1931, the State Highway Department contracted plans for a new bridge over the Delaware and Raritan Canal near Barker's Basin. Although Route26 was considered the longest straight section of highway in the state, the new freeway would get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dangerous S-curve along the highway. On January 30, 1932, the State Highway Department opened the newly constructed Calhoun Street Extension to traffic. This new freeway, designated as part of Route26, was constructed as a bypass of the business districts in Trenton and Morrisville, Pennsylvania with a new traffic circle from the Route26 mainline (now the Brunswick Circle). Calhoun Street was realigned in the process to help make traffic flow.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{cultural}} implications {{and the importance of}} bearing children, infertility in Ghana can be devastating. Throughout the years, Ghanaians have believed that both physical and spiritual ailments are the cause of infertility. Some people believe that a womb could be too hot or too cold to support a developing baby. Others believe that the cause of their infertility is witchcraft, and this belief is often supported by traditional priests who assert that the woman can be <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> witch's curse and be allowed to conceive if the priest performs a rite in which he asks fertility gods how they can be appeased. Other spiritual beliefs involving infertility include the belief that infertility {{is the result of a}} woman's disobedience to God, in which the remedy is prayer and repentance. Women who consult a tradition birth attendant are likely to be told that prayer is the medicine for infertility, although they acknowledge that infertility is sometimes caused by a physical ailment. In these cases, the traditional birth attendant may blame the infertility on stomach aches and advise the woman to visit a hospital and take the medicine given by the doctor.|$|E

500|$|Gunsmoke was {{originally}} a half-hour program filmed in black-and-white. The series expanded {{to an hour}} in length with season seven and began filming in color in season twelve. During its run 635 episodes were broadcast, of which 233 were 30 minutes in length and 402 were 60 minutes in length. [...] Of the hour-long episodes 176 were in black-and-white and 226 in color. During season two, Gunsmoke {{became one of the}} ten most popular programs on American television and moved to number one in the third season.
