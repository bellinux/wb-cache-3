As expected, households whose main earner is a <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> from dependent employment show lower levels of persistent poverty, because social interventions are tailored in order to protect (part of) them: {{they are less likely to}} lose their job and, if they do, they may be eligible to receive some unemployment insurance. In contrast, self-employed and retirees face worse economic conditions. The former cannot rely on ad hoc policies in case of job loss, earning decrease, or reduced economic activity; the latter mostly receive lower and stagnant retirement benefits. When the main earner is a woman, the household is more likely persistently poor because women traditionally play a secondary economic role in Italy.|$|R

The age- and cohort profiles of the variables are estimated using a nonparametric technique, relying purely on information from the data. The relevant decision making and consumption unit in the report is chosen to be the household, so no attempt is made to associate the different components <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> consumption and transfers with particular members of the household. The examinations are done both by household and by consumption unit. The number of consumption units in the household is determined as recommended by OECD. The age and cohort profiles are an interesting way of summarising data information and they can be also used as a first step in certain types of studies conceming welfare. The estimated age profiles of consumption are concave, as expected. Similar is the shape of age profiles of direct taxes and consumption. Disposable income is more evenly distributed than factor income, so direct taxes and income transfers equalise <b>income</b> among households <b>of</b> different age.

50|$|Gift Aid allows {{individuals}} who are subject to UK income tax to complete a simple, short declaration {{that they are a}} UK taxpayer. Any cash donations that the taxpayer makes to the charity after making a declaration are treated as being made after deduction <b>of</b> <b>income</b> tax at the basic rate (20% in 2011), and the charity can reclaim the basic rate income tax paid on the gift from HMRC.

Higher-rate taxpayers can claim income tax relief, above and beyond the amount claimed directly by the charities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between health outcomes and the equality with which income is distributed in the United States. DESIGN [...] The degree <b>of</b> <b>income</b> inequality, defined as the percentage <b>of</b> total household <b>income</b> received by the less well off 50 % of households, and changes in income inequality were calculated for the 50 states in 1980 and 1990. These measures were then examined in relation to all cause mortality adjusted for age for each state, age specific deaths, changes in mortalities, and other health outcomes and potential pathways for 1980, 1990, and 1989 - 91. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Age adjusted mortality from all causes. RESULTS [...] There was a significant correlation (r = - 0. 62 [corrected], P < 0. 001) between the percentage <b>of</b> total household <b>income</b> received by the less well off 50 % in each state and all cause mortality, unaffected by adjustment for state median incomes. Income inequality was also significantly associated with age specific mortalities and rates of low birth weight, homicide, violent crime, work disability, expenditures on medical care and police protection, smoking, and sedentary activity. Rates <b>of</b> unemployment, imprisonment, <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> assistance and food stamps, lack of medical insurance, and educational outcomes were also worse as income inequality increased. Income inequality was also associated with mortality trends, {{and there was a}} suggestion of an impact of inequality trends on mortality trends. CONCLUSION [...] Variations between states in the inequality of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>income</b> are significantly associated with variations between states in a large number of health outcomes and social indicators and with mortality trends. These differences parallel relative investments in human and social capital.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The project involved three methods: (1) qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 60 individuals in 30 couples; (2) quantitative analysis of household panel data (British Household Panel Survey); and (3) use of UK and EU policy simulation {{models of the}} tax-benefit system. The aim was to explore how the three approaches {{could be used to}} inform each other: for the econometric analysis to build on the qualitative findings, and for policy simulation to take account of within household inequalities beyond those <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> identified by the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The key research questions include: What are the policy-relevant gender specific parameters that affect the distribution of power, entitlements to and use of resources within households in the UK? In particular, do perceptions about entitlements and intra-household distribution of resources depend on the source and <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>income?</b> How do current and potential policy changes affecting access to different sources <b>of</b> <b>income</b> impact on gender roles and relationships within households? What ambiguities and tensions arise in attempting to improve both the distribution of resources between households and women's access to resources within the household? What lessons can be drawn from the above for developing policies that improve women's financial autonomy? Project description: The project aimed to explore alternative approaches to understanding the behavioral and distributional impact of policy change which take account of gender inequalities in power and influence within the household, and to use such approaches to analyse the effects of changes in fiscal, social security and associated labour market policies in the UK. It has focused on approaches to conceptualising and measuring inequalities within male-female couples, and on understanding the concepts of entitlement and financial autonomy and the factors that influence individuals’ command over resources (entitlements) within such couples...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} problem of {{effective}} taxation {{at the lower end}} <b>of</b> the <b>income</b> scale in Germany. For the <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> social <b>income</b> maintenance [...] currently about 1. 8 million nationals [...] effective taxation consists not only of the explicit taxation through the tax code but also of the implicit taxation through the withdrawal of benefits. The paper calculates effective tax rates for <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> social assistance; it is shown that for labor incomes in the lower income range explicit and implicit taxation add up to a marginal burden of just under 75 percent on average. The 1996 tax reform alleviates the explicit tax burden on low incomes, but it does not alleviate the total marginal burden on labor earnings <b>of</b> welfare <b>recipients.</b> It increases net incomes, but since the withdrawal of benefits increases with net incomes, too, the overall burden remains practically unchanged. Therefore, effective welfare traps remain prevalent; these could only be avoided through a reform of the system of social assistance and withdrawal.

Crucially, having created the precedent that tenants and lay <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> monastic <b>incomes</b> might expect to have their interests recognised by the Court of Augmentations following dissolution, the government's apparent acquiescence to the granting of additional such rights and fees helped establish a predisposition towards dissolution amongst local notables and landed interests.

30|$|A {{national}} weighting methodology is utilised incorporating constraints {{based upon}} (sex, age-group, region, household composition) {{based upon a}} combination of population projections based on the Census and from the Quarterly National Household Survey (Callan et al., 2010).

Callan et al., (2010) proposed a reweighting methodology based upon external data to improve the representativity in this dimensions.

In the presence of uncertainty, the intersectoral distortion may be much less than had previously been imagined. However, the tax system distorts at two other margins which have not received much attention. It distorts the inter-household allocation of the housing stock, since the after-tax rate of interest is one component of the opportunity cost of owner-occupied housing. It also distorts the inter-household allocation of risk-bearing. Calculations using a simple commutable general equilibrium model suggest that the excess burden from these latter two distortions are significant components of the total distortionary impact of the tax system. ...|$|R
