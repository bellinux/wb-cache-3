5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive <b>rotational</b> <b>grazing,</b> where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{holistic}} planned grazing {{began in}} the 1960s when Allan Savory, a wildlife biologist in his native Southern Rhodesia, set out to understand desertification. This {{can be seen in}} the context of the larger environmental movement. Heavily influenced by the work of André Voisin and the ineffectiveness of mainstream rangeland science of the time, Savory concluded that the spread of deserts, the loss of wildlife, and the human impoverishment that always resulted were related to the reduction of the natural herds of large grazers and even more, the change in behavior of those few remaining herds. Livestock could be substituted to provide important ecosystem services like nutrient cycling when mimicking those uniquely coevolved grasses and grazers. But managers had found that while <b>rotational</b> <b>grazing</b> systems can work for diverse management purposes, scientific experiments had demonstrated that they do not necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. An adaptive management plan was needed for the integration of the experiential with the experimental, as well as the social with the biophysical, to provide a more comprehensive framework for the management of rangeland systems. None of these sources of knowledge could be understood except in the context of the whole. Holistic management was developed to meet that need.|$|E

The yield and persistency of hybrids between white clover and T. nigrescens were compared under <b>rotational</b> sheep <b>grazing</b> over three harvest years.

The large-leaved T. repens variety Olwen, medium-leaved varieties AberDai and Menna and the small-leaved variety S 184 were sown as controls. Hybrids and control varieties were sown with a perennial ryegrass companion; between April {{and the end of}} October in each harvest year the plots were rotationally grazed with sheep with clover and perennial ryegrass (DM) yield and the proportion of clover present measured over the growing season. The clover and total DM yields of the BC 2 and BC 3 were generally comparable with the small- and medium-leaved varieties within the experiment and significantly greater than the yields of the large-leaved variety Olwen.

While exotic species, such as the Namib Desert Horse, are generally unwanted in the Namib-Naukluft Park, the horses are a special case, given their close ties with Namibian history, their popularity with visitors, and their appeal as subjects for case studies of feral horse bands. Studies during 2003 and 2004, however, found that while an area of approximately [...] around the watering area at Garub has {{been affected by the}} horses, there was no significant disturbance of the area outside this radius. The amount and species of vegetation found outside the watering area appear more affected by rainfall then by the horses, probably due to the low population density and natural <b>rotational</b> <b>grazing.</b> Due to the lack of affect on vegetation by horses, it is unlikely that they significantly influence small mammal populations. The horses also appear to have no measurable affect on any vulnerable or endangered plant or animal species, which in several cases are more threatened by human influence. As the horses are restricted to a certain grazing area and native large herbivores are not, the horses do not pose a danger to the latter species. The horses in the Namib Desert were originally known by the local population as [...] "ghost horses", as they mostly stayed away from human habitations and were rarely seen. However, when their grazing grounds were made part of the game reserve, a policy of limited intervention was put in place that encouraged support to be given to the horses when necessary, bringing the horses into closer contact with humans. This also included closer contact with tourists to Namibia, who frequently see them at the watering area at Garub and near the main road that traverses their grazing grounds. While the horses are credited with bringing tourist dollars to Namibia, there are also concerns about negative horse-human interactions, including vehicle accidents, disruption to sensitive areas by people looking for the horses and disruption of herd dynamics due to becoming too used to or dependent upon humans.|$|E

Several traits increase a species’ vulnerability to population decline through stochastic processes, including high larval specificity and poor dispersal rate. The Duke of Burgundy Hamearis lucina relies on Primula as its sole larval host plant. This monophagus dependency, coupled with susceptibility to environmental stochasticity, low dispersal and poor recolonization potential, means it is vital that sites supporting this rapidly-declining species are managed optimally. Here, we use two calcareous grassland sites in the UK with different grazing systems to identify optimal grazing management for Primula abundance and, for the first time, Primula characteristics linked previously to Duke oviposting preference and success: size, condition, succulence and surrounding sward height. We find that autumn and winter grazing intensity are both positively associated with Primula abundance, but there is a trade-off for winter grazing with negative effects on plant size, condition and succulence. Winter grazing also decreased the sward height below the optimum. Plants were bigger and better at the site managed using continuous (free-roaming) grazing versus the site managed using <b>rotational</b> (paddock-based) <b>grazing.</b> We recommend moderately high grazing intensity during autumn using a free-roaming system where possible to attain abundant Primula, with a reduction in grazing intensity or grazing removal during winter to ensure suitability of individual plants.

Concern over high stocking rates of livestock, “overgrazing”, and {{what was perceived as}} a low level of productivity in peasant farming areas was first expressed by government officials in the 1920 s and has over the years involved several attempts to restructure land use settlement patterns (Cousins, 1988). These attempts include the introduction of grazing schemes. Grazing schemes are interventions aimed at, firstly, improving livestock productivity in communal areas, and secondly, conserving the vegetation cover of grazing land and reducing the risk of irreversible environmental degradation (Cousins, 1988). It was assumed that the low productivity was due to poor management, both of stock and range-land feed resources, and that the high stocking rates caused severe land degradation. In general, grazing schemes in the Zimbabwe communal areas aim to control stock numbers, restrict access to communal range-land by means of fences, and manage the range-land by means of <b>rotational</b> resting systems. <b>Grazing</b> schemes have involved the modification of traditional tenure rules {{and the development of a}} new kind of resource management institution, the committee. Sometimes management decisions and procedures are embodied in sets of by-laws, formally written down and officially sanctioned or else informally held in the memories of community members. They are an example of the evolution of common property management systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{northwest}} of Scotland is a stronghold {{for two of}} the UK’s rarest bumblebee species, Bombus distinguendus and Bombus muscorum. The predominant form of agricultural land management in this region is crofting, a system specific to Scotland in which small agricultural units (crofts) operate <b>rotational</b> cropping and <b>grazing</b> regimes. Crofting is considered to be beneficial {{to a wide range of}} flora and fauna. However, currently there is a lack of quantitative evidence to support this view with regard to bumblebee populations. In this study we assessed the effect of land management on the abundance of foraging bumblebees and the availability of bumblebee forage plants across crofts in northwest Scotland. The results of our study show that current crofting practices do not support high densities of foraging bumblebees. Traditional crofting practice was to move livestock to uplands in the summer, but this has been largely abandoned. Summer sheep grazing of lowland pasture had a strong negative impact on bumblebee abundance and forage plant availability throughout the survey period. The use of specific ‘bird and bee’ conservation seed mixes appears to improve forage availability within the crofted landscape, although the number of bees observed remained low. Of the forage plants available, the three most frequently visited species were from the Fabaceae. We therefore conclude that the creation of agri-environment schemes which promote the use of Fabaceae-rich seed mixes and encourage the removal of sheep grazing on lowland areas throughout the summer are essential in order to conserve bumblebee populations within crofted areas...|$|R
