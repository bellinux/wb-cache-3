40|$|Abstract. This paper {{shows the}} {{performance}} {{analysis of a}} sealless cylinder with a conical type piston and one of three types of <b>rod</b> <b>bearings.</b> The piston without seal is composed of cylindrical and conical portions in the axial direction. The 2 D Reynolds equation is solved with a finite difference method for the performance analysis. The relationship between self-centering force and leakage flow rate are investigated. The sealless cylinder fabricated with the proposed optimum design values was tested with three different types of <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> having four, five and six pockets respectively.

50|$|The Waste Heat Engine's design {{requires}} {{the use of}} water to lubricate the moving parts because exhaust steam goes into the engine crankcase.

50|$|From these {{holes in}} the main journals, the oil moves through passageways inside the {{crankshaft}} to exit {{holes in the}} rod journals to lubricate the <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> and connecting <b>rods.</b> Some simpler designs relied on these rapidly moving parts to splash and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. However, in modern designs, there are also passageways through the rods which carry oil from the <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> to the rod-piston connections and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. This oil film {{also serves as a}} seal between the piston rings and cylinder walls to separate the combustion chamber in the cylinder head from the crankcase. The oil then drips back down into the oil pan.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} solution, {{almost universal}} in road car engines, {{is to use}} simple rods where cylinders from both banks share a journal.

50|$|This {{arrangement}} {{is simple and}} robust, but does not give a perfect geometry and so {{is known for its}} creaking noises and rough running, particularly if the <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> become worn.

50|$|Also {{unlike the}} Chevrolet inline 6, Ford {{products}} used {{high oil pressure}} for lubrication for the main and <b>rod</b> <b>bearings,</b> as do all modern vehicle combustion engines. While this offered no special performance advantage it did eliminate a complex oil jet system in the oil pan. As a side benefit to a prospective purchaser of a used vehicle, this also enabled {{the condition of the}} connecting <b>rod</b> and main <b>bearings</b> to be determined indirectly by observation of the analog oil pressure gauge after the vehicle was warmed up, provided that oil of normal viscosity was in use.|$|R

50|$|The {{connecting}} rods are of forged aluminum and do provide some shock damping, {{which is why}} aluminum is used in place of titanium, because titanium {{connecting rods}} transmit {{too much of the}} combustion impulse to the big-end <b>rod</b> <b>bearings,</b> endangering the bearings and thus the crankshaft and block. Each con rod has two bolts, shell bearings for the big end while the pin runs directly in the rod.|$|R

50|$|Introduced in 1978, the 200 cid {{replaced}} the larger 250 cid {{as the base}} engine for Chevrolet's new downsized intermediate line. The 200 cid used a unique 3.5-inch bore and a 3.48-inch stroke (the Chevrolet 305 cid and 350 cid V8 engines shared the same stroke dimension). These bore and stroke dimensions were later used by the 267 cid V8 Chevrolet engine. Also like the small block V8 engines, the 200 cid V6 used 2.45-inch main <b>bearings</b> and 2.10-inch <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> diameters.|$|R
40|$|Main and {{connecting}} <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> along the crankshaft in a heavy-duty engine oil system requires efficient feed of oil flow {{to ensure the}} performance of lubrication, cooling and cleaning. The bearings and builded bearing models considered in this work {{are based on a}} Volvo 13 L engine. Two main models to predict the oil flow in main {{and connecting}} <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> have been investigated using the system analysis software GT-SUITE. These two models are based on two numerical methods called  the Mobility method and the Reynold's equation respectively. The main bearing and the connecting <b>rod</b> large end <b>bearing</b> loads calculated in the present work is similar to the reference bearing loads, especially for connecting <b>rod</b> large end <b>bearing</b> and at lower engine speeds. For higher engine speeds, the present load results are far off,  compared to the reference load results. This difference at the higher engine speeds showed also an increased difference in the oil volume flow rates. But more information regarding the calculations of the reference loads is needed to analyze the differences further. Considering the "split lines", where the upper and the lower bearing shell meet, in the bearing models increased the oil volume flow rate with 13. 3 % on average for the main bearing. Main bearing stand for 86 % of the total flow whilst connecting rod large end and small end bearing stand for the rest 13 % and 1 % of the total flow. The feed of oil to main <b>bearing</b> and connecting <b>rod</b> large end <b>bearing</b> appears continuously whilst the feed of oil to connecting <b>rod</b> small end <b>bearing</b> appears {{in the form of a}} few pulsations. Comparing to the numerical reference flow results, the results in this work are similar at high oil temperatures and at low engine speeds, otherwise the results are far off. Considering the Reynold's equation when predicting the oil volume flow rates in plain journal bearings is a more accurate way than using the Mobility method since it takes more specific geometrical irregularities into account. The oil volume flow rate for main bearing differ with 2. 7 % on average when solving the Reynold's equation compared to the Mobility method...|$|R

50|$|After an {{intensive}} investigation, the probable {{cause of the}} crash was cited to be failure of the rear master <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> on the number three engine. The failure caused the rear crankpin to overheat and fail, whereupon all the rear connecting rods failed, tearing through the cylinder walls and crankcase. In the process, oil lines were torn open, which caused the fire. Sludge buildup in the crankpins, blocking oil flow {{was thought to be}} the root cause, which resulted in improved oil screens and the implementation of a crankpin plug, as well as revised oil change intervals.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple methodology {{to evaluate the}} stiffness and damping coefficients of an engine bearing over a load cycle.

The influence of thermal effects on the stiffness and damping coefficients is predicted by using a simplified thermal analysis. In order to illustrate the application of the proposed scheme, one engine main bearing and a connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> are analysed...|$|R
