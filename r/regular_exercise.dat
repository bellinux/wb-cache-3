5|$|Minnesotans {{have low}} rates of {{premature}} death, infant mortality, cardiovascular disease, and occupational fatalities. They have long life expectancies, and high rates of health insurance and <b>regular</b> <b>exercise.</b> These and other measures have led two groups to rank Minnesota as the healthiest state in the nation; however, {{in one of these}} rankings, Minnesota descended from first to sixth in the nation between 2005 and 2009 because of low levels of public health funding and the prevalence of binge drinking.|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the world}} {{countries}} are challenged with a large ageing population who {{spend most of their}} time at home and are mostly sedentary (8. 5 hours per day as of today). Sedentary behavior and physical inactivity affect the social, physical and mental states of people leading to social isolation and physical declines and hence an ideal candidate for chronic and degenerative diseases. To maintain an active aging process (healthy state of physical, mental and social wellbeing), <b>regular</b> and daily <b>exercising</b> is necessary. However, many older adults do not maintain <b>regular</b> <b>exercising</b> due to poor health, lack of company, lack of motivation, lack of transportation and suitable outdoor facilities. In this context, home based physical exercises can help people maintain their physical activity and ICT can act as a key player and facilitator by providing interactive training applications (through desktops and mobile devices), self-monitoring (using activity trackers and wearables) and automated coaching (using rule-based systems or remote assistance). Yet, for many people and, in particular, the sedentary older population at home; even with the existence of the technology, there is not enough motivation to maintain a <b>regular</b> <b>exercising</b> routine. Thus, this thesis aims to investigate the IT-mediated persuasive strategies that help independent-living older adults at home to maintain a <b>regular</b> <b>exercising</b> lifestyle. In particular, this research examines the effect of social inclusion and group exercising on the motivation of trainees at home to adhere to the training program which has proven to be effective...|$|R

The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as with many breeds of hunting dogs requires a <b>regular</b> <b>exercise</b> routine to keep them healthy and content. Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that <b>regular</b> <b>exercise</b> has {{a positive effect on}} the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was <b>regular</b> <b>exercise.</b> They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E

5|$|Castro {{was known}} for his busy working hours, often only going to bed at 3 or 4 a.m. He {{preferred}} to meet foreign diplomats in these early hours, believing that they would be tired and he could gain the upper hand in negotiations. He described Ernest Hemingway as his favorite writer, and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music. A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking <b>regular</b> <b>exercise.</b> He took a great interest in gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs. Castro had a lifelong love of guns, and a preference for life in the countryside over the city.|$|E

40|$|Background & Objectives: Numerous {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to assess the effects of acute resistance exercises on the structure and the function of heart, but little works done on effects of chronic resistance exercises. So, the objective of current study was to investigate the long term effect of <b>regular</b> <b>exercises</b> on cardiac function and oxidative stress.   Methods: Forty male Wistar rats in the weight range of 250 - 300 g were used in this study. They were divided in 2 following groups: The 3 months exercises test group and control group which remained without <b>exercises.</b> <b>Regular</b> resistive <b>exercise</b> was carried out according to the model proposed by Tamaki et al. Test group rats exercised for three months. Finally the hearts of 10 rats in each group were taken for homogenization, oxidative stress measurement and the other ten were examined for heart function. Malondialdhyde as an index of oxidative stress and superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxides and catalase as an indicator of antioxidant capacity with special kits were specifically measured.   Results: <b>Regular</b> resistive <b>exercise</b> didn't significantly affect the rats' weight, but heart weight in exercise group showed a significant increase (p< 0. 05). There was a significant decrease in heart rate in exercise group (p< 0. 05). Left ventricle contraction strength and coronary flow had a significant increase in exercise group in comparison with control group (p< 0. 05). There was not any significant difference in Malondialdhyde and antioxidant enzymes activity.   Conclusion: This study showed that, heart efficiency had a significant improvement under effect of <b>regular</b> resistive <b>exercise.</b> Meanwhile, <b>regular</b> resistive <b>exercise</b> didn’t have any significant effect on oxidative stress and heart antioxidant defense capacity...|$|R
