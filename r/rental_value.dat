5|$|Thatcher {{reformed}} {{local government}} taxes by replacing domestic rates (a tax {{based on the}} nominal <b>rental</b> <b>value</b> of a home) with the Community Charge (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident. The new tax was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year, and proved {{to be among the}} most unpopular policies of her premiership. Public disquiet culminated in a 70,000 to 200,000-strong demonstration in London on 31 March 1990; the demonstration around Trafalgar Square deteriorated into riots, leaving 113 people injured and 340 under arrest. The Community Charge was abolished in 1991 by her successor, John Major. It has since transpired that Thatcher had herself failed to register for the tax, and was threatened with financial penalties if she did not return her form.|$|E

The study revealed that the major factors often discovered from relevant literature to determine <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> of residential properties such as facilities and condition of repairs among others were the least ranked within the neighbourhood of FUTA. The study also revealed that there was a positive relationship between the population of students of FUTA living in the private rented sector and <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> of selected residential properties over the years. This indicates that demand pressure from students and residents contribute immensely to the changes in <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> within the area.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the macro-economic drivers of office <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> in South-east Asian cities over the period 1988 2001 by adopting the demand and supply framework. The paper tries to use the existing single-equation method to examine influences on office rents in five South-east Asian cities (Singapore, Hong Kong, Taipei, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok). Real GDP, unemployment rate, floor space for office buildings, interest rate, lending rate, consumer index and service sector output will be included in examining the movements of office <b>rental</b> <b>values.</b> In spite of data limitations, this research demonstrates that in Singapore and Taipei office markets, <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> are mainly determined by changes in office floor space, while in Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur office markets, lending rates have a greater effect on <b>rental</b> <b>values.</b> However, there are no significant factors in the Bangkok office market. The results also suggest that office markets in South-east Asia are highly linked with development markets, while demand-side variables do not have much impact on those markets.

40|$|Housing {{represents}} {{the most basic}} of human need and it has a profound impact on the health, welfare, and productivity of individuals. Forhousing to produce these impacts, it must be adequately provided with functional infrastructure. In Nigerian urban centres, these basicinfrastructure have suffered major neglect {{over a long period of}} time in the hands of government and its different agencies that are expectedto provide and maintain the infrastructure. Therefore, property developers are responsible for the provision of the infrastructure in theirproperties which have increased the development cost of the properties. For the property developers to continue to invest in propertydevelopment, the <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> of the property must continue to be attractive to allow developers recoup back the investment on suchproperty. This study therefore investigated into the available infrastructural facilities in residential properties in Akure, Nigeria and analysedtheir influence in the determination of the <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> of the properties. Akure was divided into four residential zones and one hundred andninety tenants were randomly selected for interview. Eleven infrastructural facilities were identified as peculiar to residential properties inAkure. The study employed multiple regression model to determine the influence of the infrastructural facilities in the <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> of theproperty while the step-wise analysis revealed that wall-fence and installed burglary proof are significant determinants of <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> ofresidential properties in Akure.

5|$|In 1819, Lancashire was {{represented}} by two members of parliament (MPs). Voting was restricted to the adult male owners of freehold land with an annual <b>rental</b> <b>value</b> of 40shillings or more– {{the equivalent of about}} £80 in 2008– and votes could only be cast at the county town of Lancaster, by a public spoken declaration at the hustings. Constituency boundaries were out of date, and the so-called rotten boroughs had a hugely disproportionate influence on the membership of the Parliament of the United Kingdom compared to the size of their populations: Old Sarum in Wiltshire, with one voter, elected two MPs, as did Dunwich in Suffolk, which by the early 19th century had almost completely disappeared into the sea. The major urban centres of Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Blackburn, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Stockport, with a combined population of almost one million, were represented by either the two county MPs for Lancashire, or the two for Cheshire in the case of Stockport. By comparison, {{more than half of all}} MPs were returned by a total of just 154owners of rotten or closed boroughs. In 1816, Thomas Oldfield's The Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland; being a History of the House of Commons, and of the Counties, Cities, and Boroughs of the United Kingdom from the earliest Period claimed that of the 515 MPs for England and Wales 351 were returned by the patronage of 177 individuals and a further 16 by the direct patronage of the government: all 45 Scottish MPs owed their seats to patronage. These inequalities in political representation led to calls for reform.|$|E

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that coupled and decoupled direct payments have different impacts on agricultural <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> because of the different production responses associated with these payments. This study investigates the impact of both coupled and decoupled EU CAP direct payments on <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> in Northern Ireland, using panel data taken from the farm business survey for the period from 1994 to 2002. Theoretically, agricultural land rents are a function of expected market returns and expected associated direct payments. The unobservable nature of expected returns means that actual market returns must {{be used as a}} proxy for the former in the empirical specification. As a consequence, the problem of bias due to expectation error arises. Using a GMM technique to take account of this problem, {{the results of this study}} show that the impact of CAP direct payments on <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> depends on the type of payment and on the nature of the production characteristics of the associated agricultural commodity. ...|$|R

An advantage of the methods used here over older ones is that the sampling error in the series can be calculated. The series show rapid shifts of income toward landowners and away from wages around 1600 and 1800, but back toward wages after 1870.

The {{study which}} entailed a {{comparative}} analysis of <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> of residential properties of restricted access and open access gated estates {{is aimed at}} discovering differences in <b>rental</b> <b>values.</b> Analysing these <b>rental</b> <b>values</b> of restricted access (Crown Estate) and open access (Victoria Gargen City) estates in Lekki Peninsula, as case studies will aid investors and policy makers to be better guided in their decision-making processes. To achieve {{the objective of the}} study, structured questionnaires were administered to 160 residents of Crown Estate out of which 116 respondents returned their questionnaires filled; 120 questionnaires were administered to the residents of Victoria Garden City out of which 90 questionnaires were retrieved while 45 questionnaires out of the 60 administered to the Estate Surveyors and Valuer’s managing properties in Crown Estate and Victoria Garden City (VGC) were retrieved. The collected questionnaires were subsequently analyzed using relevant statistical techniques such as the frequency distribution tables and the t-test. The study revealed that being gated had no effect on the choice of residency. However, location was discovered to be a germane feature in the choice of either estate.
