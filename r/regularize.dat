Along the road, ranches and haciendas were established that would <b>regularize</b> the commerce and give social and political unity to the area. This process would give rise to conflicts between hacienda owners and the indigenous peoples as possession of lands changed. In 1660, the indigenous rebelled against Spanish authorities.

On 26 April, the Israeli cabinet met to consider the Syrian suggestions, with head of Israel’s Water Planning Authority, Simha Blass, in attendance. Blass noted that while the land to be ceded to Syria was not suitable for cultivation, the Syrian map did not suit Israel’s water development plan. Blass explained that the movement of the International boundary in the area of Banias would affect Israel’s water rights. The Israeli cabinet rejected the Syrian proposals but decided to continue the negotiations by making changes to the accord and placing conditions on the Syrian proposals. The Israeli conditions took into account Blass’s position over water rights and Syria rejected the Israeli counter offer.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the <b>regularized</b> {{orthogonal}} {{linear discriminant analysis}} (ROLDA) is studied. The major issue of the <b>regularized</b> linear discriminant analysis is to choose an appropriate regularization parameter. In existing <b>regularized</b> linear discriminant analysis methods, they all select the best regularization parameter from a given parameter candidate set by using cross-validation for classification. An obvious limitation of such <b>regularized</b> linear discriminant analysis methods {{is that it is}} not clear how to choose an appropriate candidate set. Therefore, up to now, there is no concrete mathematical theory available in selecting an appropriate regularization parameter in practical applications of the <b>regularized</b> linear discriminant analysis. The present work is to fill this gap. Here we derive the mathematical relationship between orthogonal linear discriminant analysis and the <b>regularized</b> orthogonal linear discriminant analysis first, and then by means of this relationship we find a mathematical criterion for selecting the regularization parameter in ROLDA and consequently we develop a new <b>regularized</b> orthogonal linear discriminant analysis method, in which no candidate set of regularization parameter is needed. The effectiveness of our proposed <b>regularized</b> orthogonal linear discriminant analysis is illustrated by some real-world data sets. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|In 1927, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} that case that {{illegally}} earned income was subject to income tax; Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. rejected {{the argument that the}} Fifth Amendment protected criminals from reporting illegal income. The IRS special investigation unit chose Frank J. Wilson to investigate Capone, with the focus on his spending. The key to Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was tried for tax evasion in 1930. Ralph spent the next three years in prison after being convicted in a two-week trial over which Wilkerson presided. Capone ordered his lawyer to <b>regularize</b> his tax position. Crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income that Capone was willing to pay tax on for various years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance. Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years. In 1931, Capone was charged with income tax evasion, as well as with various violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition) at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of Judge James Herbert Wilkerson. U. S. Attorney George E. Q. Johnson agreed to a deal that he hoped might result in the judge giving Capone a couple of years, but Judge Wilkerson had been aware of the deal all along and refused to allow Capone to plead guilty for a reduced sentence. On {{the second day of the}} trial, Judge Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his client, saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so at his own risk. Wilkerson deemed that the 1930 letter to federal authorities could be admitted into evidence from a lawyer acting for Capone.|$|E

In this paper, we analyze their <b>regularizing</b> effects and establish the following results: (i) the filtered SVD expression are derived for the <b>regularized</b> solutions by MINRES; (ii) a hybrid MINRES that uses explicit regularization within projected problems is needed to compute a best possible <b>regularized</b> solution to a given ill-posed problem; (iii) the $k$th iterate by MINRES is more accurate than the $(k- 1) $th iterate by MR-II until the semi-convergence of MINRES, but MR-II has globally better <b>regularizing</b> effects than MINRES; (iv) bounds are obtained for the 2 -norm distance between an underlying $k$-dimensional Krylov subspace and the $k$-dimensional dominant eigenspace. They show that MR-II has better <b>regularizing</b> effects for severely and moderately ill-posed problems than for mildly ill-posed problems, and a hybrid MR-II is needed to get a best possible <b>regularized</b> solution for mildly ill-posed problems; (v) bounds are derived for the entries generated by the symmetric Lanczos process that MR-II is based on, showing how fast they decay.
