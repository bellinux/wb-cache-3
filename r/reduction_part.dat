40|$|A {{third of}} {{anthropomorphic}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} originate from the energy and transportation sectors. Since these emissions contribute to increased pollution and climate change, {{the development of new}} energy sources with decreased environmental impact is critical. The use of hydrogen as a fuel is an attractive way to increase energy security and reduce carbon emissions, and hence there is considerable interest in the efficient production and use of hydrogen. The production of hydrogen without the generation of CO 2 can be done by the electrolysis of water, and the hydrogen thus generated can be used to provide electrical power via its consumption in a fuel cell. However, both processes suffer from the inefficiency of the electrodes used for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), or water oxidation reaction, and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This project has focused on developing {{a deeper understanding of the}} factors limiting the catalytic performance of both the oxygen <b>reduction</b> (<b>Part</b> I) and oxygen evolution reactions (Part II) ...|$|E
40|$|Influenza {{hemagglutinin}} (HA) {{was used}} to analyze the stepwise folding and oligomeric assembly of glycoproteins in the early secretory pathway of living cells. In addition to mature trimers, six distinct maturation intermediates were identified. Of these, all the incompletely oxidized forms were located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and associated with calnexin, a membrane-bound, lectin-like ER chaperone. Once fully oxidized, the HA dissociated from calnexin as a monomer, which rapidly became resistant to dithiothreitol (DTT) <b>reduction.</b> <b>Part</b> of these extensively folded molecules moved as monomers into the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi complex. Assembly of homotrimers occurred without calnexin-involvement within the ER and in the intermediate compartment. When anchor-free HA molecules were analyzed, it was found that they reach the DTT-resistant monomeric conformation but fail to trimerize. Taken together, the results provide a definition and intracellular localization of several intermediates in the conformational maturation of HA, including the immediate precursor for trimer assembly...|$|E

This work focuses on power during test, covering two major research topics: test power analysis and test power reduction.

It is an universal power analysis methodology that can be applied to various digital designs, technologies, as well as handling low power design features.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{addresses the}} problem of additive noise re-duction using one-channel noise suppression system. A new implementation effective method is suggested and evaluated. The method consists of two independent parts. The noise es-timation part {{is based on the}} noise matched filter producing an estimation of background noise without the need of a voice acti-vity detector. The noise <b>reduction</b> <b>part</b> uses short-time spectral attenuation technique. The main idea reducing computational costs lies in the use of reduced number of frequency bands for computation of attenuation factors. Except of reduced number of operations this approach decreases fluctuations of estimated spectral gains, and therefore the speech distortion is low. Thus the suggested system eliminates the need of any enhanced spe-ech postprocessing. A new effective approach is used for the inverse frequency transformation. In spite of the simplicity of the suggested method its performance is comparable with other existing one-channel noise reduction methods. 1. Introduction an...|$|E
40|$|The {{subjective}} well-being {{approach to}} environmental valuation {{is applied to}} analyze the valuation of greenhouse gas emissions. Dimensions like population and income are then incorporated into the valuation to get the fairness-adjusted marginal value of emissions. The {{results indicate that the}} industrialized countries have high willingness-to-pay to reduce emissions with the United States and Japan reporting the largest figures. Developing countries differ in their valuations, albeit they are not subject to the mandatory reductions of emissions, but still the results indicate that poor countries like China and India indicate willingness to pay whereas Brazil and Mexico indicate willingness to accept payments to reduce emissions. The high willingness-to-pay indicated by the industrialized countries does not imply that they can pay off the developing countries to continue emitting as usual. However, the different modes of willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept of countries indicate possibilities toward the formation of an inter-group payments and transfers system to allow societies to contribute toward global reduction emissions <b>reduction.</b> <b>Part</b> of the payments from the industrial countries could be used to support global programs to change the patterns of production and consumption and accelerate the development of cleaner technologies. ...|$|E
