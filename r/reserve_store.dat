[Footnote: The grape-shot was fired from the Castle of San Pedro; others opine from San Cristobal; and the Canarese say that a splinter of stone did the work. According to most authorities, Nelson was half-way up the mole. James declares that Nelson's elbow was struck by a shot as he was drawing his sword and stepping out of his boat. In Nelson's Despatches, loc. cit., we read that the 'mole was instantly stormed and carried, although defended by 400 or 500 men, and the guns--six 24-pounders--were spiked; but such a heavy fire of musketry and grape-shot was kept up from the citadel and houses {{at the head of the}} mole that we could not advance, and nearly all were killed.'] The brave Captain Bowen was killed on the first step of the Mole, a volley of grape tearing away his stomach. [Footnote: This officer is said to have caused the expedition, by describing it to Admiral Jervis and the British Government as an easy exploit. He had previously cut out of this bay a Philippine Island frigate, El Principe Fernando; and he had with him, as guide, a Chinese prisoner, taken in that vessel. The guide was also killed. Captain Bowen's family made some exertions to recover certain small articles which he carried about him--watch, pistols, &c.--and failed. One pistol was lost, and for the other its possessor modestly demanded 14l.] Nineteen other Englishmen were struck down by a discharge of grape. The gun which fired it had, on that same night, been placed by the governor of the Castle of San Cristobal, Don Josef Monteverde, [Footnote: There is a note in my volume, 'Father of the adopted son, Miguelito Morales.'] at a new embrasure which he caused to be opened in the flank of the bastion. [Footnote: This part of the castle has now been altered, and mounted with brass 80-pounders.] Thus it commanded the landing-place, where before there was dead ground. The enemy afterwards confessed that the injury thus done was the first cause of his misfortunes.|$|E

The existence of a spare reservoir of mental energy ultimately explains why various motivators can buffer the effects of mild or moderate ego depletion. In a state of low resources, an individual lacks motivation to exert any more energy, but if motivation is presented, there are still extra resources that can be used up. Thus, ego depletion could be conceptualized as a psychological constraint necessary to safeguard precious resources that might be needed in emergency situations in the future.

40|$|The {{experimental}} data given below support {{the thesis that}} the liver is actively concerned with the fabrication of the plasma proteins. One of the plasma proteins (fibrinogen) takes its origin from the liver and the evidence (5, 3, 8) for this statement is now generally accepted. There is a <b>reserve</b> <b>store</b> of protein material in the liver (1, 7), and some of this or other material is thrown into the circulation after a rapid and extreme plasma depletion (6) to effect a sharp rise in total plasma protein eoneentra~tion. Liver injury and the Eck fistula abolish this sharp reaction. Disease of the liver-in man may show a low plasma protein concentration (12). The Eck fistula permits the portal blood to flow directly into the vena eava and excludes it from the liver so that the blood supply of the liver is then wholly arterial and probably reduced to 25 to 35 per cent of the normal combined portal and arterial flow.

40|$|Blood plasma {{proteins}} are {{an active}} part of the complex integrated system of body proteins. This thesis has been supported by various contributions coming from this laboratory.

This protein exchange, this ebb and flow between plasma and cell proteins is in large part dependent upon the <b>reserve</b> <b>store</b> of protein within various body cells (e. g., in liver and in muscle cells).

It is well established (2, 7) that plasma protein as whole plasma given by vein to the dog can supply all the protein requirements of the body over considerable periods of time.

40|$|The main {{thesis of}} this paper is the "dynamic {{equilibrium}} " between body protein and plasma protein.

Earlier experiments in this laboratory showed that plasma protein as plasma as the sole source of protein given by vein could maintain nitrogen equilibrium for 2 to 4 weeks (3, 11, 13).

40|$|Human {{liver tissue}} has been assayed to {{determine}} the amount of hemoglobin production factors in normal and abnormal states. Standardized dogs made anemic by blood removal have been used in this biological assay. Normal animal liver as control is rated as 100 per cent. Normal human liver tissue as compared with the normal animal control contains more of these hemoglobin production factors—a biological assay ratio of 120 to 160 per cent. Infections, acute and chronic, do not appear to modify these values, the concentration of hemoglobin-producing factors falling within the normal range. Pernicious anemia and aplastic anemia both show large liver stores of hemoglobin-producing factors—a biological assay ratio of 200 to 240 per cent. Therapy in pernicious anemia reduces these liver stores as new red cells are formed. Secondary anemia presents a low normal or subnormal liver store of hemoglobin-producing factors—an assay of 60 to 130 per cent. Hemochromatosis, erythroblastic anemia, and hemolytic icterus in spite of large iron deposits in the liver usually show a biological assay which is normal or close to normal. Polycythemia shows low <b>reserve</b> <b>stores</b> of hemoglobin-producing factors. Leukemias present a wide range of values discussed above. Hypoproteinemia almost always is associated with low <b>reserve</b> <b>stores</b> of hemoglobin-producing factors in the liver—biological assays of 60 to 80 per cent. Hypoproteinemia means a depletion of body protein <b>reserve</b> <b>stores</b> including the labile protein liver reserves—a strong indication that the prehemoglobin material (or globin) is related to these liver stores. Pregnancy, eclampsia, and lactation all may present subnormal liver stores of hemoglobin-producing factors.

40|$|When {{hemoglobin}} is {{set free}} in the circulation the kidney plays {{an important part in}} the conservation of iron. When the renal threshold is not exceeded by the hemoglobin in the blood {{there is little or no}} excess iron deposited in the kidney but when superthreshold doses of blood hemoglobin are given the epithelium of the convoluted tubules accumulates much iron and the iron analyses may show 5 times normal values. The normal dog (140 to 150 per cent hemoglobin) has a large <b>reserve</b> <b>store</b> of iron in the liver, spleen and marrow. Diets may modify this storage of iron in these tissues. To bring conclusive proof relating to the individual diet factors, the <b>reserve</b> <b>store</b> of iron should be depleted by an anemia period of 2 to 3 months. Complete removal of red cells from tissue capillaries is essential for accurate iron assays of fresh tissue. The method described accomplishes this without causing gross tissue edema. The lowest iron content is observed in the pancreas, stomach, jejunum, colon and urinary bladder. These figures average from 1 to 2 mg. iron per 100 gm. fresh tissue. This shows that smooth muscle and mucous membranes contain little iron. Striated muscle (heart, psoas) shows a relatively low iron content but uniform values close to 4 mg. per 100 gm. tissue. Lungs show a considerable fluctuation with low iron values in anemia (3. 7 mg.) and higher values in health (6 to 7 mg.). The spleen shows maximal fluctuations and the highest reserve storage of iron per 100 gm. fresh tissue. The spleen iron analyses show low values in anemia (7 to 15 mg.) and wide differences in controls (25 to 50 mg.). With hemoglobin injections the iron storage is conspicuous and iron analyses may run as high as l 50 to 175 mg. iron per 100 gm. fresh tissue. Bone marrow of the rib runs in parallel with the spleen as regards iron storage following hemoglobin injections and depletion following anemia periods. The liver because of its weight always contains the main bulk of the iron stored in the blood free tissues of the body. Its store is depleted by anemia even to levels of 4 to 5 mg. iron per 100 gm. fresh tissue. In the normal dog the iron store in the liver averages 25 mg. per 100 gm. tissue. Frequent hemoglobin injections may increase this level to 31 mg. iron per 100 gm. The liver is considered the most active clearing house for iron storage and utilization...|$|E
40|$|Using the {{technique}} of plasmapheresis, Kerr, Hurwitz and Whipple (1, 2) observed that dogs receiving food regenerate blood plasma protein more rapidly than fasting animals. Later Smith, Belt and Whipple (3) modified the experimental method by reinjecting the cell suspension simultaneously with the bleeding and reported a rapid regeneration within 15 minutes after the hemorrhage. This rate of recovery then decreased, 2 to 7 days being required for return to a normal value. The rapid replacement of serum protein immediately after plasmapheresis was interpreted as indicating a <b>reserve</b> <b>store</b> of this material. Following the demonstration that diet will promote the regeneration of serum protein from an abnormally low value to the normal, Whipple and collaborators (4 - 6) have attempted to evaluate dietary factors as specific agents for stimulating this recovery. Plasmapheresis, while the animals were fed a basal diet, was continued 4 to 6 weeks before the dogs exhibited an approximately constant production of plasma proteins. The reduction of the plasma protein level to 4. 0 per cent was considered {{to act as a}} constant and maximal stimulus for the regeneration of serum protein. Potent dietary factors necessitated larger and more frequent bleedings to maintain the concentration constant at the desired low level, designated as the basal level.

40|$|When {{blood plasma}} {{proteins}} are depleted by bleeding, with {{return of the}} washed red cells (plasmapheresis) {{it is possible to}} bring dogs to a steady state of hypoproteinemia and a uniform plasma protein production on a basal low protein diet. These dogs are clinically normal with normal appetite, no anemia and normal nitrogen metabolism. These dogs become test subjects by which various factors relating to plasma protein production may be tested. The normal dog (10 to 13 kg.) has a substantial <b>reserve</b> <b>store</b> of plasma protein building material (10 to 60 + gm.) which requires 2 to 6 weeks plasmapheresis for its complete removal. After this period the dog will produce uniform amounts of plasma protein each week on a fixed basal diet. Dogs previously depleted by plasmapheresis and then permitted to return to normal during a long rest period of many weeks, may show much higher reserve stores of protein building material in subsequent periods of plasma depletion (see Table 1). Under uniform conditions of low protein diet intake when plasmapheresis is discontinued for 2 weeks the plasma protein building material is stored quantitatively in the body and can subsequently be recovered (Table 4) in the next 2 to 3 weeks of plasmapheresis. Given complete depletion of plasma protein building reserve stores the dog can produce very little (2 ± gm. per week) plasma protein on a protein-free diet. This {{may be related to the}} wear and tear of body protein and conservation of these split products. Abscesses produced in a depleted dog during a fast may cause some excess production of plasma protein which is probably related to products of tissue destruction conserved for protein anabolism.

40|$|When {{blood plasma}} {{proteins}} are depleted by bleeding with {{return of the}} washed red blood cells (plasmapheresis) {{it is possible to}} bring dogs to a steady state of hypoproteinemia and a uniform plasma protein production on a basal low protein diet. These dogs are clinically normal. Introduction of variables into their standardized life gives insight into the production of plasma protein. Casein retested as the basal protein in the ration may show high yield of plasma protein, equal to 33 per cent of the protein fed. This equals the potency of liver protein (17 to 33 per cent) and approaches the utilization of plasma protein by mouth (40 per cent). Zein has no effect upon plasma protein regeneration but when it is supplemented with cystine, tryptophane, lysine, and glycine, there is a doubling of the liver basal plasma protein production and a retention of the fed protein nitrogen. Threonine does not modify the above reaction. Liver protein supplemented with cystine, leucine, glutamic acid, and glycine in the basal diet yields double the amount of new formed plasma protein compared with liver alone. This combination is then as potent as plasma protein itself when given by mouth— 40 per cent utilization. Tyrosine or lysine, arginine, and isoleucine do not modify the above responses. Methionine is not as effective as cystine in supplementing gelatin and tyrosine to produce plasma protein. Cystine, leucine, and glutamic acid appear to be of primary importance in the building of new plasma protein in these experiments. Plasma protein formation is dependent upon materials coming from the body reserve and from the diet. Given an exhaustion of the <b>reserve</b> <b>store</b> there is very little plasma protein produced during a protein fast (3 to 6 gm. per week). A turpentine abscess does not modify this fasting plasma protein reaction. Homologous plasma given by vein will promptly correct experimental hypoproteinemia due to bleeding. It will maintain nitrogen equilibrium and replenish protein stores. Even during hypoproteinemia plasma protein may promptly pass out of the circulation to supply body needs for protein. Perhaps the most significant concept which derives from all these experiments is the fluidity of the body protein (including plasma protein) —a ready give and take between the protein depots—a "dynamic equilibrium" of body protein...|$|E
