40|$|The Direct Access File System (DAFS) is a {{distributed}} {{file system}} built {{on top of}} direct-access transports (DAT). Direct-access transports are characterized by using remote direct memory access (RDMA) for data transfer and user-level networking. The motivation behind the DAT-enabled distributed file system architecture is {{the reduction of the}} overhead on the I/O data path. The goal of this work is to determine whether the architecture of DAFS brings any fundamental performance benefits to applications compared to traditional distributed file systems. To accomplish this, we conduct a performance evaluation of DAFS and compare it to a traditional network storage system: a version of NFS optimized to reduce the I/O overhead. We conclude that DAFS can accomplish superior performance for latency-sensitive applications. Bandwidth-sensitive applications do equally well on both systems, unless they are CPU-bound, in which case they perform better on DAFS. We also found that RDMA is a less <b>restrictive</b> <b>mechanism</b> to achieve copy avoidance than that used by the optimized NFS...|$|E
40|$|The murine gene Fv- 1 {{has been}} shown to exert a major {{influence}} over the replication of ecotropic murine leukemia viruses. Studies of the replication of Friend murine leukemia virus have shown that the restriction of viral replication occurs intracellularly after the initiation of viral DNA synthesis. The precise mechanism of the block imposed by the Fv- 1 gene product is not completely understood. Our studies of Fv- 1 restrictive infection have shown a variable decrease in the accumulation of intracellular unintegrated form I viral DNA. Analysis by microinjection of the viral DNA formed in nonpermissively infected BALB/c cells indicates that this DNA is infectious. These studies indicate that the form I DNA accumulated in nonpermissively infected BALB/c cells contains the complete viral sequences necessary for the production of viral progeny, and therefore, they suggest that the Fv- 1 host <b>restrictive</b> <b>mechanism</b> recognizes viral factors other than form I DNA alone.

40|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) cells have {{historically}} been characterized by low proliferation and neural differentiation, with an inability to repair or replace themselves following damage or degeneration. Widespread scientific efforts have therefore been made to outsmart the <b>restrictive</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the CNS and to address the devastation caused by this shortcoming. Although stem cells were initially thought to be tissue-specific {{in their ability to}} differentiate and proliferate, they have demonstrated the capacity to achieve functional neuronal identity when provided access to a permissive neural environment. Aguayo et al. (1980) proposed that the failure of CNS neurons to regenerate is not an intrinsic deficit of the neuron, but rather a characteristic feature of the environment that either does not support, or prevents regeneration 1. My lab’s success in isolating stem cells from CNS tissues and inducing them to adopt a neuronal fate, both in vitro and in vivo upon transplantation, supports this suggestion. Therefore, others and we have made significant progress in identifying diverse sources of stem cells, determining elements required for the generation of functional CNS neurons, and exploring the potential of these cells for therapeutic neuroregenerative strategies through stem cell and gene therapy...|$|E

Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment approach for obesity, with resultant improvement in obesity-related comorbidities.

This systematic review aims to assess and characterize the impact that different types of bariatric surgery have on obese OSA patients. 22 articles with stated preoperative apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), apnea index (AI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI) were analyzed in this review. A significant improvement in AHI/AI/RDI occurred after surgery, in addition to the foreseeable reduction in body mass index (BMI).

40|$|Escherichia coli cells {{treated with}} toluene {{replicate}} DNA {{when they are}} provided with deoxyribonucleoside 5 ′-triphosphates, ATP, Mg++, and K+. However, when deoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate is replaced by hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate, incorporation of nucleotides into acid-precipitable material by toluenetreated strains restrictive to nonglucosylated T-even phage is reduced to less than 5 % of that normally observed. Even when dCTP {{is present in the}} reaction mixture, a similar effect of the hydroxymethyl analogue on DNA replication is observed. In contrast, toluene-treated E. coli K 12 r 6 -r 2, 4 -, a strain permissive to the nonglucosylated T-even phage, incorporates hydroxymethyl deoxycytosine into its DNA, and replication proceeds at only a slightly reduced rate {{in the presence of the}} hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate. The presence of the hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate in the reaction mixture does not lead to degradation of preexisting DNA of the restrictive host, but it does lead to an irreversible inhibition of further DNA replication; the inhibition is observed only when the hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate is present during replication. Thus phage-specific enzymes are not necessary for the incorporation of hydroxymethylcytosine into phage DNA, and the <b>restrictive</b> <b>mechanism,</b> present in the host cell before infection, can recognize hydroxymethylcytosine residues in its own DNA, as well as the DNA of the T-even phage...|$|E

We formalize requirements for laissez-faire sharing, which parallel the requirements of free market economies, to better address the file sharing needs of information workers.

40|$|Macrophages and {{dendritic}} {{cells have}} key roles in viral infections, providing virus reservoirs that frequently resist antiviral therapies and linking innate virus detection to antiviral adaptive immune responses. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1) fails to transduce dendritic cells {{and has a}} reduced ability to transduce macrophages, due to an as yet uncharacterized mechanism that inhibits infection by interfering with efficient synthesis of viral complementary DNA. In contrast, HIV- 2 and related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVsm/mac) transduce myeloid cells efficiently owing to their virion-associated Vpx accessory proteins, which counteract the <b>restrictive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Here we show that the inhibition of HIV- 1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD 1). Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD 1 onto the CRL 4 (DCAF 1) E 3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome-dependent degradation of the protein. Mutations in SAMHD 1 cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, a disease that produces a phenotype that mimics {{the effects of a}} congenital viral infection. Failure to dispose of endogenous nucleic acid debris in Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome results in inappropriate triggering of innate immune responses via cytosolic nucleic acids sensors. Thus, our findings show that macrophages are defended from HIV- 1 infection by a mechanism that prevents an unwanted interferon response triggered by self nucleic acids, and uncover an intricate relationship between innate immune mechanisms that control response to self and to retroviral pathogens...|$|E

Morbid obesity has become a global epidemic during the 20 th century. Until now bariatric surgery is the only effective treatment for this disease leading to sustained weight loss and improvement of comorbidities. The sleeve gastrectomy is becoming a promising alternative for the gold standard the gastric bypass and it is gaining popularity as a stand-alone procedure. The effect of the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy {{is based on a}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>mechanism,</b> but a hormonal effect also seems to play an important role. Similar results are achieved in terms of excess weight loss and resolution of comorbidities compared to the gastric bypass. Inade-quate weight loss or weight regain can be treated by revisional surgery. Complication rates after LSG appear to be lower compared with gastric bypass. General guidelines recommend bariatric surgery between the age of 18 and 65. However bariatric surgery in the elderly seems safe with respect to weight loss and resolution of comorbidities. At the same time weight loss surgery is more often performed in adolescent patients failing weight loss attempts. Even though more studies are needed describing long-term effects, there is already enough evidence that this technique is an effective single procedure for a considerable proportion of obese patients. 1...|$|E
40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) is a {{major cause}} of morbidity and mortality amongst immuno-compromised individuals and {{is the leading cause of}} congenital diseases amongst newborn infants. Mouse CMV (MCMV) infection of inbred mice has been extensively used as a model for HCMV pathogenesis and host-virus interaction. Macrophages are a key target cell type in the pathogenesis of human and mouse CMV infections. Macrophages are semi-permissive to CMV infection, however, the nature of this <b>restrictive</b> <b>mechanism</b> of infection is open for investigation. In this thesis, I hypothesized that macrophage permissivity is determined by the dynamic interplay of the innate response during the immediate-early (IE) period of infection. To test this hypothesis, I first developed and validated a flow cytometry based assay. In MCMV infected macrophages, I found heterogeneous expression from the major IE promoter (MIEP) leading to the development of a refractory subpopulation for IE expression. I further developed a computational modelling approach to help elucidate the dynamics of infection during this period. Modelling work revealed that the occurrence of refractory subpopulation could be caused by either 1) pre-existence of heterogeneous permissivity of macrophages prior to infection or 2) through an emergent process. Experimental testing of the models shows that the heterogeneous IE expression of homogeneously infected macrophages is caused by an emergent process. MCMV infection using type I interferon receptor and signal transducers and activator of transcription 1 (Stat 1) knockout macrophages reveals that the emergence of refractory subpopulation is predominantly mediated by type I interferon through Stat 1. Comparative molecular analysis between progressively infected and refractory subpopulations reveals that MCMV MIEP activation in the refractory subpopulation is stochastically inhibited by high expression of type I interferon induced antiviral components...|$|E

The entry of the [125 I]-TGF-߲ to the brain was rapid, saturable and inhibited by co-injection of unlabelled TGF-߲. In contrast, co-injection of unlabelled TGF-߲ increased the retention of [125 I]-TGF-߲ in the blood. The [125 I]-TGF-߲ transported into the brain was localised by autoradiography to the extracellular space, and was intact as judged by SDS-PAGE. The [125 I]-TGF-߲ was widely distributed throughout the brain, with the highest concentrations in the hypothalamus and nerves and the lowest in the cerebral hemispheres.

We raise concerns about the mechanism causing data to be missing. We present a flexible class of joint models for the survival times and the missing data mechanism which allows us to vary the mechanism causing the missing data. Simulation studies prove this model to be both precise and reliable in estimating survival with missing data. We show that long term survival in the moderately disabled is high and, therefore, a large proportion will be surviving to times when they require care specifically for elderly CP sufferers. In particular, our models suggest that survival from diagnosis is considerably higher than has been previously estimated from this data.

30|$|The main {{challenge}} in the diagnosis (and treatment) of AD is to overcome the <b>restrictive</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is the interface between the blood and the brain and consists of a diffusion barrier which impedes the influx of most compounds from blood to brain. It is composed of three cellular elements of the brain microvasculature: endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, and pericytes. BBB endothelial cells differ from endothelial cells {{in the rest of}} the body due to their absence of fenestrations, more extensive tight junctions, and sparse pinocytic vesicle transport [17]. Despite the extremely large surface area of the 100 billion capillaries contained in the human brain (approximately 20  m 2), the permeability of many substances is low because of the dense anatomical structure of tight junctions between endothelial cells around the capillaries in the central nervous system (CNS). These tight junctions are composed of smaller subunits, frequently transmembrane proteins [18], each of which is anchored to the endothelial cells by another protein complex. This barrier does not exist in normal circulation, but in the brain it limits the flux of hydrophilic molecules across the BBB. In contrast, small lipophilic substances such as water and some gases (O 2, CO 2) diffuse freely across plasma membranes along their concentration gradient, and nutrients crucial to neural function such as glucose and amino acids enter the brain via transporters. However, the BBB restricts the passage of solutes and prevents the passage of most circulating cells and molecules, thus protecting the brain from foreign substances and maintaining CNS homeostasis [19]. Delivering therapeutic agents to the brain is a major {{challenge in}} the treatment of most brain disorders. For instance, one way of bypassing the BBB is the infusion of hyperosmolar solutions (e.g., of mannitol) in conjunction with the suitable drug. In consequence, one requirement for any substance capable of detecting biomarkers or inhibiting β peptide aggregation is that it should be able to cross the BBB.|$|E
40|$|The main {{distinguishing}} features of present-day global imbalances go beyond their sheer amount and generalisation. First, {{the world economy}} is characterised by an increased and dynamic presence of many developing countries that simultaneously have turned from deficit into surplus economies. Second, imbalances happen {{in a context of}} variable exchange rates and under an accelerated process of financial globalisation. Third, the international reserve currency is basically the currency of just one advanced country in the world. Both the variability of exchange rates –in principle freeing countries of the need to defend their parities–and the easy availability of private foreign finance –liberating them from the limits imposed either by the amount of foreign exchange reserves or the conditional access to IMF resources– go to a great extent to explain the increase and generalisation of current account deficits. But, additionally, the capacity of the United States to run deficits financed by the fact of their issuing the international reserve currency, has decisively contributed to the explosion in the magnitude of the imbalances. Of course, the ability to finance deficits by resorting to foreign inflows is dominated by its variability and by the accumulation of debt frequently ending up in severe crises. Thus, financial stability is endangered. On the surpluses side, quite a few major advanced countries persist in generating them instead of promoting fast rates of growth and improving the lot of their own citizens. Thus, the old-time deflationary bias that places limits on deficit countries while leaving the major surplus countries to unfettered run restrictive policies playing beggar-thy-neighbour {{on the rest of the}} world still rules the present-day non-system. Surely, many fast growing developing countries, having on the contrary become the dynamic force in the world economy, play a completely different role based on their having overcome the restrictions that deficits used to place on their performance. Redressing global imbalances to avoid financial instability, therefore, would, at the international level, require regulating “speculative” private international capital flows, on the one hand, and devising a new international monetary system that would run on the basis of a multilateral reserve currency. Additionally, a less <b>restrictive</b> <b>mechanism</b> than the conditionality-run IMF should be established for clearing temporary imbalances with similar obligations for surplus and deficit countries, although growth rates and the stage of development would have to be taken into account. Redressing global imbalances, however, should not be made at the expense of growth in the world economy that as mentioned before has come to increasingly depend on the developing countries’ economies. Room, therefore, would have to be built for the surpluses of the developing countries following successful export-led strategies to be accommodated within such a system. This way, developing countries will keep being able to pursue expansionary policies, reduce inequality and continue to represent a dynamic force in global terms. ...|$|E

According to earlier work in crustaceans and fish (Frederich and Pörtner 2000; Van Dijk et al. 1999), thermal limitation becomes effective first by {{a drop in}} aerobic scope at pejus temperatures Tp and, then, by the onset of anaerobic mitochondrial metabolism, which is expressed in the critical temperature Tc. Thus, a hypothesis was set up stating that oxygen limitation characterizes {{the first line of}} thermal intolerance. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of hyperoxia and temperature on energy metabolism, blood flow and tissue oxygenation in the Antarctic eelpout Pachycara brachycephalum using in vivo MR methods in combination with oxygen consumption measurements. Surprisingly, exposure to hyperoxia (PO 2 : 45 kPa) and warmer temperatures resulted in a linear increase in oxygen consumption; the typical exponential increment of oxygen uptake was eliminated. Similarly, blood flow in the Aorta dorsalis increased above 6 °C in normoxic but not to the same extent in hyperoxic animals. Liver tissue oxygenation increased steadily in both groups from 0 - 11 °C, above which there was a sudden drop in the normoxic controls whilst hyperoxic animals kept a high level of tissue oxygenation. These findings suggest that improved oxygen availability diminishes the effects of thermal stress by reducing the energy cost of oxygen uptake and distribution.

Here, we have uncovered coordination between transcriptional and morphogen cues to specify Merkel cells, poorly understood skin cells that mediate light touch sensations. In murine dorsal skin, Merkel cells are part of touch domes, which are skin structures consisting of specialized keratinocytes, Merkel cells, and afferent neurons, and are located exclusively around primary hair follicles. We show that the developing primary hair follicle functions as a niche required for Merkel cell specification. We find that intraepidermal Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, initiated by the production of Shh ligand in the developing hair follicles, is required for Merkel cell specification. The importance of Shh for Merkel cell formation is further reinforced {{by the fact that}} Shh overexpression in embryonic epidermal progenitors leads to ectopic Merkel cells. Interestingly, Shh signaling is common to primary, secondary, and tertiary hair follicles, raising the possibility that there are <b>restrictive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that regulate Merkel cell specification exclusively around primary hair follicles. Indeed, we find that loss of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC 2) in the epidermis results in the formation of ectopic Merkel cells that are associated with all hair types. We show that PRC 2 loss expands the field of epidermal cells competent to differentiate into Merkel cells through the upregulation of key Merkel-differentiation genes, which are known PRC 2 targets. Importantly, PRC 2 -mediated repression of the Merkel cell differentiation program requires inductive Shh signaling to form mature Merkel cells.

Synthetic traffic patterns based on independent traffic sources are commonly used to measure performance in terms of average latency and peak throughput. As they do not capture the level of self-throttling that occurs in most parallel applications, they can produce inaccurate throughput estimates at high loads. Thus, workloads that resemble the varying levels of synchronization of actual applications are needed to study the performance of interconnection networks.

To validate this approach, we compare the gains achieved by a <b>restrictive</b> injection <b>mechanism</b> under this workload with those obtained using traces from the NAS Parallel Benchmarks.

The acclaimed participatory nature of the Summit-process (in Geneva), including the preparatory meetings, is evaluated through a comparison of generative, <b>restrictive</b> power <b>mechanisms</b> and the resistance they provoke. Our analysis shows the importance of explicitly dealing with power and power (im) balances when evaluating participatory discourses, specifically in policy contexts. The WSIS process has made a valuable contribution towards increasing civil society's access, interaction and consultation in international regulatory practices, but the power imbalances are still too present to justify the use of the notion of participation.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} impact of key teacher {{education}} policies created between 2000 and 2010 on further education teacher educators. Data was collected {{from a group of}} experienced teacher educators in the Midlands through a series of semi-structured interviews. This article argues that the reforms were driven by too great a concern for political ideology and established overly <b>restrictive</b> control <b>mechanisms</b> to ensure compliance. Although the need for standardisation was acknowledged, the use of competency-based standards was seen as detrimental to meaningful teacher education pedagogy. It was perceived that the policies were being implemented in a managerial manner that strove for compliance. However, where compliance was at odds with their own personal and democratic professional stance, the teacher educators used a range of strategies to subvert or avoid implementing policy {{in order to try to}} stay true to their philosophical values. Nevertheless, positive aspects did emanate from the teacher education reforms, which included a drive for professional status and a recognised level 5 qualification. These positive features now appear to have been abandoned following the Lingfield Report and a different ideological thrust to deregulate the sector...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Laparoscopic sleeve {{gastrectomy}} (LSG) is {{an innovative}} {{approach to the}} surgical management of morbid obesity. Weight loss may be achieved by <b>restrictive</b> and endocrine <b>mechanisms.</b> Early data suggest LSG is effica-cious {{in the management of}} morbid obesity and may have an important role either as a staged or definitive procedure. A systematic review of the literature analyzing the clinical and operational outcomes of LSG was completed to further define the status of LSG as an emerging treatment modality for morbid obesity. Data from LSG were compared to benchmark clinical data and local operational data from laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) and laparo-scopic gastric bypass (LRYGB). Fifteen studies (940 patients) were identified following systematic review. The percent excessive weight loss (%EWL) for LSG varie...|$|R
40|$|Surveys {{carried out}} in {{international}} insurance markets, including New Zealand, indicate that there is considerable diversity in the levels of voluntary disclosure made by companies in their annual reports. Critics argue that such disparity diminishes the stewardship and decision-usefulness value of annual reports for users such as policyholders, shareholders and industry regulators. However, a major deficiency with the prior surveys {{is that they do}} not explain the different reporting practices observed in insurance markets. Drawing a framework from the managerial-discretion hypothesis, this thesis thus seeks to explain the level of information voluntarily disclosed in the annual reports of New Zealand-based life insurance companies. The managerial-discretion hypothesis holds that the diffused nature of policyholders' ownership rights in mutuals makes it more difficult for them to monitor and control managerial behaviour compared with the relatively more closely-held shareholdings of stock companies. In such a situation, policyholders are likely to control managerial discretion across a range of business activities by means of <b>restrictive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> such as internal regulations. The relationship between the level of voluntary disclosure and eight explanatory variables - organisational form, assets-in-place, product concentration, reinsurance, localisation of operations, non-executive directors, firm size and distribution system - each representing the major constructs of the managerial-discretion hypothesis, is tested empirically in this study using data-triangulation. This methodology comprises a statistical analysis of pooled 1988 - 1993 data drawn from New Zealand's life insurance industry as well as an evaluation of field interviews and documentation obtained from 12 companies representing a cross-section of the industry. Data-triangulation helps to test the validity of the constructs used and evaluate the reliability of the evidence collected. Consistent with what was hypothesised, the empirical results indicate that the level of information voluntarily disclosed by life insurance companies in their annual reports is positively associated with stock companies, firm size, product diversity and reliance on independent sales agents/brokers. Contrary to expectations, the evidence suggest that non-executive directors complement rather than substitute for voluntary disclosure. Also contrary to what was hypothesised, the statistical analysis indicate that reinsurance had a positive influence on voluntary disclosure, but this observation was not supported by the fieldwork. Furthermore, two variables - assets-in-place and localisation of operations - were found not to be important determinants of voluntary disclosure in both the statistical analysis and field-based research. The study thus provides mixed support for the managerial-discretion hypothesis. The field-based research also reveals that other factors such as company culture and market competition could be important determinants of voluntary disclosure. Finally, a major contribution {{of this study is that}} the empirical results could assist industry regulators to better understand the disclosure practices of life insurance companies and so enable them to gauge the likely success of new reporting rules...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of any {{theoretical}} guidance, a solution {{to the question of what}} is the appropriate functional form for an import demand model can only be found empirically. Examines this question in the context of UK motor vehicle imports by applying a range of tests of functional form to two, alternatively specified, import demand models: the “traditional” price-income model incorporating the popular but <b>restrictive</b> partial adjustment <b>mechanism</b> and a cost-expenditure model that employs a less restrictive lag structure. Finds, principally that the commonly imposed linear or log-linear functional forms cannot be rejected in relation to the price-income specification, but there is some evidence that neither functional form may be appropriate in relation to the theoretically sounder cost-expenditure model of import demand.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a computational, declarative approach to prosodic morphology that uses inviolable constraints to denote small finite candidate sets which are filtered by a <b>restrictive</b> incremental optimization <b>mechanism.</b> The new approach is illustrated with an implemented fragment of Modern Hebrew verbs couched in MicroCUF, an expressive constraint logic formalism. For generation and parsing of word forms, I propose a novel off-line technique to eliminate run-time optimization. It produces a finitestate oracle that efficiently restricts the constraint interpreter 's search space. As a byproduct, unknown words {{can be analyzed}} without special mechanisms. Unlike pure finite-state transducer approaches, this hybrid setup allows for more expressivity in constraints to specify e. g. token identity for reduplication or arithmetic constraints for phonetics. 1 Introduction Prosodic morphology (PM) circumscribes a number of phenomena ranging from `nonconatenative' rootand -pattern morpholog [...] ...|$|R
