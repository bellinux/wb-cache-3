50|$|The {{apparatus}} is assembled {{as in the}} diagram. (The diagram {{represents a}} batch apparatus {{as opposed to a}} continuous apparatus.) The mixture is put into the <b>round</b> <b>bottomed</b> <b>flask</b> along with a few anti-bumping granules (or a Teflon coated magnetic stirrer bar if using magnetic stirring), and the fractionating column is fitted into the top. The fractional distillation column is set up with the heat source at the bottom on the still pot. As the distance from the stillpot increases, a temperature gradient is formed in the column; it is coolest at the top and hottest at the bottom. As the mixed vapor ascends the temperature gradient, some of the vapor condenses and revaporizes along the temperature gradient. Each time the vapor condenses and vaporizes, the composition of the more volatile component in the vapor increases. This distills the vapor {{along the length of the}} column, and eventually the vapor is composed solely of the more volatile component (or an azeotrope). The vapor condenses on the glass platforms, known as trays, inside the column, and runs back down into the liquid below, refluxing distillate. The efficiency in terms of the amount of heating and time required to get fractionation can be improved by insulating the outside of the column in an insulator such as wool, aluminium foil or preferably a vacuum jacket. The hottest tray is at the bottom and the coolest is at the top. At steady state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray are at equilibrium. The most volatile component of the mixture exits as a gas at the top of the column. The vapor at the top of the column then passes into the condenser, which cools it down until it liquefies. The separation is more pure with the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.) Initially, the condensate will be close to the azeotropic composition, but when much of the ethanol has been drawn off, the condensate becomes gradually richer in water. The process continues until all the ethanol boils out of the mixture. This point can be recognized by the sharp rise in temperature shown on the thermometer.|$|E

30|$|Chopping board (PTFE, China) and Teflon (PTFE) knife {{were used}} to cut ginger rhizome in to pieces. A drying oven (Digitheat, J.P. Selecta, Spain) was used to dry ginger sample. Electronic {{blending}} device (Moulinex, France) was used for grinding and homogenizing {{the sample to determine}} the total metal content of the ginger. Mortar and pestle was used to grind soil sample. Analytical balance (Larko, LA 114, 110  g/ 0.1  g) with precision of[*]±[*] 0.0001  g was used to weigh the ginger and soil sample.

40|$|A {{technique}} for stable and reproducible electrochemically generated SBSL events (eSBSL) is presented. This approach {{is shown to}} have some advantages over conventional seeding methods. These include control of the initial gas flux {{and control of the}} initial SBSL bubble composition within the same media (e. g. the ability to seed with H 2 and O 2 for example). Comparison of different cell types shows that a cell setup based on conventional <b>round</b> <b>bottomed</b> <b>flasks</b> is the most appropriate for eSBSL generation. Typically a critical current (- 0. 11 mA) is required to generate a hydrogen seeded eSBSL event from a 50 ?m diameter Pt electrode while oxygen seeding requires + 0. 15 mA under the same conditions. Two types of bubble dynamics are observed when high-speed imaging is employed to study the eSBSL event behaviour. Most of the bubbles oscillate repetitively in a non-linear fashion as expected. However, some bubbles fragmented into clusters of smaller bubbles before coalescing in a repetitive fashion. The eSBSL event is shown to be extremely sensitive to experimental parameters such as the acoustic pressure amplitude, solution temperature, solution composition, applied frequency and local environment. In particular trace noble gase (Ar) is shown to affect the eSBSL event characteristics. At Ar concentrations below 0. 3 ?mol dm- 3 (determined by a residual gas analyser) short-lived (10 - 40 s) and fading eSBSL events are observed. The emission spectra showed a red centred ‘black body like’ character in disagreement with the available literature. In addition some evidence for OH* emission is presented for these short lived events. It is proposed that these eSBSL events contain primarily gas they were seeded with. At higher Ar concentrations (0. 3 - 1. 5 ?mol dm- 3), long-lived SBSL events are observed. These tend to produce two kinds of emission spectra. One is a blue centred spectrum and second is a double-peaked red-blue spectrum. It is postulated that these eSBSL bubbles initially contain the gas they were seeded with but are gradually converted to an Ar rich noble gas SBSL event from the solution. At higher solution gas concentrations no stable SBSL could be observed. Emission lifetime is measured using time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). The FWHM values for hydrogen/oxygen seeded eSBSL events are in the range of 290 - 315 ps under the conditions employed...|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{reports of}} resistance of Leishmania to antimonials (Thakur et al., 2004) and other traditional antileishmanial drugs, {{the need for}} the discovery of new antileishmanial agents is rising. In an attempt to find new antileishmanial agents, two new benzodiazepine (BNZ) analogues (7 -chloro- 4 -(cyclohexylmethyl) - 1 -methyl- 3, 4 -dihydro- 1 H- 1, 4 -benodiazepine- 2, 5 -dione (BNZ- 1) and 4 -(cyclohexylmethyl) - 1 -methyl- 3, 4 -dihydro- 1 H- 1, 4 -benzodiazepine- 2, 5 -dione (BNZ- 2)) were synthesised, and found to be effective against leishmaniasis in mice. This study investigates the metabolism of these two drugs together with the prototype BNZ, flurazepam (FZP), using rat hepatocytes, and investigates their interaction with glutathione in macrophages. Hepatocytes (> 80 % viability by Trypan Blue exclusion isolated by liver perfusion with collagenase) were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 - 250 g). Drugs (100 μM) were incubated with 2 × 106 viable cells/ml in Krebs-Hepes buffer, pH 7. 4, in rotating <b>round</b> <b>bottomed</b> <b>flasks</b> under an atmosphere of 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2, at 37 °C for 3 h, and timed samples taken for metabolite measurement. Samples were extracted twice with ethyl acetate at pH 10, the combined organic phases evaporated to dryness and stored at − 20 °C until analysis. Metabolites were separated by HPLC using an ACE C 18 column (50 mm × 3. 0 mm i. d., 5 μm packing), and a solvent gradient consisting of 0. 1 % formic acid: acetonitrile (starting composition 95 : 5 %, and composition after 25 min 65 : 35 % for FZP and 70 : 30 % for both BNZ 1 and 2). Flow rate was 0. 5 ml/min, and detection was at 230 nm. Identification of the metabolites was by mass spectrometry with both positive and negative ion electronspray ionization. The effects of 24 h exposure to the compounds (100 μM) was investigated in the macrophage cell line J 774. 1 in terms of reduced glutathione content (GSH) and the activity of glutathione reductase (GR). There was no evidence of significant cytotoxicity with any of the compounds at the concentration used. FZP (m/z 388) was metabolised by dealkylation of the two N- 1 ethyl substituents (m/z 360 and m/z 332), followed by hydroxylation on the BNZ ring. There was no evidence for either N- or O-glucuronidation of the resulting metabolites. BNZ- 1 (m/z 321) was metabolised by N-demethylation (m/z 307) followed by hydroxylation (m/z 323), mono- and di-hydroxylation of the parent (m/z 337 and m/z 353) and by glucuronidation of the mono-hydroxylated metabolite (m/z 513). BNZ- 2 (m/z 287) was transformed by N-demethylation (m/z 273) and hydroxylation of the parent (m/z 303), with the latter further metabolised by O-glucuronidation (m/z 479). In addition, the hydroxylated N-demethylated product (m/z 289) was also formed. Macrophages did not produce detectable metabolism of any of the drugs. All the drugs depleted macrophage GSH significantly (p < 0. 05 by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test) with BNZ- 1 and BNZ- 2 causing greater depletion than FZP (40. 6 ± 4. 0 and 45. 8 ± 8. 4, respectively, compared with 55. 5 ± 4. 9 nmol/mg protein with FZP, n = 3). Control macrophage GSH was 74. 1 ± 6. 6 nmol/mg protein. The depletion in GSH was not due to inhibition of GR: only FZP caused a significant decrease in macrophage GR activity (28. 0 ± 5. 9 compared with 42. 1 ± 8. 0 nmol/ml/min in control cells, p < 0. 05 by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test, n = 3). The marked depletion of macrophage GSH indicates a potential toxic interaction in mammalian cells. The new BNZ analogues were rapidly metabolised by hepatocytes, producing N-dealkylated and multiple hydroxylated phase I metabolites, followed by glucuronidation. This rapid metabolism may limit the therapeutic effect of BNZ 1 and 2 if their metabolites are inactive against leishmaniasis and suggest the need to optimise these lead structures further to obtain compounds with reduced rates and extent of metabolism...|$|R

Then it was diluted with water, separated product was washed with plenty of tap water and air-dried to afford CTA (8.5  g, 0.03  mol) in 95.5  % yield. 1 H-NMR of CTA (CD 3) 2 SO) δ (ppm): 1.92 (Me- 1), 2.01 (Me- 2), 2.10 (Me- 6), 3.65 (H 6), 3.81 (H 4), 3.95 (H 6 b), 4.35 (H 6 a), 4.52 (H 1), 4.75 (H 2), 5.15 (H 3).|$|E
30|$|Co–Mn {{catalysts}} (25  %Co/ 75  %Mn/ 30  wt.% TiO 2) {{tested in}} this study were prepared using co-precipitated procedure which is described elsewhere [2]. Aqueous solutions of Co(NO 3) 3 · 6 H 2 O (0.5  M) (99  %, Merck) and Mn(NO 3) 2 · 4 H 2 O (0.5  M) (99  %, Merck) with different molar ratios were pre-mixed and the resulting solutions were heated to 70  °C in a <b>round</b> <b>bottomed</b> <b>flask</b> fitted with a condenser. Aqueous Na 2 CO 3 (0.5  M) (99.8  %, Merck) was added to the mixed nitrate solution in a dropwise manner with stirring while the temperature was maintained at 70  °C until pH 8  ±  0.1 was achieved. The resulting precipitate was then left in this medium for times ranging 0 – 240  min. The aged precipitate was then filtered and washed several times with warm distilled water. The precipitate was then dried in the an oven (120  °C, 16  h) to give a material denoted as the catalyst precursor, which was subsequently calcined in static air in a furnace (500  °C, 16  h) to give the final catalyst. Then, to prepare TiO 2 supported catalyst, the amount of 30  wt.% of TiO 2 based on the total catalyst weight was added to the mixed solution of cobalt and manganese nitrates with the molar ratio of 25  %Co/ 75  % Mn and then filtered, washed, dried at 120  °C, and calcined at 500  °C for 16  h, {{in the same way as}} for the unsupported catalyst preparation. The catalyst sample was also characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area methods, as demonstrated in our previous work [2].|$|E
30|$|The blend {{solutions}} {{based on}} PPSU, PPSU/ 0.5  wt% MWCNT, PPSU/ 0.5 wt% FMWCNT (total polymer concentration =  17.5  wt%) were prepared by dissolving with different compositions in a solvent, NMP (80  wt%) under constant mechanical stirring {{at a moderate}} speed of rotation in a <b>round</b> <b>bottomed</b> <b>flask</b> for 4  h at 40  ºC (before adding PPSU CNT and NMP were sonicated for 4  h to attain uniform dispersion of CNT in NMP). Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) was carboxylated by chemical method as reported elsewhere. The homogeneous solution that was obtained was allowed to {{stand at room temperature}} for at least 1  day in an airtight condition to get rid of air bubbles. The method of preparation involved is {{the same as that of}} the “phase inversion” method employed in earlier works as reported by other researchers (Rahimpour and Madaeni 2007). The casting environment (relative humidity and temperature) was standardized for the preparation of membranes with better physical properties such as the homogeneity, thickness, and smoothness. The membrane-casting chamber was maintained at a temperature of 24  ±  1  °C and a relative humidity of 50  ±  2  %. The casting and gelation conditions were maintained constant throughout, because the thermodynamic conditions would largely affect the morphology and performance of the resulting membranes (Barth et al. 2000). The membranes were casted over a glass plate using a doctor blade. After casting, the solvent present in the cast film was allowed to evaporate for 30  s, and the cast film along with the glass plate was gently immersed in the gelation bath. After 2  h of gelation, the membranes were removed from the gelation bath and washed thoroughly with distilled water to remove all NMP from the membranes. The membrane sheets were subsequently stored in distilled water, containing 0.1  % formalin solution to prevent microbial growth. Perkin Elmer attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR) FTIR was employed for membrane surface characterization.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} given {{its name to}} some of the {{earliest}} Neolithic pottery in southern Britain after a large collection of pieces of this type of pottery were found during the excavations by Dorothy Liddell.Hembury ware pottery was generally characterised by <b>round</b> <b>bottomed</b> bowls with lug handles. Much of it was made further west, around The Lizard using Gabbroic clay and it was traded throughout the British Isles. It was made {{at the end of the}} fifth century BC and early 4th century BC. Several pieces of Hembury ware Gabbro pottery are on display in the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter, Devon.|$|R
50|$|Around 1,200 BC an {{improved}} and probably taller wall {{was placed in}} front of the existing wall, made of larger stones fitted together in a better way. Subsequently, additional improvements were made to the front wall with five different walls in total being identified. Repairs and a third facing wall were built around 500 BC. New works around 200 BC saw a massive glacis style turf rampart built, reinforced at the front with some stones. A <b>round</b> <b>bottomed</b> ditch 1m deep and 2m wide behind the rampart on the wall was dug in the bronze age. Pottery, including decorated pottery, fragments have been found.|$|R

The vessel was completely reconditioned and re-engined by Woods Hole at a cost $18,000. The vessel spent some 98 days at sea in 1940 and was described as [...] "able and economical" [...] by Columbus Iselin, supervisor of the design and construction of RV Atlantis and, in 1940, director of the institution. Biologist Gordon Riley {{on the other hand}} described the vessel [...] "as funny a little ship as I have ever seen" [...] and, though very strongly built, having [...] "all the sea-keeping qualities of an old fashioned, <b>round</b> <b>bottomed</b> bathtub." ...|$|R
