5|$|It {{has been}} noted that N. rajah {{produces}} a very extensive <b>root</b> <b>system</b> (for a Nepenthes) and, for this reason, {{it is recommended that}} a wide pot be used to allow for proper development of the <b>root</b> <b>system.</b> This also eliminates the need for frequent re-potting, which can lead to transplant shock and the eventual death of the plant.|$|E
5|$|The <b>root</b> <b>system</b> and {{the shoot}} system are interdependent – the usually non{{photosynthetic}} <b>root</b> <b>system</b> {{depends on the}} shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the <b>root</b> <b>system.</b> Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots. Stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots. Roots that spread out close to the surface, {{such as those of}} willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, {{as is the case with}} Saintpaulia, or even a single cell – which can dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.|$|E

5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its <b>root</b> <b>system.</b> Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low <b>root</b> <b>system</b> can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that some trees are interconnected through their <b>root</b> <b>system,</b> forming a colony.

5|$|The tree {{has survived}} {{for so long}} due to {{vegetative}} cloning. The visible tree is relatively young, but {{it is part of}} an older <b>root</b> <b>system</b> that dates back thousands of years. The trunk of the tree may die and regrow multiple times, but the tree's <b>root</b> <b>system</b> remains intact and in turn sprouts another trunk. The trunk may only live for about 600 years, and when one trunk dies another eventually grows back in its place. Also, each winter, heavy snow may push the tree's low-lying branches to ground level, where they take root and survive to grow again the next year in a process known as layering. Layering occurs when a tree's branch comes in contact with the earth, and new roots sprout from the contact point. Other trees, such as coast redwoods and western redcedars are known to reproduce by layering. The tree's age was determined by carbon-14 dating of the <b>root</b> <b>system,</b> which found roots dating back to 375, 5,660, 9,000, and 9,550 years. Carbon dating is not accurate enough to pin down the exact year the tree sprouted from seed; but, given the estimated age, the tree is supposed to have sprouted around 7550 BC. For comparison, the invention of writing (and thus, the beginning of recorded history) did not occur until around 4000 BC. Researchers have found a cluster of around 20 spruce trees in the same area, all over 8,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its <b>root</b> <b>system.</b> It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E
5|$|The age of {{the tree}} was {{determined}} by carbon dating of genetically matched plant material collected from under the tree, as dendrochronology would cause damage. The trunk itself {{is estimated to be}} only a few hundred years old, but the plant has survived for much longer due to a process known as layering (when a branch comes in contact with the ground, it sprouts a new root), or vegetative cloning (when the trunk dies but the <b>root</b> <b>system</b> is still alive, it may sprout a new trunk).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} {{general theory of}} {{reflection}} systems and, more specifically, partial root sys-tems which provide a unifying framework for finite <b>root</b> <b>systems,</b> Kac-Moody <b>root</b> <b>systems,</b> extended affine <b>root</b> <b>systems</b> and various generalizations thereof. Nilpotent and prenilpotent subsets are studied in this setting, based on commutator sets and the descending central series.

5|$|The {{structure}} of the <b>root</b> <b>system,</b> comprising a vertical tap root and multiple horizontal laterals, develops in the seedling's first year. Thereafter, the sinker and laterals continue to lengthen, and new laterals appear. There are only three to five laterals at first, but this number typically increases to eight to ten within ten years. During the first winter, {{there is a great}} deal of <b>root</b> <b>system</b> development, especially elongation of the sinker root, but almost no shoot growth. By summer, the sinker root has generally almost reached the water table, and shoot growth increases substantially. Around February, the shoot forms a resting bud, and growth then ceases until October. On resumption of shoot growth, the shoots grow rapidly for a short time, while the plant is under little water stress; then, with the onset of water stress, the plants settles into a long period of slower shoot growth. This pattern of summer-only shoot growth is maintained throughout the life of the plant, except that in mature plants, seasonal shoot growth may cease with the formation of a terminal inflorescence rather than a resting bud. Inflorescence development continues after shoot growth ceases, and flowering commences in February or March. March and April are the peak months for flowering, which ends in July or August.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study the Weyl groups of reduced {{extended}} affine <b>root</b> <b>systems,</b> the <b>root</b> <b>systems</b> of extended affine Lie algebras. We start by describing the extended affine Weyl {{group as a}} semidirect product of a finite Weyl group and a Heisenberg-like normal subgroup. This provides a unique expression for the Weyl group elements (in terms of some naturally arisen transformations) which is crucial in the further study of extended affine Weyl groups. We use this to give a presentation, called a presentation by conjugation, for an important subclass of extended affine Weyl groups. Using a new notion, called the index which is an invariant of the extended affine <b>root</b> <b>systems,</b> we show {{that one of the}} important features of finite and affine <b>root</b> <b>systems</b> (related to Weyl group) holds for the class of extended affine <b>root</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

For non-symplectic root systems, the unstable second K-group with respect to the <b>root</b> <b>system</b> is exactly the stable K-group for GL(A). Unstable second K-groups (in this context) are defined by taking the kernel of the universal central extension of the Chevalley group of universal type for a given <b>root</b> <b>system.</b> This construction yields the kernel of the Steinberg extension for the root systems A'n (n>1) and, in the limit, stable second K-groups.|$|E
