5000|$|Proposed Treasury <b>Regulations</b> <b>are</b> {{drafted by}} the Internal Revenue Service and {{published}} in the Federal Register.

Temporary and final <b>regulations</b> <b>are</b> initially published as Treasury Decisions (“TD”). TD's include an explanatory preamble, {{which can be a}} helpful source for legal research. In addition, the IRS publishes TDs in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.|$|R

In the rush following the collision, the stewards, occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups of women and children to the boat deck, did not have time to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E

5|$|The Rush vs. Trickett match {{attracted}} {{the largest number}} of spectators ever before gathered at a Sydney sporting event, and the event is part of Australian sporting history. Estimates {{of the size of the}} crowd range from 30,000 to 70,000. Shops and government offices closed for the event, special trains brought people into the city. Steam-ships carrying spectators accompanied the competing champions, and hundreds of smaller, private vessels crowded the river. Special <b>Regulations</b> <b>were</b> published by the Marine Board of the NSW Government to deal with the problems of regulating maritime traffic during the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} led {{to major}} changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that radio equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock. An International Ice Patrol {{was set up to}} monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety <b>regulations</b> <b>were</b> harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS); both measures are still in force today.|$|E
5|$|After being remanded to {{determine}} if the <b>regulations</b> <b>were</b> not discriminatory, the case returned to the United States Supreme Court in Department of Game of Washington v. Puyallup Tribe (Puyallyp II). Again, Justice Douglas wrote the opinion for the Court, but this time he struck down the state restrictions as discriminatory. Douglas noted that the restrictions for catching steelhead trout with nets had remained, and was a method used only by the Indians, whereas hook and line fishing was allowed but was used only by non-Indians. As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.|$|E

40|$|Regulation, even inefficient <b>regulation,</b> can <b>be</b> {{incredibly}} persistent. We {{propose a}} new explanation for regulatory persistence based on “regulatory fog”, where regulation obscures {{information about the}} effects of deregulation. This paper presents a dynamic model of regulation, in which the environment is stochastic such that the imposition of <b>regulation</b> can either <b>be</b> efficient or inefficient, and in which the regulator’s ability to observe the underlying need for <b>regulation</b> <b>is</b> reduced when <b>regulation</b> <b>is</b> imposed. As compared to a full-information benchmark, <b>regulation</b> <b>is</b> highly persistent, even if there is a high probability of transition to a state in which <b>regulation</b> <b>is</b> inefficient. This regulatory persistence decreases welfare and dramatically increases the proportion of time the economy spends under regulation. The ability to perform deregulatory experiments can improve outcomes, but only if they are sufficiently inexpensive and effective, and regulation will still remain more persistent than in the full-information benchmark.

5|$|An International Express Mail Agreement and <b>regulations</b> <b>were</b> signed {{between the}} United States and Solomon Islands governments in Honiara and Washington, D.C. on 19 April and 27 June 1991, {{coming into effect}} on 1 August 1991. On 6 November 1998, a peace {{agreement}} was signed in Honiara between the United States and Solomon Islands governments. However, since the late 1990s, Honiara has been the centre of ethnic violence and political unrest in the country. The area around Honiara was the battle ground of rival factions during the unrest {{as a result of}} the dominance of Malaitans, who were outsiders, and the local Guadalcanal islanders.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Saladin's reign as sultan in Egypt, upon the encouragement of his adviser, Qadi al-Fadil, Christians were prohibited from employment in the fiscal administration, but various Ayyubid emirs continued to allow Christians to serve in their posts. A number of other <b>regulations</b> <b>were</b> imposed, including the bans on alcohol consumption, religious processions, and the ringing of church bells. Conversion of formerly high-ranking Christians and their families to Islam took place throughout the early period of Ayyubid rule. According to historian Yaakov Lev, the persecution of non-Muslims had some permanent effects on them, but nonetheless, the effects were local and contained. To manage Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids permitted Europeans—mainly Italians, but also French and Catalans—to settle in Alexandria in large numbers. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the Fifth Crusade, 3,000 merchants from the area were arrested or expelled.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 2003, {{there were}} {{numerous}} proposals to change the HOS again, but none were ever finalized. By this time, the ICC had been abolished, and <b>regulations</b> <b>were</b> now issued by the FMCSA. The 2003 changes applied only to property-carrying drivers (i.e., truck drivers). These rules allowed 11hours of driving within a 14-hour period, and required 10hours of rest. These changes would allow drivers (using the entire 14-hour on-duty period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a bare minimum 21-hour cycle (11hours driving, 10hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow drivers to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} year the RNLI raised £10,000, however by 1849, income had dropped to £354. Finding itself in {{financial}} difficulties, the RNLI accepted a government subsidy of £2,000, which rose in subsequent years. This lasted until 1869, when the RNLI ceased accepting subsidies – it had found that voluntary donations had fallen by more than the subsidies; in addition, the government's imposition of bureaucracy and <b>regulations</b> <b>were</b> detrimental to the service. It was the loss of 27 lifeboat crew of Southport and St Annes in 1886 that gave new impetus to fundraising and an 1889 appeal raised £10,000. The first Lifeboat Saturday was held in that year.|$|E
5|$|Liquor {{was another}} {{profitable}} private industry nationalized {{by the central}} government in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately. By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain {{at a lower price}} than demanded by merchants. Apart from Emperor Ming's creation of a short-lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization, which was abolished in 68 AD, central-government price control <b>regulations</b> <b>were</b> largely absent during the Eastern Han.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of quarantine was increased to forty days in May 1664 as the continental plague worsened, and the areas subject to quarantine {{changed with the}} news of the spread of plague to include all of Holland, Zeeland and Friesland (all regions of the Dutch Republic), although restrictions on Hamburg were removed in November. Quarantine measures against ships coming from the Dutch Republic were put in place in 29 other ports from May, commencing with Great Yarmouth. The Dutch ambassador objected at the constraint of trade with his country, but England responded that it {{had been one of the}} last countries introducing such restrictions. <b>Regulations</b> <b>were</b> enforced quite strictly, so that people or houses where voyagers had come ashore without serving their quarantine were also subjected to 40 days quarantine.|$|E
