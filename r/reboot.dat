5000|$|Even {{when his}} body is {{seemingly}} destroyed or completely detached from his head, it {{has no effect on}} Bender's ability to think and communicate, indicating that his main processing facilities are located in his head.

40|$|As {{commodity}} {{operating systems}} become more reliable and fault-tolerant, {{the availability of}} a system will be determined not by when it crashes, but instead by when it must be shutdown and <b>rebooted</b> due to software maintenance [12, 21]. While many system components can be upgraded on-line, critical low-level components, such as device drivers and other kernel extensions, cannot be updated without <b>rebooting</b> the entire operating system. In this paper, we present Live Update, a mechanism that allows device drivers to be updated without <b>rebooting</b> the system. Unlike other on-line update mechanisms, our system supports existing drivers “as is”. Thus, thousands of existing device drivers can be updated transparently. In experiments we show that Live Update can upgrade existing drivers without <b>rebooting</b> and that the system imposes very little performance overhead...|$|R
