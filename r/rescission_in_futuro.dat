40|$|When {{the parties}} to a {{contract}} base their consensus on a commonly held belief which is fundamental to their motivation in contracting, we say that they contract {{on the basis of}} a supposition. Should the supposition prove false, the contract will be void. While South African courts have accepted this proposition where the supposition relates to a past or present fact, the status of a supposition relating to the future has had a far more controversial history. The CPD accepted the validity of the supposition <b>in</b> <b>futuro</b> <b>in</b> Williams v Evans, but this decision was overruled by the SCA in recent history. This article addresses the concept of a supposition relating to a future fact, in the light of the original finding in the Williams case and the relevant case law since. The currently prevailing view is that a supposition <b>in</b> <b>futuro</b> is indistinguishable from a resolutive condition, and this article aims to reconcile this position with the finding in Williams through the medium of equating the supposition <b>in</b> <b>futuro</b> with a tacit resolutive condition. If a supposition is merely a type of tacit term, then, asks the author, why is there so much controversy about the Williams case...|$|R

Our contribution is threefold. First, we use a unique data set to study the interesting and relatively new phenomenon of rescission from a corporate governance viewpoint: Rescission was not an issue until 2000 when the stock market plummeted. To our best knowledge, there is no analytical or empirical study on <b>rescission</b> <b>in</b> the literature.

His tenure was marked by debates regarding {{the separation of church and}} state. Castillo, who had taken his oath as a legislator without mentioning God in two previous occasions, imposed mandatory religious education of a Roman Catholic nature in Catamarca schools; protest from the province's sizable Jewish community and others led to the policy's <b>rescission</b> <b>in</b> 2001, however. Catamarca voters returned him to the Senate upon completion of his term as governor. His reelection campaign, however, was followed by a challenge of the results amid accusations of vote buying and collusion with Governor Eduardo Brizuela del Moral to that effect; his personal estate, which includes at least a dozen properties in the province, has also come under scrutiny.|$|R
5000|$|A {{report in}} the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2011 {{described}} the movement for a convention as gaining [...] "traction" [...] in public debate, and wrote that [...] "concern over a seemingly dysfunctional climate in Washington and issues ranging from the national debt to the overwhelming influence of money in politics have spawned calls for {{fundamental change in the}} document that guides the nation's government." [...] For several years, state lawmakers approved no Article V Convention calls at all, and {{even went so far as}} to adopt resolutions rescinding their prior such calls. However, in 2011, legislators in Alabama, Louisiana, and North Dakota (in two instances) approved resolutions applying for an Article V Convention. All three of these states had adopted <b>rescissions</b> <b>in</b> 1988, 1990, and 2001, respectively, but then reversed course in 2011.

40|$|Efforts to {{maintain}} balanced budgets lead to substantial pro-cyclicality in states' capital investments, transfers to local governments, and spending {{in areas like}} education and transportation. Reliance on volatile revenue sources predicts relatively severe volatility in these expenditures. States with strict balanced budget requirements must restore fiscal balance faster than those without, leading to <b>rescissions</b> during years <b>in</b> which they face unexpected shocks. I find that these <b>rescissions</b> occur disproportionately <b>in</b> areas with readily deferred projects. Evidence points to the relative strength of public sector union groups as a driver of variation {{in the composition of}} mid-year rescissions across states. ...|$|R

40|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) in 1968, {{consumers}} were vulnerable to many deceptive practices employed by creditors when participating in loan transactions. Following the passage of TILA, it was the hope of Congress that consumers would now have the tools necessary to fend off predatory or deceptive credit terms buried within the fine print of a loan agreement. One of the options afforded to consumers facing a suspect loan agreement is the right to rescission. When lenders, creditors, and other parties in the credit transaction “fail to provide the consumer with proper disclosures about the loan or their rights,” consumers may seek rescission as a possible remedy under TILA. Often, a consumer attempts to exercise their <b>rescission</b> rights <b>in</b> the face of an impending foreclosure due to a default on their loan. Moreover, a natural consequence of the impending foreclosure will often be the filing of Chapter 13 bankruptcy by the consumer. It is in the Chapter 13 setting that loan rescission produces diverging views among the various courts. Surprisingly, the “First Circuit has not spoken” on this issue. This Comment will first focus briefly on the historical framework of rescission and how rescission under TILA is markedly different from common law rescission. Next, this Comment will examine the splits among the circuits and explore the competing rationales to determine which circuits may serve as guideposts for the First Circuit. This Comment will then focus on the potential approaches to <b>rescission</b> <b>in</b> the bankruptcy setting. Finally, this Comment will consider several recent cases that may be illustrative of the direction in which the First Circuit is heading. In re Jaaskelainen, a case argued in the Eastern Division of Massachusetts, is particularly indicative of the trend that the First Circuit might be following and illustrates the divergent judicial interpretations throughout the circuits...|$|R

40|$|Erreur in French law and {{mistake in}} English law have {{different}} aims. Erreur is interpreted broadly {{in order to}} ensure the parties’ consent. Conversely, mistake is narrowly defined, so as to ensure that contracts are valid. The Court of Appeal case of Great Peace (2002) has confirmed this difference in putting an end to the concept of mistake in Equity. This opposition is obvious when illustrated by mistake as to the authenticity of works of art. If a party buys a painting mistakenly believing that it is genuine, he can rescind the contract in French law, since an erreur vitiates consent. Mistake as to the authenticity of a work of art is not a ground for <b>rescission</b> <b>in</b> English law. The subjectivity of consent is not taken into account. It is however possible to attain a similar result by other means, such as misrepresentation or breach of contract. This example illustrates that any European harmonisation cannot be attained simply by harmonising concepts. It should be done by the definition of common contractual terms, as envisaged by the European Commission in its recent Action Plan on European contract law. Such a harmonisation would encourage a unified European art market...|$|R
