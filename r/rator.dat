Soon afterwards, he witnesses a slave named <b>Rator</b> being condemned for execution in a gladiatorial fight for the king's amusement. Instantly recognizing his opportunity, Crios begins to criticize the king loudly, starting a merry chase through the city streets before he allows himself to be captured. In the palace dungeon, which is located right beneath Cadmos' throne, he comes face-to-face with Antiope as she is being ordinated as a priestess, and instantly becomes smitten with her. When {{he and his fellow}} prisoners, including <b>Rator,</b> are made to fight to the death before Cadmos and Ermione, Crios bribes a guard into procuring some oil to rub onto his skin, making him ungrappable for <b>Rator,</b> who has defeated all the others before taking on Crios. As a result, Crios wins and becomes Cadmos' servant, but his uncautios demonstration of his wits and clandestine visits to Antiope eventually alert Ermione to his true intentions.|$|E

Crios, who accompanies him, manages to separate Cadmos {{from the rest of}} the hunting party and take him to the cliffs at the edge of the sea, where they catch up with <b>Rator.</b> However, as Crios prepares to take Cadmos with him, Ermione and the rest of the hunters interfere, and unable to kill Cadmos, Crios and <b>Rator</b> team up and jump off the cliffs into the sea. While hiding in a nearby ruined temple of Pluto, Crios uses the temple's secret connection to make a trip back to Tartarus and steal the helmet of Pluto, an artifact which renders its wearer completely invisible at night. But as he uses the helmet's power to try and rescue Antiope, he finds her spirited away by Cadmos and Ermione. Taking Aquiles with him, Crios learns that Antiope has been imprisoned on the Isle of the Gorgon. He proceeds there with the help of his friends, kills the gorgon in a surprise attack and reunites with Antiope, but upon the gorgon's demise a violent thunderstorm breaks out, alerting Cadmos. Immediately after the storm has settled, the tyrant sends out his troops to the isle to investigate.|$|E

When things look at their bleakest for Crios, however, Zeus decides to release {{the rest of the}} Titans to Earth in order to have the task completed. With the most welcome assistance of his brothers, and some of Zeus' thunderbolts purchased from his cyclopedian weaponsmiths, Crios infiltrates the city, attacks its garrison of soldiers, and eventually stirs its oppressed people into rebellion against their tyrant ruler. With the liberated <b>Rator</b> in tow, they begin to penetrate the palace's inner sanctum. When Ermione mocks Cadmos for his failure as a [...] "god", Cadmos kills her and sets out to take revenge on Crios.|$|E

The objectives of the research work at IPA Stuttgart are to improve the man-machine-interface to robot simulation systems and to robot control systems. Therefore a suitable testbed was developed to evaluate simulation concepts for industrial robots such as off-line programming, off-line teaching and robot teleoperation. In this test surrounding, the operator wearing a headmounted stereo display is able {{to act in a}} virtual world. The movements of head and hand are tracked by sensors and included in the simulation in realtime. By means of gestures with the dataglove and control commands given by a 6 D-sensorball, the operator can move within the virtual world without having to leave his real location. Using the dataglove the operators hand movements can directly be converted into robot path data for a virtual robot. Moreover an interface towards the real robot enables the ope <b>rator's</b> movements to be directly transferred to the industrial robot (PUMA 560 with VAL II) via dataglove. In this way any path in all 6 degrees of freedom can be generated in realtime. Conventional teachpanels and time consuming path programming of the robot are unnecessary. Different to conventional graphical simulations, high requirements to the rendering system performance have to be fullfilled. This adresses especially the frame rate of such a simulation system, e. g. 15 pictures per second have to be achieved to perform a dynamic impression of the virtual world. For that reason, IPA Stuttgart developed a new rendering system, providing the required performance. An advanced data structure allows a selection of the data to be displayed on the stereo display by means of a particular simplification of the geometric objects. In order to reduce the complexity of the CAD model, parts of it will be represented in reduced complexity with bounding boxes. An algorithm controls the renderin...|$|R

In this method, the flux sensors are not essential to determine the electromagnetic torque. The rotor flux can be directly estimated by using an observer.

40|$|Improvements {{in health}} {{technology}} raise hopes for better patient outcomes {{and a more}} efficient delivery of health care. However, the processes of diffusion and implementation of new health technology {{have been shown to}} be complicated and to pose a number of challenges for the healthcare sector. Many at tempts have been made to influence and manage the introduction and diffusion of health technology. One prominent example is the Swedish nat ional guidelines that aim at influencing both clinical and political decision - making in the health sector. The overall aim of this thesis is to describe and analyze the factors influencing the diffusion and economic consequences of the introduction of a new technology with large variations in use, and to explore the process of implementation of nationally produced guidelines as an instrument for improv ing effectiveness and equity. The empirical focus is kept on the biological drugs (bDMARDs) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), since they implied a substantial treatment change when they were first int roduced and they are relatively costly; and on the national guidelines for cardiac care, since they were the first nat ional guidelines, hence allowing a long-term perspect ive in the exploration of their implementat ion. Paper I presents a register study that uses data from national and regional registries on healt hcare use and work disability of patients with RA and shows that there was a 32 percent increase in the total fixed cost of RA during 1990 - 2010, mainly after the introduct ion of bDMARDs. Paper II shows that choosing to initiate treatment with bDMARDs varied substantially among 26 rheumatologists presented with hypothetical patient cases, and that there were also disparities between rheumatologists practicing in the same clinic. Paper III presents data from the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register covering 4010 patients with RA, and shows that when using multivariate logistic regression to adjust for patient characterist ics, disease activity and t he physician’s local context, physician preference was an import ant predict or for prescription of bDMARDs. Paper IV is a qualitative study about prescribing decisions, showing that a constellat ion of various factors and their interact ion influenced the prescribing decisions according to the 26 interviewed rheumatologists. The factors included the individual rheumatologist ’s experiences and perceptions of t he evidence, the structure of the department including responsibility for costs, peer pressure, political and administrative influences, and participat ion in clinical trials. The patient as an actor emerged as an important factor. Paper V is a longitudinal qualitat ive study exploring the responses among four Swedish county councils to the national guidelines for cardiac care through 155 interviews with politicians, administ <b>rators</b> and clinical managers. The results show that unilateral responses to the national guidelines within the county councils have been rare, but there have been at tempts to compromise and to at tain a balance between multiple constituents. There are examples of local information meetings, the use of the national guidelines in local healthcare programs, and performing audits with the national guidelines as a base. However, performing explicit prioritizat ion as advised in the NGCC is rarely found. Over t ime, however, a more systematic use of the national guidelines has been noted. In conclusion, the diffusion of new health technology is influenced by a wide array of factors both at individual and organizational levels, as well as their interact ion. The diffusion resulted in large economic consequences and unequal access due to variations also at clinical level. Moreover, given that healthcare decision-making is influenced by many different factors, the simple influx of evidence-based guidelines will unlikely result in automat ic implementat ion. At tempts to influence healthcare decisions need to have a systems perspect ive and to account for the interact ion of factors between different actors...|$|R
40|$|The {{symplectic}} Dirac and the symplectic twistor {{operators are}} sym- plectic analogues of classical Dirac and twistor operators appearing in spin- Riemannian geometry. Our work concerns basic aspects {{of these two}} ope- rators. Namely, we determine the solution space of the symplectic twistor operator on the symplectic vector space of dimension 2 n. It {{turns out that the}} solution space is a symplectic counterpart of the orthogonal situation. Moreover, we demonstrate on the example of 2 n-dimensional tori the effect of dependence of the solution spaces of the symplectic Dirac and the symplectic twistor operators on the choice of the metaplectic structure. We construct a symplectic generalization of classical theta functions for the symplectic Dirac operator as well. We study several basic aspects of the symplectic version of Clifford analysis associated to the symplectic Dirac operator. Focusing mostly on the symplectic vector space of the real dimension 2, this amounts to the study of first order symmetry operators of the symplectic Dirac ope- <b>rator,</b> symplectic Clifford-Fourier transform and the reproducing kernel for the symplectic Fischer product including the construction of bases for the symplectic monogenics of the symplectic Dirac operator in real dimension 2 and their extension to symplectic spaces [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Question: Human risk {{assessment}} of chemicals is currently {{based on the}} evaluation of in vivo animal studies. The use of high animal numbers and the suffering of animals in experiments such as repeated dose toxicity studies (RDT) demand for alternative test approaches. One alternative approach currently used in human {{risk assessment}} is read-across (RAX). In a RAX approach toxicity data of one or several tested source compound(s) are used to predict the toxicity of “similar” non-tested target compound(s). Similar compounds shall share structural- and physico-chemical proper-ties {{as well as a}} similar mode of action. This study was designed to evaluate the use of data from ex vivo experiments such as <b>rator</b> human precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). Three RAX-categories were tested, namely vicinal halogenides, naphthalene derivatives and vinyl esters. Each RAX category was selected based on shared structural properties and similar toxicological effects in RDT studies extracted from the FhG RepDose database (www. fraunhofer-repdose. de). Methods: Exposure of rat and human PCLS was performed on three days for three hours daily. The cytotoxicity of chemicals was assessed by LDH and WST- 1 assay. Ex vivo IC 50 values were calculated by sigmoidal curve fitting. These values were correlated to the LD 50 values. Results: At least one substance in each category showed cyto-toxic effects in dose dependent manner. Linear regression analysis of public available in vivo LD 50 values to the obtained ex vivo IC 50 values showed good linear correlation. Vicinal halogenides and naphthalene derivatives were less toxic in human lung sections compared to rat sections, where as the vinyl esters showed the comparable cytotoxicity in both species. Thus only one substance group showed similar cytotoxicity in both tested species, whereas two other groups reveal interspecies and metabolism diversity based on cytotoxicity endpoint. Conclusion: This first evaluation of rat and human and PCLs show that ex vivo chemical testing in human lung sections result in a promising approach for toxicity screening as no human in vivo reference data exist...|$|E
