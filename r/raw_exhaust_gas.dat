These test systems usually include complex emissions sampling equipment (such as constant volume samplers and <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> sample preparation systems) and analyzers. These analyzers {{are much more}} sensitive and much faster than a typical portable exhaust gas analyzer. Response times of well under one second are common, and are required by many transient test cycles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the {{framework}} of a combined effort ship emission studies were conducted in 2004. Detailed aerosol microphysics and chemistry was measured in the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> of a single-cylinder test bed engine. The emission studies were complemented by airborne aerosol transforma-tion studies in the marine boundary layer using the DLR aircraft Falcon 20 E- 5. In this experiment a single plume of a large container ship was extensively investigated. Observations from emission studies and plume studies combined with a Gaussian plume dispersion model yield a consistent pic-ture of particle transformation processes from emission from a ship engine to atmospheric process-ing in the marine boundary layer during plume expansion. The results are used for the determina-tion of emission indices of particulate matter from ships and for the estimation of life times of ship exhaust particles in the marine boundary layer. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This work {{concentrates}} on investigating the combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine running on butanol-diesel blends. The blending ratio of butanol to diesel was varied from 0 to 40 vol % using an increment of 10 vol%, and each blend was tested on a diesel engine {{equipped with an}} EGR system. The test was carried out fewer than two engine loads at a constant engine speed, using various combinations of EGR ratios and injection timings. Test results indicate that butanol addition to engine fuel is able to substantially decrease soot emission from <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas,</b> while the change in NOx emissions varies depending on the butanol content and engine operating conditions. Increasing EGR ratio and retarding injection timing are effective approaches to reduce NOx emissions from combustion of butanol-diesel blends. But the engine control strategies need to be optimized {{in order to achieve}} low levels of both soot and NOx emissions, as well as a reasonable fuel economy. I...|$|E

40|$|Recently, a {{particle}} number (PN) limit {{was introduced in}} the European light-duty vehicles legislation. The legislation requires measurement of PN, and particulate mass (PM), from the full dilution tunnel with constant volume sampling (CVS). Furthermore, PN measurements will be introduced in the next stage of the European Heavy-Duty regulation. Heavy-duty engine certification can be done either from the CVS or from a partial flow dilution system (PFDS). For research and development purposes, though, measurements are often conducted from the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust,</b> thereby avoiding the high installation costs of CVS and PFDS. Although for legislative measurements requirements exist regarding sampling and transport of the aerosol sample, such requirements do not necessarily apply for <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> measurements. Thus, measurement differences are often observed depending on where in the experimental set up sampling occurs. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize and discuss particle loss mechanisms. Simple equations are given for the most important mechanisms. Topics like isokinetic sampling and agglomeration are discussed for various typical cases. Special emphasis is placed on thermophoretic losses since thermophoresis is the most important particle removal mechanism for <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> sampling from modern engines. Sampling from high pressure <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> is also mentioned, and comparisons of the effect of tubing materials on particle removal are carried out.

40|$|An {{independent}} controller {{was proposed}} to perform real-time diagnosis and modeling based control for diesel aftertreatment devices, {{such as the}} diesel particulate filters (DPF) and the lean NOx traps (LNT). The diesel aftertreatment devices for this research were in active flow control configuration. As opposed to passive aftertreatment control where the engine tailors the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> conditions, in active aftertreatment configuration, the <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> conditions were modified with independent controls, such as aftertreatment temperature control, exhaust flow control, and aftertreatment excess air/fuel ratio (A) control. The determination of the diesel engine transient <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> temperature is essential for effective active flow aftertreatment control schemes. To overcome the slow response of the high-inertia thermocouples used in the harsh diesel exhaust environment, a temperature response model was developed {{as part of this}} research. The temperature response model was verified by tests conducted on a Yanmar NFD 170 single cylinder diesel engine setup. The model was then implemented into a National Instrument PCI- 6023 E multifunction data acquisition board with LabVIEW. The LabVIEW program was tested on the Yanmar engine setup and was capable of estimating the transient <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> temperature in real-time using the temperature data obtained from two high-inertia thermocouples with a proper diameter ratio. The simplified transient aftertreatment model representing the regeneration behavior of the DPF and the performance of the LNT were also proposed. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Exhaust gas {{emissions}} from ships are increasingly polluting the air environment seriously. Therefore, the MARPOL 73 / 78 Annex VI is applied for all ships from 2017, Annex VI {{provided that the}} concentrations of NOx,SOx CO contained in ship’s exhaust gases must be less than 6. 4 g/kWh, 0. 6 g/kWh, and 5. 5 g/kWh respectively.

40|$|Emissions from marine {{vessels are}} being {{scrutinized}} {{as a major}} contributor to the total particulate matter (TPM), oxides of sulfur (SOx) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) environmental loading. Fuel sulfur control is the key to SOx reduction. Significant reductions in the emissions from on-road vehicles have been achieved in the last decade and the emissions from these vehicles will be reduced by another order of magnitude in the next five years: these improvements have served to emphasize the need to reduce emissions from other mobile sources, including off road equipment, locomotives, and marine vessels. Diesel-powered vessels of interest include ocean going vessels with low- and medium-speed engines, as well as ferries with high speed engines, as discussed below. A recent study examined the use of intake water injection (WIS) and ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) to reduce the emissions from a high-speed passenger ferry in southern California. One of the four Detroit Diesel 12 V 92 two-stroke high speed engines that power the Waverider (operated by SCX, inc.) was instrumented to collect intake airflow, fuel flow, shaft torque, and shaft speed. Engine speed and shaft torque were uniquely linked for given vessel draft and prevailing wind and sea conditions. A <b>raw</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> sampling system was utilized to measure the concentration of NOx, carbon dioxide (CO 2), and oxygen (O 2) and a mini dilution tunnel sampling a slipstream from the raw exhaust was used to collect TPM on 70 mm filters. The emissions data were processed to yield brake-specific mass results. The system that was employed allowed for redundant data to be collected for quality assurance and quality control. To acquire the data, the Waverider was operated at five different steady state speeds. Three modes were in the open sea off Oceanside, CA, and idle and harbor modes were also used. Data have showed that the use of ULSD along with water injection (WIS) could significantly reduce the emissions of NOx and PM while not affecting fuel consumption or engine performance compared to the baseline marine diesel. The results showed that a nominal 40 % reduction in TPM was realized when switching from the marine diesel to the ULSD. A small reduction in NOx was also shown between the marine fuel and the ULSD. The implementation of the WIS showed that NOx was reduced significantly by between 11 % and 17 %, depending upon the operating condition. With the WIS, the TPM was reduced by a few percentage points, which was close to the confidence in measurement...|$|E
