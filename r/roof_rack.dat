25|$|A <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> is {{a common}} trait on many SUV and station wagon vehicles. While roof racks are very useful in {{carrying}} extra storage on a vehicle, they also increase the frontal area of the vehicle and increase the drag coefficient. This is because as the air flows {{over the top of}} the vehicle, following the smooth lines of the hood and windshield, then collides with the <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> and causes turbulence. The removal of this part has led to increases in fuel efficiency in several studies.|$|E
25|$|The Matador station wagons had an {{available}} rear-facing third-row {{bench seat}} increasing total seating {{from six to}} eight passengers. In addition, all wagons included a <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> and a two-way tailgate that opened when the rear window was down either from the top {{to serve as an}} extended flat surface that was even with the load floor, or to swing open like a regular door hinged on the left side.|$|E
25|$|A two-door {{station wagon}} {{was added to}} the line in 1959. With the larger Rambler Six wagons offered only as four-door models, AMC's {{management}} thought there would be little sales cannibalization from the American. The Deluxe wagon was priced at $2,060, while the $2,145 Super version included a standard cargo-area mat and <b>roof</b> <b>rack.</b> A Deliveryman commercial wagon, with no rear seat and an extended cargo floor, was available, but found few takers. Self-adjusting brakes were added in 1959.|$|E

25|$|Two {{sedan and}} wagon body styles were {{available}} in two trims {{for the duration of}} the Medallion's run. The base models came in DL trim, while the up-level LX models featured more standard features. Standard equipment on all Medallions included a tachometer, digital clock, AM/FM stereo, tinted glass, tilt steering wheel, power steering and brakes, as well as a driver's seat-height adjuster for the reclining front seats. The station wagon also included a locking storage bin, as well as adjustable <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> and a rear-window wiper.|$|E
25|$|The small tent, {{available}} in either red/white or blue/gray stripes, was less popular {{and thus is}} less often seen today. It consists of {{a single piece of}} heavy canvas, with a strip of vinyl along the bottom acting as a reinforcement and splash guard. It fits over the side-door opening (and has a gap for one leg of the <b>roof</b> <b>rack)</b> as a sort of foyer or vestibule. It's big enough for two adults to stand inside, but little else, and was probably intended as a means of getting {{in and out of the}} camper in cold or wet weather.|$|E
25|$|For the 2012 model year, the Journey becomes Dodge's {{smallest}} SUV after FCA stopped manufacturing {{smaller but}} more expensive counterpart, the Nitro. In 2014, the Journey Crossroad was introduced. The Crossroad has chrome accents along {{the lower part}} of the body and in the interior, a large bumper, smoked head- and taillights, a black grille, rocker panels, rails for a <b>roof</b> <b>rack,</b> and a skid plate simile at the rear. Chrysler added the revised Dodge logo with two slanted rectangles for the 2013 Model Year. For the 2016 model-year, the Journey's AVP and Limited trims are discontinued and the Crossroad Plus trim is added and also for the 2017 model-year, the R/T trim is replaced by the GT trim.|$|E

25|$|The FJ Crawler {{was first}} offered in 2007 (for the 2008 model year) {{and is the}} result of a {{collaboration}} between Dealer Services International (DSI), known for building high quality custom packages for new vehicle dealers, and ARB, who has a long history building rugged off-road products. For participating Toyota new vehicle dealerships, the FJ Crawler could be special ordered for customers who were looking for a vehicle that is even more rugged and off-road ready than a standard Off-Road Package factory option would provide. The FJ Crawler package included an ARB Front Bull Bar Bumper, an Old Man Emu 3-inch suspension lift to support the added weight of the ARB bumper and to allow for the 17-inch Pro Comp wheels with either 33 or 35-inch off-roading tires. The FJ Crawler was able to be customized in many ways with many optional accessories to achieve the customers satisfaction. For example, the FJ Crawler could be ordered in any factory color for the current model year. The customer could choose from 3 different wheel choices, 3 different tire choices, and could even choose the exact springs and shocks used in the Old Man Emu suspension to achieve the desired ride/performance quality. There was also the option of adding accessories such as a Warn winch, IFP driving lights which would be mounted to the ARB bumper, a fog light kit for the ARB bumper, and an ARB <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> for storing gear and other items. Other options included a cat-back exhaust system, a high flow intake, as well as side steps. Also, because of variances in aftermarket tire sizes, speedometer calibration was provided to ensure correct vehicle speed and mileage are recorded.|$|E
500|$|Optional {{accessories}} {{are available}} for the range, including an aluminium <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> capable of carrying [...] and kerbside lights in the door mirrors. Also available are: [...] and [...] alloy wheels {{with a choice of}} two patterns, chrome mouldings for the bumpers and doors, front fog lamps and cruise control, rear parking sensors, automatic lights (standard on some variants), and a speed limitation devicewhich are commonly used for safety reasons or to reduce fuel bills.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2012, {{the band}} {{released}} a single called [...] "Don't <b>Roof</b> <b>Rack</b> Me, Bro (Seamus Unleashed)", {{dedicated to the}} Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney's former pet dog Seamus. The title relates to the Mitt Romney dog incident, which occurred in 1983 when Romney traveled twelve hours with the dog in a crate on his car's <b>roof</b> <b>rack.</b> Casale has also mentioned plans to release a collection of demos from the sessions of Something for Everybody, with potential titles being Devo Opens the Vault, Gems from the Devo Dumpster, or Something Else for Everybody. The album was eventually titled Something Else For Everybody and was released on May 20, 2014.|$|E
50|$|A {{myriad of}} dealer-fitted {{accessories}} were available including sunroofs, <b>roof</b> <b>racks,</b> tow bars, driving lights, cargo barriers and side steps. The TD42 was available with an optional Safari turbocharger at some Australian dealers.|$|R

5000|$|Drivers {{can also}} {{increase}} fuel efficiency by minimizing transported mass, i.e. {{the number of}} people or the amount of cargo, tools, and equipment carried in the vehicle. Removing common unnecessary accessories such as <b>roof</b> <b>racks,</b> brush guards, wind deflectors (or [...] "spoilers", when designed for downforce and not enhanced flow separation), running boards, push bars, and narrow and lower profile tires will improve fuel efficiency by reducing both weight and aerodynamic drag. Some cars also use a half size spare tire, for weight/cost/space saving purposes. On a typical vehicle, every extra 100 pounds increases fuel consumption by 2%. [...] Removing <b>roof</b> <b>racks</b> (and accessories) can decrease fuel consumption by 20%.|$|R
2500|$|Possibly {{the best}} known special edition was the [...] "Tomb Raider" [...] of 2000, built to commemorate Land Rover's role in the first film of that franchise. The Tomb Raider was {{designed}} {{to look like an}} off-road expedition vehicle. Painted dark metallic grey with special badging and details, the Tomb Raider came equipped with a <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> and <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> support system (looking similar to a roll-cage), additional spot lights, winch, bull-bar and raised air-intake. They were available either as a 90 or a 110 double cab, with standard Td5 engines. The Defender actually used in the film (now on display at the Motor Heritage Centre, Gaydon) was a highly modified 110 HCPU with a specially fitted and tuned V8 petrol engine and a non-standard interior.|$|E
2500|$|Each version {{included}} the color-coordinated upholstery and door panels, individually adjustable reclining seats, sports steering wheel, {{as well as}} the [...] of carpeted cargo room, a locking hidden compartment, and a <b>roof</b> <b>rack.</b> Special regional nameplates were on the rear fender in addition to the unique medallions on the C-pillar.|$|E

All station wagons included a standard <b>roof</b> <b>rack.</b> A big feature was the [...] of space, compared for example to the much larger-sized Oldsmobile station wagons that offered only [...] of cargo room. Among the 17 different station wagons that were marketed by AMC for 1960, the Rambler Six Cross Country Super was the most popular.|$|E
2500|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, station wagons came {{in three}} different models: [...] "Fairlane", [...] "Fairlane 500", and [...] "Torino Squire."

2500|$|The boat's history {{began with}} a phone call between Canadians Bruce Kirby and Ian Bruce. While {{discussing}} {{the possibility of a}} car-topped dinghy (a boat small enough to be carried on a <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> of a typical car) for a line of camping equipment, Bruce Kirby sketched what would be known as [...] "the million dollar doodle". The plans stayed with Kirby until 1970 when One Design and Offshore Yachtsman magazine held a regatta for boats under $1000, called [...] "America's Teacup". After a few sail modifications, the Laser easily won its class.|$|E

The 4-door station wagons were designated Cross Country and featured an unusual roofline that followed {{the slope of the}} sedan's roof and then dipped down before leveling and continuing rearward. The design by Bill Reddig allowed the use of the same dies to produce door framing for sedans and station wagons, while the dip in the rear portion of the roof included a <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> as standard equipment to reduce the visual effect of the wagon's lowered roofline.|$|E
