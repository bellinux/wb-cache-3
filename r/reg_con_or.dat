METHODS: Twelve young males performed 10 weeks of concentric (<b>CON)</b> <b>or</b> eccentric (ECC) resistance training (RT) (n = 6 CON, 6 ECC). An additional 14 males were recruited to evaluate acute muscle fascicle behaviour and molecular signalling in biopsies collected from vastus lateralis (VL) after 30 min of single bouts of <b>CON</b> <b>or</b> ECC exercise. VL volume {{was measured by}} magnetic resonance imaging. Muscle architecture (fascicle length, Lf; pennation angle, PA) was evaluated by ultrasonography. Muscle remodelling signals to <b>CON</b> <b>or</b> ECC loading [MAPK/AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling] and inflammatory pathway (TNFαMurf- 1 -MAFbx) were evaluated by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Despite the 1. 2 -fold greater load of the ECC group, similar increases in muscle volume (+ 8...|$|R

Muscle remodelling signals to <b>CON</b> <b>or</b> ECC loading [MAPK/AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling] and inflammatory pathway (TNFαMurf- 1 -MAFbx) were evaluated by immunoblotting. Results Despite the ~ 1. 2 -fold greater load of the ECC group, similar increases in muscle volume (+ 8 % CON and + 6 % ECC) and in maximal voluntary isometric contraction (+ 9 % CON and + 11 % ECC) were found after RT. However, increases in Lf were greater after ECC than CON (+ 12 vs. + 5 %) while increases in PA were greater in CON than ECC (+ 30 vs. + 5 %). Distinct architectural adaptations were associated with preferential growth in the distal regions of VL for ECC (+ECC + 8 % vs. +CON + 2) and mid belly for CON (ECC + 7 vs. CON + 11 %). While MAPK activation (p 38 MAPK, ERK 1 / 2, p 90 RSK) was specific to ECC, neither mode affected AKT-mTOR or inflammatory signalling 30 min after exercise. Conclusion Muscle growth with CON and ECC RT occurs with different morphological adaptations reflecting distinct fibre fascicle behaviour and molecular responses...|$|R
