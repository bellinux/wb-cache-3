500|$|One of {{the sensations}} of the Games was black American track star Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals. According to some American press stories, Hitler left the stadium rather than {{shake hands with}} him. This was not the case; Hitler {{had been told by}} IOC {{president}} Baillet-Latour not to shake hands with the winners unless he was prepared to shake hands with all gold medalists, which he was not; this, however was not publicized. According to Butterfield, in later years retellings of what Brundage termed [...] "a fairy tale" [...] roused the American to [...] "acute fury". Hitler was, however, asked by his youth leader, Baldur von Schirach, to meet Owens, and he refused, [...] "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I'd allow myself to be photographed shaking hands with a Negro?" ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{qualified}} to swim for Australia, another obstacle arose with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western world, led by the United States. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Evans' relay teammate Tonelli believed that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete and publicise their cause among the Australian public. Evans was fully supportive of Tonelli's campaign, reflecting that [...] "We were political tools, and the only ones to suffer would be us." [...] He rhetorically asked: [...] "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if we didn't go someone would come up to us after the Games and pat us on the back for not going?" ...|$|E

Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything, either, and write from {{a place where they}} didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too.

500|$|The rebel {{qualities of}} the group were on show in the lead-up to the Olympics. An {{obstacle}} arose with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in a}} boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western world, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and he and sections of the public put significant political pressure on the athletes to join the boycott.

500|$|The {{original}} September 1994 {{floppy disk}} release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM {{was released in}} December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends' voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create [...] "audio vignettes". Doug Church later said, [...] "We tried {{to keep them from}} shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin would have none of it". System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, [...] "I wish I could go back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version. The additional audio added so much {{it might as well have}} been a different game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern. And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in people's minds by the floppy version (the silent movie version!). I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> cost us sales..." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{explained}} that {{in developing the}} relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of the season four finale, with which D. Williams of After Ellen noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." [...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout.

[...] (He said this, in character, in his 1926 short A Plantation Act.)

2500|$|A {{rough cut}} of the movie was {{screened}} for the Beatles on 20 July 1969. Lindsay-Hogg recalled that the rough cut was about an hour longer than the released version: [...] "There was much more stuff of John and Yoko, {{and the other three}} didn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was appropriate because they wanted to make it a 'nicer' movie. They didn't want {{to have a lot of}} the dirty laundry, so a lot of it was cut down." [...] After viewing the released version, Lennon said he felt that [...] "the camera work was set up to show Paul and not to show anybody else" [...] and that [...] "the people that cut it, cut it as 'Paul is God' and we're just lyin' around..." ...|$|E

This was reflected in another professor's sentiments: [...] "I didn't think Obama was as comfortable this time as he was in the other two debates, but I didn't really hear any gaffe, any major mistake," [...] said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Sabato added, [...] "he might even be judged the winner." [...] Times Mark Halperin graded McCain's performance an A- and Obama's performance a B.|$|E
2500|$|By October 1924, Lawrence and Frieda {{left for}} Mexico {{and it was}} {{while they were in}} Oaxaca that he was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis. The couple returned to the US, and by April 1925 they were back at the Ranch where they spent the summer, Lawrence continuing work on the novel which became The Plumed Serpent. However, with his better health and their six-month visa about to expire, Lawrence was determined to return to Europe. They left Taos on September 11, Lawrence's 40th birthday, and settled in Italy. Although he never returned to New Mexico, in a letter to Brett in December 1929 from Bandol, France Lawrence expressed some interest in doing so: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I shall try to come back in the spring.

2500|$|Some works (e.g. by George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim) {{have been}} made into both [...] "musical theatre" [...] and [...] "operatic" [...] productions. Similarly, some older operettas or light operas (such as The Pirates of Penzance by Gilbert and Sullivan) have been {{produced}} in modern adaptations that treat them as musicals. For some works, production styles are almost {{as important as the}} work's musical or dramatic content in defining into which art form the piece falls. Sondheim said, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> when something plays Broadway it's a musical, and when it plays in an opera house it's opera. That's it. It's the terrain, the countryside, the expectations of the audience that make it one thing or another." [...] Although this article primarily concerns musical theatre works that are [...] "non-operatic", there remains an overlap in form between lighter operatic forms and more musically complex or ambitious musicals. In practice, {{it is often difficult to}} distinguish among the various kinds of musical theatre, including [...] "musical play", [...] "musical comedy", [...] "operetta" [...] and [...] "light opera".|$|E

Kerli was very pleased by Lovato's recording and responded by saying [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> artists are story tellers and are here to deliver a message and there's no better person that I can think of right now than her to deliver that very story. So although I did write this song for my album, it's really her song. She nails it, she owns it. I am just the Santa's little helper here." [...] Gad, Robbins, and Kerli also penned a song titled [...] "I Feel Immortal" [...] for Kerli that also did not make it to her album. The song was eventually recorded by Finnish musician Tarja for her album What Lies Beneath. A version of the track titled [...] "Immortal" [...] recorded by Kerli appears on Frankenweenie Unleashed!, an album consisting of tracks from and inspired by the Tim Burton film Frankenweenie.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, a car {{accident}} with David Hayward (Vincent Irizarry) leaves Erica's face disfigured. This storyline unintentionally mirrored a similar {{car accident}} Lucci was involved in, in 1966 which almost permanently scarred her face. Like Erica, she needed plastic surgery. In the storyline, Erica and David fall in love while he helps her through her recovery. The obstacles designed to come between them are her continued feelings for Dimitri and his inability to fully give himself to a woman {{because of what happened}} to his father when he loved his mother too much. They become engaged to be married but Erica calls it off. She next falls in love with Chris Stamp (Jack Scalia). [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she found someone very special in Chris Stamp," [...] Lucci said. [...] "They are a pretty hot combination, and he seems strong and capable enough of being with her." [...] In the story, after becoming engaged to Chris, Erica cheats on him with Jack and Chris is killed. She and Jack marry in 2005. They form a family unit including all of their combined children. The union does not last, as they grow apart and Erica cheats on him with Jeff Martin.|$|E

2500|$|Sackville-West and Trefusis eloped {{several times}} from 1918 on, mostly to France. While there Sackville-West {{dressed as a}} man when they went out together. The affair ended badly. The mothers of both women, Lady Sackville and Mrs. Keppel, joined forces to {{sabotage}} the relationship and force both women back to their husbands. Both women were deeply interested in Spain, especially the Spanish Romany, with Trefusis writing to Sackville-West that they should go to Spain to show [...] "you my pupil, I as your cicerone...I will show eyes of black velvet...the sevillana, the fandango, undulating bodies, throbbing castanets". In another letter, Trefusis wrote of her wish to live forever in Spain with Sackville-West, [...] "a world of sun and love, and singing, and dancing". Trefusis sought to appeal to Sackville-West's fascination with the Romany people by telling {{her that she was}} turning into a [...] "Gypsy", writing: [...] "They said, this evening after you gone, that you were like a dazzling Gypsy. A Gypsy potentate, a sovereign-what you will, but still a Gypsy". Trefusis and Sackville-West both used Romany phrases to express intensely held feelings such as man camelo tuti ("I can't live without you"), nonero jeli ("our love"), and sartute loude gayeres ("escape with you"). Both families were concerned that the women were creating scandal. In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Trefusis, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "I never ought to marry you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you {{for as long as you}} wanted me...I ought never to have married until I was thirty. I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is the best solution for people like me. Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young. It's a rotten and ridiculous system at present, it's simply cheating one of one's youth. It was all right for the Victorians. But this generation is disregarding, and next will have disregarded, the chrysalis." [...] At another point, Sackville-West wrote to Nicolson [...] "if wasn't for you, I would go off with V." [...] Trefusis continued to pursue Sackville-West to great lengths until Sackville-West's affairs with other women finally took their toll. In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote in her diary that she was [...] "down on" [...] herself with [...] "serious thoughts" [...] of suicide as she believed that Nicolson [...] "would be happier without" [...] her in the world. [...] The two women apparently made a bond to remain faithful to one another, meaning that although both were married, neither could engage in sexual relations with her own husband. Sackville-West, who already had two children by Nicholson, was prompted to end the affair when she heard allegations that Trefusis had been involved sexually with her own husband, indicating that she had broken their bond. When she decided to end the affair with Trefusis, Sackville-West again contemplated suicide, writing in her diary that she [...] "hated myself to the extent of thinking I better vanish" [...] from the world forever. Despite the rift, the two women were devoted to one another, and deeply in love. They continued to have occasional liaisons for a number of years afterwards, but never rekindled the affair.|$|E
