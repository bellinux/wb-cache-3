50|$|The freight pilot curved inward {{a little}} way below {{the bottom of the}} nose before sloping out again, to give more {{clearance}} to the <b>coupler</b> and <b>hoses.</b> The <b>coupler</b> wasfixed and protruded through a rectangular opening in the pilot.|$|R
5000|$|Flex <b>Hose</b> Rotary <b>Coupler</b> (FHRC) weight approx. 900 lb × 1 unit each on S1 & P1 Truss. The FHRC {{provides}} {{the transfer of}} liquid ammonia across the Thermal Radiator Rotary Joint (TRRJ) between the P1 (FHRC SN1001) & S1 (FHRC SN1002) truss segments and the Heat Rejection System Radiators (HRSRs).|$|R

50|$|EVA One (Duration 6 hours, 52 minutes) -- With {{astronaut}} Stephen G. Bowen, Stefanyshyn-Piper transferred {{an empty}} nitrogen tank assembly from ESP3 to the shuttle’s cargo bay, transferred a new flex <b>hose</b> rotary <b>coupler</b> to ESP3 for future use, removed an insulation cover on the Kibo External Facility berthing mechanism, began cleaning and lubrication of the starboard SARJ, and replacement of its 11 trundle bearing assemblies.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the hosing {{instability}} can be suppressed after the saturation of the self-modulation instability of a long particle bunch if the plasma density perturbation is linear. We derive scalings for maximum bunch tilts and seeds for the self-modulation instability to ensure stable propagation beyond saturation of self-modulation. Numerical solutions of the <b>reduced</b> <b>hosing</b> equations and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations confirm our analytical findings. Our results may also apply when a train of particle bunches or laser pulses excites a linear wake. Comment: Accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. Let...|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} center buffer coupler of AAR tight {{lock type}} at the coach end has a support frame which provides an anti-climbing protection. The coupler can be opened {{from the side}} by a lever. The design allows the use of screw coupler instead of center buffer coupler. Therefore a fixing plate for buffers is also provided. The inter-vehicle coupler for the supply of the 750 V from the generator car is located below the under-frame. Due to the moving situation 4 brake hoses are to be used at the coach end which are brought to two <b>hoses</b> behind the <b>coupler.</b>|$|R
40|$|Current models {{predict the}} hose {{instability}} to crucially limit {{the applicability of}} plasma-wakefield accelerators. By developing an analytical model which incorporates {{the evolution of the}} hose instability over long propagation distances, this work demonstrates that the inherent drive-beam energy loss, along with an initial beam energy spread detune the betatron oscillations of beam electrons, and thereby mitigate the instability. It is also shown that tapered plasma profiles can strongly <b>reduce</b> initial <b>hosing</b> seeds. Hence, we demonstrate that the propagation of a drive beam can be stabilized over long propagation distances, paving the way for the acceleration of high-quality electron beams in plasma-wakefield accelerators. We find excellent agreement between our models and particle-in-cell simulations...|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{solution is}} to use metal pipes to transfer water but these are costly to deliver and assemble. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) covered hoses and Nitrile rubber (NBR) covered hoses {{have a lot of}} advantages compared to metal pipes. It is easy to deliver, assemble and disassemble hoses and long sections of NBR- and TPU-covered <b>hoses</b> <b>reduce</b> the possibility of leakage in connecting parts. These large-diameter NBR- and TPU-covered hoses are called fracking hoses.|$|R
2500|$|The chief {{competitor}} of {{both these}} couplers, more popular among serious modellers, was the Magne-Matic, a magnetically released knuckle coupler developed by Keith and Dale Edwards, and manufactured by Kadee, a company they started. While they closely resemble miniature Janney couplers, they are somewhat different mechanically, with the knuckle pivoting {{from the center}} of the coupler head, rather than from the side. A steel pin, designed to resemble an air brake <b>hose,</b> allows the <b>couplers</b> to be released magnetically; the design of the coupler head prevents this from happening unless the train is stopped or reversed with a mated pair of couplers directly over an uncoupling magnet. An earlier, mechanically tripped version of the design had a straight pin extending down from the knuckle itself, which engaged a diamond-shaped mechanical [...] "ramp" [...] between the rails, which had to be raised above rail height when uncoupling was desired.|$|R
40|$|An {{injection}} sprayer stores {{agricultural chemicals}} {{separately from the}} liquid carrier and injects the chemicals into the carrier flowing to the nozzles. Injection sprayers {{have the potential to}} decrease excess spray mixtures resulting from applications and improve operator safely by reducing handling of chemicals. ^ Peristaltic pumps are used to meter liquid chemical formulations on some current injection sprayers. Accuracies of two peristaltic pumps metering solution, emulsion and suspension liquid herbicide formulations were determined. The maximum error in the volumetric metering rate was 41 % for a three-roller pump and 111 % for a two-roller pump. To avoid exceeding a 5 % error criterion, the pumps need to be calibrated for the chemical and temperature used. ^ An experimental thermal flowmeter was developed and tested along with turbine and piston flowmeters. Flow rates of a solution and an emulsion herbicide formulation were measured successfully. The piston flowmeter had the best linearity and the smallest time constant. To avoid exceeding a 5 % error criterion, each flowmeter needs to be calibrated for the chemical and temperature used. Each flowmeter had difficulties measuring a suspension formulation. ^ Theoretical chemical application rates were derived for injection sprayers that provide constant spray mixture flow rates through the nozzles and a spray mixture concentration proportional to ground speed. Computer simulations predicted chemical application accuracies for injection sprayers accelerating from rest to a constant speed. Various plumbing systems downstream from the injection point were simulated. Plumbing systems with <b>reduced</b> <b>hose</b> diameters performed better than conventional plumbing systems for sprayers used by private applicators. ^ A feedback system to control the liquid chemical formulation flow rate for an injection sprayer was proposed. A pressurized tank generates the flow and a microprocessor-based system controls the position of a flow control valve, based on the flow rate indicated by a piston flowmeter. The chemical flow rate overshoot was 1. 46 mL/min following a transition from an acceleration of 1. 6 (km/h) /s to constant speed. The controlled flow rate lagged the ground speed input by 0. 13 s during the acceleration period. ...|$|R
5|$|Unmanned {{boats were}} the first vessels to enter the lagoon. Onboard {{instruments}} allowed remote-controlled radiation measurements to be made. When support ships entered the lagoon for evaluation, decontamination, and salvage activities, they steered clear of lagoon water hot spots detected by the drone boats. The standard for radiation exposure to personnel {{was the same as}} that used by the Manhattan Project: 0.1 roentgens per day. Because of this constraint, only the five most distant target ships could be boarded on the first day. The closer-in ships were hosed down by Navy fireboats using saltwater and flame retardants. The first <b>hosing</b> <b>reduced</b> radioactivity by half, but subsequent hosings were ineffective. For most of the ships, reboarding had to wait until the short-lived radioisotopes decayed; ten days elapsed before the last of the targets could be boarded.|$|R
40|$|Over 2 {{million workers}} are {{potentially}} exposed to respirable crystalline silica with {{the overwhelming majority}} in the construction industry. Occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica can lead to silicosis, lung cancer, and other adverse diseases. The present research evaluated novel designs in both traditional ventilation and local exhaust ventilation for a concrete dowel drill to reduce occupational exposures such as silica. The first study investigated traditional ventilation novel designs to increase capture velocities without increasing fan speeds or power consumption. The second and third study focused on improving a concrete dowel drill local exhaust ventilation design to reduce potential respirable crystalline silica exposures during large concrete construction project such as airport runways. Previous research indicated that the manufacturer’s local exhaust ventilation system reduced respirable crystalline silica exposures by over 90 percent but the system was susceptible to filter and <b>hose</b> clogging which <b>reduced</b> performance. In the second study, a laboratory study evaluated two novel local exhaust ventilation hoods, one commercially available hood, and the dowel drill manufacturer’s hood for hood efficiency and airflow characteristics. The novel design hoods increased hood coefficient of entry from 0. 59 for the manufacturer’s hood to 0. 64 indicating increased efficiency. Novel simple hood analysis found an average hood coefficient of entry of 0. 81 indicating further improvements can be made. In the third study, simulated workplace conditions were {{used to evaluate the}} best performance hood identified in laboratory testing along with other local exhaust ventilation modifications such as replacing the manufacturer’s corrugated hose with smooth-bore hose and including a cyclone pre-separator to reduce the dust transport burden within the exhaust system. The most effective local exhaust ventilation configuration consisted of the novel design hood, smooth-bore hose, and cyclone which <b>reduced</b> average accumulated <b>hose</b> weight (manufacturer’s configuration = 0. 3 pounds per trial vs. most effective configuration = 0. 05 pounds per trial) and increased average cleanout bucket capture (0. 95 pounds per trial to 6. 30 pounds per trial). These metrics indicated potential concrete dowel drill ventilation system efficiency and capture performance increases that address the ventilation system limitations indicated by previous research...|$|R
