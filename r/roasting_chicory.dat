While {{opposing}} troops were on picket duty, it was common for Union soldiers to trade their coffee with the Confederate soldiers in exchange for tobacco (away from the eyes of officers). Southern soldiers could also use <b>roasted</b> <b>chicory</b> root as a coffee substitute.

50|$|Ground <b>roasted</b> <b>chicory</b> root {{has been}} sold commercially {{on a large scale}} since around 1970, and it has become a {{mainstream}} product, both alone and mixed with real coffee. It was widely used during the American Civil War on both sides, and has long enjoyed popularity especially in New Orleans, where Luzianne has long been a popular brand in this respect. Chicory mixed with coffee is also popular in South India, and is known as Indian filter coffee.|$|R
5000|$|Coffee {{has been}} grown in India since the 1600s, {{when it was}} first brought to India from Yemen by Muslim saint named Baba Budan. [...] The most {{commonly}} used coffee beans are arabica and robusta. These are grown in different states of South India, such as in the hills of Karnataka (Kodagu, Chikkamagalur and Hassan), Tamil Nadu (Nilgiris District, Yercaud and Kodaikanal), Kerala (Malabar region) and Andhra Pradesh (Araku Valley). The beans are usually medium-roasted and finely ground and blended with <b>roasted</b> <b>chicory.</b> The final coffee powder composition usually varies between 20 and 30 percent chicory, producing a distinct aroma and colour in the resulting coffee.|$|R
40|$|The main {{products}} produced from chicory {{in the food}} industry are soluble <b>roasted</b> <b>chicory,</b> <b>roasted</b> crushed <b>chicory,</b> chicory flour, inulin, oligofructose and others. Fried products are used {{as a substitute for}} coffee, because it is caffeine-free and has coffee taste and aroma. Chicory flour is used in the production of bakery products. Inulin and oligofructose are widely used in the manufacture of bakery and dairy products. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the carbohydrate composition of the products from chicory. The objects of research in this research work were Fried chicory (Leroux), Instant chicory (Leroux), Instant chicory (LLC Flagistom), Instant chicory with hawthorn (Iceberg Ltd and K), Instant chicory (LLC SlavKofe), Instant chicory (Ltd. Around the World), Instant chicory (LLC Favorit), Instant chicory (LLC Beta +), Dried Chirory and Dried crushed chicory № 1, 2, 3 (LLC Sovremennik), Chicory flour (Leroux), Inulin and Oligofructose (Spinnrad GmbH). Determination of fructans and their average degree of polymerization, the content of glucose, fructose, sucrose, which are contained in foods from chicory was carried out using biochemical method with kit Sucrose / D-Glucose / D-Fructose (R-Biopharm). Studies are suggested that fried chicory products do not contain fructans. Dried products of chicory are contained inulin, the contents of which are about 60 – 70 %, and contained other biologically active substances. Content of fructans in commercial products, such as inulin and oligofructose is about 93 % and 79 %...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to reduce the {{formation}} of acrylamide during <b>roasting</b> of <b>chicory</b> roots by soaking the fresh roots in a solution of calcium chloride, by the use of different temperature and time of roasting of dried roots, as well as by the addition of the enzyme (asparaginase) during roasting of dried roots. It was shown, that with increasing <b>roasting</b> temperature of <b>chicory</b> roots from 100 - 175 ° C the acrylamide content also increased, while at a temperature of 210 ° C the growth was inhibited. Increasing roasting time from 10 - 25 minutes resulted in an increased acrylamide content. Soaking the roots in the CaCl 2 solution for 20 minutes reduced the formation of acrylamide during the roasting approximately by 40 %, similarly as the application of asparaginase to the dried roots during the roasting process...|$|R
50|$|In many American coffeehouses, a café au lait is a {{drink of}} strong drip brewed or French pressed coffee, to which steamed milk is added; this {{contrasts}} with a caffè latte, which uses espresso as a base. American café au lait is generally served in a cup, as with brewed coffee, being served in a bowl only at shops which wish to emphasize French tradition.Café au lait is a popular drink in New Orleans, available at coffee shops like Café du Monde and Morning Call, where it is made with milk and coffee mixed with chicory, giving it a strong, bitter taste. Unlike the European café style, a New Orleans-style café au lait is made with scalded milk (milk warmed over heat to just below boiling), rather than with steamed milk. The use of <b>roasted</b> <b>chicory</b> root as an extender in coffee became common in Louisiana during the American Civil War, when Union naval blockades cut off the Port of New Orleans, forcing citizens to stretch out the coffee supply. In New Orleans, café au lait is traditionally drunk while eating beignets dusted with powdered sugar, which offsets the bitterness of the chicory.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{extract from}} <b>roasted</b> <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus L.; 菊苣 jú jù) root (chicory root extract), which {{contains}} inulin-type fructans, has favorable effects including antihyperglycemic and antidyslipidemic effects and {{the improvement of}} bowel movement. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} chicory root extract on blood glucose, lipid metabolism, and fecal properties in 47 healthy adult participants in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The participants were divided into a test group that drank chicory root extract and a placebo group that drank nonchicory root extract (ingesting 300  mL daily for 4  weeks). We performed hematological examinations and body composition measurements, and administered a visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaire for fecal properties at the baseline (Week 0) and after the intervention (Week 4) for the two groups. Although no significant differences in fasting plasma glucose or insulin were observed, hemoglobin A 1 c was found to decrease by ingesting chicory root extract. No intergroup differences in the levels of lipid metabolism parameters were observed. However, the level of adiponectin was significantly improved in the chicory root extract group when the baseline and postintervention values were compared. In addition, chicory root extract tends to improve the VAS score for fecal properties. These results suggest that chicory root extract could delay or prevent the early onset of diabetes mellitus and improve bowel movements...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{research}} is to find optimal conditions for dispersing and subsequent dehydration of liquid food environments in the nozzle spray drying chamber through the study of dynamic changes in viscosity according to temperature, velocities gradients and dry residue content. The objects of study were <b>roasted</b> <b>chicory</b> and malt barley concentrates with dry residue content of 20, 40, 60 and 80 %. Research of dynamic viscosity were carried out at the measuring complex based on the rotational viscometer Rheotest II, analog-to-digital converter, module Laurent and a personal computer with a unique software that allows to record in real time (not only on a tape recorder, {{but also in the}} form of graphic files) the behavior of the viscosity characteristics of concentrates. Registration of changes of dynamic viscosity was carried out at a shear rate gradient from 1, 0 с - 1 to 27, 0 с - 1 and the products temperature thermostating : 35, 55, 75 ˚ C. The research results are presented in the form of graphic dependences of effective viscosity on shear rate and flow curves (dependencies of shear stresses on the velocity gradient), which defined flow regimes, the optimal modes of dispersion concentrates into spray dryer chambers in obtaining of powdered semi-finished products and instanting were found: dry residue content - 40 %, concentrate temperature - 75 ˚C, velocity gradient in the air channel of the nozzle at least 20 c-...|$|R

50|$|In the USA, Vietnamese-style {{coffee is}} {{sometimes}} confused with that brewed in Louisiana with French <b>roast</b> coffee with <b>chicory.</b> Vietnamese immigrants {{who came to}} the state in the late 20th century adopted New Orleans-style coffee because they were unable to get Vietnamese-grown coffee. The French roast style popular in Louisiana was similar to Vietnamese coffee in its relatively coarse grind; therefore it made an excellent substitute for traditional brewing in the single-serving filter/brewer. In Vietnam, however, locally produced coffees are characterized by medium roast and don't contain chicory.|$|R
40|$|Summary. A {{series of}} {{experiments}} on the preparation of fondant sweets with partial replacement of sugar by 2 - 4 % of chicory semi-product were carried out. The analysis of differential and integral distribution curves of particles and sucrose crystals in fondant showed that dispersity reduces {{with the increase in}} the chicory content. The effect of fructose and fiber on fondant structure formation was evaluated. A fructose, being an antycrystallizer, delays the crystal structure formation, the fiber due to the high hydrophilicity and water retention capacity on the one hand enhances the supersaturation of the liquid phase, {{and on the other hand}} increases mass effective viscosity, which results in the formation of the crystal structure and the liquid phase of high viscosity. Fondant rheological characteristics were defined. Analysis of fondant mass flow curves with powdered chicory semi-product showed them to be pseudo plastic rheological bodies regardless of the recipe. Structural and mechanical properties of the fondant mass during molding depend on the moisture and other liquid components contents, temperature, strain rate, mechanical impact duration, etc. Studies of fondant mass structuring process in room conditions (20 °C) showed that structure formation process accelerates with increase in chicory concentration and the plastic strength of sweets is significantly higher at 3 % chicory content as compared to 2 % content. A comparative analysis of fondant sweets quality indexes with various chicory dosages was carried out. Increase in dosage of additives in sweets increases the percentage of reducing substances that slows drying of products during storage and extends their shelf life. The increase in dosage of additives in sweets increases the percentage of reducing substances that slow drying of products during storage and extend their shelf life. The liquid phase content is directly proportional to the dosage of chicory. The technology of making fondant sweets with addition of <b>roasted</b> <b>chicory</b> semi-product while tempering fondant is developed. High nutritional value product was obtained and technological characteristics of production were enhanced by increasing the viscosity and the plastic strength of fondant. The duration of the fondant sweets structure formation while proving significantly reduced, and scrap rate decreased...|$|R
5000|$|... 'The Counts' optimistic {{view of the}} {{opportunities}} on the prairie underlay the flourish of agricultural and industrial activity on the Pipestone and at the Kalenterin ranch after 1888. Before his departure for France in 1889, de Roffignac had formed a partnership with van Brabant. The purpose of this association was to [...] "(grow) and Manufacture this indispensable article (chicory) under the firm style of the [...] "Bellevue French Coffee Company" [...] (Colonist). In their enthusiasm they produced enough coffee {{in the first year}} of operation to market to continental America for the next twenty years. Chicory was an additive, used in France and England, that greatly improved on the texture and taste of coffee. The two entrepreneurs imported seed and equipment from Europe, converted the Bellevue farm over to the production of the chicory crop, and set up drying and manufacturing plants in the Bellevue yard. To encourage farmers in the area to grow chicory, they distributed packages of seeds. The manufacturing process consisted of <b>roasting</b> the <b>chicory,</b> grinding it, mixing it with coffee, and packaging it in tins. Michelle Guitard, writing in Saskatchewan History (Vol. 30, no. 3), informs us that 'for reasons of economy, the proper proportion of chicory to coffee was not maintained - the coffee was undrinkable." [...] The chicory factory burned down in the winter of 1890-91, and the van Brabants moved their operation over to Richelieu. The [...] "Richelieu Coffee Brand, [...] " [...] placed on the market in 1892 and 1893, was no more successful than the [...] "Bellevue" [...] brand. When the Richelieu operation burned down, Renoult and de Beaudrap, who supplied the capital, assumed control of the chicory factory. Instead of blending the powder with coffee, they sold it as an additive. The two men operated the chicory factory until de Beaudrap's departure for France in 1899, and the Count later claimed that the venture yielded him a small profit. There is no record of a sale of the additive to a buyer even as far as Regina. It is possible as Mr. F. Dunand felt, that de Beaudrap's operation lacked publicity.|$|R
40|$|Disaccharide alditols (DAs) such as maltitol, isomaltitol, and {{lactitol}} {{are increasingly}} being employed in food industry {{by virtue of their}} low hydroscopicity, high stability, and good bulking properties. Still, these compounds are reduced-calorie sweeteners, so they are successfully employed in many dietetic foods, like candies, chocolates, baked products; ice! creams, and beverages. sere we describe the determination of maltitol, isomaltitol, and lactitol, along with other common carbohydrates, in some foodstuffs such as toffees, biscuits, creams, sponge cakes, chocolates, <b>roasted</b> malt, and <b>chicory</b> leaves. Separations were accomplished by high-ps anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed amperometric detection using 40 mM NaOH + 1 mM Ba(CH 3 COO) (2) as the mobile phase. The optimal detection potential (E-DET = + 0. 10 V) was established in voltammetric experiments carried out in batch and flowing stream solutions. Under optimized conditions {{there was no need for}} both postcolumn addition of strong bases to the eluent and, even more important, column regeneration between runs. A pellicular column with a relatively low ion-exchange capacity was adopted, which allows a rapid separation of sorbitol, isomaltitol, lactitol, maltitol, glucose, fructose, sucrose, and lactose. The presence in the alkaline mobile phase of barium ions improved selectivity and reproducibility besides shorter analysis times as well. Limits of detection were on time order of 10 - 20 pmol injected. The contents of DAs and other free sugars in some dietetic foods were evaluated by calibration graphs...|$|R
