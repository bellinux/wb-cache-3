After 1945, {{ridership}} declined with the rise in automobile use; in 1977 SP petitioned the state Public Utilities Commission to discontinue the commute operation because of ongoing losses. California legislators wrote Assembly Bill 1853 in 1977 to allow local transit districts along the line to make bulk purchases of tickets for <b>resale</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss,</b> subsidizing commuters reliant on the Peninsula Commute until 1980; more importantly, the bill also authorized the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to begin negotiating with SP to operate the passenger rail service and acquire the right-of-way between San Bruno and Daly City.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{indirect}} inflationary mechanism allowed by loss leaders banning laws. In a double duopoly model where producers compete to sell differentiated products through differentiated retailers, {{we show that}} the ban of <b>resale</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> can be pro-collusive: colluding producers can use this rule strategically to set higher wholesale prices, and pay the retailers through negotiated listing fees. The ban turns wholesale prices into floor prices, thus increasing resale price and lessening consumers welfare. However, if producers do not collude, this mechanism does not hold. These results are robust even if thelistingfeesaretwo-parttariff...|$|E
40|$|The law of 3 January 2008 for the {{development}} of competition for the benefit of consumers, known as the Chatel Law, continues the reform of the relationship between suppliers and distributors which was begun by the Dutreil Law of 2 August 2005. The adoption of a new, lowered threshold for <b>resale</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> and the introduction of a "unique contract" should change the behavior of operators. But this law already appears to be a transitional law which calls for other steps in the more or less near term, for changes in the legislation applicable to vertical relationships in order to simplify and intensify competition...|$|E

50|$|A {{large part}} of the first major landrush was cybersquatting, a {{practice}} in which individuals strategically purchase high-value domain names for <b>resale</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher price.

There are companies, such as DomainMarket.com, based around similar practices yet are still considered legal ventures.|$|R
50|$|The current {{position}} is: people may personally bring into Britain with them unlimited amounts of alcohol and/or tobacco from another EU member state, provided {{that they have}} been legally purchased (with the relevant local rate of duty paid) in the member state of origin, and are for either personal consumption, or as a genuine gift to another. Importing goods for <b>resale</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> profit, or even 'not for profit' proxy purchases on behalf of non-travelling third parties is not permitted.|$|R
40|$|If we {{can speak}} of the European Community’s ‘economic constitution’, we can assert that {{competition}} rules, together with free movement rules, form its core. Notably, implementation of the competition rules enshrined in Articles 81 and 82 EC changed radically with the enactment of Regulation 1 / 2003, which in effect dispensed with mandatory prior notifications and allowed national authorities to apply Article 101 (3) TFEU directly. Given that national legislations perceive certain types of unilateral conduct, even if adopted by a non-dominant undertaking, as a potential source of anticompetitive effects, an important question concerns the leeway enjoyed by national authorities under {{the exception to the}} convergence rule in Article 3 (2) of Regulation 1 / 2003, and the consequent effect on both legal practice and policy issues. In this lucidly argued book, focusing on national competition provisions in Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom that deal with such conduct, the author provides a detailed examination of how such considerations as the following are affected by Regulation 1 / 2003 : [...] prohibition of abuse of economic dependence or superior bargaining power; [...] the particular susceptibility of long-term contracts; [...] prohibition of <b>resale</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> or below cost; [...] prohibition of boycott, unlawful pressures, threats, and other coercive tactics adopted by undertakings; and the role of unfair competition law. The analysis follows a functional method of comparative legal analysis, reviewing the most relevant norms in the selected jurisdictions, particularly in what concerns their goals and function {{in the context of their}} respective legal systems. Special attention is paid to two specific sectors – the motor-vehicle and the retailing industries – which have most often triggered relevant legislation and case law in the jurisdictions covered. Legal scholarship in the field is also drawn upon. In its clarification of the meaning of Regulation 1 / 2003, this book allows practitioners to fully grasp its scope. The author’s thorough, masterful analysis of the statutory framework of Article 3 of the regulation also reveals the variety of reasons why different Member States have different competition policies on the scope of the exception to the rule of convergence, and in this way provides lawyers, policymakers, and academics with welcome insights on how major EU jurisdictions apply European competition law. •	Preface. •	List of Abbreviations. •	CHAPTER 1 Introduction. •	CHAPTER 2 The Interplay between ECL and NCL before Regulation 1 / 2003. •	CHAPTER 3 Interplay between ECL and NCL after Regulation 1 / 2003. •	CHAPTER 4 Unilateral Conduct and Undertaking. •	CHAPTER 5 Economic and Legal Perspectives on Market Power. •	CHAPTER 6 National Provisions on the Abuse of Economic Dependence. •	CHAPTER 7 Unilateral Conduct of Non-dominant Firms. •	CHAPTER 8 Competition Issues and Unfair Trading Practices. •	CHAPTER 9 Economic Insights on Superior Bargaining Power. •	CHAPTER 10 Diversity and Competition Law. •	CHAPTER 11 Unilateral Conduct and Unfair Competition Law. •	CHAPTER 12 Unitas in Diversitate in Competition Law. •	Annex. •	Bibliography (Books, Chapters, Papers and Journals). •	Documents, Reports and Studies. •	Index.

25|$|Most {{businesses}} {{continued to}} operate when possible and stocks lasted. They {{were not allowed}} to discriminate between local and German customers. The Germans had a very favourable exchange rate, so while shops had goods, including clothes, boots, cigarettes, tea and coffee, they bought everything up in massive quantities and posted them back to Germany, many for <b>resale</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> profit. Shops did not hold stocks back for locals until later in the war. Business hours were reduced, shop workers who had worked nine-hour days, 15 on Saturdays, were reduced to 20 hours a week.|$|R

50|$|Trading account assets {{refer to}} a {{separate}} account managed by banks that buy (underwriting) U.S. government securities and other securities for their own trading account or for <b>resale</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> profit to other banks and to the public, rather than for investment in the bank's own investment portfolio. Trading assets are segregated from the investment portfolio. They are recorded separately when acquired until they are disposed of or sold, and are then recorded at the price in effect when these securities are purchased or sold. Trading assets held for other banks are marked to market (adjusted to current market value) while held by a bank.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} 6 to 7 figure price range, red {{diamonds}} are generally purchased by diamond investors or collectors, {{for the purposes}} of <b>resale</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> later date or to complete a diamond collection, according to the Diamond Investment & Intelligence Center. Both investors and collectors only choose natural red diamonds for this purpose, as synthetic or color treated diamonds are essentially valueless. Often, when a buyer is seriously interested in the purchase of a very expensive diamond, they will ask for the diamond to be examined by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) to ascertain that it is genuine. Of all the diamond colors, red diamonds are the only color whose size of under 1 carat will not disqualify them from being an investment stone, since so few red diamonds larger than that can be found at all in the market. Red is not a commonly synthesized diamond color, as it does not usually appeal to the general mass of diamond consumers.|$|R
