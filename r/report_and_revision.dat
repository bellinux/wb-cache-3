40|$|The global {{move towards}} {{sustainability}} and sustainability reporting, {{the rise and}} influence of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and triple bottom line reporting, together with {{the launch of the}} King III <b>Report,</b> <b>and</b> <b>revision</b> of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listing requirements in South Africa, both requiring the preparation of an integrated report, have resulted in a uniquely altered information environment, in which investors are required to make investment decisions. The value-relevance of this new sustainability information is however to date untested in a South African context. The introduction of the Social Responsible Investment (SRI) Index in South Africa provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the value-relevance of such new reporting. This research report tests the GRI, using the SRI Index as a proxy, to determine whether this accepted reporting standard is recognized as being valuerelevant, from both a short term and long term perspective, on the JSE over the period 2004 to 2012. The short term value-relevance is tested using cumulative average abnormal returns in an event study methodology, while the long term effect was investigated using a 4 -tiered portfolio construction technique, which uses the SRI Index category rankings to define the portfolios. The results indicate that true to the long term nature of sustainability information, in the short term the quality of sustainability and sustainability reporting has no effect on the market value of a company. However, in the long term, a positive effect was found where the SRI listed portfolio, and the SRI best performer portfolio, significantly outperformed the non-listed portfolio on a consistent basis as measured using relative performance. The SRI persistent best performer portfolio however underperformed all other portfolios. This is however due to an overwhelming lack of diversification due to a low number of shares in the portfolio, as well as the portfolio being severely overweight in resource shares, which tend to be the best reporters, due to their large environmental impact. The research report therefore concludes that investing in a higher quality SRI/GRI sustainability portfolio, as opposed to a lower quality portfolio, resulted in excess returns to the investors over the period 2004 - 2012...|$|E

25|$|However, {{the theory}} that The Contention may be an early draft does not {{necessarily}} imply {{that it could not}} also represent a bad quarto. Traditionally, most critics (such as Alexander, Doran, McKerrow and Urkowitz) have looked at the problem as an either-or situation; The Contention is either a reported text or an early draft, but recently there has been some argument that it may be both. For example, this is the theory supported by Roger Warren in his Oxford Shakespeare edition of the play. It is also the theory advanced by Randall Martin in his Oxford Shakespeare edition of 3 Henry VI. The crux of the argument is that both the evidence for the bad quarto theory and the evidence for the early draft theory are so compelling that neither is able to completely refute the other. As such, if the play contains evidence of being both a <b>reported</b> text <b>and</b> an early draft, it must be both; i.e. The Contention represents a reported text of an early draft of 2 Henry VI. Shakespeare wrote an early version of the play, which was staged. Shortly after that staging, some of the actors constructed a bad quarto from it and had it published. In the meantime, Shakespeare had rewritten the play into the form found in the First Folio. Warren argues that this is the only theory which can account for the strong evidence for both <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>revision,</b> <b>and</b> it is a theory which is gaining increased support in the late twentieth/early twenty-first century.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the quality of}} prostatic biopsies in the Centre region {{on the basis of}} their indication, their performance and analysis of the anatomical pathology report in comparison with the recommendations of the Agence nationale d'accréditation et d'évaluation en santé (ANAES - French national agency for healthcare accreditation and evaluation) and the regional oncology network for the Centre region. Methods: Transverse descriptive survey including all prostatic biopsy histology reports compiled by anatomical pathologists from biopsies performed by surgeons in the same region, during the first quarter of 2001. Results: We analysed 606 <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> the deviations observed with respect to the recommendations concerned: - a non-compliant indication for endorectal ultrasound performed for diagnostic purposes before performance of the biopsy in 49 % of cases; - inappropriate biopsy performance conditions, with 64 % of biopsies performed as a hospital inpatient procedure and 47 % under anaesthetic (spinal anaesthetic, neuroleptic analgesia or general anaesthetic); - non-compliance with the quality criteria for the anatomical pathology report, with 44 % of the reports only including one of the four items of clinical information recommended and only 54 % of the reports clearly indicating extension to the peri-prostatic space, a key factor in the therapeutic decision. Conclusion: This study, conducted with a group of experts, demonstrated medical practice deviations with respect to the reference systems.

50|$|The Joint Contracts Tribunal was {{established}} in the 1930s by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and the National Federation of Building Trades Employers (NFBTE), to consider future proposals for amending the Form of Contract which had been published in 1931. Its first chairman, to 1956, was Sydney Tatchell, followed by Sir Percy Thomas. The RIBA Guide to its Archive and History (1986) recorded that the tribunal had been established jointly in October 1932 by the councils of the RIBA and NFBTE to consider suggestions for the amendment of the 1931 Form of Contract, and that each of those two bodies appointed one of the two Joint Secretaries. The Secretary RIBA had acted as the RIBA Joint Secretary until the early 1960s (Macalister to 1942, Spragg to 1959), when this appointment was performed by the Practice Secretary and then by the Legal Adviser. The archived documents are listed in the Guide as the RIBA Joint Secretary's Papers, 1932-1944, 1952-1971, including copies of minutes <b>and</b> <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> papers concerning <b>revision</b> of the Form of Contract 1955-1961.|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} {{spatial and}} temporal variability in the y band sky brightness {{over the course of}} four nights above Cerro Tololo near Cerro Pachon, Chile, the planned site for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Our wide-angle camera lens provided a 41 deg field of view and a 145 arcsec pixel scale. We minimized potential system throughput differences by deploying a deep depletion CCD and a filter that matches the proposed LSST y_ 3 band (970 nm- 1030 nm). Images of the sky exhibited coherent wave structure, attributable to atmospheric gravity waves at 90 km altitude, creating 3 %- 4 % rms spatial sky flux variability on scales of about 2 degrees and larger. Over the course of a full night the y_ 3 band additionally showed highly coherent temporal variability of up to a factor of 2 in flux. We estimate the mean absolute sky level to be approximately y_ 3 = 17. 8 mag (Vega), or y_ 3 = 18. 3 mag (AB). While our observations were made through a y_ 3 filter, the relative sky brightness variability should hold for all proposed y bands, whereas the absolute levels should more strongly depend on spectral response. The spatial variability presents a challenge to wide-field cameras that require illumination correction strategies that make use of stacked sky flats. The temporal variability may warrant an adaptive y band imaging strategy for LSST, to take advantage of times when the sky is darkest. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to PASP.

40|$|We {{present a}} search for an {{electromagnetic}} counterpart of the gravitational wave source GW 151226. Using the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope we mapped out 290 square degrees in the optical i_ps filter starting 11. 5 hr after the LIGO information release and lasting for a further 28 days. The first observations started 49. 5 hr after {{the time of the}} GW 151226 detection. We typically reached sensitivity limits of i_ps = 20. 3 - 20. 8 and covered 26. 5 % of the LIGO probability skymap. We supplemented this with ATLAS survey data, reaching 31 % of the probability region to shallower depths of m~ 19. We found 49 extragalactic transients (that are not obviously AGN), including a faint transient in a galaxy at 7 Mpc (a luminous blue variable outburst) plus a rapidly decaying M-dwarf flare. Spectral classification of 20 other transient events showed them all to be supernovae. We found an unusual transient, PS 15 dpn, with an explosion date temporally coincident with GW 151226 which evolved into a type Ibn supernova. The redshift of the transient is secure at z= 0. 1747 +/- 0. 0001 and we find it unlikely to be linked, since the luminosity distance has a negligible probability of being consistent with that of GW 151226. In the 290 square degrees surveyed we therefore do not find a likely counterpart. However we show that our survey strategy would be sensitive to NS-NS mergers producing kilonovae at D < 100 Mpc which is promising for future LIGO/Virgo searches.
