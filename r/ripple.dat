5|$|Elliptic {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use elliptic rational functions in their transfer function as an approximation to the ideal filter response {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. This is the same Chebyshev approximation technique used by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different elliptic functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases making the same discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a generalisation to all equal <b>ripple</b> problems. Elliptic filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal <b>ripple</b> in passband and stopband), Chebyshev filter (<b>ripple</b> only in passband), reverse Chebyshev filter (<b>ripple</b> only in stopband) and Butterworth filter (no <b>ripple</b> in either band).|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this case}} report was to study the {{relationship}} between high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), spikes, and seizures in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy. IntroductionDuring intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), HFOs {{are thought to be}} a marker for the seizure onset zone (SOZ). High-frequency oscillations are classified into <b>ripples</b> with frequencies of 70 – 200 Hz and fast <b>ripples</b> with frequencies of 200 – 500 Hz. Although HFOs are thought to be a marker for the SOZ, their relationship to spikes has not been studied in detail, especially within the SOZ. MethodsWe studied the time course of <b>ripples</b> and spikes in a patient undergoing intracranial EEG. Medications were discontinued on day one. She suffered three seizures on day three. Her SOZ was in the left hippocampus, which displayed abundant <b>ripples</b> and spikes. <b>Ripples,</b> spikes with simultaneous <b>ripples,</b> and spikes without <b>ripples</b> were counted for this study. ResultsWe found that <b>ripples</b> and spikes in the SOZ had a marked diurnal variation. <b>Ripples,</b> spikes with <b>ripples,</b> and spikes without <b>ripples</b> increased and decreased in concert until just before seizure onset, when <b>ripples</b> and spikes with <b>ripples</b> increased markedly. Spikes without <b>ripples</b> did not increase. ConclusionsThese results support <b>ripples</b> as a marker for SOZ and show that they co-occur with spikes. Seizure onset was heralded by an increase in <b>ripples</b> and spikes with <b>ripples,</b> without an increase in spikes without <b>ripples.</b> We hypothesize that spikes associated with <b>ripples</b> may have a somewhat different pathophysiological mechanism than spikes not associated with <b>ripples,</b> differences that may be relevant for the timing of seizure onset...|$|R
40|$|Objective: <b>Ripples</b> (80 - 250. Hz) {{have been}} shown to be a more {{specific}} biomarker for the epileptogenic zone than epileptic spikes in intracranial EEG and even surface EEG. <b>Ripples</b> often co-occur with spikes. We investigated the spatiotemporal relation between spikes and <b>ripples,</b> and differences between spikes that do and do not co-occur with <b>ripples.</b> Methods: We marked 50 time points with spikes in bipolar surface EEG during NREM sleep in patients with focal or multifocal epilepsy. We marked <b>ripples</b> that occurred with spikes and calculated parameters relating spikes and ripples: the duration, amplitude and slope of spikes, the timing of the start of <b>ripples</b> and spikes and the proportion of overlap. Results: In total 219 <b>ripples</b> and 5995 individual spikes were marked in 31 patients. Spikes with <b>ripples</b> were on average shorter, had higher amplitude and higher slope than spikes without <b>ripples.</b> 64 % of <b>ripples</b> started before spikes started. Spikes occurred on 13 (5 - 26) channels per patient, and <b>ripples</b> on 3 (0 - 14) channels, which were also spike channels. Conclusion: <b>Ripples</b> precede rather than follow spikes, so <b>ripples</b> are unlikely to result from spikes. Significance: <b>Ripples</b> and spikes seem not one-on-one coupled, but certain states of the brain can accommodate both...|$|R
50|$|Wave-formed <b>ripples</b> {{indicate}} an environment with weak currents where water motion {{is dominated by}} wave oscillations.Although symmetrical <b>ripples</b> are also called bi-directional <b>ripples</b> {{there is a difference}} between them. Bi-directional <b>ripples</b> are rarely symmetrical due to the difference in force of the two directions, where as the wave formed or oscillation <b>ripples</b> form from the circular water movement pattern of water molecules. These <b>ripples</b> form parallel to the shore line. They usually display rounded troughs and rounded crests.|$|R

50|$|<b>Ripples</b> are {{relatively}} small, elongated ridges that form on bed surfaces perpendicular to current flow. With continuous current flow in one direction, asymmetrical <b>ripples</b> form. Asymmetrical <b>ripples</b> contain a steeper slope downstream.

Symmetrical <b>ripples</b> tend {{to have the same}} slope {{on both sides of the}} crest.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Rippling</b> {{is a form}} of {{rewriting}} {{that guides}} search by only performing steps that reduce the differences between formulae. Termination is normally ensured by a defined measure that is required to decrease with each step. Because of these restrictions, <b>rippling</b> will fail to prove theorems about, for example, mutual recursion where steps that temporarily increase the differences are necessary. Best-first <b>rippling</b> is an extension to <b>rippling</b> where the restrictions have been recast as heuristic scores for use in best-first search. If nothing better is available, previously illegal steps can be considered, making best-first <b>rippling</b> more flexible than ordinary <b>rippling.</b> We have implemented best-first <b>rippling</b> in the IsaPlanner system together with a mechanism for caching proof-states that helps remove symmetries in the search space, and machinery to ensure termination based on term embeddings. Our experiments show that the implementation of best-first <b>rippling</b> is faster on average than Isa-Planner’s version of traditional depth-first <b>rippling,</b> and solves a range of problems where ordinary <b>rippling</b> fails. ...|$|R
50|$|Wind blowing on a sand surface <b>ripples</b> {{the surface}} into crests and troughs whose long axes are {{perpendicular}} to the wind direction. The average length of jumps during saltation corresponds to the wavelength, or distance between adjacent crests, of the <b>ripples.</b> In <b>ripples,</b> the coarsest materials collect at the crests causing inverse grading. This distinguishes small <b>ripples</b> from dunes, where the coarsest materials are generally in the troughs. This is also a distinguishing feature between water laid <b>ripples</b> and aeolian <b>ripples.</b>|$|R

The simplest architecture is the <b>ripple</b> carry adder, which follows the standard multi-digit algorithm.

5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled tuned circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section filter, by mutual inductance. These are most useful where the design requirement is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband <b>ripple.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a <b>ripple</b> effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E

5|$|Devil Daggers was {{developed}} by Sorath, a Melbourne-based independent video game developer. The development group was formed by Matt Bush, a member of Dustforce creators Hitbox Team. The game's art direction and rendering engine were designed to reimagine the aesthetics and graphical style of video games from the 1990s. This was achieved by making use of unfiltered textures, jagged 3D models, and the deliberate implementation of polygon jitter and texture warping found in early 3D games. Jitter and warping were often considered technical flaws of PlayStation games; however, the recreation of these effects in Devil Daggers is to make enemies shudder and <b>ripple</b> during movement. Enemy designs are hellish, with some entities taking the form of insectoids with skeletal features. Audio is composed largely of distorted and abstract sounds with compressed, digitised screams used to produce unsettling noises for the creatures.|$|E
