40|$|Ergot {{alkaloids}} are mycotoxins {{which can}} be found in food based on cereal-crops, due to a con-tamination of plants by fungi of the genus Claviceps. The ingestion of ergot contaminated cereal crops can lead to a severe poisoning known as ergotism. For food and feed safety purposes, the extraction of ergot alkaloids from ergot contaminated flour was investigated. For the specific recog-nition of ergot alkaloids, DNA aptamer ligands specially selected for ergot alkaloids were grafted onto silica gel in order to construct a specific solid phase extraction system. The aptamer-func-tionalized silica gels were used to extract ergot alkaloids from a contaminated <b>rye</b> <b>feed</b> sample. The presence of ergot alkaloids eluted from the aptamer-functionalized silica gels was analyzed using LC-QTOF-MS. By using this simple system, it was possible to specifically extract ergosine, ergo...|$|E

Amounts of TAX ranged on average between 89 and 103 g/kg wholemeal flour, and the extract viscosity between 2. 6 and 5. 1 cSt. The extract viscosity was significantly correlated with falling numbers and all three arabinoxylan fractions. Arabinoxylan contents and extract viscosity were influenced by the rye genotype. The anthocyanin free hybrid cultivar Helltop combined reduced TAX, SAX and IAX levels with low extract viscosity and high crude protein contents {{and seems to be}} more suitable for use in animal feeding than the other three cultivars tested in this respect. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} growing chicks to {{study the effects of}} <b>feeding</b> <b>rye</b> and wheat diets supplemented with different calcium levels, two types and two levels of fat, and increasing levels of vitamin D 3 and to study the interrelationships of these dietary ingredients on chick performance. In Experiment 1, feed conversion efficiency was reduced to a much greater extent (10 % vs. 1 %) when tallow replaced soybean oil in a rye-based diet containing only. 6 % calcium compared to a wheat-based diet. When the dietary calcium was increased to 1. 1 % the replacement of tallow by soybean oil resulted in only a small reduction in feed efficiency for chicks fed either the rye- (3 %) or wheat- (1 %) based diets. The retention of fat, particularly tallow, was depressed in rye as com-pared to wheat-fed birds. Fat retention was also influenced by calcium levels. Increasing the dietary calcium from. 6 to 1. 1 % improved tallow (16 %) and depressed (7 %) soybean oil retention in rye-based diets, whereas in wheat-based diets the retention for both fats was slightly decreased. Experiment 2 showed that the efficiency of utilization of rye diets containing 7. 5 % tallow was improved by 10 % when the level of dietary calcium was increased from. 6 to 1. 1 % while the corresponding improvement in similarly formulated wheat diets was only 1 %.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of dietary essential oil components, i. e., thymol, cinnamaldehyde and a commercial blend of essential oil components (CRINA ® Poultry) on growth performance, fat digestibility, intestinal viscosity and plasma cholesterol in female broiler chickens fed on a diet rich in rye. There were 5 dietary treatments: a diet containing corn, a diet with rye, the rye diet with 100 ppm thymol, the rye diet with 100 ppm cinnamaldehyde and the rye diet with 100 ppm CRINA ® Poultry. Each treatment consisted of 3 cages with 5 birds per cage. Birds fed on the supplement-free diet containing rye instead of corn showed a significantly depressed daily weight gain between 1 - 14 days of age. The rye-induced suppression of weight gain between 1 - 14 days of age was partially overcome by the inclusion in the diet of cinnamaldehyde, but the effect failed to reach statistical significance. Birds fed on the diets with rye generally ate less than those fed on the corn diet. Cinnamaldehyde tended to increase voluntary feed intake. The water:feed ratio was increased by the <b>feeding</b> of <b>rye,</b> but the supplements had no effect. The viscosity of jejunal and ileal digesta were significantly elevated when the diet contained rye instead of corn, but there was no counteracting effect of the essential oil components. Fecal fat digestibility was significantly lowered in birds fed on the rye diet, but the supplements did not reverse this effect. Thus, it is concluded that cinnamaldehyde may counteract the antinutritional effect of rye, but without a simultaneous effect on intestinal viscosity or fat digestibility. <b>Feeding</b> <b>rye</b> instead of corn did not modulate plasma cholesterol. Cinnamaldehyde produced a significant increase in plasma cholesterol concentration...|$|R
40|$|Dietary {{antibiotics}} at low, subtherapeutic {{levels have}} been shown to improve growth performance in farm animals. However, there is a trend to look for alternatives to dietary antibiotics, due to occurrence of antibiotic-resistance bacteria. The present thesis explored the essential oils as the possible alternative to dietary antibiotics. An essential oil is a mixture of fragrant, volatile compounds derived from the aromatic plant. Dietary feed additives based on essential oil components are marketed to enhance growth performance and health. It is claimed that under practical conditions dietary essential oil components improve digestion and stimulate feed intake, and consequently raise growth performance. However, the effect of essential oils on animal performance has not been proved in a controlled study. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of essential oils as the possible alternatives to antibiotics in poultry nutrition. Female broiler chickens were used as an animal model to study the effect of essential oils on growth performance, activities of digestive enzymes, macronutrient digestion and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, experiments were carried out to test whether dietary essential oil components could either counteract anti-nutrient effect of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) or rye. Finally, the possible synergistic effects of individual essential oil components were tested in relation to growth performance when chickens were fed on a diet containing CMC. The literature review describes the general biological activities of essential oils. Dietary essential oils can have several useful biological properties, e. g., acting as antimicrobial substance and antioxidants, and being hypocholesterolemic, affecting flavor, and stimulating the digestion process. Their metabolic pathways have been well elucidated, and based on that observation, it was suggested that their side effects are unlikely. Due to a limited number of controlled studies on the effect of essential oil components on growth performance in broiler chickens, an experiment was conducted to describe the effect of thymol, cinnamaldehyde and a commercial preparation of essential oil components (CRINA Poultry) on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities and macronutrient digestibilities. Corn-soybean meal based diet was used to prepare the experimental diets and chicks were housed in wire-bottomed cages. It was shown that no effect of essential oil components on any of parameters monitored in female broiler chickens was observed, but it can not be excluded that positive effects would have been observed under less hygienic environmental conditions or when using a less digestible diet. However, in this study dietary cinnamaldehyde significantly lowered water intake without affecting growth performance. Consequently, dry matter contents of excreta were higher in birds fed diet containing cinnamaldehyde. The observed cinnamaldehyde-induced reduction of spontaneous water intake could be commercially interesting. In subsequent studies, we further screened dietary carvacrol, and -ionone as potential feed additives in female broiler chickens. Furthermore, we tested the alleged hypocholesterolemic effect of dietary essential oil components when the chickens were fed either cholesterol-free or cholesterol-rich diets. It was found that dietary carvacrol lowered feed intake and weight gain, but also lowered the feed:gain ratio. The carvacrol effect on feed:gain ratio could relate to increased efficiency of feed utilization and/or altered carcass composition. Unfortunately, carcass composition of the chickens was not analyzed. Carvacrol lowered plasma triglyceride concentrations, but did not affect plasma cholesterol. Dietary -ionone failed to affect growth performance and the plasma lipid profile, irrespective of whether the diet was cholesterol free or rich in cholesterol. The question then addressed was whether dietary essential oils (thymol, cinnamaldehyde, CRINA Poultry) could antagonize the negative effect of CMC on growth performance in broilers. Intestinal viscosity was increased by CMC inclusion, but was not lowered by dietary essential oils. However, addition of cinnamaldehyde and CRINA Poultry to the CMC diet tended to counteract the negative effect on growth performance. Fat digestibility was reduced by CMC, but cinnamaldehyde and CRINA Poultry partially relieved the CMC-induced inhibition of fat digestion. This study indicates that cinnamaldehyde and CRINA Poultry, but not thymol, may antagonize the negative effect of CMC on growth performance which may relate to improving fat digestibility. In following study, we observed whether dietary essential oil components, i. e., thymol, cinnamaldehyde and CRINA Poultry could have effects on growth performance, fat digestibility, and intestinal viscosity in female broiler chickens fed on <b>rye.</b> <b>Feeding</b> <b>rye</b> to chicken lowered weight gain, elevated intestinal viscosity and reduced fat digestibility. Addition of dietary cinnamaldehyde to rye diet partially counteracted rye-suppressed weight gain in female broiler chickens. However, intestinal viscosity and fat digestion were not modified by dietary cinnamaldehyde. The partial counteraction of dietary cinnamaldehyde on rye-induced growth depression seemed to be mediated by concomitant increase in feed intake, however underlying mechanisms remain unknown. It would expect that a mixture of essential oil components could act synergistically on growth performance. Carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde were selected based on earlier studies. In addition, CMC was included to enhance treatment contrasts. Individual components when supplemented to the CMC diet had no apparent effects on growth performance. On the other hand, a mixture of carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde added to CMC diet significantly impaired growth performance of the chickens. This latter study suggests that a certain combination of two or more essential oil components can impair growth performance of chickens when birds are fed a diet with the soluble fiber, CMC. It is generally concluded that dietary essential oil components have potential to improve performance of broiler chickens. However, the consistently alleged hypocholesterolemic effects of dietary essential oil components were not observed. Based on the present work, future studies with dietary essential oil components should focus on identifying synergistic effects of different essential oil components and their application to animal production...|$|R
40|$|Rye bran {{contains}} dietary fiber, and lipids. Unsaturated {{fatty acids}} make rye bran products vulnerable to oxidation and formation of off-flavor. High level of dietary fiber gives rye bran a rough {{feel in the}} mouth. Therefore, extrusion was chosen to make rye bran products more appealing to consumers. The literature review covered flavor of rye, lipids in rye, lipid oxidation in cereals, extrusion of cereals, and principles of the HS-SPME-GC-MS method. The aim of this thesis was to study stability of lipids of rye bran during the extrusion process using different extrusion parameters, and the stability of extrudates during storage. Four experiments were carried out. The first three were to analyze the effect of extrusion die temperature (80, 100, 120 and 140 °C), water content of the <b>rye</b> bran <b>feed</b> (13, 16, 22, and 30 %) and particle size of the rye bran (633 ± 13 and 15 ± 1 ?m). In the last experiment, five most interesting samples were selected from the previous three experiments and reproduced. A stabilization of relative humidity was conducted. HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis was run after stabilization to determine effects of the parameters on the initial quality of extrudates, and then every two weeks till the 10 -week time point. In total of 88 (max.) volatile compounds were detected. Among them, 30 volatiles were selected for further study based on peak areas at first, mainly lipid oxidation and Maillard reaction products (MRPs) : aldehydes, furans and pyrazines. PCAs analyzing the extrudates were run with the 30 compounds as variables. Ten volatiles appeared {{to have a significant}} effect on the PCA model. From the first experiment, extrusion temperature of extrusion die had a small effect on the oxidation stability. The indicator of oxidation, hexanal, of all samples had almost the same level at initial point (around 3. 0 * 107 counts/s). The increasing tendency during storage was also similar. MRPs were more likely to appear in the extrudates produced at higher temperature (140 °C). From the second experiment, water content had great impact on the oxidation and MRPs. MRPs were better released at 2 -week time point and then decomposed or reacted with other compounds. The initial state of oxidation was similar, but during the storage, the lower the water content was, the better the oxidative stability the extrudates had. Comparing the results of the experiment 2 and 3, the level of MRPs was much higher when the particle size of the bran was small, while the oxidative stability was improved in the third experiment, especially in the 16 % water content samples. In conclusion, water content and particle size of rye bran had significant influence on the initial state of the extrudates. Samples produced with lower water content and bran with finer particle size had better oxidative stability and higher level of MRPs. This will be important in the developing of extruded rye bran products...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} growing chicks to study the effects on performance and fat absorption of <b>feeding</b> <b>rye</b> and wheat diets supplemented with fats of different chain length and degree of saturation. In Experiment 1 it was shown {{that there was a}} much greater decrease in feed intake and fat absorption when tallow replaced safflower oil in the diets of chicks fed rye as compared to those fed wheat-based diets. Experiment 2 established the effects on chick performance of supplementing diets based on either rye or wheat with variably saturated fats. Substituting the most saturated triglyceride (<- 18 : 0) with the most unsaturated triglyceride (Cl 8 : 2) in the rye diets improved the respective feed intake, weight gain, and feed conversion efficiency by 11, 75, and 40 %, whereas the corresponding changes for the wheat-fed birds were- 9, 9, and 16 %, respectively. Experiment 3 investigated the effects on chick performance of supplementing rye-based or wheat-based diets with fats of varying chain lengths. Substituting fats containing long chain fatty acids (*- 48) for those containing shorter chain fatty acids (Cl 2) resulted in respective improvements in weight gain and feed conversion efficiency of 27 and 30 % in rye-fed birds and corresponding improvements of only 1 and 9 % in the wheat-fed birds. A similar trend also occurred for fat absorption. The results of Experiment 4 demonstrated that older birds (35 versus 6 days of age) fed wheat-based diets absorbed only 1 % more fat than younger birds, whereas when rye diets were fed, older birds absorbed 55 % more fat than the younger birds. Overall it may be concluded that fat absorption in chicks is affected by chain length and degree of saturation of the fat and the age of the birds and that these factors affect rye-fed birds to a much greater degree than those birds fed wheat-based diets.
