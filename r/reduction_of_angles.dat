40|$|OBJECTIVES The aim was {{to define}} the 3 -dimensional (3 D) {{geometrical}} changes of the aortic root and to determine the local shear stress profile of aortic root elements during the cardiac cycle. METHODS Six sonomicrometric crystals (200 Hz) were implanted into the aortic root of five pigs at the commissures and at the aortic root base (AoB). 3 D aortic root deformation including volume, torsion and tilt angle were determined. Geometrical data with measured local flow and pressure conditions was used for computed fluid dynamics modelling of the aortic root. RESULTS Compared with end-diastole, the sinotubular junction and AoB have maximal expansion at peak ejection: 16. 42 ± 6. 36 and 7. 60 ± 2. 52 %, and minimal at isovolaemic relaxation: 2. 87 ± 1. 62 and 1. 85 ± 1. 79 %. Aortic root tilt and rotation angle were maximal {{at the end of}} diastole: 17. 7 ± 8. 8 and 21. 2 ± 2. 09 °, and decreased to 15. 24 ± 8. 14 and 18. 3 ± 0. 1. 94 ° at peak ejection. High shear stress > 20 Pa was registered at peak ejection at coaptations, and during diastole at the superior two-thirds of the leaflets and intervalvular triangles (IVTs). The leaflet body, inferior one-third of the IVTs and valve nadir were exposed to moderate shear stress (8 - 16 Pa) during the cardiac cycle. CONCLUSIONS Aortic root geometry demonstrates precise 3 D changes of tilt and rotation angle. <b>Reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> during ejection results in a straight cylinder with low shear stress that facilitates the ejection; the increase during diastole results in a tilted frustum with elevated shear stress. Findings can be used for comparative analysis of native and synthetic structures with individual compliance...|$|E

40|$|This is a {{preliminary}} investigation {{to detect the}} body sway and postural changes of patients with AIS under different spatial images. Two pairs of low‐power prismatic eye lenses (Fresnel prisms) with 5 dioptre and 10 dioptre were used. In the experiment, the apices of the prisms were orientated randomly at every 22. 5 ° from 0 ° to 360 ° to test changes. Four patients with mean age of 11 and Cobb's <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 30 ° were recruited and {{the results showed that}} the low‐power prisms at specific orientations (157. 5 ° and 180 °) could cause positive postural changes (2. 1 ° ‐ 2. 7 ° <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> trunk mis‐alignment) measured by 3 ‐D motion analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Convergence excess esotropia (EC) {{can be an}} {{additional}} component in all forms of strabismus. The most favourable prognosis is found in those cases where EC is associated with microtropia or bifoveal fusion, due to a better binocular potential. METHODS: 50 non selected cases were entered into the study and {{divided into two groups}} (Group A: EC with microtropia; Group B: EC with bifoveal fusion). All the patients were followed at the Lausanne Strabismus Unit and all cases underwent a bilateral medial rectus posterior fixation (Cüppers' Faden operation) placed at 13 mm from the original insertion. RESULTS: In Group A, the average <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> strabismus was 25 delta for near fixation, 20 delta in Group B. In both groups, the average decrease in angle for distance fixation was 6 delta. In Group A, 75 % of cases gained some binocularity post-operatively, not only for distance but also for near fixation. In Group B, all the patients showed a normal response on the Lang stereotest post-operatively.

Contact model with small sliding option is applied between contact pair surfaces of all connecting elements. Bolt pretension force is introduced in the initial steps of analysis.

The study is farther extended by analyzing the models varying connection parameters, material properties of connection assemblages, and magnitude of bolt pretension. The following results are obtained: 1) bolt sustains additional tensile force due to prying action; 2) prying force develops more quickly due to increment of bolt diameter, gage distance from angle heel to the centerline of bolt hole, and <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> thickness; and 3) bolt pretension increases the initial connection stiffness...|$|R

The results show the existence of ordered phases with a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the tilt <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the aliphatic tails compared to films at the air/water interface. For DPPC, where due to the large head group, a nontilted phase does not exist at all at the air/water interface, insertion of oil yields a phase with zero tilt angle. In addition a phase sequence is found where with increasing pressure the tilt azimuth changes from next-nearest neighbor to nearest neighbor orientation. For DPPE the oil can be completely squeezed out of the film. For the two different alkanes the effects differ quantitatively as regards the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> tilt <b>angle</b> or projected area.

One {{way to try to}} reduce the number and severity of these types of crashes is by increasing the red clearance interval of a traffic signal. In Portland, Oregon, eight intersections received a variety of treatments including red extensions. Determining which treatment had what effect can be difficult to weed out.

25|$|It wasn't until Dunne {{left the}} Balloon Factory and {{started his own}} company, the Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate Ltd., that a {{monoplane}} could be built. The D.6 was finished in 1911, with a 60hp (45kW) Green in a pusher configuration. Three A-frames supported the wing engine, pilot and undercarriage. All Dunne's tailless aircraft had swept wings with marked washout (<b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> incidence) at the tips. Since sweepback placed the tips well behind the centre of gravity, they provided longitudinal (pitch) stability in just {{the same way as}} a conventional tailplane, mounted at lower incidence than the wing. The wing camber increased outwards, causing the outer leading edge to droop further. The inherent design of the wing provided some directional (yaw) stability, which was augmented on the D.6 using down-turned wingtips. The wing had wingtip elevons for control, though because of the down-turned tips these also provided some rudder-like forces. The D.6 was tested at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain in January 1911 but failed to take off.|$|R

30|$|The ACL {{reconstruction}} in pediatric age {{has become}} more frequent in these past recent years. In skeletally immature patients, physeal-sparing procedures are recommended for {{the reconstruction of the}} injured ACL. The use of patellar tendon should be avoided for the potential risk of premature physeal closure and subsequent tibial recurvatum (Meller et al. 2008), moreover it may interfere with the delicate changes of the extensor mechanism during growth (progressive <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> laxity, <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> Q <b>angle,</b> lower limb torsional changes and gradual patella lowering). For these reasons the semitendinous graft is widely used for ACL reconstruction in children and teenage. Carnevali’s surgical technique, used in this study, satisfies these requirements.|$|R
5000|$|The two {{effects are}} evidently {{correlated}} {{with a general}} increase of the thrust produced. If compared to a helicopter or any other propeller, {{it is evident that}} the same blade section in a rotocycloid produces much more thrust at the same Reynolds number. This effect can be explained by considering the traditional behavior of a propeller.At low Reynolds numbers turbulence and laminar flow conditions can ever been reached. Considering a traditional wing profile it is evident that those conditions minimizes the speed differences between upper and lower face of the wing. It is then evident that both lift and stall speed are reduced. A consequence is a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attach at which stall conditions are reached. In this regime, conventional propellers and rotors must use larger blade area and rotate faster to achieve the same propulsive forces and lose more energy to blade drag. It is then evident that a cyclorotor is much more energy efficient than any other propeller. Actual cyclorotors bypass this problem by quickly increasing and then decreasing blade <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack, which temporarily delays stall and achieves a high lift coefficient. This unsteady lift makes cyclorotors more efficient at small scales, low velocities, and high altitudes than traditional propellers. It is otherwise evident that many living beings are still much more efficient, because they can change non only the pitch but also the shape of their wings, such as birds [...] and some insects or they can change the property of the boundary layer such as sharkskin.Some research tries to acquire the same level of efficiency of the natural examples of wings or surfaces. One direction is to introduce morphing wing concepts,. Another relates to the introduction of boundary layer control mechanisms, such as dielecric barrier discharge,.|$|R

The group of patients comprised 13 boys and 17 girls (mean age {{at the start of}} treatment: 10 years for boys and 8 years and 10 months for girls). Mean treatment time: 3. 7 and 3. 5 years respectively. RESULTS: Results at the end of treatment were as follows: <b>Reduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> formed by the maxillary and mandibular apical bases, <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>angles</b> formed by the mandibular base to the Frankfort Horizontal and the anterior cranial base. There were also changes in the S-N-B, S-N-Pg (increase) and A-N-B (reduction) variables. Facial angle increase, resulting in <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> mandibular retrognathism. Decrease <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> formed by the upper occlusal and the maxillary base planes. Increase of upper incisor inclination angles, formed with the anterior cranial base plane, the maxillary base plane and the Frankfort Horizontal. On the other hand, the angle defining lower incisor position in relation to the anterior limits of the maxilla and mandible was reduced. Concerning soft tissue measurements, G-Sls/Sls-Pos and Ns-Sls/Sls-Pos were decreased. The Ns-Pos/Pos-Ls angle was also reduced, since this angle is proportionate to facial convexity. On the other hand, the Ns-Pos/Po-O angle increased. The positive relationship of S-N-B and S-N-Pg variables was statistically significant, {{as well as that of}} N-S-Gn and S-N/Go-Me variables.

Material and methods Fifteen patients affected by III degree congenital talipes equinovarus (TEV) were treated surgically. TEV was bilateral in seven cases, thus the total number of operated feet were 22. The patients underwent peritalar release according to Simons, and were evaluated postoperatively with antero-posterior and lateral view X-rays. Clinical and radiological follow-up was at mean 6. 7 years (range 2 – 13 years). Clinical and morpho-functional evaluations were performed in agreement with Manes and Laaveg/Ponseti. Also, all patients were evaluated at standard X-ray two-projection stress views, photopodogram and baropodometric exam. Results Of the 15 operated patients, two were not available for followup. Therefore, a total of 20 feet were evaluated. Two patients underwent another surgical intervention for deformity recurrence. At follow-up no patient presented with pain at rest. According to Manes 13 cases had good results, five cases had satisfactory results, and two cases had bad results. Results at Laaeveg and Ponseti evaluation were excellent in 16 cases, good in two cases, and unsatisfactory in two cases. Anteroposterior radiographic exam revealed an alteration of the astragalo-calcanear divergence in seven feet and a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> Kite <b>angle</b> in three patients. At lateral view, X-rays revealed a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the astragalo-calcanear <b>angle,</b> compared to normal values, in 12 cases. The scaphoid was dorsally subdislocated in eight cases. Photopodogram evaluation showed accentuation of the plantar vault in five cases, Static baropodometric examination showed a backward shift of the body baricenter, which determined an overload at the normal hindfoot. Discussion In the present study, we perform a complete peritalar release as described by Simons, which seems to guarantee better chances of restoring correct astragalo-calcanear anatomy. In terms of deformity correction, the clinical and morphological results were satisfactory in 90...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{modification}} of medical polymers {{is carried out}} to improve biocompatibility. In this study, conventional polyurethane was exposed to microwave plasma treatment with oxygen and argon gases for 30 seconds and 60 seconds. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectra investigations of irradiated samples indicated the presence of functional groups. Atomic force microscope images of samples irradiated with inert and active gases indicated the nanometric topography of the sample surfaces. Samples irradiated by oxygen plasma indicated high roughness compared with those irradiated by inert plasma for the different lengths of time. In addition, surface roughness increased with time, which can {{be due to a}} <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> contact <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> samples irradiated by oxygen plasma. Contact angle analysis indicated a reduction in samples irradiated with both types of plasma. However, samples irradiated with oxygen plasma indicated lower contact angle compared with those irradiated by argon plasma. Cellular investigations with unrestricted somatic stem cells showed better adhesion, cell growth, and proliferation among samples radiated by oxygen plasma for longer than for normal samples...|$|R
40|$|Accompanying {{the growing}} {{interest}} in Micro Air Vehicles (MAV) over recent decades investigations for flapping flight of birds and insects have been increased. Although up until the present many basic phenomena have been explored and are understood, there are nevertheless still many unanswered questions. The present paper discusses first results of a measurement campaign for investigating flapping flight in more detail. The results presented refer to flow field measurements using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) applied in span-wise distributed planes on the upper side and wake of specially designed MAV models. The spatial flow topology and the interaction of vortex structures are shown. Special {{attention is paid to}} the differences between two types of motion: pure plunge and a combination of plunge and pitch motion. For the second type a strong <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the vortex structures is visible which is related to a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the effective <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} excimer laser refractive surgery as an alternative for optical correction in patients affected by fully refractive accommodative strabismus. SETTING: Eye Clinic, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy. METHODS: After a simulation of the cycloplegic correction with contact lenses over a 30 -day period, 18 patients (6 men, 12 women, mean age 32. 4 years +/- 9. 4 [SD]) affected by fully refractive accommodative esotropia had refractive surgery using an excimer laser; 8 patients had photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), and 10 patients had laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). RESULTS: The correction of the refractive error with excimer laser allowed a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> deviation in all but 1 patient, who presented with a regression of refractive error and <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> deviation 2 years posttreatment. The 2 -year follow-up showed that the mean <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> deviation in PRK was 2 (Delta) esophoria at near and 0. 4 (Delta) esophoria at distance (P<. 06); in LASIK, it was 1. 7 (Delta) esophoria at near and 0. 2 (Delta) esophoria at distance (P<. 06). The difference between the 2 groups {{was not statistically significant}} at near (P =. 56), at distance (P =. 74), or for spherical equivalent (P =. 16). CONCLUSION: Excimer laser refractive surgery seems to be useful in the correction of fully refractive accommodative esotropia...|$|R
