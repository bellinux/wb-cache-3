5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E
5|$|Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via {{mechanical}} means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably {{followed by}} sowing of native plants. Animals rarely graze {{it because of}} its irritating hairs, and liquid herbicides require surfactants to be effective, as the hair causes water to <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the plant, much like the lotus effect. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy. G. tetrum and Cucullia verbasci usually have little effect on V.thapsus populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein. Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include glyphosate, triclopyr and sulfurometuron-methyl. Ground herbicides, like tebuthiuron, are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.|$|E
5|$|Production of the D-1 variant {{started in}} 1941 with 495 ordered. These {{aircraft}} were delivered between May 1941 and March 1942. The RLM wanted 832 machines produced from February 1941. The Weserflug company was tasked with their production. From June to September 1941, 40 Ju 87 Ds {{were expected to}} be built, increasing to 90 thereafter. Various production problems were encountered. Just one of the planned 48 was produced in July. Of the 25 the RLM hoped for in August 1941, none were delivered. Only in September 1941 did the first two of the planned 102 Ju 87s <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the production lines. The shortfalls continued to the end of 1941. During this time, the WFG plant in Lemwerder moved production to Berlin. Over 165 Ju 87s had not been delivered and production was only 23 Ju 87 Ds per month out of the 40 expected. By the spring of 1942 to the end of production in 1944, 3,300 Ju 87s, mostly D-1s, D-2s and D-5s had been manufactured.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Hornets {{began to}} <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the {{production}} lines in 1984. The first two aircraft (serial numbers A21-101 and A21-102) were entirely built at McDonnell Douglas' factory in St. Louis, and were {{handed over to}} the RAAF on 29 October 1984. These aircraft remained in the United States until May 1985 for training and trials purposes. The next two Australian Hornets (A21-103 and A21-104) were also built at St. Louis, but were then disassembled and flown to Avalon in June 1984 on board a USAF Lockheed C-5 Galaxy. The aircraft were then reassembled, and A21-103 was rolled out at a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal David Evans, on 16 November. However, the aircraft's initial test flight was delayed until 26 February 1985 by a demarcation dispute over which category of pilot was permitted to fly the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The British public {{first saw}} the Spitfire at the RAF Hendon air-display on Saturday 27 June 1936. Although {{full-scale}} production was supposed to begin immediately, there were numerous problems {{that could not be}} overcome for some time, and the first production Spitfire, K9787, did not <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the Woolston, Southampton assembly line until mid-1938. The first and most immediate problem was that the main Supermarine factory at Woolston was already working at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stranraer flying boats. Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong (the parent company) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns, and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents. As a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the Spitfire be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighters. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that the problems could be overcome, and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938. The two orders covered the K, L and N prefix serial numbers.|$|E
25|$|Following {{withdrawal}} from service of Karatta, RW. Miller operated the MV Troubridge, in later years as {{a joint venture with}} the South Australian Government. Troubridge was a roll on, <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> vessel of 1,996 tons, which used specially designed loading gantries at Port Adelaide, Port Lincoln and Kingscote.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet {{war effort}} {{in the first phase}} of the Eastern front war was {{severely}} hampered by the obsolete aviation industry. In 1941 the MiG-3, LaGG-3 and Yak-1 were just starting to <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the production lines but were inferior in all-round performance to the Bf 109. Many of these aircraft were delivered before Barbarossa, but most of these were destroyed on the ground.|$|E
25|$|Scientists hypothesise that {{sufficient}} volcanic {{interaction with}} the lake's bottom water that has high gas concentrations would heat water, force the methane out of the water, spark a methane explosion, and trigger a nearly simultaneous release of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide would then suffocate {{large numbers of people}} in the lake basin as the gases <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the lake surface. It is also possible that the lake could spawn lake tsunamis as gas explodes out of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} strategic sealift vessel {{project was}} based on a proposal to acquire a converted Ro-Ro (Roll On - <b>Roll</b> <b>Off)</b> vessel from Japan as recommended by the Center of Naval Leadership & Excellence in 2009. Purchase and technical assistance was to be provided by the DBP Maritime Leasing Corporation Inc. (DMLC). It was one of the priority items in the wish list for purchase between 2012 and 2016 presented by the armed forces to the House of Representatives' committee on national defense and security on 26 January 2011. But this project did not push through due to delays in budget allocation and with the ship being offered and sold to another buyer.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the sedan}} body, and the VRS version were {{discontinued}} (the latter until facelift in 2010), the 2nd-generation Fabia offered {{variety of new}} choices. The GreenLine model was the most environmentally-friendly Fabia, with 59kW 1.4-litre diesel 3-cylinder consuming 4.1 l/100km, which is 109 g of CO2 per km. At the Frankfurt International Motor Show (IAA) 2007 Škoda presented near-production-state design study of the Fabia Scout: a rugged version of the Fabia Combi. However, it was until May 2009 when this car finally started to <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the production line in Mladá Boleslav. The new-generation Fabia featured a specific design element: a roof in different colour {{than the rest of}} the body was available as an option.|$|E
500|$|Another {{class of}} {{applications}} of the Reuleaux triangle involves cylindrical objects with a Reuleaux triangle cross section. [...] Several pencils are manufactured in this shape, rather than the more traditional round or hexagonal barrels. [...] They are usually promoted as being more comfortable or encouraging proper grip, {{as well as being}} less likely to <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> tables (since the center of gravity moves up and down more than a rolling hexagon).|$|E

500|$|By the 1950s it {{was still}} quicker for ferry traffic to divert via the Blackwall Tunnel even with all three vessels {{operating}} at full capacity. In April 1963 the ferry service was upgraded to a Roll On <b>Roll</b> <b>Off</b> model, reducing waiting times on the approach roads. The LCC continued to operate the ferry until it {{was replaced by the}} Greater London Council (GLC) on 31 March 1965. In 1964 Marples Ridgeway and Partners started building the current reinforced concrete terminals, which can operate over a [...] tidal range. The three ferries in use today were built in 1963 and the current terminals were opened in 1966.|$|E

500|$|When {{comparing}} the [...] "petal effect" [...] to the [...] "lotus effect", {{it is important}} to note some striking differences. The surface structure of the lotus leaf and the rose petal, as seen in Figure 9, can be used to explain the two different effects. The lotus petal has a randomly rough surface and low contact angle hysteresis, which means the water droplet is not able to wet the microstructure spaces between the spikes. This allows air to remain inside the texture, causing a heterogeneous surface composed of both air and solid. As a result, the adhesive force between the water and the solid surface is extremely low, allowing the water to <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> easily (i.e. [...] "self-cleaning" [...] phenomenon).|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{have found}} other criticisms in the gameplay. Buchanan {{mentioned}} that the character holds his gun in his right hand, requiring the player to compensate by moving left before shooting enemies (if the player can move left on the screen). Thomas echoed Buchanan's concerns in a later review, adding that this requires players to mentally adjust and to target enemies off-center. Thomas criticized {{the control of the}} tank, in particular the lack of traction, which he said may cause players to <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> a platform or cliff. Parish criticized the gameplay in the top-down perspective, saying that the gun the players uses is too weak; he continues by adding that there are too few upgrades for it and that, whenever the player takes damage, it downgrades from a [...] "high-powered beam of death" [...] to [...] "a stupid unreliable peashooter of mild discomfort".|$|E
500|$|Saadiq's studio {{integrated}} modern {{equipment such as}} a Pro Tools digital workstation and an SSL 9000 mixing console, and featured various vintage gear, including Saadiq's 1960s Ludwig drum kit and a kick-drum mic {{purchased from}} Abbey Road Studios. In the studio, Saadiq and Brungardt experimented with techniques and equipment. They wanted the songs to have slower [...] like older recordings, as producers in the past did not have advanced compressors, audio tools that manipulate the dynamic content of signals and affect certain sounds in a recording's mix. Their production applied tube preamps and tube compressors, with the former used as a front end for Pro Tools. For Saadiq's vocals, he used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone to thicken and distort his voice and embellish his characteristically clean delivery, while Brungardt employed a compressor and a Pro Tools plug-in during the mix. Saadiq sought a certain [...] "edge" [...] for his vocals and an unpolished sonic element for the album. They also tried to record tracks onto cassette tapes {{in order to produce}} a grittier, older sound. Brungardt used a FilterBank plug-in when mixing the album to uncompress vocals and <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> high-end sound from tracks.|$|E
500|$|The {{final cut}} of [...] "Cog" [...] {{consists}} of two continuous sixty-second dolly shots taken from a technocrane, stitched together [...] later in post-production. (The stitching appears during {{the moment when the}} muffler rolls across the floor.) Four days of filming were required to get these two shots, two days for each minute-long section. Filming sessions lasted seven hours and the work was exacting, as some parts needed to be positioned with an accuracy of a sixteenth of an inch. Despite the detailed instructions derived from the testing period, small variations in ambient temperature, humidity and settling dust continually threw off the movement of the parts enough to end the sequence early. It took 90 minutes on the first day just to get the initial transmission bearing to roll correctly into the second. Between testing and filming, 606takes were needed to capture the final cut. The team commandeered two of Honda's six hand-assembled Accords—one to <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the trailer {{at the end of the}} advertisement, the other to be stripped for parts. While several sections of the early scripts had to be abandoned due to the total unavailability of certain Accord components, by the time production finished the accumulated spare parts filled two articulated lorries.|$|E
