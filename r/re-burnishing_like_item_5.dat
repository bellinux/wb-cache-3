The first-year students performed very well on some items, even better than expected. The ‘specialized <b>item</b> price’ (<b>item</b> <b>5)</b> was correctly answered by 25.9 % in the pilot study. In the first data collection of the main study, approximately 52.7 % of the apprentices answered <b>item</b> <b>5</b> correctly. For comparison, 59.8 % of 214 German industrial clerk apprentices in their third year answered <b>item</b> <b>5</b> correctly (Winther and Achtenhagen 2009 b, p. 549).|$|R

Entry of private operators in 1990 ’s, competition has caused prices to drop and calls across India {{are one of}} the cheapest in the world. Technological advances combined with forces of globalization resulted in the transformation of the economy, industries, markets and customers resulting in a connected knowledge economy, borderless global economy, globalizing, covering and consolidating industries, fragmenting and frictionless markets and active, connected, informed and demanding customers. The objective of this research is to ascertain the constructs like customer satisfaction towards the mobile phone service providers, switching barrier and the customer loyalty factors. Methodology/Technique – Respondents in the study are the customers who use mobile phones. Primary data were collected {{with the help of the}} specially designed questionnaire, which was administered to the mobile users. The final questionnaire was pre-tested on 40 respondents and the coefficient values are all above. 8 thus meeting Nunnaly’s recommendation of greater than 0. 7 as the acceptable reliability level.

The method involves {{the application of}} a novel self-configuration technique for the generation of vector-space representations optimized from the information-theoretic perspective. The method, referred to as Holistic Probabilistic Modus Ponendo Ponens (HPMPP), enables reasoning about the likelihood of unknown facts. The proposed vector-space graph representation model is based on the probabilistic apparatus of quantum Information Retrieval and on the compatibility of all operators representing subjects, predicates, objects and facts. The dual graph-vector representation of the available propositional data enables the entropy-reducing transformation and supports the compositionality of mutually compatible representations. As shown in the experiments presented in the paper, the compositionality of the vector-space representations allows an HPMPP-based recommendation system to identify which of the unknown facts having the triple form (user X, <b>likes,</b> <b>item</b> Y) are the most likely to be true {{in a way that is}} both effective and, in contrast to methods proposed so far, fully automatic...|$|R
