5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s through the 1980s, {{typesetting}} moved from metal to photo composition. During this time, type design {{made a similar}} transition from physical matrixes to hand drawn letters on vellum or mylar and then the precise cutting of [...] "rubyliths." [...] Rubylith was a common material in the printing trade, in which a red transparent film, very soft and pliable, was bonded to a supporting clear acetate. Placing the ruby over the master drawing of the letter, the craftsman would gently and precisely cut through the upper film and peel the non-image portions away. The resulting letterform, now existing as the remaining red material still adhering to the clear substrate, would then be ready to be photographed using a <b>reproduction</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a review and {{description of the}} patents of the 20 th century scientist and philosopher Albert Einstein. The patents produced in collaboration with very prolific inventors cover the period of 1928 - 1936. Einstein's patents included refrigerators, electromagnetic pumps, sound reproduction apparatus and light intensity self-adjusting cameras. This paper illustrates that patents are a valuable source of information for constructing historical profiles of Einstein's colleagues. The paper concludes that the 20 th century theories of Einstein continue to be an exceptionally valuable source of patentable ideas.

40|$|For the {{accurate}} colour <b>reproduction,</b> multiband <b>cameras</b> {{have been studied}} and developed. On the other hand, high dynamic range image acquisition is also strongly desired in many applications. A multiband camera has a potential to meet both needs if its sensitivities are properly controlled. In this paper, a method for expansion of dynamic range that uses a six-band camera consisting of three high sensitive bands and three low sensitive bands is introduced. Experimental results demonstrating {{the effectiveness of the}} presented method is also shown. 1...|$|R
50|$|Colour {{reproduction}} (gamut) {{is dependent}} on the type and quality of film or sensor used {{and the quality of the}} optical system and film processing. Different films and sensors have different color sensitivity; the photographer needs to understand his equipment, the light conditions, and the media used to ensure accurate colour <b>reproduction.</b> Many digital <b>cameras</b> offer RAW format (sensor data), which makes it possible to choose color space in the development stage regardless of camera settings.|$|R
40|$|Early ethnographic cinema is a doubly {{condemned}} genre. These films {{emerged in}} a moment of cinematic history that scholars have had to vigorously defend against accusations of incompetence and archival excess. They were also born of the nineteenth-century cultural fascination with racial difference and the ever-expanding reach of Western imperialism. Post-war visual anthropologists distance themselves from their pre-war counterparts, arguing that early ethnographic cinema lacks not only technical sophistication, but also a necessary dose of self-reflection. For film scholars, the very term "early ethnographic cinema" has become a kind of shorthand for a regime of visual oppression and capture. This dissertation examines the broad field of French and American ethnographic cinema produced by government agencies, academic institutions, and commercial film companies between the advent of cinema and the early nineteen thirties. Looking beyond and well before the most widely-cited example of this cinematic mode [...] Robert Flaherty's Nanook of the North (1922) [...] I reconsider the boundaries of early ethnographic cinema and challenge its pervasive dismissal as a hegemonic ideological and narrative force. Through close readings of the Lumières' Village Ashantis series, the Albert Kahn photo-film archives, and a wide range of expedition films, I argue that early ethnographic cinema renders visible the discursive and disciplinary instabilities of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century ethnographic practice. Early ethnographic cinema demands a shift from linguistic signs to indexical images, from the armchair to the field, from the pen to the camera. It contributes yet another order of displacement to a discipline founded upon geographic dislocations and decenterings. The incoherent or unstable quality of the ethnographic image owes not to the failures of untrained filmmakers or the primitivity of the earliest cinematic forms, but to the combined demands of ethnographic practice and visual <b>reproduction.</b> <b>Cameras</b> in hand, filmmakers went in search of the non-self, the unfamiliar, and the faraway. An insecure world of irrepressible motion and infinite difference stretched out before their lenses...|$|R
50|$|For much of {{the first}} year, Stieglitz {{emphasized}} foreign photographers in the magazine as encouragement to his U.S. colleagues to develop a uniquely American school of photography.

Stat <b>camera</b> <b>reproduction</b> of paste-ups composed of often [...] "swiped" [...] graphic elements, and letraset type, were fast and affordable. Contributing designers included Van Howell and Joe Schenkman. This largely forgotten period of innovation in communication is remembered for its association with period (mainly punk) music graphics and concert flyers, and for many campus publications and activist flyers. It is somewhat similar to the later desktop publishing revolution.|$|R
40|$|Direct {{transfer}} cylinders {{are usually}} imaged from positives created {{off of the}} camera back. In this thesis a method was proposed to create positives from a dot-generating laser scanner that would fit the requirements of direct transfer cylinders. A test gray scale was scanned and a positive produced which contained square dots as opposed to round dots. This positive was used to etch a cylinder and then the cylinder was run on the Champlaln rotogravure press, located {{in the school of}} printing. From the printed results of the first test positive a tone reproduction study was performed to determine how subsequent positives should be made to achieve an improved <b>reproduction.</b> A required <b>camera</b> curve was derived from the tone reproduction study and programmed into the scanner. The positives that conformed to this predetermined curve were chosen as the best reproductions by a panel of six jurors who were shown prints consisting of differing tone reproduction curves. The conclusions of the study illustrate {{that it is possible to}} use the laser scanner to produce direct transfer positives that fit the requirements of the system. However, it is pointed out in detail that the screened positives alone cannot fully determine tone reproduction because of the inherent problems of etching affecting cell width and depth...|$|R
40|$|In {{illuminant}} estimation, {{we attempt}} to estimate the RGB of the light. We then use this estimate on an image to correct for the light's colour bias. Illuminant estimation is {{an essential component of}} all <b>camera</b> <b>reproduction</b> pipelines. How well an illuminant estimation algorithm works is determined by how well it predicts the ground truth illuminant colour. Typically, the ground truth is the RGB of a white surface placed in a scene. Over a large set of images an estimation error is calculated and different algorithms are then ranked according to their average estimation performance. Perhaps the most widely used publically available dataset used in illuminant estimation is Gehler's Colour Checker set that was reprocessed by Shi and Funt. This image set comprises 568 images of typical everyday scenes. Curiously, we have found three different ground truths for the Shi-Funt Colour Checker image set. In this paper, we investigate whether adopting one ground truth over another results in different rankings of illuminant estimation algorithms. We find that, depending on the ground truth used, the ranking of different algorithms can change, and sometimes dramatically. Indeed, it is entirely possible that much of the recent 'advances' made in illuminant estimation were achieved because authors have switched to using a ground truth where better estimation performance is possible...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examines {{a medium}} of symbolic communication [...] photography [...] {{to understand how}} the social context of the use of that medium shapes its social meaning. Camera club photography is compared with photographic activity which is institutionally legitimized as art, in order to elucidate how art world legitimization shapes the nature of photographic activity. The distinctive featues of 2 ̆ 2 art 2 ̆ 2 as a communicational system, as manifested in photography, are described. A variety of research methods were employed. Data on camera club activities were gathered through participant-observation over a three year period. Observations of art photography activities such as exhibit openings and conferences were conducted. Interviews augmented observational data: 10 camera club members and 19 art photographers make up the interview sample. Pertinent documents were analyzed as well. Art and camera club photographic activities diverge. Art photography is highly personal and concentrates on representations of artists 2 ̆ 7 ideas. Successful artists contribute innovations to the field. Art photographs do not convey easily interpretable meanings. Successful work is described as mysterious and interpretations involve viewers 2 ̆ 7 own personal reactions to ambiguous content. Conversely camera club photographs are direct, their content straightforward. Camera clubs carry on the pictorialist tradition in photography, updated with borrowings from commercial portraiture, nature and travel photography. Camera club photographers demonstrate their competence through skillful <b>reproduction</b> of the <b>camera</b> club aesthetic code. Innovation and personal self-expression are devalued. Art photography has been constructed in contradistinction to all other uses of the medium. The accessibility of photographic technology to amateurs and professionasl alike, and the ease with which competence in the medium may be attained are inverted in art photography. Art photography transforms this democratic medium into a pursuit requiring special criteria for admission. The relationship between camera club and fine art photography may be described in terms of folklorists 2 ̆ 7 distinctions between folk art and fine art. While innovation attends art world legitimization, the club context frames amateur photography as a traditional activity, maintaining aesthetic values distinct from the art world. Both highly skillful uses of the medium, the social contexts of camera club and fine art photography shape the social meaning of these activities. ...|$|R
