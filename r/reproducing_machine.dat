These {{are some of the}} issues confronted by researchers in Artificial Life (ALife), a young field on the rise that has been gaining acceptance over the past few years. Can a <b>machine</b> <b>reproduce?</b> This question was posed by mathematician John von Neumann in the early 1950 s and explored by him before his untimely death in 1957. Specifically he asked whether an artificial machine could create a copy of itself, which in turn could create more copies (in analogy to nature). Von Neumann wished to investigate the logic necessary for reproduction. He was not interested, nor did h...|$|R

40|$|The {{progress}} in the scientific understanding/simulation of the evolution mechanisms and the first technological realizations (artificial life environments, robots, intelligent toys, self <b>reproducing</b> <b>machines,</b> agents on the web) are creating {{the base of a}} new age: the coming of the artificial beings and artificial societies. Although this aspect could seems a technological conquest, by our point of view it represent the foundation of a new step in the human evolution. The anticipation of this change is {{the development of a new}} cultural paradigm inherited from the theories of evolution and complexity: a new way to think to the culture, aesthetics and intelligence seen as emergent self-organizing qualities of a collectivity evolved along the time through genetic and language evolution. For these reasons artificial life is going to be an anticipatory and incredibly creative area for the artistic expression and imagination. In this paper we try to correlate some elements of the present research in the field of artificial life, art and technological grow up in order to trace a path of development for the creation of digital worlds where the artificial beings are able to evolve own culture, language and aesthetics and they are able to interact con the human people. Finally we report our experience in the realization of an interactive audio-visual art installation based on two connected virtual worlds realized with artificial life environments. In these worlds,the digital individuals can interact, reproduce and evolve through the mechanisms of genetic mutations. The real people can interact with the artificial individuals creating an hybrid ecosystem and generating emergent shapes, colors, sound architectures and metaphors for imaginary societies, virtual reflections of the real worlds...|$|R

40|$|There are {{two parts}} of the design process that can benefit from reduced, {{miniature}} benchmarks that behave like longer-running applications during simulation: 1) the early design phase before an implementation exists, and 2) the later design phases when cycle-accurate functional models exist. In the early design phase, many hundreds or thousands of potential design tradeoffs must be evaluated rapidly at a high-level. In the later design phases, design changes are costly to undo, so potential changes need to be accurately evaluated using a performance model that has been validated against a functional model. Applications typically run too long to be executed completely for either early design tradeoffs or late performance model validation. In this paper, we explore the potential for automatically synthesizing reduced miniature benchmarks from the execution characteristics of actual applications. We discuss the advantages and challenges of automatic synthesis and present evidence that miniature benchmarks can <b>reproduce</b> the <b>machine</b> behavior of much longer running applications. We present one approach to benchmark synthesis and show that IPC and many average characteristics of the executing synthetic benchmarks {{are similar to those of}} the applications that the synthetic benchmarks are derived from.
