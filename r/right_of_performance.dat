40|$|The {{exclusive}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> public <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> {{a musical}} composition now brings to composers and songwriters revenue of approximately one {{billion dollars a}} year in the US alone. However, this right was not firmly established until a century after America’s first copyright statute, relying until then on the common-law principles that protected unpublished works. The first effort to create this right by statute was the Ingersoll Copyright Bill, an omnibus revision in 1844 which died quickly in committee. After that 50 years passed, and in the final quarter of the nineteenth century the need for statutory protection for public performance became more and more obvious as a result of litigation, especially that surrounding the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta The Mikado. In the mid- 1890 s the right was once again proposed in an omnibus revision that died in committee, the Treloar Copyright Bill. Simultaneously though, this right went through Congress and was passed as part of an amendatory act which also increased penalties for all unlawful public performances (including drama). This article traces the history of these acts and the litigation in the later nineteenth century, telling a story that has heretofore not been told – the prehistory <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> public <b>of</b> public <b>performance</b> for musical compositions...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{performance}} measurement {{in the public}} sector organization is very important in looking into the early <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> local governments.

40|$|Technology {{trends are}} leading to {{increasing}} number of cores on chip. All these cores inherently share the DRAM bandwidth. The on-chip cache resources are limited and in many situa-tions, cannot hold the working set of the threads running on all these cores. This situation makes DRAM bandwidth a crit-ical shared resource. Existing DRAM bandwidth management schemes provide support for enforcing bandwidth shares but have problems like starvation, complexity, and unpredictable DRAM access latency. In this paper, we propose a DRAM bandwidth management scheme with two key features. First, the scheme avoids unex-pected long latencies or starvation of memory requests. It also allows OS to select the <b>right</b> combination <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> and strength <b>of</b> bandwidth share enforcement. Second, it provides a feedback-driven policy that adaptively tunes the bandwidth shares to achieve desired average latencies for memory ac-cesses. This feature is useful under high contention {{and can be used}} to provide performance level support for critical ap-plications or to support service level agreements for enterprise computing data centers. 1...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a working}} paper. This paper investigates the geo-political and {{international}} economic aspects <b>of</b> human <b>rights</b> <b>performance</b> using a pooled cross-section time-series data set. We start with simple descriptive {{accounts of the}} recent geographic history <b>of</b> human <b>rights</b> <b>performance.</b> We then test for basic economic effects of income and then apply tools from the spatial economics literature to examine {{the degree to which}} clusters <b>of</b> relative human <b>rights</b> <b>performance</b> exist. Using spatial weighting models we analyse the spatial impact of proximity and human <b>rights</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> neghbours on overall levels <b>of</b> human <b>rights</b> <b>performance.</b> Unlike previous studies, our approach treats this spatial impact as partly endogenous: one country’s human rights performance may affect its neighbours through a variety of potential geographical spillover mechanisms. The spatial weighting models take into account size and distance of neighbours in order to compare each country’s human rights performance with what would be predicted by regression on a weighted average <b>of</b> its neighbours’ <b>performance.</b> The findings sugest that there are (a) geographical clusters <b>of</b> human <b>rights</b> <b>performance</b> and (b) size and proximity effects for human <b>rights</b> <b>performance,</b> both <b>of</b> which have significant implications for the promotion and protection <b>of</b> human <b>rights...</b>|$|R

The first of these developments was the shaping of a more principled and graduated crisis response procedure for the suspension <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> Member States in response to serious and persistent violations <b>of</b> human <b>rights.</b> The second development was an unprecedented degree of scrutiny <b>of</b> the human <b>rights</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> prospective Member States which served to highlight the familiar double-standards critique in relation to the EU 2 ̆ 7 s internal and external policies, and provided a major impetus to the development of more effective ongoing monitoring and coordination arrangements...|$|R
