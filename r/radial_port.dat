5|$|The orbital {{assembly}} of Mir began on February 19, 1986 with {{the launch of}} the Proton-K rocket. Four of the six modules which were later added (Kvant-2 in 1989, Kristall in 1990, Spektr in 1995 and Priroda in 1996) followed the same sequence {{to be added to the}} main Mir complex. Firstly, the module would be launched independently on its own Proton-K and chase the station automatically. It would then dock to the forward docking port on the core module's docking node, then extend its Lyappa arm to mate with a fixture on the node's exterior. The arm would then lift the module away from the forward docking port and rotate it on to the <b>radial</b> <b>port</b> where it was to mate, before lowering it to dock. The node was equipped with only two Konus drogues, which were required for dockings. This meant that, prior to the arrival of each new module, the node would have to be depressurised to allow spacewalking cosmonauts to manually relocate the drogue to the next port to be occupied.|$|E
50|$|The axial port of the LCMs will {{be fitted}} with {{rendezvous}} equipment and will first dock to the axial port of the CCM. A mechanical arm {{similar to the}} Russian Lyappa arm used on the Mir space station will then move the module to a <b>radial</b> <b>port</b> of the CCM.|$|E
50|$|It was a {{mechanically}} {{driven arm}} used to move modules from the forward (or axial) docking ports which had rendevouz equipment fitted to the permanent radial docking ports. The arm mated with a socket located on Mir’s multiple docking assembly node {{adjacent to the}} -XB end of the Base Block. Once connected, the module's main docking probe retracted and the arm raised the module so that it pivoted 90 degrees for docking to a <b>radial</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E
5000|$|With the {{depression}} biting, 1933 {{was the last}} year of production for dirt-track bikes, and the TT Replicas. The Ulster 500 cc was fitted with a [...] "semi-radial" [...] (parallel valves with <b>radial</b> <b>ports)</b> cast-iron head. For 1934 the Ulster had its head cast in aluminium bronze, and a radial four-valve 250 cc Sports was released. Rudge motorcycles took the first three places in the 1934 Lightweight TT.|$|R
25|$|Harmony, {{also known}} as Node 2, is {{the second of the}} station's node modules and the utility hub of the USOS. The module {{contains}} four racks that provide electrical power, bus electronic data, and acts as a central connecting point for several other components via its six Common Berthing Mechanisms (CBMs). The European Columbus and Japanese Kibō laboratories are permanently berthed to the starboard and <b>port</b> <b>radial</b> <b>ports</b> respectively. The nadir and zenith ports can be used for docking visiting spacecraft including HTV, Dragon, and Cygnus, with the nadir port serving as the primary docking port. American Shuttle Orbiters docked with the ISS via PMA-2, attached to the forward port.|$|R
40|$|The antenna {{studies were}} {{performed}} in a large magnetized plasma source, a schematic drawing of which is shown. The plasma diagnostics consist of a 70 GHz (4 mm) microwave interferometer for density measurements and of various Langmuir probes for spatially resolved measurements of t sub e, n sub e and {{the shape of the}} electron distribution function. All diagnostic data are time-resolved by sample-and-hold techniques so as to yield information about the plasma build-up, the steady-state discharge, and the plasma decay in the afterglow. Whistler waves are excited and detected with various antennas which are inserted {{into the center of the}} plasma column through one axial and two orthogonal <b>radial</b> <b>ports.</b> The antennas were tested for their proper dipole response and then calibrated in a known field geometry in air. For the electric dipole, a parallel plate capacitor field was used; the magnetic loop is calibrated in the near-zone field of a long linear conductor of known radio frequency current distribution. Results are presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|Like Mir and the Russian {{orbital segment}} of the ISS, the CSS modules will be fully {{assembled}} in orbit, {{in contrast to the}} US Orbital Segment of the ISS, which required spacewalking to interconnect cables, piping, and structural elements manually. The axial port of the LCMs will be fitted with rendezvous equipment and will first dock to the axial port of the CCM. A mechanical arm similar to the Russian Lyappa arm used on the Mir space station will then move the module to a <b>radial</b> <b>port</b> of the CCM.|$|E
50|$|The docking hub {{allow the}} core module to be docked with five other space station modules, {{including}} two experimental modules, a cargo ship, and a Shenzhou spacecraft. The axial port of the module will be fitted with rendezvous equipment and a mechanical arm {{similar to the}} Russian Lyappa arm used on the Mir space station. The axial port on the docking hub shall be the primary docking port, when new modules arrive, they will first dock here, then the mechanical arm shall attach and move the module to a <b>radial</b> <b>port.</b> Crew and supply ships from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center will dock to either of the axial ports of the module.|$|E

50|$|Each CBM {{compatible}} module {{that connects}} to previously launched modules requires a PCBM {{to connect to}} an ACBM. The three ISS connecting nodes feature four <b>radial</b> ACBM <b>ports.</b> Unity features two ACBM on the axial side, while Harmony and Tranquility feature a PCBM on one axial side and an ACBM on the other axial side. The Destiny laboratory and the Japanese Pressurised Module both feature one PCBM and one ACBM.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to module-specific equipment, Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr and Priroda were each equipped with one Lyappa arm, a robotic arm which, after the module had docked {{to the core}} module's forward port, grappled one of two fixtures positioned on the core module's docking node. The arriving module's docking probe was then retracted, and the arm raised the module {{so that it could}} be pivoted 90° for docking to one of the four <b>radial</b> docking <b>ports.</b>|$|R
40|$|A passive neutron {{area monitor}} has been {{designed}} using Monte Carlo methods; the monitor is a polyethylene cylinder with pairs of thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD 600 and TLD 700) as thermal neutron detector. The monitor was calibrated with a bare and a thermalzed 241 AmBe neutron sources and its performance was evaluated measuring the ambient dose equivalent due to photoneutrons produced by a 15 MV linear accelerator for radiotherapy and the neutrons in the output of a TRIGA Mark III <b>radial</b> beam <b>port...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Kristall was its {{relation}} to the Soviet Buran program. Kristall carried two APAS-89 Androgynous Peripheral Attach System designed to be compatible with the Buran shuttle. One unit was located axially {{and the other was}} located radially. After the cancellation of the Buran program in 1993, the lateral docking port found use for the Shuttle-Mir Program. The <b>radial</b> <b>port</b> was never used. The axial port was tested by the modified Soyuz TM-16 spacecraft in 1993 in preparation for Shuttle dockings. On May 26, 1995, Kristall was moved from the -Y port on the Mir base block to the -X port. It was then moved on May 30 to -Z port in preparation for the arrival of the Spektr module. On June 10, Kristall was moved back to -X port to prepare for the upcoming Shuttle docking. The first Space Shuttle docking occurred in 1995 during STS-71 by the Space Shuttle Atlantis. On July 17, 1995, Kristall was moved one last time to its permanent position at the -Z port. For Buran dockings, the entire procedure of moving Kristall would have to be used.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{need for}} real time, {{reliable}} density measurement for density control, compatible with the restricted access and radiation environment on ITER. Line average density measurements using microwave or laser interferometry techniques have proven to be robust and reliable for density control on contemporary tokamaks. In ITER, the large path length, high density and density gradients, limit the wavelength of a probing beam to shorter then about 50 {micro}m due to refraction effects. In this paper the authors consider the design of short wavelength vibration compensated interferometers and Faraday rotation techniques for density measurements on ITER. These techniques allow operation of the diagnostics without a prohibitively large vibration isolated structure and permits the optics to be mounted directly on the <b>radial</b> <b>port</b> plugs on ITER. A beam path designed for 10. 6 {micro}m (CO 2 laser) with a tangential path through the plasma allows both an interferometer and a Faraday rotation measurement of the line average density with good density resolution while avoiding refraction problems. Plasma effects on the probing beams and design tradeoffs will be discussed along with radiation and long pulse issues. A proposed layout of the diagnostic for ITER will be present...|$|E
40|$|In SST- 1, 42 GHz ECRH {{system has}} been {{commissioned}} to carry out breakdown and heating experiments at 0. 75 T and 1. 5 T operating toroidal magnetic fields. The 42 GHz ECRH system consists of high power microwave source Gyrotron capable to deliver 500 kW microwave power for 500 ms duration, approximately 20 meter long transmission line and a mirror based launcher. The ECRH power in fundamental O-mode & second harmonic X-mode is launched from low field side (<b>radial</b> <b>port)</b> of the tokamak. At 0. 75 T operation, approximately 300 kW ECH power is launched in second harmonic X-mode and successful ECRH assisted breakdown is achieved at low loop_voltage ~ 3 V. The ECRH power is launched around 45 ms prior to loop voltage. The hydrogen pressure in tokamak is maintained ~ 1 × 10 - 5 mbar and the pre-ionized density is ~ 4 × 1012 /cc. At 1. 5 T operating toroidal magnetic field, the ECH power is launched in fundamental O-mode. The ECH power at fundamental harmonic is varied from 100 kW to 250 kW and successful breakdown is achieved in all ECRH shots. In fundamental harmonic there is no delay in breakdown while at second harmonic ~ 40 ms delay is observed, which is normal in case of second harmonic ECRH assisted breakdown...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{design and construction}} of a 5 cm bore, 23 cm long solenoidal magnet operated at 250 kilogauss is described. The magnet provides confining field for a plasma heated by a CO$sub 2 $ laser. <b>Radial</b> diagnostic <b>ports</b> with a clear aperture of 0. 41 cm allow viewing access near the magnet midplane.

50|$|The rifle's {{operation}} during firing and reloading {{is identical}} {{to that of the}} AKM. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle. The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and bolt carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide, rotates the bolt approximately 35° and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. The moving assembly has about 5.5 mm of free travel which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence, allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken. Like previous Kalashnikov-pattern rifles, the AK-74 does not have a gas valve; excess gases are ventilated through a series of <b>radial</b> <b>ports</b> in the gas cylinder. Since the Kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation, the 5.45×39mm AK-74 bolt has a larger extractor claw than the 7.62×39mm AKM for increased extraction reliability. Other minor modifications were made to the bolt and carrier assembly.|$|R
50|$|The Lyappa (or Ljappa) arm was {{a robotic}} arm {{used during the}} {{assembly}} of the Soviet/Russian space station Mir. Each of the Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr and Priroda modules was equipped {{with one of these}} arms, which, after the module had docked to the core module's forward port, grappled one of two fixtures positioned on the core module's hub module. The module's main docking probe was then retracted, and the arm raised the module so that it could be pivoted 90 degrees for docking to one of the four <b>radial</b> docking <b>ports.</b>|$|R
40|$|The lower hybrid (LH) {{launcher}} configuration {{has been}} redesigned {{to integrate the}} functions of the vertical four-way power splitter and the front waveguide array (front array). This permits 256 waveguide channels to be fed by only 64 waveguides at the vacuum window interface. The resulting configuration is a more compact coupler, which incorporates the simplicity of a multijunction coupler while preserving the spectral flexibility of a conventional lower hybrid launcher. Other spin-offs of the redesign are reduction in thermal incompatibility between the front array and vacuum windows, improved maintainability, in situ vacuum window replacement, a reduced number of radio frequency (rf) connections, and a weight reduction of 7300 kg. There should be a significant cost reduction as well. Issues associated with the launcher design and fabrication have been addressed by a research and development program that includes brazing of the front array and testing of the power splitter configuration to confirm that phase errors due to reflections in the shorted splitter legs will not significantly impact the rf spectrum. The Conceptual Design Review requires that radiation levels at the torus <b>radial</b> <b>port</b> mounting flange and outer surface of the toroidal field coils should be sufficiently low to permit hands-on maintenance. Low activation materials and neutron shielding are incorporated in the launcher design to meet these requirements. The launcher is configured to couple 3 MW of steady state LH heating/LH current drive power at 3. 7 GHz to the Tokamak Physics Experiment plasma...|$|E
40|$|A major {{renovation}} of the ATLAS 10 GHz ECRIS, which began operations in 1987, is in the planning and acquisition phase. The old two-stage source will be converted to a single stage design including a high gradient magnetic field, electron donor disk, large <b>radial</b> <b>ports,</b> and flexible modular design. Eight solenoid coils taken from the existing ECR will produce the axial mirror. The individual coils will be encased in an iron yoke that optimizes the magnetic field. Computer modeling of the field profile yields a minimum field along the axis of 3. 0 kG with mirror ratios of 4. 4 and 2. 9. An open hexapole configuration consisting of Nd-Fe-B bars enclosed in an austenitic stainless steel housing will be placed in an aluminium plasma chamber that will be water cooled along the poles of the hexapole. The hexapole field at the chamber wall, 4 cm in radius, {{is expected to be}} 9. 3 kG along the magnet poles and 5. 7 kG along the center of the pole gaps, which are 2. 4 cm wide. A 3 D model produced from individual 2 D field profiles was used to check the end effects of the hexapole. Based on the models this new field configuration is capable of supporting a second ECR resonance zone at 14 GHz, which may be implemented at a later date...|$|R
50|$|To fire, the {{operator}} inserts a loaded magazine, pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the trigger. In semi-automatic, the firearm fires only once, requiring the trigger {{to be released}} and depressed again for the next shot. In full-automatic, the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle.

30|$|The {{differential}} {{neutron energy}} spectrum, at the inner entrance {{position of the}} radial channel No. 4 from {{the core of the}} Dalat nuclear research reactor, including the conventional Westcott fluxes, α-coefficient and fast neutron spectrum have been measured by the multi-foil activation method. The measured neutron energy spectrum show that, the thermal and epithermal neutron density fluxes are 4.80  ×  109  ±  0.072 and 1.98  ×  107  ±  0.031  cm− 2  s− 1, respectively. The experimental value of α-coefficient is 0.0448  ±  0.001. The energy neutron spectrum up to 107 eV has been obtained. The present results are proposed to be used as input information for optimal simulations and design of neutron facilities and radiation shielding, which are under developing at the <b>radial</b> beam <b>port</b> No. 4 of the Dalat research reactor. We are expected to obtain collimated neutron beams, after transferring through a combination of filter materials, with a pure thermal flux higher than 106  cm− 2  s− 1, or quasi-mono-energetic neutron flux of about 105  cm− 2  s− 1 in keV energy region.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of control port geometry on swirl development, operating characteristics, global flow and momentum characteristics is studied experimentally. Shape {{and size of}} the control flow channels and the pressure applied at the tangential ports are critical in determining the trajectory of the jet issuing from the tangential ports; and deflection of radial flow, vortex strength and prevention of back diffusion along the <b>radial</b> supply <b>ports.</b> Dominance of control-to-exit area ratio is confirmed but a clear improvement in performance is noted for the practical site-based geometry that is not derived from this ratio, but from the shaped passages of the device. Flow and momentum characteristics provide additional design data. Lack of {{influence of}} supply-to-exit area ratio is demonstrated at lower ratios than advertised in literature. The relationship of Swirl number to output flow is demonstrated. The results imply a geometrical development that has led to practical improvements in vortex amplifier geometry on the scale of the mini-VA. Global flow and momentum characteristics provide insight into design and operation that is useful when avoiding back-diffusion in a mini-VA...|$|R
40|$|Neutron {{collimator}} is {{the most}} important component in a neutron radiography facility set up, which defines the neutron beam characteristic at the object plane. The neutron radiography facility in Malaysia was built at one of the <b>radial</b> beam <b>ports</b> of TRIGA MARK II PUSPATI research reactor RTP. At present, the facility has low thermal neutron intensity at the sample position, which leads to long irradiation times; it gives many limitations for the industrial applications. The collimator used for this facility is based on step divergent collimator type. The aim of this research is to design the best geometry and to choose materials for thermal neutron collimator so as to obtain a uniform beam, high L D ratio and a maximum thermal neutron flux at the object plane. In order to achieve this aim new collimator geometry has been designed to improve the existing radiography facility by using Monte Carlo simulation codes of SIMRES and MCNPX. The new design results are compared with those of the existing facility. Our simulation result may be of help in the design of new collimator for neutron radiography facilit...|$|R
40|$|For {{the study}} of {{short-lived}} fission products, a gas jet system {{has been set up}} in a beam port of the Ford Nuclear Reactor at the University of Michigan. The system consists of a target chamber joined to three polyethylene tubes which serve as gas inlet, fission product outlet and an outlet for pressure monitoring. The target chamber is housed in a 7. 6 cm (ID) aluminum tube supported inside a <b>radial</b> beam <b>port.</b> This tube can be withdrawn by ∼ 1 m, allowing the target chamber to be positioned either close to or ∼ 1 m from the core. The aluminum tube is surrounded by water, which provides shielding and protects the target when not in use (at ∼ 1 m position). The target is ∼ 1 mg of 235 U, chemically plated on an aluminum planchett. The uranium is covered with 2. 7 mg·cm − 2 of aluminum. The aluminum covering stops most of the heavy fission fragments; the light fission fragments pass through the foil and are thermalized in a gaseous mixture of nitrogen and ethylene. The transport time of fission products from the target chamber to the detector position was measured to be 970 msec. Preliminary experiments indicate that the transport time can be reduced further. The gas jet system is being utilized for the development of fast, gas-phase chemistry for the separation of bromine from fission products...|$|R
40|$|The {{trajectory}} {{and reach}} of jets issuing from tangential control ports at {{the periphery of}} a vortex amplifier’s swirl chamber depend largely on design geometry, size and pressures applied. Excessive control port pressure causes these jets to extend too far {{across the face of}} the <b>radial</b> supply <b>ports,</b> to impact on the opposing supply port wall whereupon, they bifurcate to create back diffusion of control port flow along the supply port channels. Flow through vortex amplifier geometry is simulated using a baseline Reynolds stress turbulence model with CFX automatic wall treatment. Anisotropic stress and vortex stretching in the swirl chamber and outlet have not prevented convergence (based on normalised vortex amplifier residuals). Known flow structures are reproduced. This paper is focussed on simulation close to pressures needed for bifurcation. Just before the point on an operating characteristic at which bifurcated tangential flow appears, the recirculation zone crossing most of the radial supply stretches to intermittently cut off the radial flow. The steady state results indicate asymmetry between the four ports, as smoke visualisation tests also imply. The transient results are sufficient to demonstrate time-dependent structures and suggest periodicity of flow structures. The model can be used to inform design and operability studies. Moreover, a curious near-wall structure of spinning flow not previously reported has been predicted close to the axis and hugging the swirl chamber wall opposite the outlet, at radii within the forced part of the Rankine vortex...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a set of}} experiments in a physical model study to explore plume transport and recirculation potential {{for a range of}} generic Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plant designs and ambient conditions. Tests were conducted in a thermally-stratified 12 m x 18 m x 0. 6 m basin, at an undistorted length scale ratio of 1 : 300, which allowed the upper 180 m of the ocean to be studied. Conditions which have been tested include a range of plant sizes (nominally 200 MWe - 600 MWe); a range of discharge configurations (mixed vs. non-mixed evaporator and condenser flows, multiple vs. <b>radial</b> slot discharge <b>port(s),</b> variation of discharge-intake separation and variation of discharge angle); and a range of ambient current speeds (0. 15 - 1. 0 m/s), and density profiles (surface mixed layers of 31 to 64 m). The tests described herein complement those reported previously (Adams et al., 1979) for a stagnant-ambient environment. Measurements included temperature, dye concentration and visual observations from still and motion pictures. Results derived from these measurements are presented in tables and graphs in prototype dimensions for direct use by OTEC designers. Many of the results are also analyzed and presented in non-dimensional terms to extend their generality. No significant recirculation was observed for any tests with a discharge directed with a vertical (downward) component. For tests with a horizontal discharge, recirculation was observed to be a complex function of a number of parameters. For sufficiently shallow discharge submergence, low to moderate current speeds, and with plants employing a radial slot discharge, recirculation could result from dynamic pressures caused by the proximity of the free surface - despite the negative plume buoyancy. This mode was labelled "confinement-induced" recirculation and led to measurements of direct recirculation ranging from 25 % to 40 %. For certain combinations of ambient current speed and generally positive plume buoyancy (resultIng from deeper discharge submergence), the plume was observed to billow upward resulting in "current-induced" recirculation. This was observed for both radial slot and multiple port discharge configurations although somewhat greater recirculation was observed with the former configuration. Measured recirculation for current-induced recirculation fell in the range 0 to 10 % with a peak occurring at intermediate current speeds of about 0. 5 m/s. Experiments with a mixed evaporator and condenser discharge showed less tendency for direct recirculation of either type than the separate (evaporator only) discharges, but the effects of recirculation, as measured by the drop in evaporator intake temDerature (below the ambient temperature {{at the level of the}} intake) were not very different. A simple mathematical model, based on the governing length scales, was successfully calibrated to the observed values of direct recirculation for the radial discharge case. Various measures of plume transport were summarized to help designers predict the impact of OTEC operation on the environment and to establish guidelines for spacing of multiple plants. Minimum near field dilutions were observed in the range between 5 and 10 indicating that the peak concentration of any chemicals contained in the discharge would be between 10 and 20 % of the discharge concentration. Near field horizontal and vertical dimensions of the plume wake were found to be correlated with a length scale derived from discharge kinematic momentum flux and ambient current speed. The rise and fall of the equilibrium plume elevation (above or below the discharge elevation) was found to be governed by a ratio of length scales based on the ambient density profile and the discharge kinematic momentum and buoyancy fluxes...|$|R
