5|$|In September 2010, Volvo Cars and Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, {{issued a}} report {{regarding}} {{the results of the}} first phase of the Volvo V70 Plug-in Hybrid demonstration program. Among other findings, before the trial drivers participating in the field testing were concerned about being a danger to pedestrians and cyclists due to the quietness of the electric-drive vehicle. After the test several of them change their opinion and said that this issue was less of a problem than expected. Nevertheless, some test drivers said they experienced incidents of not being noticed while others said they had taken extra care in their driving with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> issue.|$|E
5|$|An online {{petition}} {{was formed}} {{in response to the}} concerns raised about the planned mosque, calling on the Prime Minister to prevent the building of the mosque; the petition closed with over 250,000 signatures and was at the time the most signed petition on the site. Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for general control of development in their areas and are required to take into consideration the views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there is neither a current planning permission or application for a mosque, nor is one expected in the near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} modern Muslim {{scholars}} and Muslim intellectuals seem {{to conform to}} the idea of Jihad as fundamentally a peaceful religious endeavour of self-reformation and of defending and extending religion through civil means rather than chiefly a belligerent armed struggle, in accordance with Ghulam Ahmad's standpoint on the issue. Furthermore, some Islamic scholars have opined that Jesus has died (Ghulam Ahmad's assertion) or have expressed their own confusion on this matter, though the majority orthodox position of most Muslims with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> issue has not changed.|$|E
25|$|Blockbuster offered several online movie rental plans. In {{some cities}} {{customers}} could add games to their movie rental queue {{as if they}} were included in their plan, but game rentals resulted in a separate additional fee which was not displayed or charged {{until the end of the}} billing cycle. Until July 26, 2007, Blockbuster offered and advertised unlimited free in-store exchanges of online rentals with all plans. Since then there were several changes back and forth with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> policy; as of March 2010 customers were allowed a limited number of in-store exchanges.|$|E

25|$|In 1838, Menefee and John J. Crittenden {{served as}} seconds for fellow Kentucky {{representative}} William J. Graves in a duel in which Graves killed Maine representative Jonathan Cilley. The House censured Graves over the incident, and the reputations of both Crittenden and Menefee were tarnished by their involvement. Shortly thereafter, the House passed anti-dueling legislation. Menefee's longest {{speech in the}} House was with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> law, and was delivered in three parts on April 23, 28, and 30, 1838.

25|$|Nero and Octavia {{were married}} on June 9, 53. Claudius later repented of marrying Agrippina and {{adopting}} Nero, began to favor Britannicus, and started preparing {{him for the}} throne. His actions allegedly gave Agrippina a motive to eliminate Claudius. The ancient sources say she poisoned Claudius on October 13, 54 with a plate of deadly mushrooms at a banquet, thus enabling Nero to quickly take the throne as emperor. Accounts vary wildly with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> private incident and according to more modern sources, it is possible (but exceedingly convenient) that Claudius died of natural causes; Claudius was 63 years old.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the central {{ownership}} of the teams, all players are paid by the league. This is to ensure that no team receives an unfair advantage over any other with regards to financial success. The payscale has set a number of tiers which group players of similar experience levels, with all players in the same tier receiving the same pay. The ABL has considered the possibility of having one or two marquee players paid above the standard scale, though no final decision has been made with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this.</b> One concern about high rates of pay expressed by the ABF was that it was a contributing factor, if not the main factor, in the failure of the previous Australian Baseball League. ABF management has also expressed the concern that if this league were to fail, there may never be another opportunity for professional baseball in Australia.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} avian species use nasal salt glands, {{alongside}} their kidneys, to control hypertonicity {{in their blood}} plasma. However, the common ostrich shows no nasal glandular function in <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> homeostatic process. Even {{in a state of}} dehydration, which increases the osmolality of the blood, nasal salt glands show no sizeable contribution of salt elimination. Also, the overall mass of the glands was less than that of the duck’s nasal gland. The common ostrich, having a heavier body weight, should have larger, heavier nasal glands to more effectively excrete salt from a larger volume of blood, {{but this is not the}} case. These unequal proportions contribute to the assumption that the common ostrich’s nasal glands do not play any role in salt excretion. The nasal glands may be the result of an ancestral trait, which is no longer needed by the common ostrich, but has not been bred out of their gene pool.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Soul snatchers: the {{mechanics}} of cults, Jean-Marie Abgrall describes how Altered States Of Consciousness (ASCs) are used in many cults to make the initiate more susceptible to the group will and world view. He cites research by Barmark and Gautnitz which showed {{the similarities between the}} states obtained by Transcendental Meditation and ASCs. In this way, not only does the subject become more reliant on the ASC, but it allows for a weakening of criticism of the cult and increase in faith therein. Abgrall goes on to note that the use of mantras {{is one of the most}} widespread techniques in cults, noting in TM this mantra is produced mentally. He says that a guru is usually central to a cult and that its success will rely on how effective that guru is. Among the common characteristics of a guru he notes paraphrenia, a mental illness that completely cuts the individual from reality. In <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> he notes for example, that the Maharishi recommended the TM-Sidhi program including 'yogic flying' as a way to reduce crime.|$|E
25|$|Omniscience is the {{capacity}} to know everything that {{there is to know}} (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level predeterminism such as hard theological determinism or predestination – that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> cannot be their own, {{as is the case with}} libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an incompatible-properties argument for the existence of God, known as the argument from free will, and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of omnipotence with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).|$|E

25|$|Justice Chan {{relied on}} a United Kingdom case, Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council (1976), to {{ascertain}} the law with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> ground of judicial review. In this case, the House of Lords held that statutory provisions which are framed to include the word satisfaction may exclude judicial review on matters of pure judgment by the decision-maker, but judicial review will not be excluded in all cases. Lord Wilberforce held that when the judgment {{is dependent on the}} existence of relevant facts, the court has to ascertain if the facts truly exist and if they have been properly taken into account, although the evaluation of the facts is for the decision-maker alone. If these requirements are not met, an aggrieved person is entitled to challenge the decision, and the court can intervene {{on the grounds that the}} decision-maker acted outside its powers, outside the purpose of the legislation empowering it, unfairly, or upon an incorrect basis of fact. Lord Diplock mentioned it was also necessary to consider if the decision-maker had taken into consideration only matters which he ought to have considered.|$|E

500|$|A {{prolific}} goalscorer, Messi {{is known}} for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and precise passing, and is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker, though his ability on penalties has somewhat deteriorated in recent seasons. His pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or {{the right side of the}} pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest of all time, with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, [...] "The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control." [...] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E

Many German field commanders were generous in their praise of Patton's leadership following the war, {{and many of its}} highest commanders also held his abilities in high regard. Erwin Rommel credited Patton with executing [...] "the most astonishing achievement in mobile warfare". Generaloberst Alfred Jodl, {{chief of staff of the}} German Army, stated that Patton [...] "was the American Guderian. He was very bold and preferred large movements. He took big risks and won big successes." [...] Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring noted that [...] "Patton had developed tank warfare into an art, and understood how to handle tanks brilliantly in the field. I feel compelled, therefore, to compare him with Generalfeldmarschall Rommel, who likewise had mastered the art of tank warfare. Both of them had a kind of second sight in <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> type of warfare." [...] Referring to the escape of the Afrika Korps after the Battle of El Alamein, Fritz Bayerlein opined that [...] "I do not think that General Patton would let us get away so easily."
