5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system.

5|$|In September 1944, Soviet troops {{advanced}} into Yugoslavia {{and forced}} the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia to <b>rescue</b> <b>them</b> from being cut off. By this point, the Communist-led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern Serbia, the Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of {{the capital city of}} Belgrade on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945. Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions, although Finland was forced to fight their former allies.|$|E
