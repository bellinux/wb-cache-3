40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{training}} <b>relaxation</b> <b>labeling</b> <b>processes,</b> a popular class of parallel iterative procedures widely employed in pattern recognition and computer vision. The approach discussed here is based on a theory of consistency developed by Hummel and Zucker, and contrasts with a recently introduced learning strategy which can be regarded as heteroassociative, i. e., what is actually learned is the association between patterns rather than the patterns themselves. The proposed learning model is instead autoassociative and involves making a set of training patterns consistent, in the sense rigorously defined by Hummel and Zucker; this implies that they become local attractors of the <b>relaxation</b> <b>labeling</b> dynamical system. The learning problem is formulated in terms of solving a system of linear inequalities, and a straightforward iterative algorithm is presented to accomplish this.

40|$|Our work in image {{similarity}} retrieval by <b>relaxation</b> <b>labeling</b> <b>processes</b> [1] required adding local constraints {{to obtain}} an initial set of compatible objects and labels on pairs of images to ensure labeling consistency at convergence. This approach suffers from the problem of over-specified constraints that leads to potentially invaluable information being prematurely removed. To address this problem, we introduce {{the idea of a}} Match-all label for objects that failed these constraints. It serves to give them a defined labeling probability as well as allowing them participate in global correspondences through the compatibility model. We show that this enhanced formulation still meets the conditions for a theorem on labeling consistency in Hummel and Zucker [2] to be satisfied.

40|$|<b>Relaxation</b> <b>labeling</b> <b>processes</b> are a {{class of}} {{mechanisms}} that {{solve the problem of}} assigning labels to objects {{in a manner that is}} consistent with respect to some domain-specific constraints. We reformulate this using the model of a team of learning automata interacting with an environment or a high-level critic that gives noisy responses as to the consistency of a tentative labeling selected by the automata. This results in an iterative linear algorithm that is itself probabilistic. Using an explicit definition of consistency we give a complete analysis of this probabilistic relaxation process using weak convergence results for stochastic algorithms. Our model can accommodate a range of uncertainties in the compatibility functions. We prove a local convergence result and show that the point of convergence depends both on the initial labeling and the constraints. The algorithm is implementable in a highly parallel fashion...|$|R
