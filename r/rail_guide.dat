50|$|The rifle's {{operation}} during firing and reloading {{is identical}} {{to that of the}} AKM. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle. The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and bolt carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier <b>rail</b> <b>guide,</b> rotates the bolt approximately 35° and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. The moving assembly has about 5.5 mm of free travel which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence, allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken. Like previous Kalashnikov-pattern rifles, the AK-74 does not have a gas valve; excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder. Since the Kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation, the 5.45×39mm AK-74 bolt has a larger extractor claw than the 7.62×39mm AKM for increased extraction reliability. Other minor modifications were made to the bolt and carrier assembly.|$|E
50|$|To fire, the {{operator}} inserts a loaded magazine, pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the trigger. In semi-automatic, the firearm fires only once, requiring the trigger {{to be released}} and depressed again for the next shot. In full-automatic, the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{a mathematical model}} of the beam adapted for use in general-purpose software systems to analyze dynamic characteristics. The elastic properties of the beam tension, bending and torsion are taken into account. Such a model significantly expands the functional capabilities of the complexes. The mathematical model of the beam designed for the finite element method is taken as a basis. Then its adaptation is carried out {{taking into account the}} beam joint to the arbitrary points of a rigid solid, thereby having a model suitable to analyze objects with lumped parameters. Beam parameters are the material parameters, the geometric characteristics, and the coordinates of joint points to the solids. The paper describes in detail the algorithm of computations performed at each step of numerical integration of the systems of ordinary differential equations, and presents an equivalent diagram of the mathematical model of the beam. Mathematical models of elastic rail guides, cylindrical and prismatic, derived from the mathematical model of the beam are more functional compared to the models based on the kinematic equations. The prismatic <b>rail</b> <b>guide</b> (V-guide), unlike the beam, does not counteract the translational motion of solids along it, i. e. only works in torsion and bending, and a deforming part of the <b>rail</b> <b>guide</b> length is variable. The cylindrical <b>rail</b> <b>guide</b> works in bending only. These differences can be easily implemented by modifying the equations of the mathematical model of the beam. Using these models allows us to connect solids by two or more rail guides, and it does not lead to the degeneration of the Jacobi matrix (unlike models based on kinematic equations). The models are implemented in PA 8 and PA 9 software and methodological support complexes for analysis of dynamic objects developed at the Department of CAD in Bauman MSTU. </p...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{shows an}} {{innovative}} multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which {{is able to}} easily and quickly change its configuration. In order to satisfy this feature, the principal structure is made of an universal plate, combined with a circular ring, to create a <b>rail</b> <b>guide</b> able to host the arms, in a variable number from 3 to 8, and the legs. The arms are adjustable and contain all the avionic and motor drivers to connect the main structure with each electric motor. The unique arm design, defined as all-in-one, allows classical single rotor configurations, double rotor configurations and amphibious configurations including inflatable elements positioned {{at the bottom of}} the arms. The proposed multi-rotor system is inexpensive because of the few universal pieces needed to compose the platform which allows the creation of a kit. This modular kit allows to have a modular drone with different configurations. Such configurations are distinguished among them for the number of arms, number of legs, number of rotors and motors, and landing capability. Another innovation feature is the introduction of the 3 D printing technology to produce all the structural elements. In this manner, all the pieces are designed to be produced via the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology using desktop 3 D printers. Therefore, an universal, dynamic and economic multi-rotor UAV has been developed...|$|E

40|$|A new {{diaphragm}} and dual <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> {{system was}} designed {{for use in a}} crash cushion for high-speed race tracks. These structural components were designed to provide sufficient lateral support to redirect impacting vehicles and compress the energy-absorbing elements of the crash cushion. The primary design criteria stated that the diaphragm/guide rail system should be capable of withstanding a 100 -kip lateral impact load. The <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> was to be configured in order to not require replacement after a design impact event. Initial design and modeling resulted in two candidates for <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> sections which were evaluated during physical testing. The better of the two candidates was then paired with a prototype diaphragm and subjected to dynamic testing. The first prototype was found to develop a maximum resistive force of 175 kips, and the diaphragm <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> absorbed a total of 822 kip-in. of energy but sustained significant <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> damage. An extensive computer modeling effort was initiated to optimize both the diaphragm and the <b>guide</b> <b>rails.</b> The structural capacity of the optimized prototype diaphragm and <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> system was verified through a dynamic bogie test. The second prototype weighed 55 lbs less, developed a maximum resistive force of 212 kips, and absorbed a total of 929 kip-in. of energy, resulting in a <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> permanent deflection of 1 / 16 in. Meeting all design requirements, the second prototype is recommended for use in the continued development of the crash cushion for high-speed race track applications. Adviser: John D. Rei...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{straightening}} of {{the elevator}} <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> was analyzed using the load-deflection pressure straightening model.

The variation of the <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> bending formation in the contiguous steps of the multi-step straightening process was studied and the relationship of these steps was derived. After the straightening stroke of the first step is calculated, the straightening strokes of the steps afterwards will be obtained by using the relationship and the bending formation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a noncontact sliding table design and measurements of its performance via ultrasonic levitation. A slider placed atop two vibrating <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> is levitated by an acoustic radiation force emitted from the rails. A flexural traveling wave propagating along the <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> allows noncontact transportation of the slider. Permitting a transport mechanism that reduces abrasion and dust generation with an inexpensive and simple structure. The {{profile of the}} sliding table was designed using the finite-element analysis (FEA) for high levitation and transportation efficiency. The prototype sliding table was made of alumina ceramic (Al 2 O 3) to increase machining accuracy and rigidity using a structure composed {{of a pair of}} <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> with a triangular cross section and piezoelectric transducers. Two types of transducers were used: bolt-clamped Langevin transducers and bimorph transducers. A 40 -mm long slider was designed to fit atop the two <b>rail</b> <b>guides.</b> Flexural standing waves and torsional standing waves were observed along the <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> at resonance, and the levitation of the slider was obtained using the flexural mode even while the levitation distance was less than 10 pm. The levitation distance of the slider was measured while increasing the slider&# 039;s weight. The levitation pressure, rigidity, and vertical displacement amplitude of the levitating slider thus were measured to be 6. 7 kN/m(2), 3. 0 kN/mu m/m(2), and less than 1 mu m, respectively. Noncontact transport of the slider was achieved using phased drive of the two transducers {{at either end of the}} vibrating <b>guide</b> <b>rail.</b> By controlling the phase difference, the slider transportation direction could be switched, and a maximum thrust of 13 mN was obtaine...|$|R

The second generation, in the 1990s and 2000s, feature a large steel impact head that engages the frame or bumper of the vehicle. The impact head is driven back along the <b>guide</b> <b>rail,</b> dissipating the vehicle's kinetic energy by bending or tearing the steel in the <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> sections.
