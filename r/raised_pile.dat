50|$|A rangkiang is a {{structure}} built over a <b>raised</b> <b>pile</b> foundation, an Austronesian legacy {{that can be}} found anywhere else in Indonesia. It has a distinguished roof shape known as gonjong ("spired") roofs, similar to a Minangkabau traditional house, the rumah gadang. The gonjong roof symbolically identifies it with buffalo horns. Similar to the rumah gadang, the roof of a rangkiang is traditionally a thatched roof made of palm fibre (ijuk), and it is also similarly decorated. The only opening to a rangkiang is a small rectangular hatch high up in the gable end, into which the harvested rice is placed. A ladder is required to reach this hatch.|$|E
50|$|An effigy mound is a <b>raised</b> <b>pile</b> {{of earth}} {{built in the}} shape of a stylized animal, symbol, human, or other figure and {{generally}} containing one or more human burials. Effigy mounds were primarily built during the Late Woodland Period (350-1300 CE (current era)). Conical and linear mounds, the predecessors of effigy mounds may date from as far back as 700 BCE (before the current era). They remain places First Peoples frequent to visit and speak with ancestors, to put down tobacco and to give thanks. These sites are primarily visited by Hochungra (pl. of Hochunk) people whose ancestors likely built the great majority of them, though they are also visited by people from other original indigenous nations such as Anishinaabe (Ojibwe), Kikapu, Oneida, Menominii who reside in Wisconsin and surrounding areas. There also remains the possibility that a greater diversity of First Peoples such as ancestors of those named nations may have contributed to building some percentage of the mounds. That is to say that ancestral Hochunk likely popularized the form and other groups may have adopted the practice of building effigy mounds from having observed the Hochunk ancestors methods and aesthetics surrounding their construction.|$|E
40|$|When {{a certain}} effect in {{textiles}} {{can be achieved}} on two different weaving apparatuses, it is common practice to assume the simpler method to be the more primitive and thus antecedent to the more advanced technique. This paper will discuss two unique Japanese weaving methods that testify {{to the fact that}} simple techniques do not always predate their more sophisticated counterparts. In these examples, the simpler weaving methods were actually created in imitation of preexisting textiles from other regions that had been woven on more complex looms. The first of these examples is the Japanese method for voided velvet; the other is a double cloth woven on the small island of Hachijo. Thanks to its location {{at the end of the}} Silk Road, the island nation of Japan was for centuries a cultural reservoir for numerous treasures imported from its Asian neighbors and far-off continents. Chinese and Korean artisans began immigrating to Japan in around the fifth century, bringing with them advanced technology from their respective cultures. At the same time, native Japanese artisans invented weaving methods to imitate the foreign textiles they saw, often without any knowledge of the original techniques they were trying to emulate. Over Japan 2 ̆ 7 s long history, there have been two periods when the foreign influence on textile culture was especially strong. The first of these periods was during the 7 th and 8 th centuries, when large quantities of primarily Chinese textiles were imported into Japan. Some of these still exist today in the Shoso-in Repository in the ancient capital of Nara. The other wave of foreign textiles into Japan took place between the 15 th and 18 th centuries, coming from such far reaches as Yuan- and Ming-dynasty China, India, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Among the treasures imported during these centuries were numerous patterned weaves that had been created in far off lands using highly advanced techniques. One of precious textiles in the later group was Chinese velvet. Japanese weavers had long puzzled as to how to make looped pile on the surface of silk fabrics, a secret that the Chinese had guarded for centuries. The way in which this technique eventually arrived in Japan is described in an Edo-period book, which tells that a metal rod was accidentally left in the loop of a velvet textile imported into Japan around 1650. With this fortuitous discovery, Japanese weavers finally understood that the <b>raised</b> <b>pile</b> loops were formed with wire rods...|$|E

The men, too full of passion to fear, or too full of pride to allow their fears to be seen, were gathering in arms, or hurrying to and fro with intelligence, or making hasty arrangements to remove their wives and children from the scenes of cruel suffering which were to ensue. They stationed watchmen on the hills to give warning of the approach of the enemy.

Mothers bore their children, men their gold and silver, and sisters aided their sick or feeble brothers to sustain the toil and terror of the flight.|$|R

During the winter, workers used jet engines to thaw and dig out the permafrost or blasted it with dynamite to get access to the underlying kimberlite. The entire mine had to be covered at night to prevent the machinery from freezing.|$|R

Velvet is woven as {{supplemental}} warp loops on the foundation and the loops are usually later cut, resulting in the <b>raised</b> surface <b>pile</b> [22] page 80. It has a complex weaving structure and is woven by highly skilled weavers [23]. High quality velvets indicate that the culture has a high level of textile manufacture [24]. Weave structure, dyes and metal from metal threads were analyzed and compared from fifteen Persian velvets and six Indian velvets in MMA collections. Dyes were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with photo diode array detector. Analysis of metal of the metal-wrapped threads was performed using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. This was done in order to investigate whether the velvets from the two cultures could be attributed with certainty using these results along with historical and iconographical studies. In this paper, a part of such analysis of dyes and metal of metal threads is reported. The study involving more integrated results from weave structure and historical and iconographical studies is forthcoming.|$|R
