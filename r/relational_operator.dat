The map-reduce framework offers a simple model to parallelize custom code, but it does not integrate well with relational databases. Likewise, the literature on optimizing queries in relational databases has largely ignored user-defined functions (UDFs). In this paper, we discuss annotations for user-defined functions that facilitate optimizations that both consider <b>relational</b> <b>operators</b> and UDFs. We believe this to be the superior approach compared to just linking map-reduce evaluation to a relational database because it enables a broader range of optimizations. In this paper we focus on optimizations that enable the parallel execution of <b>relational</b> <b>operators</b> and UDFs for a number of typical patterns.

5000|$|If we want {{to combine}} tuples from two {{relations}} where the combination condition is not simply the equality of shared attributes then it is convenient {{to have a more}} general form of join operator, which is the θ-join (or theta-join). The θ-join is a binary operator that is written as [...] or [...] where a and b are attribute names, θ is a binary <b>relational</b> <b>operator</b> in the set {<, ≤, =, >, ≥}, v is a value constant, and R and S are relations. The result of this operation consists of all combinations of tuples in R and S that satisfy θ. The result of the θ-join is defined only if the headers of S and R are disjoint, that is, do not contain a common attribute.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Predicates {{appear in}} both the {{specification}} and implementation of a program. One approach to software testing, referred to as predicate testing, is to require certain types of tests for a predicate. In this paper, three fault-based testing criteria are defined for compound predicates, which are predicates {{with one or more}} AND/OR operators. BQR (boolean operator) testing requires a set of tests to guarantee the detection of (single or multiple) boolean operator faults, including incorrect AND/OR operators and missing/extra NOT operators. BRO (boolean and <b>relational</b> <b>operator)</b> testing requires a set of tests to guarantee the detection of boolean operator faults and <b>relational</b> <b>operator</b> faults (i. e., incorrect relational operators). BRE (boolean and relational expression) testing requires a set of tests to guarantee the detection of boolean operator faults, <b>relational</b> <b>operator</b> faults, and a type of fault involving arithmetical expressions. It is shown that for a compound predicate with n, n z 0, AND/OR operators, at most n + 2 constraints are needed for BOR testing and at most 2 * n + 3 constraints for BRO or BRE testing, where each constraint specifies a restriction on the value of each boolean variable or relational expression in the predicate. Algorithms for generating a minimum set of constraints for BOR, BRO, and BRE testing of a compound predicate are given, and the feasibility problem for the generated constraints is discussed. For boolean expressions that contain multiple occurrences of some boolean variables, how to combine BOR testing with the meaningful impact strategy developed by Weyuker, Goradia, and Singh [21] is briefly described.

40|$|A {{negative}} database is {{a representation}} of all elements not contained in a given database. A negative database can enhance the privacy of sensitive information without resorting to encryption. This {{can be useful in}} settings where encryption is too expensive, e. g., some sensor networks, or for applications where searches or other operations on stored data are desired. The original negative database framework supported only authentication queries and operations for modifying data, such as insert and delete. This paper extends that work by defining a set of relational operators for negative representations. For each <b>relational</b> <b>operator,</b> the corresponding negative operator is defined such that the result of the negative operator applied to a negative representation is equivalent to the positive version applied to the positive representation. Algorithms for each <b>relational</b> <b>operator</b> are described and compared to its positive counterpart.

40|$|In this demonstration, {{we present}} a {{prototype}} system, Predator-Miner, which extends Predator with an relationallike association rule mining operator to support data mining operations. Predator-Miner allows a user to combine association rule mining queries with SQL queries. This approach towards tight integration differs from existing techniques of using user-defined functions (UDFs), stored procedures, or re-expressing a mining query as several SQL queries in two aspects. First, by encapsulating the task of association rule mining in a <b>relational</b> <b>operator,</b> we allow association rule mining to be considered {{as part of the}} query plan, on which query optimization can be performed on the mining query holistically. Second, by integrating it as a <b>relational</b> <b>operator,</b> we can leverage on the mature field of relational database technology. We extend Predator to support a variant of DMQL, and allow SQL and DMQL to be intermixed in a query. We also demonstrate a cost-based mining query optimization framework. 1...|$|E
