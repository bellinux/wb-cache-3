In addition to this, the regularisation program that accompanied the legal reform – and all other regularisations implemented since – accepted the certificate of empadronamiento as a proof of the length of residence in Spain, which especially encouraged the registration of undocumented migrants. Last but not least, most municipalities carried out campaigns to promote the empadronamiento of foreign residents in those early years, since the budget they receive from the central government depends precisely on their total population as counted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Padrón.|$|R

Palivizumab is a biological pharmaceutical used as passive prophylaxis against severe infection with {{respiratory syncytial virus}} in high-risk children. Objective: To assess <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> of palivizumab <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Danish National Prescription Registry (DNPR) and to examine if palivizumab reimbursement data obtained from the Danish Health and Medicines Authority {{could serve as a}} supplement to data from the DNPR. Methods: Registration of palivizumab exposure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DNPR between 1999 and 2010 was compared to two external data sources: registration of palivizumab exposure in medical records, and palivizumab reimbursement data. Results: During the study period, 182 children with palivizumab exposure were registered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DNPR. A total of 207 children were registered for palivizumab reimbursement. The sensitivity of palivizumab <b>registration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DNPR was 26 % (20 %– 34 %), and the specificity of no palivizumab <b>registration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DNPR was 97 % (94 %– 99 %), with data from the medical record as the reference. Palivizumab <b>registration</b> sensitivity <b>in</b> reimbursement data was 29 % (22 %– 36 %), and the specificity of no palivizumab <b>registration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DNPR was 97 % (94 %– 99 %), with data from the medical record as the reference. Conclusion: Exposure to palivizumab was underestimated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DNPR. Reimbursement data are a readily accessible data supplement, which only slightly increased the sensitivity of palivizumab <b>registration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DNPR. Our findings underline the need to improve DNPR information concerning drugs administered in hospitals.
