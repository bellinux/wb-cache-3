5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin can behave aggressively. Males fight for rank {{and access to}} females. During mating season, males compete vigorously with each other through displays of toughness and size, {{with a series of}} acts, such as head-butting. They display aggression towards sharks and smaller dolphin species. At least one population, off Scotland, has practiced infanticide, and also has attacked and killed harbour porpoises. University of Aberdeen <b>researchers</b> <b>say</b> the dolphins do not eat their victims, but are simply competing for food. However, Dr. Read of Duke University, a porpoise expert researching similar cases of porpoise killings that had occurred in Virginia in 1996 and 1997, holds a different view. He states dolphins and porpoises feed on different types of fish, thus food competition is an unlikely cause of the killings. Similar behaviour has been observed in Ireland. In the first half of July, 2014, four attacks with three Porpoise fatalities were observed and caught on video by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre in the Cardigan Bay.|$|E
5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the <b>researchers</b> <b>say</b> is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic stem cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent stem cells far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E

25|$|Shrout’s study {{concluded}} that women who experienced negative appraisals, like self-blame and causal attribution, led to emotional distress and increased health-compromising behavior (Shrout, 2017). Studies show that men typically only experience distress from a physical or sexual affair, while women are more bothered by emotional or relational affairs. However, women are more affected than men. This is due perception (Shrout, 2017). Women perceive relationships {{as more of a}} priority and are usually more emotionally attached (Palermo, 2015). Following a study of coping differences between genders, Binghamton University and University College London <b>researchers</b> <b>say</b> it’s evolutionary and we can blame our ancestors for this.|$|E

25|$|Present {{vaccination}} {{strategies for}} SIV {{control and prevention}} in swine farms typically {{include the use of}} one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses. The United States Department of Agriculture <b>researchers</b> <b>say</b> while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.|$|E
25|$|Stimulation from {{anal sex}} can {{additionally}} {{be affected by}} popular perception or portrayals of the activity, such as erotica or pornography. In pornography, anal sex is commonly portrayed as a desirable, painless routine that does not require personal lubricant; this can result in couples performing anal sex without care, and men and women believing that it is unusual for women, as receptive partners, to find discomfort or pain instead of pleasure from the activity. By contrast, each person's sphincter muscles react to penetration differently, the anal sphincters have tissues that {{are more prone to}} tearing, and the anus and rectum do not provide lubrication for sexual penetration like the vagina does. <b>Researchers</b> <b>say</b> adequate application of a personal lubricant, relaxation, and communication between sexual partners are crucial to avoid pain or damage to the anus or rectum. Additionally, ensuring that the anal area is clean and the bowel is empty, for both aesthetics and practicality, may be desired by participants.|$|E

25|$|The Dhakeshwari {{temple was}} built in the 12th century by Ballal Sen, a king of the Sena dynasty, and many say the city was named after this temple. The current {{architectural}} style of the temple cannot be dated to that period because of the numerous repairs, renovations and rebuilding which have taken place over time. It is considered an essential part of Dhaka's cultural heritage. Many <b>researchers</b> <b>say</b> that the temple {{is also one of the}} Shakti Peethas, where the jewel from the crown of the Goddess Sati had fallen. Although there is not enough historical context to establish this as a fact, researchers were directed to this site while trying to locate the particular Shakti Peetha. Since ages, the temple has been held in great importance. The original 800-year-old statue was taken to Kumartuli, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. There remains the replica of original idol in Dhaka. The temple was further damaged during the Muslim mob attacks of 1989–90.|$|E

A {{study published in the}} British Medical Journal stated that Wii players use more energy than they do playing sedentary computer games. While this energy increase may be beneficial to weight management, it was not an adequate replacement for regular exercise. A case study published in the American Physical Therapy Association's journal, Physical Therapy, focused on use of the Wii for rehabilitation in a teenager with cerebral palsy. It {{is believed to be the}} first published research demonstrating physical-therapy benefits from use of the gaming system. <b>Researchers</b> <b>say</b> the system complements traditional techniques through use of simultaneous gaming rehabilitation efforts. In May 2010 the American Heart Association (AHA) endorsed the Wii to encourage sedentary people to take the first step toward fitness. The AHA heart icon covers the console and two of its more-active games, Wii Fit Plus and Wii Sports Resort.|$|E

30|$|Feelings about {{activities}} include {{positive and negative}} feelings (Bornholt 2002 b; Bornholt et al. 2005; Russell 1980).

The interviewer reads the 16 words slowly and the child ticks words (or not) to indicate feelings (e.g., ‘alright’[*], ‘pleased’[*], ‘worried’).

Responses (coded 0 / 1) form reliable indicators (alpha about 0.70, range 0.62 to 0.87) of positive feelings and related-yet-discrete negative feelings (guilt, worry, disgust and anger) about each activity.
