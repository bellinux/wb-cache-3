The cast specimen were machined to standard testing dimensions. The tensile test {{was carried out}} using universal testing machine while <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>B</b> scale testing machine (HRB) {{was used for the}} hardness test.

This was compared with specimen from aluminium pot scraps with ultimate tensile strength of 172 N/mm 2 and 161 N/mm 2 for die and sand cast specimens respectively. The hardness test results show that specimens from aluminium piston were harder than the specimen from the aluminium pot with 52 and 51. 0 HRB compared with 26. 7 and 23. 2 HRB for die and sand casting specimens respectively.

The geometric calibration of Rockwell diamond indenters has been a key issue for <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> standardization. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a microform calibration system based on a stylus instrument for the geometric calibration of Rockwell diamond indenters. Using that system, a NIST master standard Rockwell diamond indenter No. 3581 was established in 1995, by which approximately 300 standard reference material (SRM) <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> blocks of HRC scale were calibrated for implementation of the HRC scale in the United States. This indenter has been re-calibrated in 1997, 2005 and 2007. The calibration results have shown both high stability for the NIST standard Rockwell diamond indenter and high reproducibility for the NIST microform calibration system. After more than fifteen years of service, the stylus instrument was recently replaced by a new one. In order to test the measurement agreement between the two stylus instruments, another NIST master Rockwell diamond indenter No. 101 has been recently calibrated by the new instrument and the calibration result shows good agreement with the previous results...|$|R
