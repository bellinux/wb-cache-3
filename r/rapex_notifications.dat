40|$|The European Commission {{launched}} the 18 -month project "Tattoos and Permanent Make-up" {{with the aim}} of collecting data about the use, the ingredients, the EU market and possible health problems associated to tattoo and permanent make-up (PMU) inks. The report on work package 1 (2015, Piccinini P. et al.) is available at [URL] The present report is the outcome of the work package 2 which aims to describe the status of tattoo and PMU practices like tattoo prevalence in the population, including the removal processes, details on service providers and ink manufacturers, tattoo and PMU market, inks' chemical composition, <b>RAPEX</b> <b>notifications</b> and national market surveillance. The information was gathered through questionnaires sent to 32 national authorities (all EU MS and EFTA countries), plus OECD Secretariat, 38 ink manufacturers/distributors/private labels and 23 tattooists/PMU professionals' associations. Replies were collected from 24 EU/EFTA national authorities, 4 non-EU/EFTA countries, 7 ink manufacturers/ distributors/private labels and 10 associations. In addition, we reviewed thoroughly data available from other sources like scientific literature, RAPEX (Rapid Alert System for dangerous non-food products) notifications and national surveillance reports, as of May 2015. The main findings show that: Tattoo and PMU inks are complex chemical mixtures containing several ingredients. The main ingredients are the colorants, pigments in particular; more than 100 of them have been identified in tattoo and PMU inks. These pigments are not produced specifically for such application and a risk assessment taking into account their injection and permanence into the human body is not carried out. An additional identified risk is the presence of impurities; in fact tattoo and PMU inks' purity is on average around 70 - 90 %. Azo pigments, group to which most of the organic colorants in use belong, are proved to release potentially carcinogenic aromatic amines when exposed to solar, UV or laser irradiation. It is estimated that around 12 % of the whole European population, all ages comprised, are tattooed (estimation based on available data from 14 Member States) and more than 20 % in the United States. Higher tattoo prevalence was reported in young population, including adolescents. While traditionally men were more tattooed than women, figures show that this trend in Europe, Australia and North America is changing. Nowadays in a number of cases the tattoo prevalence in women is higher than in men, particularly in young generations. Most of the tattoo inks used in Europe are imported from the United States, while PMU inks are mostly produced in Europe. The European manufacturers are mainly based in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Spain. With regards to the tattoo artists performing the tattoos, the number of "non-professional tattooists" might represent up to 10 times the number of "registered/professionals" ones. Around 95 % of the 126 RAPEX alerts notified for tattoo/PMU during the last decade related to chemical risks: hazardous chemicals and/or impurities (such as carcinogenic aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, sensitizers, preservatives and heavy metals). The remaining 5 % concerned microbiological risks, which are mainly {{due to the lack of}} sterility of the inks before opening and from the use of tap water for their dilution. Two thirds of the <b>RAPEX</b> <b>notifications</b> pertain to products imported, with the highest percentages from the United States. JRC. I. 1 -Chemical Assessment and Testin...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years several {{communications}} to the Rapid Alarm System for non food products (RAPEX) were issued 1 concerning the presence of cyclohexanone in stink blasters (toys emitting characteristic smell after squeezing) and its possible impact on human health. The scope {{of the present study}} was to identify and quantify the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from this kind of toys and to evaluate possible health risks, in particular for children. Although the stink blasters are intended for outdoor use, a hypothetical indoor use (e. g. use by children in closed environments) has been considered relevant for exposure assessment studies. Specimens for testing were bought in a local market and are similar to the products mentioned in the <b>RAPEX</b> <b>notification.</b> The toys analyzed (following extraction with methanol) contain less than 0. 2 % by weight of cyclohexanone. Cyclohexanone was found in the sponge and the head of the toy (causing the characteristic smell, when squeezed) but also in the body. In addition to these preliminary experiments and in order to evaluate air exposure to cyclohexanone, the stink blasters were placed in the Indoortron facility, a walk-in type environmental chamber of 30 m 3 volume featuring automatic control of parameters such as temperature (T), relative humidity (RH) and air change rates (ach), and tested for emissions after squeezing several times under ¿real world setting¿ conditions (22 C, 50 % RH, 0. 5 ach). By this, the main compounds emitted were cyclohexanone and toluene with concentrations reaching values to 25 ug/m 3 and 32 ug/m 3 respectively. These concentrations are much lower than the indicative occupational exposure limit values of 40 mg/m 3 for cyclohexanone and 192 mg/m 3 for toluene 2. However, within the frame of this study it is not possible to evaluate possible health effects, which might be expected from a chronic exposure to the aforementioned chemicals at low doses.

5000|$|In Europe toys {{must meet}} the {{criteria}} set by the EC Toy Safety Directive (essentially that a toy be safe, which may be addressed by testing to European Standard EN71) {{in order for them}} to carry the CE mark. All European Union member states have transposed this directive into law - for example, the UK's Toy (Safety) Regulations 1995. [...] Trading Standards Officers in the UK, similarly to appropriate authorities in the other EU member states, have the power to immediately demand the withdrawal of a toy product from sale on safety grounds via the <b>RAPEX</b> recall <b>notification</b> system (used for all products subject to European safety legislation). [...] In Canada the government department Health Canada has the responsibility of ensuring product safety, just as the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) does in the United States. Australian and New Zealand toy safety standards (following the approximate model of the European Toy Safety Standard) have been adopted by the ISO as International Standard ISO 8124. Toy safety standards are continually updated and modified as the understanding of risks increases and new products are developed.|$|R
