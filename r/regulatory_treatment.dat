50|$|In the {{environment}} of convergent network, specific services with certain network technologies will receive different <b>regulatory</b> <b>treatments.</b> The 1996 Act created distinct regulatory categories for services that are provided by different network technologies. Besides the existing regulation framework for regulating telecommunications services and cable services in another title, the 1996 Act defines a category of services, “information services,” that distinguished from “telecommunications services” and was not subject to either telephone or cable regulation. “Information services” are consisted of the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications. For instance, voice and video services that are provided using Internet protocol technology may be classified as “information services” and therefore not subject to traditional voice or video regulation.|$|R

50|$|If {{issued by}} a bank holding company, {{they are treated}} as capital rather than {{liabilities}} under banking regulations, and may be treated as the highest quality capital (tier 1 capital) if they have certain characteristics. Since the amount of liabilities (such as deposits) that a banking institution may have is limited to some multiple of its capital, this <b>regulatory</b> <b>treatment</b> is highly favorable and is why the trust preferred structure is favored by bank holding companies.|$|E
50|$|Trust {{preferred}} securities {{are used}} by bank holding companies for their favorable tax, accounting, and <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>treatments.</b> Specifically, the subordinated debt securities are taxed like debt obligations by the IRS, so interest payments are deductible.

Barking dogs generate {{a range of}} concerns in the private home however that barking becomes a nuisance when it affects the public; that is, the incidence of nuisance transforms the ‘private dog’ into the ‘public dog’. A number of scientific and critical studies have been undertaken to understand the source and nature of why dogs bark (Buckland et al. 2014; Cross et al. 2009; Pongrácz et al. 2010; Yin and McCowan 2004). There have also {{been a number of}} studies to examine how barking might be monitored and addressed, hinting at a need to critically examine <b>regulatory</b> <b>treatments</b> of nuisance barking (Bragdon and Miller 1978; Flint et al. 2013; Raglus et al. 2015). Dog bark nuisance has been examined as it affects the broader fields of housing and common law (Huss 2005), however the regulation of barking dog nuisance has not been researched by scholars in any comprehensive way (Flint et al. 2014).|$|R

50|$|There are {{multiple}} and intense regulatory battles over triple-play services, as incumbent telcos and incumbent cable operators {{attempt to keep}} out new competitors; since both industries historically have been regulated monopolies, regulatory capture has long been as much a core competency for them as have been prices and terms of service. Cable providers want to compete with telcos for local voice service, but want to discourage telcos from competing with them for television service. Incumbent telcos want to deliver television service but want to block competition for voice service from cable operators. Both industries cloak their demands for favorable <b>regulatory</b> <b>treatment</b> in claims that their positions favor the public interests.|$|E
40|$|Postharvest {{endeavors to}} develop methyl bromide (MB) {{alternatives}} for fresh fruit commodities rest essentially on two basic requisites: (a) any chemical or non-chemical alternative treatment must be efficacious against a targeted quarantine pest resulting in 100 % mortality; and (b) the alternative <b>regulatory</b> <b>treatments</b> must not injure or reduce the postharvest quality of fresh commodities {{for sale and}} consumption. Thus, in principle, an acceptable MB alternative would be realized if the above requisites are met.

Here, we report results of some potential MB alternative treatments on selected fruit commodities. Postharvest methyl iodide (MI) fumigation and forced aeration investigations conducted in cooperation with entomologist James Leesch on lemon quality/phytotoxicity was continued using coastal lemons.

40|$|Global {{financial}} {{regulators are}} currently {{reflecting on the}} nature of the insurance business. Specifically, they are trying to classify insurance into traditional' and non-traditional' activities, and to distinguish them from non-insurance' activities. Subsequently, they will seek to apply different <b>regulatory</b> <b>treatments</b> to these categories to achieve better control of systemic risk in the global financial system. This means that one of the most important current questions in international finance is what is insurance and where does insurance end?' This paper aims to elaborate on the economics of insurance and its borders with general finance. It argues that the classification challenge by regulators partly stems from terminological confusion between insurance activities and more general financial activities. Insurance and finance both use the same terms - in particular the ubiquitous notion of risk - but attach fundamentally different meanings to them. With the proper terminology at hand and a clear distinction between insurance products, product management activities and balance sheet management activities, the limits of insurance can be re-established. Such delineation is essential to determine appropriate systemic risk regulation...|$|R

5000|$|A {{bad debt}} is a {{monetary}} amount owed to a creditor that {{is unlikely to}} be paid and, or which the creditor is not willing to take action to collect because of various reasons, often due to the debtor not having the money to pay, for example due to a company going into liquidation or insolvency. There are various technical definitions of what constitutes a bad debt, depending on accounting conventions, <b>regulatory</b> <b>treatment</b> and the institution provisioning.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of fresh commodity quality is of vital importance to enhance product sale and for successful competition {{in a global}} market. Furthermore, the imposition of <b>regulatory</b> quarantine <b>treatments</b> of fresh commodities for pest disinfestation cause injury to the commodities which must be minimized. It is, therefore, essential to develop efficacious quarantine treatments which do not adversely damage fresh commodity quality or increase decay in postharvest storage. Various approaches are been investigated for minimizing quarantine-induced phytotoxicity to fresh commodities. Manipulating the postharvest environment of citrus to enhance the natural resistance to stress by curing/conditioning has shown to lessen peel injury induced by <b>regulatory</b> cold <b>treatments</b> (Houck et al., 1990). Recently, conditioning of lemons at 15 EC for 3 days before methyl iodide fumigation lessened lemon peel injury. Conditioning was found to alter soluble sugars changes of the lemon peel which {{may be involved in}} moderating stress and protecting cellular membranes (Aung et al., 1998). Additional study is being conducted to evaluate the influence of fruit maturity and origin on treatment effectiveness in order to increase the reliability and general applicability of conditioning in lessening citrus phytotoxicity.

50|$|In {{order to}} address the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} mandated by the US Congress in 1975, the U.S. Department of Energy established in July 2000 a methodology for calculating the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy of electric vehicles on a well-to-wheel basis. The methodology considers the upstream efficiency of the processes involved in the two fuel cycles, including efficiency factors for petroleum refining and distribution, {{as well as the}} national average efficiency for electricity generation and transmission.The formula also includes a fuel efficiency incentive factor of 1/0.15 to benefit electric vehicles. This reward factor is intended provide an incentive for vehicle manufactures to produce and sell electric vehicles, as a higher equivalent fuel economy for EVs improves the carmaker overall fleet fuel economy levels in complying with the CAFE standards, and Congress anticipated that such an incentive would help accelerate the commercialization of electric vehicles. The incentive factor chosen by DoE for EVs is the same 1/0.15 factor already applied in the <b>regulatory</b> <b>treatment</b> of other types of alternative fuel vehicles. When all factors are considered in DoE's formula, the energy efficiency or equivalent fuel economy of electric vehicles increases from 33,705 Wh/gallon (plug-to-wheel) to 82,049 Wh/gallon (well-to-wheel).|$|E

40|$|Phytotoxicity {{of fresh}} {{commodities}} {{is a major}} impediment for successful application of efficacious <b>regulatory</b> pest disinfestation <b>treatments</b> (Jones, 1940; Claypool and Vines, 1956). As biological entities, {{fresh fruits and vegetables}} continue their developmental and senescent processes after harvest. The various handling procedures, and the imposition of stringent <b>regulatory</b> quarantine <b>treatments</b> accelerate or aggravate the natural metabolic processes to the detriment of fruit quality and shorten storage life. Also, the diversity of market cultivars and stage of maturity harvested complicate the reliability of certain promising disinfestation treatments. The challenge to postharvest science is to understand and ascertain the underlying biochemical/physiological changes that are associated with the phytotoxic/injurious responses in fresh commodities in order to devise new approaches to minimize the undesirable changes. Effective, acceptable postharvest quarantine treatments involving chemical fumigants heat and cold for pest disinfestation must therefore be predicated upon: 1) maintenance of the quality of fresh commodity; 2) avoidance of unacceptable level of injury as to make the fruits unmarketable; and 3) recognition of the unique biological and horticultural characteristics of fresh commodities. Methyl bromide (MB) is a potent chemical toxicant used worldwide in agriculture for over half a century to control of a broad spectrum of pests. However, due to its impending ban, recent environmental and health concerns have made it necessary to find alternative methods for pest disinfestation.
