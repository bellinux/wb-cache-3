30|$|The PRFSS {{includes}} intramunicipal data to have {{a better}} understanding of urban freight activities in a first estimate (light duty vehicles LDV are not included in the survey). Opposite to the international transport, transport within municipalities, with a share of one third of tonnes, produces less than 5 % of running kilometers and 3 % of tonne kilometers. Urban freight activities are not exclusively based on small <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles,</b> because they carry less than 10 % of total tonnes, and need the support of medium <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles.</b> There is private service dominance in short distances using small and medium <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Opposite, there is public service dominance in longer distances using higher capacity vehicles.|$|R

50|$|In October 2006, Stagecoach ordered 45 Plaxton Panther bodied Volvo B12BT 15-metre 63 seat coaches. The three-axle {{coaches were}} the longest <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the UK on their {{introduction}} to service in February 2007, {{and the first}} of their kind {{to be built in}} Britain.|$|R
25|$|Class 2: any <b>rigid</b> goods <b>vehicle</b> over 7½ long tons.|$|R

50|$|Initially, a {{fleet of}} six rigid trolleybuses was {{available}} for use on the Zurich system. They were made by Saurer, Tüscher, FBW and SWS, carried fleet nos. 51 to 56, and differed technically or structurally from each other. By 1957, the number of <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles</b> of various types in the fleet had increased to 57 units.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, {{due to the}} {{extension}} of the system to Herbstäcker, two used <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles,</b> both built in 1961, made their way from Lucerne to Schaffhausen. With a total of 13 trolleybuses, the Schaffhausen fleet thus reached its historical peak. The two ex-Lucerne vehicles, nos. 206 (formerly Lucerne 226) and 207 (formerly Lucerne 227) were in service until 1991.|$|R
50|$|Monorail {{vehicles}} {{often appear}} similar to light rail vehicles, {{and can be}} staffed or unstaffed. They can be individual <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles,</b> articulated single units, or multiple units coupled into trains. Like other advanced rapid transit systems, monorails can be driven by linear induction motors; like conventional railways, vehicle bodies can {{be connected to the}} beam via bogies, allowing curves to be negotiated.|$|R
5000|$|Class 4 - Heavy Rigid Vehicle: Any <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle</b> of any weight, any {{combination}} vehicle {{which consists of}} a heavy vehicle and a light trailer, or any vehicle of Class 1 or 2 (but not 3).|$|E

40|$|A six {{degree of}} freedom {{simulation}} of <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles</b> was developed to study space shuttle vehicle boost-abort guidance and control techniques. The simulation was described in detail as an all digital program and as a hybrid program. Only the digital simulation was implemented. The equations verified in the digital simulation were adapted {{for use in the}} hybrid simulation. Study results were obtained from four abort cases using the digital program...|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{and control}} {{software}} that integrates {{the complexities of}} solar array models, a space environment, and an electric propulsion system into a <b>rigid</b> body <b>vehicle</b> simulation and control model is provided. A <b>rigid</b> body <b>vehicle</b> simulation of a solar electric propulsion (SEP) vehicle may be created using at least one solar array model, at least one model of a space environment, {{and at least one}} model of a SEP propulsion system. Power availability and thrust profiles may be determined based on the <b>rigid</b> body <b>vehicle</b> simulation as the SEP vehicle transitions from a low Earth orbit (LEO) to a higher orbit or trajectory. The power availability and thrust profiles may be displayed such that a user can use the displayed power availability and thrust profiles to determine design parameters for an SEP vehicle mission...|$|R

50|$|Along {{with the}} Lausanne {{trolleybus}} system, the Lucerne system {{is one of}} only two trolleybus systems worldwide that still utilise the rigid concace bus and the trailer consortium form of operation. In addition, the Lucerne system is, along with the Le-Fond-De-L'eau and Lausanne systems, one of only three trolleybus systems in Switzerland still using <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles.</b> An ongoing process called operation dismantle projects re-use parts of the long serving buses as gifts to the Cuban transportation system.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "rigid bus" [...] is used {{mainly in}} British English and Australian English and usually only when {{distinguishing}} such buses from articulated buses, {{such as when}} describing a fleet that includes both types. In the case of two-axle buses, which must be single-chassis, <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles,</b> British English often refers to such vehicles as [...] "two-axle" [...] buses, only using the term [...] "rigid" [...] when referring to vehicles with three or more axles, which can be either rigid or articulated.|$|R
50|$|The {{regulations}} controlling lorry sizes in the UK use metric units. The general maximum gross {{vehicle weight}} (GVW) is 44 tonnes (lorry, fuel and load). The general maximum allowed <b>vehicle</b> length for <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicles</b> is 12 m. For articulated lorries the maximum allowed length is 16.5 m (truck and trailer). Road trains can be up to 18.75 m long. The general maximum width for any vehicle is 2.55 m. Vehicles with a height of 3 m or above must have a notice in the cab showing their full height.|$|R
