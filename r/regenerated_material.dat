30|$|High {{temperatures}} {{were also}} beneficial for lignin extraction in ILs. Tan et al. observed an improved delignification of sugarcane bagasse using alkylbenzenesulphonate IL ([emim][ABS]) with increasing temperature from 170 °C to 190 °C [78]. The same trend was also confirmed in wood flour and triticale straw using [emim][CH 3 COO] [28, 79]. It {{is assumed that}} the most efficient delignification temperature is strongly related to the average glass transition temperature of 165 °C for a given lignin polymer [80]. However, that temperature is dictated by the chemical composition of lignin (monolignol composition and concentrations) and varies significantly between {{the different types of}} lignocellulosic biomass [67]. In the pre-treatment process at higher temperatures, lignin is susceptible to self-condensation reactions. The condensation of lignin is accompanied by an increase in molecular weight, which results in precipitation during the process and subsequently lignin is recovered in the <b>regenerated</b> <b>material.</b> Moreover, inhibition of lignin dissolution after condensation is another issue that contribute to the higher percentage of lignin recovered in the <b>regenerated</b> <b>material</b> [81, 82]. Nevertheless, if higher temperatures were complemented with long dissolution times, the condensed lignin could start to decompose and subsequently dissolve [83].|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the <b>regenerated</b> <b>material</b> {{is mainly}} composed by cellulose, since this macromolecule is not soluble in antisolvent. However, a 100 % (w/w) regeneration of cellulose {{seems not to}} be possible. During the pre-treatment process cellulose might undergo degradation and form smaller components soluble in the IL [71]. Moreover, the regeneration process is dependent upon molecular weight, where the dissolved higher molecular weight and partially dissolved wood components in ILs {{are the first to}} precipitate [35]. The smallest molecular weights could not precipitate after antisolvent addition being dissolved in the liquid stream.|$|E
30|$|The {{regeneration}} {{process was}} explained by Zavrel et al. describing that ions of the IL are extracted into the aqueous phase through hydrogen bonding, dipolar and Coulombic forces [26, 70]. Basically, water molecules form hydrodynamic shells around ions of the IL disrupting the direct interactions of IL ions with cellulose. Thus, intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds are rebuilt and cellulose precipitates [26]. However, not only cellulose can be dissolved but also other compounds of lignocellulose {{interact with the}} IL ions, such as hemicellulose and lignin. Singh et al. stated that the addition of water to switchgrass pre-treated in [emim][CH 3 COO] results in the precipitation of carbohydrates for downstream processing and lignin appears to be partially extracted in the IL/water mixture [31]. The degree of delignification and interaction of lignin with the precipitating solvent, IL, or cellulose dictate {{the purity of the}} regenerated cellulose for further saccharification and sugar yield [31]. Leskinen et al. evaluated the precipitation and composition of the regenerated samples from wood sawdust treatment with [amim][Cl] [35]. In the obtained <b>regenerated</b> <b>material</b> the lignin content increased due to the absence of delignification and simultaneous dissolution of some polysaccharide components. However, Nguyen et al. presented that lignin is firstly removed in the pre-treatment of rice straw with [emim][CH 3 COO] [51]. This may indicate differences in the mode of dissolution between [amim][Cl] and [emim][CH 3 COO] or it may also result from differences between biomass used in both studies. A more accurate correlation between lignin removal and the reduction of cellulose crystallinity was approached in a work of Tan et al. [71] Lignin content in the <b>regenerated</b> <b>material</b> was found to be proportional to the CrI. Thus, when more lignin is retained in the <b>regenerated</b> <b>material,</b> higher CrI is observed. The possible explanation comes from the movement restriction of cellulose in the presence of lignin that causes the dissolved cellulose to rearrange into the same conformation upon recrystallisation. Thus, the crystallinity of cellulose remains relatively high if pre-treatment was not efficient in lignin removal [71]. For lignocellulosic materials that contain relatively large amounts of lignin, higher temperature is required to change the structural crystallinity of cellulose I to cellulose II [59].|$|E

30|$|Arora et al. {{showed that}} a 3 -hour {{pre-treatment}} of switchgrass at 160 °C with [emim][CH 3 COO] resulted in delignification of 73.5 % [67]. The regenerated solid is comprised of 31 % glucan (80 % of the original glucan from switchgrass) with 8 % glucan (20.5 % of original glucan concentration in switchgrass) in the liquid fraction. In contrast, {{the majority of the}} xylan (19 %) ended up in the liquid stream, which was 73 % of the original xylan concentration of switchgrass. This means that the depolymerisation of xylan occurred and by HPAEC analysis, it was concluded that depolymerisation resulted in the formation of oligosaccharides instead of monosaccharides. Only 5 % of lignin in the regenerated solid was detected [67]. Therefore, as stated previously, in the presence of IL, higher temperature favours hemicellulose hydrolysis when using [emim][CH 3 COO] in the pre-treatment. Using the same biomass (from the same origin) and IL, as well as the same conditions of pre-treatment, Li et al. [62] showed different results. The pre-treatment process partially removed lignin and hemicellulose from the original switchgrass and produced a <b>regenerated</b> <b>material</b> composed by 67.7 % glucan, 13.6 % lignin and 7.6 % xylan content. The lignin extraction achieved 69.2 % of total lignin removal including 12.0 % of acid soluble lignin and 57.2 % of Klason lignin [62]. Much better results were obtained by Arora et al. [67] They were explained by a prior to and extended pre-extraction of switchgrass using ethanol comparing to those performed by Li et al. [62] When switchgrass was pre-treated with [Me(OEt) 3 Et 3 N][CH 3 COO] at 110 °C for 15  minutes, the content of Klason lignin in the <b>regenerated</b> <b>material</b> was reduced to 24 wt% from the initial value of 34 wt% [89]. Although [Me(OEt) 3 Et 3 N][CH 3 COO] presented an improved solubility of alkali lignin as compared to [emim][CH 3 COO] [89], the bulky cation [Me(OEt) 3 Et 3 N] was demonstrated to have lower efficiency in the switchgrass pre-treatment in comparison with the smaller [emim] cation.|$|E

The [emim][DEP] was reused in wheat straw pre-treatment, for which it was noted that after the fifth run a 52.8 % yield of reducing sugars was obtained in comparison with 54.8 % at the first pre-treatment.

Comparing to the untreated switchgrass, the BET surface area of the pre-treated switchgrass increased {{by a factor of}} 30. At the same time, the pore volume also increased 30 -fold with an average measured pore size of 10 – 15  nm for [emim][CH 3 COO] of the pre-treated switchgrass [67].

Around 40 % of the lignin was extracted from wood flour within 5  hours and more than 85 % was extracted after 70  hours providing a cellulose-rich <b>regenerated</b> <b>material</b> with only 3.2 % of lignin content for the last pre-treatment [28].

The results from both studies allow indicate that the lignin extraction is improved as the pre-treatment time increases. However, the time required could be different regarding the biomass used. Viell et al. observed the effect of longer dissolution time as more pronounced for beech wood than for spruce wood after pre-treatment with [emim][CH 3 COO] [29].

A total of 94 % and 65 % cellulose and xylan digestibility, respectively, were obtained after pre-treatment with [Ch][Lys], [Ch][Gly], [Ch][Ala], and [Ch][Met] that were the most efficient in lignin extraction (> 55 %) [66]. Cotton stalk was subjected to pre-treatments with several ionic liquids such as [HEA][HCOO], [amim][Cl], [bmim][Cl], [emim][Cl] and [emim][CH 3 COO]. The extracted lignin ranged between 31 % and 46 %, where maximum removal yields were obtained for pre-treatments with [emim][CH 3 COO] and [amim][Cl], determined to be 45 % and 46 %, respectively [63]. Kenaf pre-treatment was additionally performed with five types of ILs, such as [amim][Cl], [bmim][Cl], [emim][Cl], [emim][DEP] and [emim][CH 3 COO] [50]. The cellulose saccharification ratio was about 20 % for kenaf powders pre-treated in [amim][Cl], [bmim][Cl], [emim][Cl] and [emim][DEP] by conventional heating at 110 °C for 2  hours. The glucose yield was further increased when ultrasonic radiation was used for the same ILs with a 60 - 95 % glucose yield after 120  minutes at only 25 °C. The cellulose saccharification ratio of kenaf powder in [emim][CH 3 COO] was 86 % after 15  minutes of ultrasonic pre-treatment at 25 °C, compared to only 47 % {{in the case of the}} thermal pre-treatment in the same IL. However, it seems that the ultrasonic pre-treatment leads to a higher loss material in the liquid phase than for the conventional oil heating pre-treatment [50]. Wu et al. reported a 33 % (w/w) loading of corn stover pre-treated with [emim][CH 3 COO] as an efficient pre-treatment, in terms of the biomass loading, since it removed 15 % of the total lignin from the original biomass [41]. The best result was obtained by a pre-treatment with a biomass loading of 4.8 % at 125 °C for 1  hour giving a lignin extraction of 43.5 %. The <b>regenerated</b> <b>material</b> was determined to compose a 63.4 % carbohydrate and still remained 13.3 % lignin [41]. At 130 °C wheat straw was pre-treated with [emim][DEP] (4 % w/w) resulting in a porous and amorphous <b>regenerated</b> <b>material,</b> with only 54.8 % of reducing sugar yield attained possibly due to only a 30 -minute pre-treatment process [91]. The dissolution of sugarcane bagasse in [bmim][Cl] at high temperatures, such as 140 °C and 150 °C, was reported to be incomplete [76]. The undissolved material was first separated before regeneration of the dissolved material, the composition of which was practically the same as that of the original biomass. The results showed a composition of a <b>regenerated</b> <b>material</b> (without undissolved biomass) of 77 % cellulose at 140 °C and 82 % at 150 °C. The lignin and hemicellulose content proportionally decreased as the temperature increased. At 150 °C, the lower lignin and hemicellulose content of the <b>regenerated</b> <b>material</b> can be attributed to both preferential dissolution of cellulose and to an increased degradation of hemicellulose and lignin during the pre-treatment process. The pre-treatment efficiency was then evaluated by enzymatic hydrolysis and the best results were obtained for a pre-treatment at 150 °C for 90  minutes [76]. Sant’Ana da Silva et al. demonstrated that only a 30 -minute sugarcane pre-treatment at 120 °C with [emim][CH 3 COO] gave a regenerated biomass very susceptible for saccharification [69]. Yields above 95 % and 76 % of glucose and xylose were achieved, respectively. The [emim][CH 3 COO] IL was mixed with energy cane bagasse at a 20 : 1 ratio [92]. It was observed that 15.1 % of the total mass was lost during pre-treatment with IL and 52.6 % of the loss was attributed to lignin removal. Composition of analysis revealed that 32.1 % of the initial lignin was removed in IL-treated energy cane samples. Specifically, 41.7 % of the initial acid insoluble lignin was removed from energy cane. The loss of glucan in IL-treated samples was less than 9 % and cellulose digestibility of pre-treated sample at 24  hours was approximately 25 and 22 times higher than untreated and water-treated samples, respectively. The hemicellulose digestibility followed the same trend as that observed for cellulose [92]. Tan et al. used oil palm frond that was pre-treated with [bmim][Cl] at different pre-treatment conditions [86]. The pre-treatment variables studied were temperature, time and solid loading. Under the pre-treatment conditions of 4 wt% solid loading at 100 °C, the lignin removal efficiency reached its maximum in less than a half hour. The lignin content decreased from 33.63 % in original biomass to 17.91 %, i.e., close to 50 % of the lignin was extracted. During the pre-treatment process the cellulose loss was determined to be around 4 - 9 % [33]. Indeed, ILs are able to depolymerise polysaccharides in biomass to compounds with low molecular weight. ILs with greater depolymerisation power cause greater loss of reducing sugar during pre-treatment providing higher mass loss of carbohydrates. The dissolved polysaccharides undergo different degrees of depolymerisation and reducing sugar loss when pre-treated with different types of ILs. Sugarcane bagasse was pre-treated with [bmim][Cl] and 6.7 mg[*]·[*]mL- 1 of reducing sugars was detected in IL. In the case of the pre-treatment with [emim][DEP], 2.7 mg[*]·[*]mL- 1 of reducing sugars were detected in IL, whereas [emim][CH 3 COO] was ineffective in depolymerisation of polysaccharides during pre-treatment (insignificant amount of reducing sugar was detected) [33]. Tan et al. claimed that depolymerisation of cellulose occurs under acidic conditions in the ionic liquid media during pre-treatment [71]. The acidic conditions are created by degradation products, namely acetic acid and carboxylic acid released from hemicellulose hydrolysis upon pre-treatment. Under acidic conditions IL had the ability to hydrolyse cellulose causing significant losses. The loss products are essentially formed by carbohydrate oligomers and monomers that are soluble in the antisolvent and failed to be regenerated [71]. Van Spronsen et al. presumed that water is formed at temperatures higher than 100 °C from dehydration [27]. The components of lignocellulosic biomass were then exposed for hydrolysis. Hemicellulose could be further hydrolysed into acetic acid, which subsequently may act as a catalyst to the hydrolysis process of cellulose and the remaining hemicellulose [27]. The lesser depolymerisation observed for [emim][CH 3 COO] could be explained by the buffering effect exhibited by a very basic [CH 3 COO] anion. Its ability to combine with protons to form acetic acid may limit the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of hemicellulose polymers [53]. If the resultant products of degradation and hydrolysis are low macromolecular weight compounds, the probability of its recovery in the regeneration process is lower.

40|$|Germplasm {{preservation}} {{plays an}} important role in current breeding programs. A simple vitrification procedure that allows for the reproducible cryopreservation of two alder embryogenic lines is presented for the first time. Somatic embryos clumps (1 – 2 mm) were precultured in hormone-free medium (Murashige and Skoog halfstrength macronutrients, MS 1 / 2) supplemented with 0. 3 M sucrose for 3 days, and then treated with a mixture of 2 M glycerol plus 0. 4 M sucrose for 20 min at 25 C. Osmoprotected somatic embryos were dehydrated using plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS 2). The effect of different PVS 2 incubation times was evaluated, and 60 min at 0 C was considered to be the optimum period. After changing the solution with fresh PVS 2, the somatic embryos were directly immersed in liquid nitrogen. Following rapid thawing in a water bath at 40 C for 2 min, the somatic embryos were transferred onto MS 1 / 2 supplemented with 0. 1 mg l- 1 benzyladenine, 30 g l- 1 sucrose and 6 g l- 1 Vitro agar. The cultures were kept in the dark for 1 week prior to exposure to light (16 h/ 8 h light/dark cycle). The recovery rate of vitrified somatic embryos reached over 90 % in both embryogenic lines. Cryopreservation did not affect the plant regeneration potential of Alnus glutinosa through somatic embryogenesis. The ploidy stability of the <b>regenerated</b> <b>material</b> was assessed by flow cytometry. Analysis of DNA ploidy stability of the control, PVS 2 treated, cryopreserved somatic embryos and plantlets showed no significant differences...|$|E

Thermal degradation study of untreated bamboo and cellulose-rich material was carried out under dynamic condition using thermogravimetric analysis. Free kinetics models of Kissinger, Ozawa, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose were used to determine the kinetic parameters of thermal degradation process. The pattern of activation energy (E (a)) values with respect to % conversion values was noted different for the aforementioned models. The E (a) calculated using the Kissinger method were 184 and 156 kJ mol(- 1), and Ozawa method were 185 and 157 kJ mol(- 1) of untreated and treated sample of bamboo, respectively, while the values of E (a) calculated by Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose were 71. 7 - 203. 4 kJ mol(- 1) and 281. 7 - 230. 7 kJ mol(- 1) for untreated and treated sample of bamboo, respectively. Calorific and CHNS values of both untreated and <b>regenerated</b> cellulose-rich <b>material</b> were measured by bomb calorimeter and elemental analyzer (CHNS), respectively. Both the calorific value and carbon content of the <b>regenerated</b> cellulose-rich <b>material</b> (15. 62 J/kg, 37. 86 %, respectively) were found to be less than those of untreated bamboo (17. 40 J/kg and 43. 14 %, respectively).
