An exploratory descriptive study was undertaken to investigate the <b>response</b> <b>times</b> of ambulances of the Western Cape Emergency Medical Services to calls from midwife obstetric units (MOUs) in the Peninsula Maternal and Neonatal Services (PMNS) in Cape Town. <b>Response</b> <b>times</b> were calculated from data collected in specific MOUs using a specifically developed instrument.

A comparison was then made between the recorded and analysed <b>response</b> <b>times</b> to national norms and recommendations for ambulance <b>response</b> <b>times</b> and maternal transfer <b>response</b> <b>times</b> respectively. A wide range of <b>response</b> <b>times</b> was noted for the whole sample.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed approximately 15 representatives to the island to mitigate the <b>response</b> <b>time</b> {{in the wake of}} the storm.

Additional shelters were opened on the islands of Rota, Tinian, and Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and nearly 200 people sought cover there. Airports and seaports between the three islands were shut down, causing flights to be canceled.

5|$|When World WarII {{broke out}} in Europe, it was {{expected}} that the Japanese, who had already made aggressive moves against mainland China, would try to invade the Indies. In response, the Dutch colonial government– which had previously limited military training for native Indonesians– began teaching the populace how to deal with air raids. To co-ordinate the preparations, the Dutch formed Air Raid Preparation teams. Sudirman, respected in the community, was asked to lead the Cilacap chapter. Aside from teaching local citizens the safety procedures for dealing with an air raid, Sudirman established watchposts throughout the area. He and the Dutch would also have passing aircraft drop materials to simulate a bombing run; this was intended to improve <b>response</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

40|$|Many Internet {{applications}} employ multi-tier software architectures. The {{performance of}} such multi-tier Internet applications is typically {{measured by the}} end-toend <b>response</b> <b>times.</b> Most of the earlier works in modeling the <b>response</b> <b>times</b> of such systems have limited their study to modeling the mean. However, since the user-perceived performance is highly influenced by the variability in <b>response</b> <b>times,</b> the variance of the <b>response</b> <b>times</b> is important as well. We first develop a simple model for the end-to-end <b>response</b> <b>times</b> for multitiered Internet applications. We validate the model by real data from two large-scale applications that are widely deployed on the Internet. Second, we derive exact and approximate expressions for the mean and the variance, respectively, of the end-toend <b>response</b> <b>times.</b> Extensive numerical validation shows that the approximations match very well with simulations. These observations make the results presented highly useful for capacity planning and performance prediction of large-scale multitiered Internet applications...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a simple {{recursive}} equation to determine the best-case <b>response</b> <b>times</b> of periodic tasks under fixed-priority preemptive scheduling and arbitrary phasings. The approach is of a similar nature to the one used to determine worst-case <b>response</b> <b>times,</b> in the sense that, where a critical instant is considered to determine the latter, we base our analysis on an optimal instant, in which all higher priority tasks have a simultaneous release that coincides with the best-case completion of the task under consideration. The resulting recursive equation closely resembles the one for worst-case <b>response</b> <b>times,</b> apart from a term 1 difference, {{and the fact that}} the best-case <b>response</b> <b>times</b> are approached from above. The resulting iterative procedure is illustrated by means of a small example.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate <b>response</b> <b>times</b> of a salinity sensor and a soil psychrometer. Influences of pressure, temperature and molar concentration changes were to be measured. Salinity sensor <b>response</b> <b>times</b> ranged from 50 to 130 minutes during solution adsorption while desorption <b>response</b> <b>times</b> were perhaps ten times as long. Temperature affected both <b>response</b> <b>times</b> and equilibrium values, but pressure did not affect either. Soil psychrometer <b>response</b> <b>times</b> ranged from from 40 to 80 minutes for either adsorption or desorption of solution. However, other factors probably related to indirectness of measurement made the soil psychrometer fail to reflect osmotic potential. Both pressure and temperature effects were significant. Comparisons between hypothetical soil water infiltration <b>times</b> and sensor <b>response</b> <b>times</b> together with soil psychrometer failure led to the conclusion that the salinity sensor may be useful while the soil psychrometer would probably not be useful for the return-flow water quality control...|$|R

25|$|In August 2013, DCFEMS {{reported}} that it had significantly lowered EMS response times in April, May, June, and July 2013. The department said its standard was {{to respond to a}} call (e.g., leave the station) within 6.5 minutes 90 percent of the time. The department lowered its <b>response</b> <b>time</b> from 84 percent of the time in February 2013 to 92 percent of the time in June 2013. The <b>response</b> <b>time</b> for critical calls (about half of those received every day) also fell, from 5:03 minutes in February 2013 to 4:02 minutes in June 2013. Ellerbe attributed the improvements to a new protocol that required ambulance crews and firefighter EMTs to submit paperwork justifying the <b>response</b> <b>time</b> every time it exceeded the standard. Ellerbe suggested that some employees were simply not responding very quickly, and noted that at least one employee was disciplined {{for not being able to}} justify a slow <b>response</b> <b>time.</b> The firefighters' union complained about the amount of paperwork required, and said crews were sacrificing safety in order to meet the <b>response</b> <b>time</b> standard.
