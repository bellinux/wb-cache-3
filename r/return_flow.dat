5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E

25|$|The {{agreement}} {{failed to}} encourage discipline by the Federal Reserve or the United States government. The Federal Reserve {{was concerned about}} {{an increase in the}} domestic unemployment rate due to the devaluation of the dollar. In attempt to undermine the efforts of the Smithsonian Agreement, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in pursuit of a previously established domestic policy objective of full national employment. With the Smithsonian Agreement, member countries anticipated <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> of dollars to the U.S, but the reduced interest rates within the United States caused dollars to continue to flow out of the U.S. and into foreign central banks. The inflow of dollars into foreign banks continued the monetization process of the dollar overseas, defeating the aims of the Smithsonian Agreement. As a result, the dollar price in the gold free market continued to cause pressure on its official rate; soon after a 10% devaluation was announced in February 1973, Japan and the EEC countries decided to let their currencies float. This proved to be the beginning of the collapse of the Bretton Woods System. The end of Bretton Woods was formally ratified by the Jamaica Accords in 1976. By the early 1980s, all industrialised nations were using floating currencies.|$|E

25|$|Interactions {{with the}} mantle {{discontinuities}} {{play a significant}} role in slab rollback. Stagnation at the 660-km discontinuity causes retrograde slab motion due to the suction forces acting at the surface. Slab rollback induces mantle <b>return</b> <b>flow,</b> which causes extension from the shear stresses at the base of the overriding plate. As slab rollback velocities increase, circular mantle flow velocities also increase, accelerating extension rates. Extension rates are altered when the slab interacts with the discontinuities within the mantle at 410km and 660km depth. Slabs can either penetrate directly into the lower mantle, or can be retarded due to the phase transition at 660km depth creating a difference in buoyancy. An increase in retrograde trench migration (slab rollback) (2–4cm/yr) is a result of flattened slabs at the 660-km discontinuity where the slab does not penetrate into the lower mantle. This is the case for the Japan, Java and Izu-Bonin trenches. These flattened slabs are only temporarily arrested in the transition zone. The subsequent displacement into the lower mantle is caused by slab pull forces, or the destabilization of the slab from warming and broadening due to thermal diffusion. Slabs that penetrate directly into the lower mantle result in slower slab rollback rates (~1–3cm/yr) such as the Mariana arc, Tonga arcs.|$|E

In Godavari basin the ground water use exceeds surface / river water use in irrigation, etc. So the actual <b>return</b> <b>flows</b> available would not exceed 10% of primary water supply of the river. Thus as an exception in case of irrigation use, Clause II B aptly says that the extent of <b>return</b> <b>flows</b> shall not be deducted from the water lifted / diverted for the irrigation use (clause III A i).

2500|$|The {{separation}} of baseflow from direct runoff in a hydrograph is often {{of interest to}} hydrologists, planners, and engineers, as it aids in determining the influence of different hydrologic processes on discharge from the subject catchment. [...] Because the timing, magnitude, and duration of groundwater <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> differs so greatly from that of direct runoff, separating and understanding the influence of these distinct processes is key to analyzing and simulating the likely hydrologic effects of various land use, water use, weather, and climate conditions and changes.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the process}} of {{separating}} “baseflow” from “direct runoff” is an inexact science. [...] In part this is because these two concepts are not, themselves, entirely distinct and unrelated. [...] <b>Return</b> <b>flow</b> from groundwater increases along with overland flow from saturated or impermeable areas during and after a storm event; [...] moreover, a particular water molecule can easily move through both pathways {{en route to the}} watershed outlet. [...] Therefore, separation of a purely “baseflow component” in a hydrograph is a somewhat arbitrary exercise. [...] Nevertheless, various graphical and empirical techniques have been developed to perform these hydrograph separations. [...] The separation of base flow from direct runoff can be an important first step in developing rainfall-runoff models for a watershed of interest—for example, in developing and applying unit hydrographs as described below.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} glacial period, much of {{northern}} Europe, Asia, North America, Greenland and Antarctica {{was covered by}} ice sheets. The ice was as thick as three kilometres during the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago. [...] The enormous weight of this ice caused {{the surface of the}} Earth's crust to deform and warp downward, forcing the viscoelastic mantle material to flow away from the loaded region. [...] At the end of each glacial period when the glaciers retreated, the removal of the weight from the depressed land led to slow (and still ongoing) uplift or rebound of the land and the <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> of mantle material back under the deglaciated area.

40|$|Despite its {{critical}} role in agriculture and potable water supply for the region, few studies have evaluated the microbial quality of the Rio Grande River, especially for the parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Cryptosporidium and Giardia cause diarrheal illness and {{have been responsible for}} numerous waterborne and foodborne disease outbreaks. Cryptosporidiosis, the disease caused by Cryptosporidium, may be fatal in people with weakened immune systems and there is currently no effective treatment for the disease. During the irrigation season, water is released from upstream reservoirs and the river water is used by El Paso as a potable supply. During the non-irrigation season (October through February), river flows are comprised of agricultural <b>return</b> <b>flows</b> and wastewater treatment plant effluents. Due to recent drought conditions in the region, winter <b>return</b> <b>flows</b> in the El Paso area are largely wastewater effluents.

Conventional filtration and disinfection followed by nanofiltration or reverse osmosis have been proposed for treatment of the water to remove total dissolved solids and microorganisms.
