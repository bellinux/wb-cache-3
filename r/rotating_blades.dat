5|$|The Combine use a large {{array of}} science fiction technology. They have access to {{teleportation}} technology, which takes them from their dimension to Earth. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by Eli Vance, Isaac Kleiner and Judith Mossman in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations on Earth without significant modification. Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of small airborne robots, scanners, to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area. Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp <b>rotating</b> <b>blades</b> with which they attack their targets to cause laceration injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of land mines; hopper mines throw themselves {{into the air and}} detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical rollermines roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks. Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents.|$|E

Pipes allow the flour {{to move to}} a mixing machine where it is mixed with warm water by <b>rotating</b> <b>blades.</b> When the mixture is of a lumpy consistency the mixture is pressed into sheets or extruded.

40|$|<b>Rotated</b> <b>blades</b> are key {{mechanical}} components in turbomachinery and high cycle fatigues often induce blade cracks. Accurate detection of small cracks in <b>rotated</b> <b>blades</b> is very significant for safety, reliability, and availability. In nature, a breathing crack model is {{fit for a}} small crack in a <b>rotated</b> <b>blade</b> rather than other models. However, traditional vibration displacements-based methods are less sensitive to nonlinear characteristics due to small breathing cracks. In order to solve this problem, vibration power flow analysis (VPFA) is proposed to analyze nonlinear dynamic behaviors of <b>rotated</b> <b>blades</b> with small breathing cracks in this paper. Firstly, local flexibility due to a crack is derived and then time-varying dynamic model of the <b>rotated</b> <b>blade</b> with a small breathing crack is built. Based on it, the corresponding vibration power flow model is presented. Finally, VPFA-based numerical simulations are done to validate nonlinear behaviors of the cracked blade. The results demonstrate that nonlinear behaviors of a crack can be enhanced by power flow analysis and VPFA is more sensitive to a small breathing crack than displacements-based vibration analysis. Bifurcations will occur due to breathing cracks and subharmonic resonance factors can be defined to identify breathing cracks. Thus the proposed method can provide a promising way for detecting and predicting small breathing cracks in <b>rotated</b> <b>blades...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Despite lengthy {{delays in}} their own programme, the Luftwaffe beat the British efforts into the air by nine months. A lack of cobalt for {{high-temperature}} steel alloys meant the German designs were always at risk of overheating and damaging their turbines. The low-grade alloy production versions of the Junkers Jumo 004, designed by Dr. Anselm Franz and which powered the Messerschmitt Me 262 would typically last only 10–25hours (longer with an experienced pilot) before burning out, if it was accelerated too quickly, the compressor would stall and power was immediately lost and sometimes it exploded on their first startup. [...] Over 200 German pilots were killed during training. [...] Nevertheless, the Me 262 could fly far faster than allied planes and had very effective firepower. [...] Although Me 262s were introduced late in the war they shot down 542 or more allied planes and in one allied bombing raid downed 32 of the 36 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. Whittle's designs were more basic, with centrifugal compressors rather than the more complicated axial designs. [...] The latter, having several stages of <b>rotating</b> <b>blades,</b> each stage increasing the pressure, were potentially more efficient but were {{much more difficult to}} develop. [...] The UK designs also had better materials such as the Nimonic alloys for turbine blades. Early UK jet engines would run for 150hours between overhauls and had better power-to-weight ratio and specific fuel consumption compared with the German designs. By the end of the Second World War, other UK engine companies were working on jet designs based on the Whittle pattern, such as the de Havilland Goblin and Ghost engines. However, the advantages of axial-flow compressors with their higher pressure ratios compared with simpler centrifugal designs led to a transition to axial compressors in the late 1940s, epitomised by the Rolls-Royce Avon series, Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire, Bristol Olympus, and others.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rotated</b> <b>blades</b> are key {{mechanical}} components in turbine and high cycle fatigues often induce blade cracks. Meanwhile, mistuning is inevitable in <b>rotated</b> <b>blades,</b> which often {{makes it much}} difficult to detect cracks. In order to solve this problem, it is important and necessary to study effects of crack on vibration characteristics of mistuned <b>rotated</b> <b>blades</b> (MRBs). Firstly, a lumped-parameter model is established based on coupled multiple blades, where mistuned stiffness with normal distribution is introduced. Next, a breathing crack model is adopted and eigenvalue analysis is used in coupled lumped-parameter model. Then, numerical analysis is done and effects of depths and positions of a crack on natural frequency, vibration amplitude, and vibration localization parameters are studied. The results show that a crack causes natural frequency decease and vibration amplitude increase of cracked blade. Bifurcations will occur due to a breathing crack. Furthermore, based on natural frequencies and vibration amplitudes, variational factors are defined to detect a crack in MRBs, which are validated by numerical simulations. Thus, the proposed method provides theoretical guidance for crack detection in MRBs...|$|R
