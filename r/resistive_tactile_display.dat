40|$|Abstract A teletaction {{system uses}} a <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> {{to present the}} user with {{information}} about texture, local shape, and/or local compliance. Current <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> are flat and rigid, and require precise machining and assembly of many parts. This paper describes the fabrication and performance of a one-piece pneumaticallyactuated <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> molded from silicone rubber. Tactor spacing is 2. 5 mm with 1 mm diameter tactor elements. <b>Tactile</b> <b>display</b> compliance ensures contact between the finger and <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> at all times. Unlike previous pneumatic <b>tactile</b> <b>displays,</b> there is no chamber leakage and no seal friction. A psychophysics experiment showed that a a synthetic grating on the <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> was perceived {{as well as a}} low-passfiltered real contact. ...|$|R
40|$|Virtual surface {{characteristics}} of <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> are investigated {{to characterize the}} feeling of human touch for a haptic interface application. In order to represent the tactile feeling, a prototype <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> incorporating Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid has been developed. <b>Tactile</b> <b>display</b> devices simulate the finger’s skin to feel the sensations of contact such as compliance, friction, and topography of the surface. Thus, the <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> can provide information {{on the surface of}} an organic tissue to the surgeon in virtual reality. In order to investigate the compliance feeling of a human finger’s touch, normal force responses of a <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> under various magnetic fields have been assessed. Also, shearing friction force responses of the <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> are investigated to simulate the action of finger dragging on the surface. Moreover, different matrix arrays of magnetic poles are applied to form the virtual surface topography. From the results, different tactile feelings are observed according to the applied magnetic field strength as well as the arrays of magnetic poles combinations. This research presents a smart <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> technology for virtual surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{most common}} methods of tactile {{presentation}} on touch screen, the <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> was directly attached or contacted onto the screen. Therefore, the <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> must be transparent {{so that it}} does not obstruct the view of the screen. On the other hand, if the tactile sensation is presented at back side of the device, the <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> {{does not need to be}} transparent. However, the cost of covering the whole back side with high-density <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> is high. To overcome these limitations, we proposed to use a small and dense <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> placed at the back side and touched with one finger. The <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> is able to present the information around the operating finger touching the screen to the finger on back side of device.

40|$|AbstractA {{method to}} provide human tactile {{sensation}} using {{surface acoustic wave}} (SAW) was proposed. A stator transducer material (piezoelectric material) of a SAW <b>tactile</b> <b>display,</b> however, had constraint of size and shape. Previously, to solve this problem, a new method was proposed to excite and propagate SAW on a non-piezoelectric material surface. Excitation and propagation of SAW on a non-piezoelectric material is realized by combination of a LiNbO 3 plate and a glass substrate. Using the method, the glass substrate SAW <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> could realize <b>tactile</b> sensation {{in the same manner}} as the conventional SAW <b>tactile</b> <b>display.</b> However, a relationship between the friction coefficient and vibration amplitude is unclear in the glass substrate SAW <b>tactile</b> <b>display.</b> To decide and optimize the control parameters of the glass substrate SAW <b>tactile</b> <b>display,</b> the relation is needed.

We tested the possibilities of counteracting these effects by using a <b>tactile</b> torso <b>display.</b> The display consisted of 64 vibro-tactile elements and presented infoflllation on the desired direction of motion only (simple version), or also included infoflllation on the current motion direction (complex version). The participants flew in a fixed-base helicopter simulator with either full vision or with simulated night vision goggleshowed perfoflllance improvement for both <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> variants compared to hovering without a <b>tactile</b> <b>display.</b> This improvement was present in the NVG conditions (mean reduction of the position error of 22 % in the horizontal direction and of 41 % in the vertical direction), {{but also in the}} full vision condition (mean reductions of 32 and 63 %, respectively). Also, perfoflllance with a <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> is less affected by the introduction of a secondary (cognitive) task than perfoflllance without a <b>tactile</b> <b>display.</b> The complex variant of the <b>tactile</b> torso <b>display</b> tends to be less effective than the simple variant. We hypothesize that this effect may be due to what we call "tactile clutter". This simulator study proves the potential of intuitive <b>tactile</b> torso <b>displays</b> in reducing drift during hover. The display is so effective that it even results in perfoflllance improvement in full vision conditions. Also, the results prove that <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> can be applied in fast man-in-the-loop tasks.

40|$|Developing <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> is an {{important}} aspect of improving the realism of feeling softness in laparoscopic surgery. One of the major challenges of designing a <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> is to understand how the perception of touch can be perceived with differences in material properties. This project seeks to address this limitation by investigating how the interaction of material properties affects perception of softness and to present the perception of softness through a <b>tactile</b> <b>display.</b> The first aim explores how the interaction of material properties affects perception of softness through the use of two psychophysical experiments. Experiments used a set of nine stimuli representing three materials of different compliance, with three different patterns of surface roughness or with three different coatings of stickiness. The results indicated that compliance affected perception of softness when pressing the finger, but not when sliding; and that compliance, friction and thermal conductivity all influenced the perception of softness. To achieve the second aim of reproducing various levels of softnesses, the <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> was built at the University of Leeds. The displayed softness was controlled by changing the contact area and tension of a flexible sheet. Psychophysical experiments were conducted to evaluate how well humans perceive softness through the display. The data was analysed using MatLab to plot psychometric functions.
