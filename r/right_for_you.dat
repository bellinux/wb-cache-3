500|$|In 2001, Fiasco co-founded 1st & 15th Entertainment with Charles [...] "Chilly" [...] Patton. 1st & 15th is an {{independent}} record label separate from Atlantic Records named after the traditional twice-monthly paycheck dates. [...] Although his albums are released by Atlantic since he is under contract with them, most of his works are usually produced by 1st & 15th and its in house producers. Although Fiasco was initially to serve as vice-president, he became CEO after Patton was convicted on drug charges. Fiasco and singer Matthew Santos {{were two of the}} most recognizable signed artists. In November 2009, Fiasco announced he would discontinue the 1st & 15th label: [...] "It was just such a 'this isn't <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> right now. This isn't gonna work for you right now. You need to be focused on you. Do you really want that, do you really have the capacity to do it?'" [...] In March 2013 Fiasco took to Twitter to announce that he had become the Creative Director at Higi, a scoring system based in the Chicago area that helps you to discover more about yourself so you can look, live and feel better.|$|E

Buñuel courted her in a formal Aragonese manner, complete with a chaperone, [...] and they married in 1934 despite a warning by Jean Epstein when Buñuel first proposed in 1930: [...] "Jeanne, you are making a mistake... It's not <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> don't marry him." [...] The two remained married throughout his life and had two sons, Juan-Luis and Rafael. Diego Buñuel, filmmaker and host of the National Geographic Channel's Don't Tell My Mother series, is their grandson.|$|E
2500|$|After Ford {{graduated}} from Santa Monica High School, {{he began working}} in small theatre groups. While in high school, he took odd jobs, including working for Will Rogers, who taught him horsemanship. Ford later commented {{that his father had}} no objection to his growing interest in acting, but told him, [...] "It's all <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to try to act, if you learn something else first. Be able to take a car apart and put it together. Be able to build a house, every bit of it. Then you'll always have something." [...] Ford heeded the advice and during the 1950s, when he was one of Hollywood's most popular actors, he regularly worked on plumbing, wiring, and air conditioning at home. At times, he worked as a roofer and installer of plate-glass windows.|$|E

2500|$|Over the red, {{black and}} white canvas there is a poem written in Braille by poet Chloe Mitchell; the braille follows {{the theme of the}} album's singles artwork which also {{features}} the same technique. Speaking on her choice to use the language, Rihanna commented, [...] "Sometimes the ones who have sight are the blindest." [...] During the cover's designing stage, Rihanna met with Mitchell, in which they [...] "drank" [...] {{and came up with a}} poem that would be used for the artwork and liner notes entitled If They Let Us. Mitchell explained the poem and its meaning to Rolling Stone magazine, stating it was about being misunderstood, but still be able to stand out while doing what is <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> She further said that the poem speaks about not conforming to society and being a leader as well as accepting that being misunderstood is a positive thing.|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 2011, Douglas County, Colorado, sheriff's deputies arrested Davis in Highlands Park, Colorado, at the Town Center in Highlands Ranch, for third-degree {{assault and}} disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors, {{stemming}} from a dispute between Davis and 50-year-old Jeff Maes about a parking space. Maes and his family got to a parking spot first and parked in it. A witness told police that Davis then confronted Maes and said, [...] "I was waiting for that spot and it wasn't <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to take it." [...] When Maes refused to move, Davis struck Maes. The blow sent Maes to the ground. Davis was released on a $1,750 bail bond. When prosecutors later learned that Maes may have suffered a broken vertebra in the incident, they increased one {{of the charges against}} Davis to second-degree assault (a felony), a crime of violence that carries a five-year mandatory minimum, and Davis's bond was raised to $10,000. Neither Maes nor a third man present at the scene have been charged in the incident. Davis later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor third-degree assault and received a two-year probationary sentence.|$|E
