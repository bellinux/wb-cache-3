50|$|Basic {{sediment}} {{and water}} (BS&W) is a technical specification of certain impurities in crude oil. When extracted from an oil reservoir, the crude oil will contain some {{amount of water}} and suspended solids from the <b>reservoir</b> <b>formation.</b> The particulate matter is known as sediment or mud. The water content can vary greatly from field to field, and may be present in large quantities for older fields, or if oil extraction is enhanced using water injection technology.

The residual content of these unwanted impurities is measured as BS&W. Oil refineries may either buy crude to a certain BS&W specification or may alternatively have initial crude oil dehydration and desalting process units that reduce the BS&W to acceptable limits, or a combination thereof.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Clay {{minerals}} {{are almost}} ubiquitous in soil and rock and {{are among the}} most reactive silicates. They affect the engineering behaviour of soil and rock both as materials of construction and as foundation materials. In the petroleum industry, clay affects the permeability of <b>reservoir</b> <b>formations,</b> it is a common cap-rock, and it is also a constituent of the fluids used in drilling operations. Engineering behaviour almost always involves clay-water interaction and in turn this depends on the nature of water and solutions and on the composition and microstructure ofthe clay. The importance of clay to specific problems from each of these areas is discussed. In foundation engineering its role in soil-moisture interaction is illustrated by reference to problems resulting from the geological history of some North American soils and from engineering activities. In building materials, reference is made to its effect on concrete durability in aggregate r lated problems. The importance of clay in petroleum engineering refers to authigenic clays in reservoir rocks, to clay behaviour in the Alberta oil sands and to the use of clay minerals as a geothermal thermometer. The engineering geologist encounters clay in foundation materials, in materials of construction and in <b>reservoir</b> <b>formations.</b> Frequently the clay is associated with problem...|$|R

The geothermal potential is related directly to reservoir quality, {{which in the}} Danish onshore area traditionally is addressed by considering clay content, net sand thickness, porosity and permeability by means of wireline logs, core analysis data, well tests and seismic data (e.g. Mathiesen et al. 2013).

40|$|The {{results of}} a palynological study on late Llandovery-Wenlock (mid-Silurian) {{successions}} in the North Esk, Bavelaw Castle and Loganlee inliers of the Pentland Hills, Midland Valley of Scotland, are documented. Palynological assemblages from the <b>Reservoir</b> <b>Formation</b> are dominated by acritarchs, but chitinozoa, cryptospores and scolecodonts are also present. Assemblages from {{the lower part of}} the <b>Reservoir</b> <b>Formation</b> are of low diversity and abundance, but marked increases in both abundance and diversity, particularly of the acritarchs, occur in the upper 200 [*]m or so of the formation. The reasons for the marked increases are unclear, but could reflect changing environmental conditions during deposition of the upper <b>Reservoir</b> <b>Formation,</b> with the marine palynomorphs tracking changes in the location of certain physical and chemical properties of water-masses, for example nutrient availability, salinity or temperature. There is a general decline in the abundance and diversity of acritarchs and chitinozoans above the <b>Reservoir</b> <b>Formation,</b> although both groups, together with rare cryptospores, are present in samples from the Deerhope and Wether Law Linn formations. The Henshaw Formation yielded few marine microfossils, but more abundant and diverse spores and cyptospores than the underlying formations, consistent with an upward transition from marine to prograding terrestrial facies. The microfloras from the Reservoir, Deerhope and Wether Law Linn formations are consistent with the late Llandovery age indicated by graptolite evidence. A feature of assemblages from the <b>Reservoir</b> <b>Formation,</b> particularly the more productive samples from the upper part of the formation, is the common occurrence of sphaeromorph acritarchs, Moyeria cabottii and Tylotopalla species. The common occurrence of these forms gives the palynological assemblages a distinctive character. Similar sphaeromorph-Moyeria-Tylotopalla dominated acritarch microfloras occur at about the same level (spiralis Graptolite Biozone) in the Silurian succession of the Girvan Inlier, in the Drumyork Flags Formation. They might therefore be useful for correlating upper Llandovery rocks across the Midland Valley. ...|$|E

40|$|Most {{oil wells}} {{eventually}} produce some quantity of <b>reservoir</b> brine (<b>formation</b> water) over their lifetime. Increased water production is usually indicated {{by a significant}} increase in the water to oil ratio (WOR) of the well. As the WOR of well increases, it causes costly added water handling, it reduces efficiency of the depletion mechanism, the afflicted well may be abandoned early, there can be loss of the total field overall recovery, and because <b>reservoir</b> brine (<b>formation</b> water) is corrosive its disposal becomes expensive. In this work, a simple Arrhenius type function is presented for estimation of <b>reservoir</b> brine (<b>formation</b> water) properties for temperatures above 30 °C and salt contents between 5 % and 25 % by mass. An Arrhenius type function has been selected because it is easier than existing approaches, less complicated with fewer computations, and suitable for engineers.

Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with the reliable data in the literature with average absolute deviation being around 0. 09 – 2. 6 %.

In particular, chemical and petroleum engineers would find the proposed approach to be user-friendly with transparent calculations involving no complex expressions...|$|R
