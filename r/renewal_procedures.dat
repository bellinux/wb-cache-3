Using a <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure,</b> the authors report that drug-associated contextual stimuli {{play a critical role in}} relapse to drug-seeking previously maintained by a heroin-cocaine mixture (speedball). Rats were trained to self-administer speedball, after which drug-reinforced behavior was extinguished over 20 days in the self-administration context or in a different context. On the test day, rats exposed to the drug-associated context, after extinction in a different context, reliably renewed drug seeking.

The renewal of extinguished conditioned behavior is observed during test. The current study tested the effects of multiple extinction contexts and context similarity in attenuating renewal. Participants (N = 99) {{took part in a}} fear conditioning ABA <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure.</b> Using a measure of self-reported expectancy of the US, ABA renewal was observed when a single extinction context that was dissimilar to the test context was used. Renewal was attenuated, though still present, when extinction occurred in multiple dissimilar extinction contexts or in a single extinction context that was similar to the test context. Renewal was completely abolished when multiple extinction contexts that were similar to the test context were combined. Multiple extinction contexts and context similarity act additively in their effect on attenuating renewal. The results are discussed in relation to the design of exposure therapy programs that seek to reduce relapse that can occur via renewal...|$|R

Consequently, a signature {{created by the}} proxy signer is distinguishable from that created by the principal signer. This level of security is a common requirement in many applications to prevent malicious proxy agents from impersonating the principal signer. Moreover, the scheme is based on bilinear pairings over elliptic curves and thus smaller key sizes are required compared to schemes not utilizing elliptic curves. A revocation protocol of dishonest agents is given together with a <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure</b> for the proxies of honest agents.

Otherwise, it will be {{isolated}} from the tree of trust and {{would not be able to}} send any packet via its neighbours. Also, to increase the level of trustworthiness, initially, every node may certify any other for a short period of time, say for a couple of hours. After that, if the [...] "postulant" [...] node proves good intentions, its certificate is renewed with a greater validity period. It is worth noting that detecting misbehaving nodes among one-hop nodes is quite easy due to the broadcast nature of wireless communications. The detection of misbehaving nodes can also be enforced using a reputation rating or recommendation system based on observation and/or second-hand information as discussed in Section 2. An already certified node must present a valid certificate to get a new one. Otherwise, the <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure</b> fails and implicitly the node is forced to disjoin from the network. Even though the proposed method imposes increased node overhead during its first stages, balances some time later after achieving a relative high degree of trust level between all the participants.|$|R

Here, we describe a simple procedure that allowed maintaining highly efficient bioanodes supplied with biowaste. Current densities up to 14. 8 A/m(2) were obtained with more than 40 % of the electrons introduced as biowaste being recovered in the electrical circuit Three fed-batch reactors were started at different biowaste loading rates. A decline of coulombic efficiencies between 22 and 31 % was recorded depending on the reactor over the first 3 weeks of operation. A <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure</b> of the anode was thereafter implemented, {{which led to a}} recovery of initial performances. The second and the third renewal, allowed maintaining stable high level performances with coulombic efficiency of approximately 40 % over at least 3 weeks. Electroactive biofilm dynamics were monitored using 16 S rRNA-gene amplicon sequencing. Retrieved sequences were dominated by Geobacter sulfurreducens-related reads (37 % of total sequences), which proportion however varied along the experiment Interestingly, sequences affiliated to various Bacteroidetes groups were also abundant, suggesting an adaptation of the anodic biofilm to the degradation of biowaste through metabolic interactions between microbial community members...|$|R
40|$|A recent fear-potentiated startle {{study in}} rodents {{suggested}} that extinction was not context dependent when extinction was conducted {{after a short}} delay following acquisition, suggesting that extinction can lead to erasure of fear learning in some circumstances. The main objective {{of this study was}} to attempt to replicate these findings in humans by examining the context specificity of short-delay extinction in an ABA <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure</b> using virtual reality environments. A second objective was to examine whether renewal, if any, would be influenced by context conditioning. Subjects underwent differential aversive conditioning in virtual context A, which was immediately followed by extinction in virtual context B. Extinction was followed by tests of renewal in context A and B, with the order counterbalanced across subjects. Results showed that extinction was context dependent. Evidence for renewal was established using fear-potentiated startle as well as skin conductance and fear ratings. In addition, although contextual anxiety was greater in the acquisition context than in the extinction context during renewal, as assessed with startle, context conditioning did not influence the renewal effect. These data do not support the view that extinction conducted shortly after acquisition is context independent. Hence, they do not provide evidence that extinction can lead to erasure of a fear memory established via Pavlovian conditioning...|$|R

We investigated whether these additions contributed to a reduction in at-fault motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) by examining the trend of the at-fault MVC rates per licensed driver and the rate ratios of the older drivers relative to those aged 65 – 69 years for the years 1986 – 2011. All data were derived from nationwide traffic statistics. If the introduction of the lesson was effective in reducing at-fault MVCs of older drivers, the rate ratio should have declined, given that the lesson targeted only the older drivers. We found this was not the case, i. e., there was no declining trend in the at-fault MVC rate ratios of both drivers aged 75 years or older and drivers aged 70 years or older, relative to drivers aged 65 – 69 years, after the driving lesson at license renewal became mandatory for these older drivers. Therefore, the mandatory lesson for the older drivers at license renewal needs to be reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first attempt to {{estimate}} the hydroelectricity rent in Italy, as several concessions are about to expire, {{and the first to}} analyze the implications of different redistribution mechanisms. Due to budgetary constraints, local authorities want to capture a higher part of the rent, thought to be considerable. At the same time, the <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure</b> entails the implementation of environmental mitigation measures, as set forth in the water framework directive. Hence, rent-seizing and environmental protection generate a major trade-off. We focus our analysis on the County of Sondrio, home to 18 % of the overall hydropower capacity, where the first renewals will take place. We obtain the highest rent ever estimated for hydropower production, averaging from 30. 3. €/MWh to 82. 4. €/MWh. These high values explain why local authorities are pushing for the introduction of a 30 % revenue sharing fee, as they would earn almost 90 % of the rent, much more than the 50 % currently seized. Albeit satisfying the rent-seizing objective, the proposed fee hinders the implementation of costly mitigation measures. In this paper, we advocate the adoption of a resource rent tax, as we show that it would reduce the trade-off between rent-seizing and environmental protection...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{patterns}} of occurrence of the ectoparasite Amyloodinium ocellatum and the conditions that result in its maintenance at non-dangerous levels for gilthead seabream Sparus aurata could be very useful, since outbreaks of heavy infestation by this parasitic dinoflagellate can cause severe mortality in temperate aquaculture. We have evaluated the interactions between A. ocellatum and related environmental variables for the first time. Biotic and abiotic parameters of water quality in production ponds from a temperate aquaculture (Sado Estuary, Portugal) were monitored and subsequently analysed. Dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, phytoplankton biomass and salinity were closely related to A. ocellatum occurrences; dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH and phytoplankton biomass had significant negative relationships with A. ocellatum trophonts, while salinity had a significant positive relationship with A. ocellatum trophonts in fish gills. Phytoplankton biomass was significantly correlated with increases of dissolved oxygen in production ponds. An increase of rate of water renewal increased salinity, due to persistence of low water levels in production ponds during the water <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure.</b> Salinity negatively affected phytoplankton biomass and consequently the level of dissolved oxygen, raising the probability of A. ocellatum occurrences. Fish biomass in production ponds was correlated with the average and {{the maximum number of}} trophonts found in fish gills, highlighting the importance of defining stocking levels and production values in ponds. The present results help to improve understanding of the interactions between biotic and abiotic variables, fish farm management practices and parasite incidence in temperate terrestrial pond aquaculture. A morphological feature of the A. ocellatum tomonts cells in division phase, collected from the most infected fish gills, is discussed.

40|$|Older Automobile Drivers: Medical Aspects Kurt Johansson MD Introduction: Older drivers (65 +) are not {{a threat}} to traffic safety; the number of {{accidents}} involving older drivers is small compared to the number of younger drivers' accidents. However, a substantial number of studies have shown that when mileage is taken into consideration, older drivers have an increased risk for being involved in traffic accidents. Possible reasons for this increased accident risk among older drivers could be the effects of aging or the influence of disease. In many countries, there is a medical examination included in the license renewal procedure; its goals are to detect potential medical threats to traffic safety, and subsequently to take due precautions by treating and advising the driver, or by denying renewal. The aims of this study were to investigate the efficacy of medical screening of older drivers, and to identify risk factors for road traffic accidents among older drivers. Methods: The efficacy of the medical examination included in the license <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure</b> was evaluated by comparing accident statistics in Sweden (where license renewal is a sirnple formality and where there is no compulsory medical check-up) and Finland (where the license expires at age 70 and can only be renewed after a medical check-up). With the aim of identifying risk factors for traffic accidents among older drivers, we investigated both drivers guilty of moving violations and drivers who died in traffic accidents. In one part of the study, a group of 37 older drivers found guilty of crashes (n = 23) or other moving violations (n = 14) was selected (cases where alcohol was involved were excluded.) These were then compared to closely individually matched controls. An extensive battery of examinations, tests, and blood analyses was performed. Another part of the study included 98 older drivers who died in traffic accidents according to the definition used in official statistics. Neuropathological assessment was performed on Bielschowsky stained tissue from frontal and parietal brain areas, and diagnoses were made according to the commonly used CERAD criteria. We also retrieved data from drug analyses performed at the National Forensic Institute of Chemistry. Results: The comparison of accident statistics between Sweden and Finland did not give evidence for any traffic safety effect of the license <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure.</b> Nor did the medical examination of drivers convicted for crashes uncover any differences compared to controls. However, tests of memory and visuospatial ability (copying a cube) indicated that cognitive impairment was more frequent in the crash group compared to controls. In the test of visual acuity with Snellen's 'E', which carries a greater cognitive load than letters, those drivers convicted of crashes scored lower than controls. The neuropathological assessment disclosed evidence of Alzheimer's disease in {{more than half of the}} deceased drivers. Blood samples from 23 % of the male drivers 75 + revealed that, at the time of the fatal crash, they had in their blood drugs known to have an impact on cognitive functions. Conclusion: Cognitive impairment seems to be a very important risk factor for older drivers' involvement in road traffic accidents. The cognitive impairment is often not great enough that it can be recognized or detected during the commonly performed doctor's examination. A detailed test of cognitive function should be included in the examination of older license applicants. The physician, and the older driver on medication, must also be made aware of the importance of drug influence on cognitive functions and the subsequent increase in accident risk when using such drugs.

40|$|The present thesis {{examined}} {{the role of}} the prelimbic (PL) cortex in using associative history and contextual cues to change an animals response towards a stimulus. In the first set of experiments, we clarified {{the role of the}} PL cortex in attention. Here, we found that PL lesions disrupted the exhibition of the overshadowing effect whilst leaving the blocking phenomenon intact. Further, we found that rats with PL lesions demonstrated faster acquisition towards the blocked cue, suggesting they had not down-regulated attention towards the blocked cue. A deficit in down-regulating attention in PL-lesioned animals was confirmed using a blocking of unblocking procedure. These data demonstrated that the PL cortex is necessary to allow animals to change the degree of attention directed towards cues {{on the basis of their}} associative history. In a second set of experiments, we attempted to generalise the role of the PL cortex in modulating attention to the aversive domain. Here, we again found that animals with PL lesions exhibited a deficit in overshadowing but remain capable of demonstrating the blocking effect. Using functional inactivation, we found that the PL cortex is necessary during the conditioning phase of overshadowing, but not in the expression of this effect at test. This confirmed that the PL cortex is necessary to allow animals to modulate attention towards cues during the learning process to influence the development of learnt associations in an aversive procedure. In a final set of experiments, we investigated the role of the PL cortex in using contextual cues to modulate responding. Using an ABA <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure,</b> we demonstrated that rats without a functional PL cortex during the test phase failed to express the renewal of conditioned fear. This deficit was also accompanied by a lack of change in orienting towards a CS according to present contextual cues. Further, we also found that the PL cortex is also involved in the acquisition and expression of associations developed in a contextual bi-conditional discrimination. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the PL cortex is necessary for animals to use associative history and contextual cues to modulate both learning and performance...|$|R

Indusrial wastewaters are often generated and discharged into the environment without treatment. Toxicity of effluents from Synythetic Resin production plant were evaluated in this study. Acute toxicity (96 -h LC 50) was evaluated using 0. 23, 0. 31, 0. 35 and 0. 39 mg/L of the effluent in a <b>renewal</b> bioassay <b>procedure.</b> Physicochemical parameters of the effluent were also evaluated, the values obtained for lead, cyanide, total suspened solid, total hadness, total dissolved solids and alkalinity were higher than the Federal Environmental Protection Agency standard specification for effluent discharge into aquatic environment and as such contributed to the effluent's toxicity. Mortality increased as the concentrations of the effluent increases and 0. 355 mg/L was obtained as LC 50.

After series of range finding test, the fishes were exposed to lethal concentrations 0. 00 mg/L, 0. 01 mg/L, 0. 02 mg/L, 0. 03 mg/L, 0. 04 mg/L and 0. 05 mg/L and as well as sub-lethal concentrations 0. 000 mg/L, 0. 002 mg/L, 0. 003 mg/L, 0. 004 mg/L, 0. 005 mg/L and 0. 006 mg/L of detergent effluent for 56 days in a <b>renewal</b> bioassay <b>procedure.</b> The median lethal concentration (LC 50) values for lethal and sublethal tests were 0. 0166 mg/L and 0. 0038 mg/L respectively. Respiratory disturbance, erratic swimming, loss of equilibrium, lethargies and sudden fish death were observed in the exposed fish and these varied greatly with differences in concentration of the toxicant and this shows that mortality increases {{with an increase in}} concentration. The differences observed in the mortalities of C. gariepinus at varying concentrations were significant (p < 0. 05), an indication that mortality could be a factor of concentration and time of exposure. The liver of the control fish showed normal parenchyma appearance of hepatocyte with normal staining patterns of the cell. In the treated fishes, there was congestion of central vein, vacoulation of hepatocyte, oedema, cellular infiltration and cellular necrosis. Detergent effluent is highly toxic to Clarias gariepinus juveniles, which are more susceptible to this household cleaning agent’s effluent; therefore, an indiscriminate discharge of this effluent to the surrounding should be discourage...|$|R

It brings forth scenes that are parallel projects of that which exists in reality. It is a deliberate strategy that is contrary to the mass production of many contemporary artists. But because his paintings could hardly be entirely classified under surrealism or realism, the American art historian, Carol Strickland, developed the term “sottorealism,” based on Kalaizis' work. In this context, “sotto” refers to “beyond” or “below” and points to the hidden mystery that exists behind the depicted surface of the painting. Life and death, dream and reality are in a strange confluence here. Emerging out of this process, his paintings then bring forth a certain delirium, a disruption of the inner equilibrium. The paintings are often charged by a strange ferocity, in which everything takes place at the same time: magic, grace, harmony, and an unfathomable abyss. Kalaizis often mentions the surrealist André Masson in interviews and discussions, who once said: “Nothing is more fantastic than reality.” ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the here}} {{reported}} on project, we have screened relations between {{product life cycle}} environmental performance and organising traced from technical processes that are nodes by having central roles in these cycles. Thereby, we have aimed both to further an already introduced method {{for this type of}} study by introducing an approach that is quicker to use than the thorough design previously deployed and to test it on a broader range of empirical domains. The method used combines life cycle assessment (LCA) and organisational studies, which are coherently integrated with each other using particularly the socio-material approaches actor-network theory (ANT) and action nets. The screening approach was applied to six test cases that covered six different types of services and physical commodities, and for each of these six comparisons have been performed between the organising traced empirically from at least three different nodes and their product life cycles environmental performance. The cases have covered the products and nodes listed in table S. 1, further on in this summary. The test case on properties management was based on existing publications on a thorough study using the combination of LCA and organisational studies, while the other five test cases were performed as screenings applying this combination approach for the first time. A large number of practices of this organising have been indicated potentially to considerably influence product life cycle environmental performance. These organisational practices have been indicated to vary considerably between different activities both regarding the practices themselves and regarding the discernibility of their relations to each other and of their influence on environmental performance. The approach used in the project necessarily has limitations due to its screening characteristic, but these can be seen as prerequisites both for identifying the large number of organisational practices with indicated large influence on environmental performance and for reaching the overarching indications made through the project. However, even if no direct quantitative environmental differences were possible and feasible to present, the screening has at least shown that the environmental performances of the studied product life cycles seemed considerably to depend on organisational practices through not straightforward interplays between organising, technology and materials and energy processes. These organisational practices include the examples presented in Table S. 2, further on in this summary. Table S. 2 : Bowling: Ceasing of business or not, Lunch provision or not, Additional games and similar activities degrees; Bread: Supply transport distance, Bread thickness and baking, Overproduction; Bus travel on intercity routes: Eco-driving training and discussions degrees, Number of routes served by the ticket offices, Seats organisation differences on the buses; Cement: Production permits <b>renewal</b> <b>procedure</b> differences, Production permit expiration criteria differences, Organisational practices for handling technical problems at and operation of the plant differences; Properties management: Types of windows related to the handling of cultural heritage requirements, Water taps replacement related to renovation and emergencies, system knowledge and operation and maintenance differences, Insulation differences due to fire protection differences; Road management (operation and routine maintenance of roads) : Renewal or not of procurement contracts, Centralisation of contractors activities, Fragmentation of procurement governance. Regarding overall usefulness of screening and thorough nodal LCA organisation studies, respectively, generally the screenings were found to be considerably useful but instead performing thorough studies was indicated to provide considerable additional usefulness although the level and type of this addition were generally found to be difficult to predict. In relation to this, the results have also been discussed regarding whether and if so how they may point towards more overarching ideas on considerable reductions of society’s environmental impacts. This has covered internally driven environmental work within the organising connected to and along product life cycles, substantial amounts of assistance in such work from external experts, and an approach to focus of with a global coverage letting the local activities where the environmentally impacting resource use and emissions occur be monetary targeted. The actual feasibility of each of these approaches, however, {{have been found to be}} more or less limited and a uniting requirement seem to be a considerable pressure from the public. Finally, even if such considerable undertakings are made the project here reported on suggests that the environmental effects of a considerable share of actions still may not be possible or feasible to foresee...|$|R
50|$|In the British House of Commons, {{a motion}} or an {{amendment}} {{which is the}} same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session may not be renewed again in that same session. Such substantive motions can be renewed in succeeding sessions as new motions. Reversals of earlier decisions {{can be done by}} Repeal of a Standing Order, Annulment, or Rescission. The repeal of a standing order is normally made as part of an order creating a new standard order.

Technically it is regarded as a new question: the form being to read the previous resolution of the House and to move that it be rescinded. This power of rescission has been used sparingly and then only in the case of substantive motions. The reasons why open rescission is so rare is that the House instinctively realizes that parliamentary government requires the majority to abide by a decision regularly come to, however unexpected, and that it is unfair to resort to methods, whether direct or indirect, to reverse such a decision. Essentially this is a safeguard for the rights of the minority.|$|R
