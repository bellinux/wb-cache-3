5|$|On 29 January 1536, when Anne miscarried a son, {{the king}} began to reflect {{again on the}} biblical {{prohibitions}} that had haunted him during his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. Shortly after the miscarriage, the king started to {{take an interest in}} Jane Seymour. By 24 April, he had commissioned Cromwell to prepare the case for a divorce. Unaware of these plans, Cranmer had continued to write letters to Cromwell on minor matters up to 22 April. Anne was sent to the Tower of London on 2 May, and Cranmer was urgently summoned by Cromwell. On the very next day, Cranmer {{wrote a letter to the}} king expressing his doubts about the queen's guilt, highlighting his own esteem for Anne. After it was delivered, however, Cranmer was <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the end of Anne's marriage was inevitable. On 16 May, he saw Anne in the Tower and heard her confession and the following day, he pronounced the marriage null and void. Two days later, Anne was executed; Cranmer was one of the few who publicly mourned her death.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{actions in}} the next few years are {{intertwined}} with the history of Stephen's ascension to the throne. Following King Henry I's death in 1135 the succession was disputed between the king's nephews—Stephen and his elder brother, Theobald II, Count of Champagne—and Henry's surviving legitimate child Matilda, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the German Emperor, Henry V. King Henry's only legitimate son, William, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father, who married her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but when Henry I died, Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald II or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald II contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was not <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> loss, and secured the support of the Scottish king, David, her maternal uncle, and in 1138 the support of her half-brother, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I.|$|E

25|$|His {{thoughts}} {{drifted to}} gloom and misanthropy. His mood was not improved {{by the fact}} that by now there was no pretence of keeping up appearances: his marriage had failed. Years earlier he had grown <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lack of love between him and Sarah. He had been visiting prostitutes and displayed more idealised amorous inclinations toward a number of women whose names are lost to history. Now in 1819, he was unable to pay the rent on their rooms at 19 York Street and his family were evicted. That was the last straw for Sarah, who moved into rooms with their son and broke with Hazlitt for good, forcing him to find his own accommodation. He would sometimes see his son and even his wife, with whom he remained on speaking terms, but they were effectively separated.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these substantial additions, in 1799, the Mahratta Raja of Tanjore ceded his kingdom to the East India Company in return for an annuity, while the Nizam surrendered all territory acquired from Tipu Sultan, to the British, in return for an army in his dominions. This latter accession brought the districts of Bellary, Anantapur, Cuddapah and Kurnool, which were known as the Ceded Districts {{on account of the}} circumstances attending upon their accession to the British dominions. The discovery of a body of correspondence between Tipu Sultan and the Nawab of the Carnatic, violative of his alliance with the British, led to a treaty in 1801, whereby the government of his territory of Arcot was <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English, in return for the titular dignity of Prince of Arcot and an annual stipend. Thus, {{the last quarter of the}} 18th century was a period of rapid expansion.|$|E

25|$|Casaubon escapes {{the museum}} through the Paris sewers, {{eventually}} fleeing {{to the countryside}} villa where Belbo had grown up. It is unclear by this point how reliable a narrator Casaubon has been, {{and to what extent}} he has been inventing, or deceived by, conspiracy theories. Casaubon soon learns that Diotallevi succumbed to his cancer at midnight on St. John's Eve, coincidentally the same time Belbo died. The novel ends with Casaubon meditating on the events of the book, apparently <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> (possibly delusional) idea that the Tres will capture him soon. And when they do, he will follow Belbo's lead, refusing to give them any clues, refusing to create a lie. While waiting, holed up in a farmhouse where Belbo lived years before, he finds an old manuscript by Belbo, a sort of diary. He discovers that Belbo had a mystical experience at the age of twelve, in which he perceived ultimate meaning beyond signs and semiotics. He realizes that much of Belbo's behavior and possibly his creation of the Plan and even his death was inspired by Belbo's desire to recapture that lost meaning.|$|E
25|$|Elites in pre-colonial Rwanda {{propagated}} an origin myth of {{the three}} groups to justify the hierarchical relationship of sociopolitical inequality between them in sacred, religious terms. According to this myth, Kigwa, a deity who fell from heaven, had three sons: Gatwa, Gahutu and Gatutsi. He chose an heir by giving each son the responsibility of watching over a pot of milk during the night. Gatwa drank the milk, Gahutu fell asleep and carelessly spilt his pot, and only Gatutsi kept watch, keeping his milk safe. Therefore, Kigwa appointed Gatutsi to be his successor, and Gahutu to be his brother's servant, while Gatwa was to be <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> status of an outsider. Gatutsi would possess cattle and power, and Gahutu would only be allowed to acquire cattle through service to Gatutsi, whereas Gatwa was condemned to the fringe of society. This myth was the basis of the hierarchical relationship that placed the Tutsi at the apex of the social pyramid: above the Hutu, who were in turn above the marginalized Twa. The prevalence of this myth became the basis of the social and political stratification of Rwanda.|$|E

Connery, however, was somewhat <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> project, lacking the enthusiasm he sported for Thunderball. A press conference on his arrival had been tense, [...] "soured by aggressive questioning of Connery's crumpled, jet-lagged appearance".

500|$|A 1965 plan {{signaled}} {{the beginning of}} Tech's expansion to include what is now West Campus. The area west of Hemphill Avenue, for decades the campus' western border, was then a working-class multiracial neighborhood, and Hemphill itself was a major city thoroughfare connecting Buckhead, the Atlantic Steel Mill, Techwood Homes and Downtown. In July 1968, Harrison <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surprise of many in the Georgia Tech community; it was leaked to the press prior to his official announcement, and he subsequently released a public statement, saying that [...] "ten years was {{long enough to be}} president of one university". The true reasons stemmed from his reorganization of the campus administration, and difficulties between Harrison and the Georgia Board of Regents and its chancellor over long-term goals and procedures.|$|E

500|$|As {{late as the}} Siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists {{could still}} believe in their {{eventual}} victory, as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. In late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis's surrender at the Siege of Yorktown reached London; Lord North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. The King drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered, finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised peace negotiations. The Treaties of Paris, by which Britain recognised {{the independence of the}} American states and returned Florida to Spain, were signed in 1782 and 1783. When John Adams was appointed American Minister to London in 1785, George had become <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new relationship between his country and the former colonies.

500|$|The episode {{boasts the}} longest {{title of the}} series and the second-longest of all Star Trek {{television}} installments, behind [...] "For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky" [...] of the 1960s series. [...] "Looking for par'Mach" [...] drew inspiration from the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac, in which a brilliant Frenchman, <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the woman he adores {{will never be able}} to look past his distractingly large nose, helps another man win the lady's heart by dictating beautiful language from nearby. The idea for a modern adaption of Cyrano de Bergerac was proposed by Michael Dorn. [...] "Looking for par'Mach" [...] was directed by Andrew Robinson, who plays the Cardassian Elim Garak on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. This marked the first time that the actor of a recurring (but not main) Star Trek character had directed an episode in the franchise. Having just received two Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards for theatrical directing, Robinson personally asked executive producer Rick Berman to direct an episode of Deep Space Nine; Robinson was pleased to have been assigned this particular episode.|$|E

500|$|During the 1938–39 offseason, Pearson {{became a}} {{contract}} holdout after {{he rejected the}} Yankees' initial offer. [...] Reportedly the same amount he had earned the season before ($10,000), he described the contract offer as [...] "not up to [...] expectations." [...] The two sides eventually agreed to a contract worth $13,500. [...] He kept up his good pitching, garnering the seventh-highest winning percentage (.706) in the AL that year, though his ERA ballooned to 4.49. [...] Throughout the season, problems in his pitching arm flared up again, restricting him to just [...] innings pitched and 20 games started. [...] As a result, his inclusion on the postseason roster was not guaranteed; in late September, McCarthy appeared <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that Pearson would not [...] "be able to help [...] in this series." [...] However, he managed to shrug off his injury woes and was penciled into the starting rotation for Game 2 of the 1939 World Series. [...] Facing the Cincinnati Reds, he held them hitless through [...] innings pitched—eventually giving up just two singles—while striking out eight and walking one in a complete game, 4–0 victory. [...] Pearson's sublime pitching performance {{is considered one of}} the greatest in World Series history; with a game score of 90, it is one of only eight Fall Classic starts to record a game score of 90 or above. [...] The Yankees proceeded to sweep the Reds two games later, resulting in their fourth consecutive championship and giving Pearson the distinction of winning a World Series ring in every season of his Yankees tenure.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} the crew {{were out on the}} {{surrounding}} ice during the night when a break-up of the pack occurred. When morning came, the group, consisting of Tyson, Meyer, six of the seamen, the cook, the steward, and all of the Inuit, found themselves stranded on an ice floe. The castaways could see the Polaris [...] away, but attempts to attract the ship's attention with a large black cloth were futile. <b>Resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ice, the Inuit soon had igloo shelters built, and Tyson estimated that they had [...] of food. They also had the ship's two whaleboats, and two kayaks, although one kayak was soon lost during a breakup of the ice. Meyer reckoned that they were drifting on the Greenland side of the Davis Strait and would soon be within rowing distance of Disko. He was incorrect; the men were actually on the Canadian side of the strait. The error caused the men to reject Tyson's plans for conserving. The seamen soon broke up one of the whaleboats for firewood, making a safe escape to land very unlikely. One night in November, the men went on an eating binge, consuming a large quantity of the food stores. The group drifted on the ice floe {{for the next six months}} over [...] before being rescued off the coast of Newfoundland by the sealer Tigress on April 30, 1873. All probably would have perished had the group not included the skilled Inuit hunters Ebierbing and Hendrik, who were able to kill seal on a number of occasions. Despite this, scarcely a word was written about the Inuit in either the official reports of the expedition, or the press.|$|E
500|$|Dunstan was {{to become}} the most vocal {{opponent}} of the LCL Government of Sir Thomas Playford, strongly criticising its practice of electoral malapportionment, known as the Playmander, a pun on the term gerrymander. This system gave a disproportionate electoral weight to the LCL's rural base, with votes worth as much as ten times others − at the 1968 election the rural seat of Frome had 4,500 formal votes, while the metropolitan seat of Enfield had 42,000 formal votes. He added colour and flair to debate in South Australian politics, changing the existing [...] "gentlemanly" [...] method of conducting parliamentary proceedings. He did not fear direct confrontation with the incumbent government and attacked it with vigour—up to this point most of his Labor colleagues had become dispirited by the Playmander, and were <b>resigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ongoing dominance of Playford and LCL, so they were sought to influence policy through collaborative legislating. In 1954, the LCL introduced the Government Electoral Bill, which was designed to further accentuate the undue weight on rural voters. During the debate, Dunstan decried this [...] "immoral Bill ... I cannot separate it from the motives of those who put it forward. Since it is immoral, so are they." [...] Such language, unusually aggressive by the prevailing standards, resulted in Dunstan's removal from the parliamentary chambers after he refused a request from the Speaker to retract his remark. The first parliamentarian to be expelled in years, Dunstan found himself on the front pages of newspapers for the first time. Nevertheless, {{he was not able to}} build up much of a profile in his first few years as The Advertiser, the dominant newspaper in the city, had a policy of ignoring the young politician's activities—its editor Lloyd Dumas was the father of one of Dunstan's first girlfriends.|$|E
