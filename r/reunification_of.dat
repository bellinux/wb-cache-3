5|$|Weizsäcker {{took office}} {{for his second}} presidential term on 1 July 1989, {{and in the course}} of it he oversaw the end of the Cold War and the <b>Reunification</b> <b>of</b> Germany. Thereupon, Weizsäcker became the first all-German Head of State since Karl Dönitz in May 1945. At midnight on 3 October 1990, during the {{official}} festivities held before the Reichstag building in Berlin to mark the moment of the <b>reunification</b> <b>of</b> Germany, President Weizsäcker delivered the only speech of the night, immediately after the raising of the flag, and before the playing of the National Anthem. His brief remarks, however, were almost inaudible, due to the sound of the bells marking midnight, and of the fireworks that were released to celebrate the moment of reunification. In those remarks he praised the accomplishment of German unity in freedom and in peace. He gave a longer speech at the act of state at the Berliner Philharmonie later that day.|$|E
5|$|When Æthelwulf {{returned}} to England, Æthelbald refused to surrender the West Saxon throne, and Æthelwulf agreed {{to divide the}} kingdom, taking the east and leaving the west in Æthelbald's hands.

50|$|Anhalt {{was raised}} to a principality in 1218 but was divided in 1252 between Henry's sons, forming Anhalt-Aschersleben, Anhalt-Bernburg and Anhalt-Zerbst. Over the centuries, {{numerous}} additional divisions and <b>reunifications</b> <b>of</b> the Anhalt territory took place, resulting {{in the creation of}} Anhalt-Köthen, Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-Pless and Anhalt-Plötzkau, as well as the recreation of several of the divisions; after 1252 it was only ruled as a single entity between 1570 and 1603.|$|R

5|$|Since the {{existing}} tank fleet {{did not meet}} the Spanish army's needs, Spain opened talks with Germany and Krauss-Maffei over the possibility of future collaboration in regards to Spain's future tank, and sent a military delegation to Germany in 1994. Although the Germans offered Spain surplus Leopard 1 tanks and Soviet equipment incorporated into the German army after the <b>reunification</b> <b>of</b> Germany, the Spanish government declined these offers and pressed for the Leopard 2.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{date of the}} war's end is {{also not}} universally agreed upon. It was {{generally}} accepted {{at the time that}} the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2 September 1945). A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951. A treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the <b>reunification</b> <b>of</b> East and West Germany to take place in 1990 and resolved other post-World War II issues.|$|E
40|$|Dependency Drug Courts (DDCs) {{have emerged}} as a {{promising}} method of enhancing the functional status and <b>reunification</b> success <b>of</b> families involved in child welfare and affected by substance use disorders, yet few evaluations {{have appeared in the}} literature to help inform the discussion about their effectiveness. This article reports 24 month outcome findings from the Sacramento DDC. Seventy percent of the participants were women and almost 51 % reported methamphetamine as their primary drug problem. DDC participants had higher rates of treatment participation, with treatment being successful regardless of the parent’s primary drug type. At 24 months, 42. 0 % of the DDC children had reunified versus 27. 2 % of the comparison children. Parents with heroin problems had the lowest rates <b>of</b> <b>reunification</b> and marijuana users had the highest rates <b>of</b> <b>reunification.</b> Rates <b>of</b> recidivism were extremely low for both groups.

5|$|The only {{contemporaneous}} {{record of}} Charles's deeds {{were made by}} a Franciscan friar who was hostile towards the monarch. Instead of emphasizing Charles's achievements in the <b>reunification</b> <b>of</b> the country, the friar described in detail the negative episodes of Charles's reign. In particular, the unusual cruelty that the king showed after Felician Záh's assassination attempt on the royal family contributed to the negative picture of Charles's personality. The Franciscan friar attributed Charles's defeat by Basarab of Wallachia as a punishment from God for the king's revenge.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Hyksos and the <b>reunification</b> <b>of</b> Egypt under Ahmose I, the Theban rulers began to {{construct}} elaborate tombs that reflected their newfound power. The tombs of Ahmose and his son Amenhotep I (their exact location remains unknown) were probably in the Seventeenth Dynasty necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga'. The first royal tombs in the valley were those of Amenhotep I (although this identification is also disputed), and Thutmose I, whose advisor, Ineni, notes in his tomb that he advised the king to place his tomb in the desolate valley (the identity of this actual tomb is unclear, but it is probably KV20 or KV38).|$|E

5|$|Following the <b>reunification</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem in 1967, {{the city}} {{embarked}} on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were {{opened in the}} new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, drawing customers {{away from the city}} center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The clientele of the upscale European boutiques had also aged, and the neighborhoods adjacent to downtown became occupied by poor and Haredi Jews who did not patronize the Triangle. The elegant shops gave way to hummus restaurants, dollar stores, and money changers. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} the Damascus government began an overwhelmingly anti-Iraqi Ba'athist propaganda campaign, {{to which their}} counterparts in Baghdad responded. However, the Iraqi Ba'athists helped Assad, who at the 4th Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch called for the <b>reunification</b> <b>of</b> the Ba'ath Party, {{in his attempt to}} seize power from Jadid. It was reported that Assad promised the Iraqis to recognize Aflaq's historical leadership. Iraq's foreign minister Abd al-Karim al-Shaykli even had his own personal office in the Syrian Ministry of Defence, which Assad headed. However, this should not be misconstrued, the Iraqi Regional Branch was Arab nationalist in name only, and was in fact Iraqi nationalist.|$|E

He earned a Doctor of Theology from the Utrecht University and was ordained into the ministry of the Dutch Reformed Church by the Classis of Amsterdam in 1770.

5|$|From the mid-1940s {{through the}} 1960s, the Triangle was the {{commercial}} and cultural heart of Jerusalem, with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by German-Jewish immigrant businessmen that appealed to an affluent clientele. Following the <b>reunification</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem in 1967 {{and the expansion of}} the city away from the downtown core, the commercial viability of the Triangle declined. The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street and the interior streets of the Triangle to an open-air pedestrian mall in 1982. Over the next two decades, outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in, cementing the reputation of the Triangle as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis.|$|E
5|$|Geographers in the Roman Empire such as Ptolemy {{provided}} a rough {{sketch of the}} eastern Indian Ocean, including the Malay Peninsula and beyond this the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea. Ptolemy's Cattigara was most likely Óc Eo, Vietnam, where Antonine-era Roman items have been found. Ancient Chinese geographers demonstrated a general knowledge of West Asia and Rome's eastern provinces. The 7th-century AD Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote of the contemporary <b>reunification</b> <b>of</b> northern and southern China, which he treated as separate nations recently at war.
