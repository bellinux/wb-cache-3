40|$|Objective: Paraoxonase- 1 (PON- 1) is a highdensity {{lipoprotein}} (HDL) associated enzyme {{involved in}} the protective mechanisms of HDL. Our aim was to compare the effect of treatment with <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> on serum PON- 1 activity. Methods: We performed a prespecif ied prospective study in 68 patients, part of a larger, multicentre randomized study - RADAR (<b>Rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>Atorvastatin</b> in different Dosages And Reverse cholesterol transport). Patients aged 40 - 80 years, all men, with established cardiovascular disease and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 1. 0 mmol/L (< 40 mg/dL) entered a 6 -week dietary run-in period before receiving treatment with rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg daily for 6 weeks. Doses were increased after 6 weeks to rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg and after 12 weeks to rosuvastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg daily. Serum PON- 1 activity and lipid profile were determined at baseline, 6 and 18 weeks. Results: After 18 weeks, the rosuvastatin arm showed a significant increase of PON- 1 activity (6. 39 U/L, p = 0. 02) whereas this was not observed in the atorvastatin arm (1. 84 U/L, p = 0. 77). The difference between groups did not reach significance (p = 0. 11). Both <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> resulted in significant (p = 0. 0001) and similar increases in HDL-C after 6 weeks [0. 06 mmol/L (2. 32 mg/dL) vs. 0. 05 mmol/L (1. 93 mg/dL] and after 18 weeks [0. 10 mmol/L (3. 87 mg/dL) vs. 0. 10 mmol/L (3. 87 mg/dL) ].

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We prospectively {{compared}} the preventive effects of <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) {{in patients with}} chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: We enrolled 1078 consecutive patients with CKD undergoing elective PCI. Patients in Group 1 (n =  273) received rosuvastatin (10 mg), and those in group 2 (n =  805) received atorvastatin (20 mg). The primary end-point was the development of CIN, defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0. 5 mg/dL, or an increase ≥ 25 % from baseline within 48 - 72 h after contrast medium exposure. RESULTS: CIN was observed in 58 (5. 4 %) patients. The incidence of CIN was similar in patients pretreated with either rosuvastatin or atorvastatin (5. 9 % vs. 5. 2 %, p =  0. 684). The same results were also observed when using other definitions of CIN. Clinical and procedural characteristics did not show {{significant differences between the}} two groups (p> 0. 05). Additionally, there were no significant inter-group differences with respect to in-hospital mortality rates (0. 4 % vs. 1. 5 %, p =  0. 141), or other in-hospital complications. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> demonstrated similar efficacies for preventing CIN, after adjusting for potential confounding risk factors (odds ratio =  1. 17, 95 % confidence interval, 0. 62 - 2. 20, p =  0. 623). A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients taking either rosuvastatin or atorvastatin had similar incidences of all-cause mortality (9. 4 % vs. 7. 1 %, respectively; p =  0. 290) and major adverse cardiovascular events (29. 32 % vs. 23. 14 %, respectively; p =  0. 135) during follow-up.

40|$|Statins are agents {{widely used}} to lower LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary and {{secondary}} prevention of coronary heart disease. The five statins available in the UK (simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, <b>atorvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>rosuvastatin)</b> differ in many of their pharmacologic properties. In addition to lowering LDL-C, statins also increase HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) moderately. There have been rare reports of significant HDL-C decreases in patients commenced on fibrates and when thiazolidinediones are added to fibrates. This {{is known as a}} 'paradoxical HDL-C decrease' as both groups of agents usually increase HDL-C. This phenomenon has never been clearly documented following statin therapy. We now describe a patient with type 2 diabetes who showed this paradoxical fall in HDL-C (baseline HDL-C: 1. 8 mmol/L; on simvastatin 40 mg HDL-C 0. 6 mmol/L; on atorvastatin 20 mg HDL-C 0. 9 mmol/L) with a similar decrease in apolipoprotein A 1. No similar decrease was observed with pravastatin <b>and</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> therapy. This phenomenon appeared to be associated with statin treatment and not a statin/fibrate combination.

Measurements were performed in participants (n = 135) at baseline and after 6 weeks on either rosuvastatin (40 mg/day) or atorvastatin (80 mg/day) therapy. Plasma sterols were measured using gas-liquid chromatography. <b>Rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> significantly (P < 0. 001) altered plasma total cholesterol (C) levels by − 40 %, and the ratios of lathosterol/C by − 64 % and − 68 %, and campesterol/C by + 52 % and + 72 %, respectively, with significant differences (P < 0. 001) between the treatment groups for the latter parameter. When using absolute values of these markers, subjects with the greatest reductions in both synthesis (lathosterol) and absorption (campesterol) had significantly greater reductions in total C than subjects in whom the converse was true (− 46 % versus − 34 %, P = 0. 001), with similar effects for LDL-C. <b>Rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> decreased markers of cholesterol synthesis and increased markers of fractional cholesterol absorption, with rosuvastatin having significantly less effect on the latter parameter than atorvastatin.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare a reloading dose of <b>Rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>Atorvastatin</b> administered within 24 h before coronary angioplasty (PCI) in reducing the rate of periprocedural myonecrosis and major cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients on chronic statin treatment undergoing elective PCI. Background: Elective PCI may be complicated with elevation of cardiac biomarkers. Several studies suggested that pretreatment with statins may be associated with a reduction in periprocedural myocardial necrosis. Methods: Three hundred and fifty patients with stable angina who underwent elective PCI were randomly assigned to receive a pre-procedural reloading dose of Rosuvastatin (40 mg) (Rosuvastatin Group-RG n = 175) or Atorvastatin (80 mg) (Atorvastatin Group-AG n = 175) and a control group on chronic statin therapy without reloading (Control-Group-CG). The primary end-point was periprocedural myocardial necrosis and the occurrence of MACCE at 30 -day, 6 - 12 month follow-up. Also we evaluate the rise of periprocedural Troponin T serum levels > 3 x the upper limit of normal. Results: Twelve and 24 -hour post-PCI Creatine Kinase Muscle and Brain (CK-MB) elevation > 3 x occurred more frequently in the CG than in the RG and in the AG (at 24 -h: 25. 0 vs 7. 1; p = 0. 003 and 25. 0 vs 6. 1; p = 0. 001). At 30 -day, 6 -and 12 -month follow-up the incidence of cumulative MACCE was higher in CG than in the RG or AG (at 12 -month: 41. 0 % vs 11. 4 % vs 12. 0 %; p = 0. 001). There was no difference between the RG and AG in terms of myocardial post-procedural necrosis and MACCE occurrence at follow-up. Conclusions: High-dose statin reloading improves procedural and long term clinical outcomes in stable patients on chronic statin therapy.

40|$|Background : The 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG-Co-A) reductase inhibitors, {{also known}} as statins, are the most {{effective}} class of drugs for lowering serum Low-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) concentrations. They are first-line agents for patients who require drug therapy to reduce serum LDL-c concentrations. Although these drugs have been very successful in managing the cardiovascular health of many patients, there are also potential adverse effects that have been identified. The most common adverse effects reported include muscle pain or weakness that can progress to rhabdomyolysis and mortality. If detected early, statin-related symptoms are reversible after withdrawal of the statin. Objective : This research was aimed to know the safety of statin used at Public Hospitals in Yogyakarta. Method : This research was observational study with retrospective data collected.

40|$|ObjectivesThis {{analysis}} from the LUNAR (Limiting UNdertreatment of lipids in ACS with Rosuvastatin) study assessed lipid changes 1 to 4 days after onset of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), before initiation of study treatment. BackgroundEarly studies indicated that cholesterol levels decrease significantly after ACS. However, most studies were small {{or did not}} measure low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) directly, and many used nonfasting or retrospective data. More recent studies suggest less pronounced changes in cholesterol levels after ACS. MethodsThe LUNAR trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label study in adults hospitalized for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI, or unstable angina (UA). Blood samples were taken at median times after onset of ACS symptoms of 26 h (Day 1, fasting or nonfasting sample), 43 h (Day 2, fasting sample), and 84 h (Day 4, fasting sample) for direct measurement of serum lipid levels before study treatments were started. ResultsOf 507 patients available for analysis, 212 were admitted for STEMI, 176 for non-STEMI, and 119 for UA. The LDL-C levels decreased in the 24 h after admission (from 136. 2 to 133. 5 mg/dl), followed by an increase over the subsequent 2 days (to 141. 8 mg/dl). These changes {{did not seem to}} be clinically meaningful. Similar changes were observed for total cholesterol and smaller changes for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; fasting triglyceride levels did not change. ConclusionsMean lipid levels vary relatively little in the 4 days after an ACS and can be used to guide selection of lipid-lowering medication.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between statin-induced increases in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration and statin-induced decreases in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is unknown. The effects of different statins on HDL-C levels, relationships between changes in HDL-C {{and changes in}} LDL-C, and predictors of statin-induced increases in HDL-C have been investigated in an individual patient meta-analysis of 32, 258 dyslipidemic patients included in 37 randomized studies using <b>rosuvastatin,</b> <b>atorvastatin,</b> <b>and</b> simvastatin. The HDL-C raising ability of <b>rosuvastatin,</b> <b>and</b> simvastatin was comparable, with both being superior to atorvastatin.

Secondary objectives include {{a comparison of the}} effects of early-started <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> placebo on inflammatory markers. MethodsThis is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS, symptom onset less than 48 h before admission, and for whom a percutaneous coronary intervention is planned, are eligible for inclusion and are randomized into three groups (G 1, G 2 and G 3). The study comprises two double-blind periods. Period  1 starts at hospital admission and lasts until Day  0 (discharge or less or equal to 6  days after admission); patients in G 1 receive one tablet of <b>rosuvastatin</b> 20 mg/day <b>and</b> patients in G 2 and G 3 receive one matching placebo tablet per day.

40|$|Background and objective: Despite the {{favorable}} effects of reduction of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in decreasing {{the risk of}} coronary heart disease, many patients treated with lipid-lowering HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) do not achieve goal LDL-C levels. This {{may be due to}} high doses of statins prescribed that could potentially induce adverse effects and compromise patient safety and compliance with considerable expense in the long-term. We compared the actions of <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin,</b> administered at the low dosages of 10 and 20 mg/day, respectively, in reducing plasma LDL-C levels and their effects on other components of the atherogenic lipid profile in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. Methods: In this randomized, parallel group, open-label clinical study, 106 patients with LDL-C > 200 mg/dL were treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg/day (group A; n = 52), or atorvastatin 20 mg/day (group B; n = 54) for 48 weeks. Results: At 48 weeks, rosuvastatin 10 mg/day was associated with a significantly greater reduction in plasma LDL-C levels compared with atorvastatin 20 mg/day (– 44. 32 % vs – 30 %; p < 0. 005). Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin also produced a greater reduction in plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels (p < 0. 005). Plasma HDL-C levels were not affected significantly, independent of the drug used. Conclusion: In high-risk patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin 10 mg/day was more efficacious than atorvastatin 20 mg/day in reducing plasma LDL-C levels, enabling goal LDL-C levels to be achieved and improving other lipid parameters.

Objectives: The objectives of the study were to determine and compare the developmental toxicity effects including teratogenic and offspring weight effect of <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> in time mated mice. Methods: Fifty six Balb c mice were divided into seven experimental groups of eight mice each. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were administered at doses of 10, 40, 100 mg/kg/day via oral gavage route once every day for 7 days prior to the mating and continued during the mating and pregnancy period up to delivery. Maternal weight changes and miscarriages were monitored during the pregnancy period. The mice were allowed a vaginal delivery and the offspring were weighed and assessed for gross morphological defects.

40|$|Objective: Lipid {{profiling}} (lipidomics) may {{be useful}} in revealing detailed information with regard to the effects on lipid metabolism, the cardiovascular risk and to differentiate between therapies. The aims of the present study were to: (1) analyze in depth the lipid changes induced by <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> at different dosages; (2) compare differences between the two drugs with respect to the lipid profile change; (3) relate the findings with meaningful pathological mechanisms of coronary artery disease. Research design and methods: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was applied to obtain the metabolite profiles of plasma samples taken from a prospectively defined subset (n = 80) of participants in the RADAR study where a randomly assigned treatment with rosuvastatin or atorvastatin in increasing dosages was administered during an 18 -week period. Results: A number of sphingomyelins (SPMs) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs) correlate with the different effects of the two statins on the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Rosuvastatin increased the plasma concentration of PCs after 6 and 18 weeks, while atorvastatin reduced the plasma concentrations of PCs at both timepoints and dosages (p < 0. 01 for between-treatment comparison). Both atorvastatin and rosuvastatin lowered plasma SPMs concentrations, but atorvastatin demonstrated a more pronounced effect with the highest dose (p = 0. 03). Rosuvastatin resulted in a significantly more effective lowering of the [SPMs/(SPMs + PCs) ] ratio than atorvastatin at any close/timepoint (p < 0. 05), a ratio reported to be of clinical importance in coronary artery disease.

40|$|Statins {{are known}} to have cholesterol-independent {{pleiotropic}} effects, such as upregulation of the enzyme ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase. These effects may contribute to the protective effect of statins against ischemia and reperfusion (IR). Interestingly, pleiotropic effects have been shown to differ between hydrophilic and lipophilic statins. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) represents a largely nitric oxide-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation and has been shown to decrease after exposure to IR in humans. FMD has been validated to study (pharmacological) interventions in IR injury. We examined the effect of a short-term (3 - 7 days) statin pretreatment on brachial artery endothelial function before and after IR, and whether the effect on brachial artery endothelial function differs between <b>rosuvastatin</b> (hydrophilic statin) <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> (lipophilic statin). Our results show that IR significantly decreases FMD; however, statin pretreatment did not alter the effect of IR on FMD (irrespective of treatment duration or type of statin used). This experiment suggests that the cardioprotective effects of statins (both lipophilic and hydrophilic) against IR are not mediated through preservation of endothelial function...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: The {{efficacy}} <b>and</b> {{safety of}} <b>rosuvastatin,</b> <b>atorvastatin,</b> <b>and</b> placebo were compared {{in patients with}} the metabolic syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with the metabolic syndrome with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > or = 3. 36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) and multiple risk factors conferring a 10 -year coronary heart disease risk score of > 10 % were randomized (2 : 2 : 1) to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, or placebo for 6 weeks. Subsequently, the <b>rosuvastatin</b> 10 mg <b>and</b> placebo groups received <b>rosuvastatin</b> 20 mg <b>and</b> the <b>atorvastatin</b> 10 mg group received atorvastatin 20 mg for 6 weeks. LDL-C was reduced significantly more in patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg when compared with those receiving atorvastatin 10 mg at 6 weeks [intention-to-treat (ITT) population by randomized treatment: 41. 7 vs. 35. 7 %, P < 0. 001; ITT population by as-allocated treatment: 42. 7 vs. 36. 6 %, P < 0. 001]. Significant LDL-C reductions were also observed in patients receiving rosuvastatin when compared with those receiving atorvastatin at 12 weeks (48. 9 vs. 42. 5 %, P < 0. 001). More patients achieved LDL-C goals with rosuvastatin when compared with atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin. Treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: At equivalent doses, rosuvastatin had a significantly greater effect than atorvastatin in lowering LDL-C and improving the lipid profile and was well tolerated in patients with the metabolic syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Background: Achieving the {{greatest}} reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins requires the optimum dose and potency of statin. Using {{data from the}} VOYAGER meta-analysis, we determined doses of <b>rosuvastatin,</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> <b>and</b> simvastatin that induce equal reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C). Methods: Least squares mean percentage change in LDL-C and non-HDL-C was calculated using 38, 052 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 5 - 40 [*]mg, atorvastatin 10 - 80 [*]mg and simvastatin 10 - 80 [*]mg. Equipotent doses were estimated by linear interpolation between actual adjacent doses. Results: Rosuvastatin 5 [*]mg reduced LDL-C by 39 % and non-HDL-C by 35 %. Equivalent reductions in LDL-C required atorvastatin 15 [*]mg or simvastatin 39 [*]mg. Equivalent reductions in non-HDL-C required atorvastatin 14 mg or simvastatin 42 [*]mg. Rosuvastatin 10 [*]mg reduced LDL-C by 44 % and non-HDL-C by 40 %. Equivalent reductions in LDL-C required atorvastatin 29 mg or simvastatin 72 [*]mg. Equivalent reductions in non-HDL-C required atorvastatin 27 mg or simvastatin 77 [*]mg. Rosuvastatin 20 [*]mg reduced LDL-C by 50 % and non-HDL-C by 45 %. Equivalent reductions in LDL-C <b>and</b> non-HDL-C required <b>atorvastatin</b> 70 mg <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> 62 [*]mg, respectively, and were not achieved with the maximum 80 [*]mg dose of simvastatin. Rosuvastatin 40 [*]mg reduced LDL-C by 55 % and non-HDL-C by 50 %. Comparable reductions were not achieved with the maximum 80 [*]mg doses of atorvastatin or simvastatin. Conclusions: Regarding reductions in LDL-C <b>and</b> non-HDL-C, each <b>rosuvastatin</b> dose is equivalent to doses 3 - 3. 5 times higher for <b>atorvastatin</b> <b>and</b> 7 - 8 times higher for simvastatin.

40|$|Background: The {{ratio of}} low-density {{lipoprotein}} cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) is a reliable predictor of cardiovascular risk. Low HDL-C levels {{in patients with}} coronary artery disease {{are associated with a}} high risk for cardiovascular events. Objectives: This study compared the effects of <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> on the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio in patients with cardiovascular disease and low HDL-C. Methods: Patients aged 40 - 80 years with established cardiovascular disease and HDL-C < 1. 0 mmol/L (< 40 mg/dL) entered a 6 -week dietary run-in period, before randomisation to open-label treatment with rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 230) or atorvastatin 20 mg (n = 231) for 6 weeks. Doses were increased after 6 weeks to rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg, and after 12 weeks to rosuvastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg. Serum lipid parameters were measured at baseline and 6, 12 and 18 weeks. Results: After 6 weeks of treatment, mean percentage change from baseline in LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was - 47. 0 % in the rosuvastatin group and - 41. 9 % in the atorvastatin group (p < 0. 05 for between-group comparison). After 12 and 18 weeks of treatment, change from baseline was - 53. 0 % and - 57. 3 %, respectively, for rosuvastatin, compared with - 47. 9 % and - 49. 6 %, respectively, for atorvastatin (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 001, respectively, for between-group comparison). Rosuvastatin also reduced LDL-C, total cholesterol and non-HDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin at all three time points, and significantly improved total cholesterol/HDL-C and apolipoprotein B/A-I ratios. Conclusions: Rosuvastatin 10, 20 and 40 mg is significantly more effective than atorvastatin 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively, in improving the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio in patients with cardiovascular disease and low HDL-C.

However, three such trials have been computer-simulated using the Archimedes model, an individual-based simulation of human physiology and behaviors, treatment interventions, and health care systems. The results are reviewed here. Methods: The first simulated trial assessed clinical outcomes in patients receiving available doses of the two drugs. The second assessed the impact of initial treatment decisions, while the third assessed the effect of switching from rosuvastatin to atorvastatin. Results: In the first simulated trial, treatment with rosuvastatin was estimated to result in greater reductions than treatment with atorvastatin in major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rates at 5 years and 20 years at all doses examined (relative risk [RR]: 0. 897, 0. 888, and 0. 930 at 5 years for rosuvastatin 20 mg vs atorvastatin 40 mg, rosuvastatin 40 mg vs atorvastatin 80 mg, and rosuvastatin 20 mg vs atorvastatin 80 mg, respectively; all P< 0. 05). In the second simulated trial, outcomes were significantly better in patients initially prescribed rosuvastatin than in those initially prescribed atorvastatin (RR of MACE at 5 years: 0. 918; P< 0. 001). In the third simulated trial, risk of MACE was significantly greater in patients switching from rosuvastatin to atorvastatin than in those remaining on rosuvastatin (RR at 5 years: 1. 109; P< 0. 001). Conclusion: The results of these simulated {{clinical trials}} suggest improved outcomes among patients receiving rosuvastatin relative to patients receiving atorvastatin in various clinical settings.

40|$|Membrane {{transporters}} {{are widely}} recognized for {{their role in}} drug disposition in humans. Differences in drug concentration among individuals for drugs used to treat cardiovascular diseases, such as statins and ezetimibe, may result from alteration in hepatic and intestinal transporter function due to genetic, clinical or environmental factors, causing variability in drug efficacy or toxicity. The closely related uptake transporters organic anion-transporting polypeptides OATP 1 B 3 and OATP 1 B 1, are expressed in human liver sharing numerous drug substrates, including 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins. Recently, a transport-deficient OATP 1 B 1 variant was associated with increased statin exposure and toxicity, however little is known regarding the functional relevance of genetic variation in OATP 1 B 3. We assessed OATP 1 B 3 coding sequence and identified novel polymorphisms; two variants displayed impaired rosuvastatin transport in vitro. OATP 1 B 3 polymorphisms may represent an unrecognized determinant of statin disposition. The organic solute transporter (OST) αβ is highly expressed in human ileum and {{plays a key role}} in bile acid transport from the intestinal lumen into portal blood. However, drug substrates are largely unexplored and the transporter 2 ̆ 7 s role in intestinal drug absorption is unknown. We identified four novel drug substrates of OSTαβ, including <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin,</b> and characterized an OSTβ variant with impaired transport in vitro. Utilizing biopsy samples, we observed abundant expression in ileum but also duodenum and colon. In Ostα-/- mice, we demonstrated increased rosuvastatin concentration in plasma and liver compared to wild-type, further suggesting a role for OSTαβ in drug transport. Targeted inhibition of intestinal cholesterol transport by ezetimibe is another cholesterol-lowering approach showing marked interpatient variation, likely resulting from differences in plasma exposure. Evidence suggests a role of drug transporters in circulating ezetimibe concentrations. We observed 67 -fold variability in ezetimibe concentration, and 140 -fold variability in ezetimibe glucuronide concentration, an active metabolite, in 152 patients taking ezetimibe. We identified age, BMI, gender and concomitant fenofibrate use as major determinants of ezetimibe exposure, whereas transporter polymorphisms were less important predictors; a reduced-function OATP 1 B 3 variant was associated with metabolite-to-parent ratio but not drug level. These findings illustrate additional mechanistic insights that show the importance of hepatic and intestinal membrane transporters to drug disposition...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Adverse event reports (AERs) {{submitted}} to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to assess the muscular and renal adverse events induced by the administration of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and to attempt to determine the rank-order of the association. Methods: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, AERs involving pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative detection of signals, i. e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Myalgia, rhabdomyolysis {{and an increase in}} creatine phosphokinase level were focused on as the muscular adverse events, and acute renal failure, non-acute renal failure, and an increase in blood creatinine level as the renal adverse events. Results: Based on 1, 644, 220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, signals were detected for 4 statins with respect to myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, and an increase in creatine phosphokinase level, but these signals were stronger for <b>rosuvastatin</b> than pravastatin <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin.</b> Signals were also detected for acute renal failure, though in the case of atorvastatin, the association was marginal, and furthermore, a signal was not detected for non-acute renal failure or for an increase in bloo...|$|R

40|$|Background. International {{guidelines}} {{emphasize the}} need to achieve recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels {{in order to reduce}} morbidity and mortality associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). However, many patients with hypercholesterolemia fail to achieve LDL-C goals on treatment. Objective: the primary objective was to compare the efficacy of <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin</b> for enabling patients to achieve National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) LDL-C goals. Secondary objectives were European LDL-C goal achievement, changes in the lipid profile, and safety. Research design and methods: This 12 -week, multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label trial compared the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin 10 mg with atorvastatin 10 mg in statin-naive and switched patients with primary hypercholesterolemia from Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Portugal, and Venezuela. Results: A total of 1124 patients with similar baseline characteristics were randomized to the two treatment groups. After 12 weeks of treatment, a significantly greater percentage of patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg compared with atorvastatin 10 mg achieved NCEP ATP III LDL-C goals (71. 2 % vs 61. 4 %, p < 0. 001), 1998 European LDL-C goals (73. 5 % vs 59. 2 %, p < 0. 001) and 2003 European LDL-C goals (58. 9 % vs 44. 6 %, p < 0. 001). Rosuvastatin treatment was associated with significant reductions in LDL-C and total cholesterol (TC) and, in statin-naive patients, a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with atorvastatin treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated with a similar incidence of adverse events. Clinically significant elevations in creatinine, creatine kinase or hepatic transaminases were low and similar between treatment groups. Conclusions: Rosuvastatin 10 mg is significantly more effective at achieving NCEP ATP III and European LDL-C goals, lowering LDL-C and TC in both naive and switched patients and increasing HDL-C in naive patients than atorvastatin 10 mg, with a similar safety and tolerability profile.

40|$|Background: The {{extent to}} which {{individual}} statins vary in terms of clinical outcomes across all populations, in addition to secondary and primary prevention has not been studied extensively in meta-analyses. Methods: We systematically studied 199, 721 participants in 92 placebo-controlled and active-comparator trials comparing atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin in participants with, or at risk of developing, cardiovascular disease. We performed pairwise and network meta-analyses for major coronary events and all-cause mortality outcomes, {{taking into account the}} dose differences across trials. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO 2011 :CRD 42011001470. Results: There were only a few trials that evaluated fluvastatin. Most frequent comparisons occurred between pravastatin and placebo, atorvastatin and placebo, and <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin.</b> No trial directly compared all six statins to each other. Across all populations, statins were significantly more effective than control in reducing all-cause mortality (OR 0. 87, 95 % credible interval 0. 820. 92) and major coronary events (OR 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 640. 75). In terms of reducing major coronary events, atorvastatin (OR 0. 66, 95 % CI 0. 480. 94) and fluvastatin (OR 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 360. 95) were significantly more effective than rosuvastatin at comparable doses. In participants with cardiovascular disease, statins significantly reduced deaths (OR 0. 82, 95 % CI 0. 750. 90) and major coronary events (OR 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 620. 77). Atorvastatin was significantly more effective than pravastatin (OR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 430. 99) and simvastatin (OR 0. 68, 95 % CI 0. 380. 98) for secondary prevention of major coronary events. In primary prevention, statins significantly reduced deaths (OR 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 830. 99) and major coronary events (OR 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 610. 79) with no differences among individual statins. Across all populations, atorvastatin (80 %), fluvastatin (79 %), and simvastatin (62 %) had the highest overall probability of being the best treatment in terms of both outcomes. Higher doses of atorvastatin and fluvastatin had the highest number of significant differences in preventing major coronary events compared with other statins. No significant heterogeneity or inconsistency was detected. Conclusions: Statins significantly reduce the incidence of all-cause mortality and major coronary events as compared to control in both secondary and primary prevention. This analysis provides evidence for potential differences between individual statins, which are not fully explained by their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-reducing effects. The observed differences between statins should be investigated in future prospective studies...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: the {{objective}} {{of this study was to}} analyze adherence to therapeutic guidelines among patients treated with lipid lowering drugs (statins). MATERIAL AND METHODS: a retrospective observational study including 5 Local Health Units (LHUs) was conducted using administrative databases. Patients who received at least one prescription for statins between January 1 st, 2007 and June 30 th, 2008 were selected and followed for 12 months. Patients were classified according to their level of absolute cardiovascular risk (moderate, high, very high according to Nota 13 AIFA). RESULTS: a total of 71, 855 patients were included (14, 133 newly treated patients with statins, representing 19. 4 % of total sample), (age 68. 8 ± 10. 7, male 51 %). Level of absolute cardiovascular risk were: moderate risk (45. 4 %), high risk (33. 4 %), very high risk (16. 3 %), familial hypercholesterolemia (4. 9 %). Statins assumed by patients in analysis were stratified in two groups (first or second choice), accordingly to their efficacy (level of LDL cholesterol reduction) in relation to the patient’s cardiovascular risk (coherently with new Nota 13 AIFA, 2011). Among patients with a very high cardiovascular risk, only 52. 8 % used statins indicated by Nota 13 as a first choice while 2. 9 % used a second choice statin and 44. 3 % used an inadequate statin and/or dosage; among familial hypercholesterolemia patients, those percentages were, respectively: 53. 8 %, 21. 1 % and 25. 1 %. When only patients naïve to statins treatment were analyzed, similar percentages were found. Only few patients in very high risk group used adequate dosages: among patients treated with <b>rosuvastatin</b> <b>and</b> <b>atorvastatin,</b> 11. 2 % used atorvastatin 40 mg, and 0. 2 % used atorvastatin 80 mg (this population was not analyzed for events because of low numerosity) while 4. 1 % used rosuvastatin 20 mg and 0. 2 % used rosuvastatin 40 mg; overall, 84. 3 % of patients in this group used inadequate dosages. Cardiovascular events at one year of follow up were 1. 6 % for patients treated with rosuvastatin 20 mg, 1. 6 % for rosuvastatin 40 mg and 6. 1 % for atorvastatin 40 mg; death rates (any cause) were 0. 9 %, 0. 0 %, 2. 6 % respectively. The analysis of the sub-population of patients treated with rosuvastatin 20 mg with previous CV event showed a percentage of patients with a CV event during the observational period of 3. 4 %, a percentage of patients with cerebrovascular event of 0. 9 % and a mortality percentage of 0. 9 %.

40|$|AbstractDeveloped and {{optimized}} a validated isocratic reverse phase HPLC {{separation of}} <b>Rosuvastatin,</b> Telmisartan, Ezetimibe <b>and</b> <b>Atorvastatin</b> in pharmaceutical preparation using response surface methodology. The separation {{was carried out}} by using phenomenex C 18 column (15 cm× 4. 6 mm id, 5 μm particle size) and UV detection at 239 nm. The ranges of the independent variables used for the optimization were MeCN: 33 – 38 %, buffer conc. : 10 – 20 mM and flow rate: 1 – 2 ml/min. The influence of these independent variables on the output responses: capacity factor of the first peak (k 1), resolutions of the 2 nd and 3 rd peak (Rs 2, 3), and capacity factor of the fifth peak (k 5) were evaluated. Using this strategy, a mathematical model was defined and a response surface was derived for the separation. The three responses were simultaneously optimized by using Derringer's desirability functions. Optimum conditions chosen for the assay were MeCN, MeOH, 20 mM K 2 HPO 4 (pH 3. 0 ± 0. 2) solution (34. 27 : 20 : 45. 73 v/v/v) and flow rate 2 ml/min. Total chromatographic analysis time per sample was approximately 10 min. The optimized assay condition was validated as per the ICH guidelines and applied for the quantitative analysis of Rosavel EZ, Avas-EZ and Lipisar 20 tablet. The developed method was simple, accurate and precise. Hence, it can be employed for the routine analysis in quality control laboratories...|$|R
