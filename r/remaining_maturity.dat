40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to compare the Hull-White short rate model to the Cheyette short rate model. The Cheyette short rate model is a {{stochastic}} volatility model, that is introduced to improve the fit of the implied volatility skew to the market skew. Both models are implemented with piecewise constant parameters to match the term structure. We calibrate the Cheyette model to the EURO, USD and KRW swaption markets and compare the calibration results to the Hull-White model. We propose an efficient implementation method {{to speed up the}} calibration process. In general we see that the Cheyette model gives indeed a better fit, in particular for the EURO and KRW markets. The models with calibrated parameters are used to price exotic interest rate derivatives by Monte Carlo simulation. Comparing the results of the Cheyette model to the results of the Hull-White model, can give insight in the skew and curvature impact on exotic interest rate derivatives. We consider digital caplets, digital caps, range accrual swaps, callable range acrruals and a callable <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity</b> swap. The price impact on digital caplets and digital caps are in line with static replication. By this we mean that the prices computed with static replication are better matched by the Cheyette model than by the Hull-White model. For the callable range accrual on LIBOR we have to be more careful, since a one-factor model cannot be calibrated to two market skews per option maturity. This implies that the price of the underlying range accrual is not in line with static replication, since we calibrate to co-terminal swaptions, while the underlying depends on the cap market. For the callable <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity</b> swap we do not encounter this issue, since the underlying depends on the same co-terminal swaption skews. For a callable RMS we observe that the Hull and White model underestimates the option price, compared to the Cheyette model.

40|$|In this paper, we {{conduct a}} {{regression}} {{analysis on the}} spread over Libor (LS) on the domestic straight bond trading market in Japan from May 1997 through March 1998. Our analysis shows that, for non-construction issues, the lower the rating the higher the LS, and that the LS differential among issues with different ratings has expanded since around November 1997 {{against the background of}} a growing awareness of credit risk. Our analysis also shows that during the analysis period (May 1997 through March 1998) the coupon rate, which was previously a significant explanatory variable for the LS, lost its significance, and that the coefficient of the <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity,</b> which is also an explanatory variable, switched from negative to positive (the longer the period remaining until maturity, the higher the LS). The heightened awareness of credit risk among investors apparently contributed to both these phenomena, and the latter is particularly noteworthy because it is consistent with the results of empirical analyses in the United States. Finally, for construction issues, our analysis showed that the LS continued to increase following the bankruptcy of several construction companies during the summer of 1997, and that an extremely large premium has arisen for certain issues. ...|$|E

40|$|Receiving {{the same}} {{fractional}} recovery of par at default for bonds {{of the same}} issuer and seniority, regardless of <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity,</b> has been labelled in the academic literature as a Recovery of Face Value at Default (RFV). Such a recovery form results from language found in typical bond indentures and is supported by empirical evidence from defaulted bond values. We incorporate RFV into an exogenous boundary structural credit risk model and compare its e ect to more typical recovery forms found in such models. We find that the chosen recovery form can significantly a ect valuation and the sensitivities produced by these models, thus having important implications for empirical studies attempting to validate structural credit risk models. We show that some features of existing structural models {{are a result of}} the recovery form assumed in the model and do not necessarily hold under an RFV recovery form. Some of our results complement those found in the literature which examines the endogeneity of the default boundary. We find that some features that may have been solely attributed to modelling the boundary as an optimal decision by the firm can be obtained in an exogenous boundary framework with RFV. This has direct implications for studies which attempt to determine whether endogenous or exogenous models are better supported empirically. We extend our results to incorporate a multifactor default-free term structure model and examine the impact of the recovery form in estimating the cost of debt capital within a structural model framework. ...|$|E

The corporate bond market in India demonstrates poor investor participation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present an account of piece wise cubic spline methodology of yield estimation that can be feasibly implemented by practitioners. This paper attempts to approximate the corporate bond yield using residual maturity for listed and traded bonds using traded data from the period January 2001 to October 2014. We use a two stage process, where in the first stage, we model the yield behavior of corporate bonds against their residual maturity nodes of 3 years, 5 years and 20 years, respectively. In the second stage, we identify the significant factors of bond liquidity that impacts the cubic spline residual to improve accuracy in estimation. The first step of piece wise cubic spline estimates the 3 node parameters to predict the logarithmic yield to maturities against their <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity</b> in years. The second step intends to analyze the prediction errors and provides for correction in accuracy incorporating factors of bond liquidity such as issuer, issue and liquidity factors, respectively. The dual approach explains the variation in yields and could be used for identifying quality papers and the reasons for lower investor participation in bond markets and for arriving at term structure in related markets.

40|$|Deep-water sharks exhibit species-specific {{reproductive}} strategies, {{which include}} segregation by sex, size and reproductive stage. However, {{due to the}} wide spatial distribution of most species, available information, usually collected at a regional scale, is usually not adequate to infer species reproductive spatial dynamics. This study draws together information {{on the distribution of}} reproductive stages of three species of squaliform sharks: Portuguese dogfish Centroscymnus coelolepis (Somniosidae), leafscale gulper shark Centrophorus squamosus (Centrophoridae) and birdbeak dogfish Deania calcea (Centrophoridae), gathering data from several geographical areas from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. For each species we analysed the sex ratio and the spatial patterns of reproductive stages within regions, considering the influence of geographical area, depth, season, temperature and salinity. The combination of statistical methods used in this study successfully identified a number of life history patterns which reflect different use of habitats by sex and life cycle stage. Pregnant females of the three species are spatially segregated, inhabiting shallower and/or warmer waters. In the case of the leafscale gulper shark this segregation might be associated with large scale migrations. In contrast, in Portuguese dogfish all adult maturity stages occur in the same geographical area. Pregnant female birdbeak dogfish were rare in all samples. Larger immature specimens of all the three species distribute deeper than the <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity</b> stages in most of the regions analysed. Mature males of leafscale gulper shark and birdbeak dogfish were more broadly distributed than mature females, supporting the possibility of sex-biased dispersal. Neonates and small sized specimens were scarce in the Northeast Atlantic potentially explained by their concentration in nurseries, and/or by gear selectivity. Management measures will benefit from considering the geographic scale of demographic variation between species. However, standardized collaborative approaches will be needed for comprehensive assessment. Publicado...|$|E

40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} this study is to didactically {{demonstrate}} the factors shaping the currency swap stock of domestic banks prior to the crisis and to provide a descriptive analysis of how the structure and the functioning of the market changed during the crisis. The main conclusions of the study are as follows. In addition to the wide ranging applicability of the transaction, the rise in the currency swap stock of domestic credit institutions is also attributable to macroeconomic factors. The bulk of the exchange rate risk resulting from the high external borrowing requirement and rising external debt was carried by the domestic private sector, while the foreign sector shared a decreasing portion of the risk. The rapid increase in the swap stock was also due to the fact that the synthetic production of foreign currency funds with currency swaps was often more successful than the direct inflow of foreign currency funds. On the basis of the decomposition of the domestic banking system’s on-balance sheet foreign currency position, we can state that it increased mainly as a result of items that also increased the balance sheet total. Following the outbreak of the global financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, the conditions for ensuring foreign currency liquidity deteriorated significantly, which had a substantial effect on implied forint yields, and the turnover and structure of the swap market. While the total average turnover of the domestic FX swap market did not drop radically when the crisis was spreading, market liquidity did decline significantly for a few days and access to foreign currency liquidity became limited. The active role assumed by parent banks and shortening maturities contributed to moderating the decline in turnover. Anecdotal information relating to the tightening of counterparty limits vis-a-vis domestic banks is supported by the decline in the number of non-resident counterparties. The crisis also contributed to changes in the structure of the swap stock. The average <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity</b> of the gross stock began to decline directly after the Lehman bankruptcy, at the time of global dollar liquidity problems, followed by a rise starting from early 2009, principally owing to transactions concluded with parent banks. Domestic subsidiary banks managed to increase maturity primarily through cross-currency swap transactions concluded with intra-group counterparties, but non-group counterparties also concluded transactions with longer maturity with domestic banks.

40|$|This Guide to the {{international}} banking statistics is intended to serve two main purposes: firstly, to provide reporting countries with definitions and guidelines for the reporting of data; secondly, to give {{a detailed account of}} current country practices regarding the coverage and disaggregation of the reported data. The Guide describes two statistical systems, the locational banking statistics and the consolidated banking statistics. It replaces the previous issue (July 2000) and includes numerous changes and updates to the tables on countries' reporting practices. The locational banking statistics, which are described in Part I, gather quarterly data on international financial claims and liabilities of bank offices resident in the reporting countries broken down by currency, sector and country of residence of counterparty, and by nationality of reporting banks. In this system, both domestic and foreign-owned banking offices in the reporting countries record their positions on a gross (unconsolidated) basis, including those vis-à-vis own affiliates, which is consistent with the principles of national accounts, balance of payments and external debt statistics. The statistics were introduced with a breakdown by major individual currencies and a partial sectoral and geographical breakdown {{at the beginning of the}} 1970 s to provide information on the development and growth of the eurocurrency markets. In the subsequent years, the issue of recycling oil-related surpluses and the accompanying rise in international indebtedness shifted the emphasis in favour of a more detailed geographical breakdown and of flow data. The outbreak of the debt crisis in the early 1980 s stimulated further efforts to refine both the geographical coverage of the data and the estimates of exchange rate adjusted flows. In the early 1990 s, strong interest arose in making use of these statistics to improve the coverage and accuracy of the recording of balance of payments transactions. Following the financial crises in emerging economies in the late 1990 s the locational banking statistics became an important component of the Joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank Statistics on External Debt, which were developed in response to requests for dissemination of more timely external debt indicators. The consolidated banking statistics, which are described in Part II, collect quarterly data on banks' international financial claims broken down by <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity</b> and sector of borrower. In addition, they include information on exposures by country of immediate borrower and on the reallocation of claims (ie risk transfers) to the country of ultimate risk. The latter is defined as the country where the guarantor of a claim resides. The data mainly cover claims reported by domestic bank head offices, including the exposures of their foreign affiliates, and are collected on a worldwide consolidated basis with inter-office positions being netted out. The statistics also provide separate data on international claims of foreign bank offices whose head offices are located outside the reporting countries on an unconsolidated basis. The statistics were introduced as a semiannual reporting exercise in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s to provide information on the country risk exposures of major individual nationality banking groups to developing countries. Following the financial crises in emerging economies in the late 1990 s, the consolidated banking statistics were enhanced to include complete country coverage of banks' on-balance sheet exposures, separate country data on an ultimate risk basis and a move to a quarterly reporting frequency. In response to recommendations of a working group of the CGFS, and in order to maintain the consolidated banking statistics as a key source of public information on international financial market developments, it is planned to improve the measurement of commercial banks' consolidated country risk exposures on an ultimate risk basis. Consequently, the statistics will, as from end- 2004, cover more detailed and comprehensive data on country risk exposures inclusive of derivatives and other off-balance sheet positions. Part III of this Guide provides a glossary of terms used in the locational and consolidated banking statistics, while part IV contains a list of international organisations (Appendix 1) and official monetary authorities (Appendix 2). Beginning in 1998, the BIS has invited a number of additional countries, in particular from emerging markets, to participate in {{the international}} banking statistics. This is intended to further increase the global coverage of the statistics. So far, 12 economies have joined the locational (Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Guernsey, India, Isle of Man, Jersey, Panama, Portugal, Taiwan (China) and Turkey) and nine have joined the consolidated (Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India, Panama, Portugal, Singapore, Taiwan (China), and Turkey) banking statistics, with more countries expected to be included in the near future. The Guide has been prepared with the assistance of the central banks or official authorities contributing to the two sets of international banking statistics. The BIS is grateful to all these institutions for their cooperation and valuable advice in its preparation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to discuss the risks that quantitative easing (QE) may pose to market liquidity. The objective is to assess if the magnitude or the design of the ECB's public sector purchase programme (PSPP) undermines the market liquidity of purchased securities. This research focuses on the German government debt securities market. Market participants have warned that the effective supply of German government debt securities is low in relation to PSPP purchases, which could cause scarcity and undermine market liquidity. The PSPP could weaken the market liquidity of purchased securities by reducing their effective market supply. The scarcity could also cause shortage of collateral in the repo market, which would increase hedging costs and contribute to higher market making costs. As a result, the PSPP could discourage market making in the purchased securities, which would undermine liquidity resilience. In addition, a particularly low level of market liquidity could suppress the price discovery mechanism, which would diminish the effectiveness of QE's portfolio balance channel. Transaction level data on PSPP purchases is not publicly available, which rules out a detailed analysis on the PSPP’s stock and flow effects. Instead, {{this research}} utilizes an event study approach to measure the impact of the EAPP announcement in January 2015 on the market liquidity of PSPP-eligible securities. The event study {{is based on the assumption}} that the quoted bid-ask spreads partly reflect market makers' expectations of market making costs. This research also determines which securities were most and least likely purchased under the PSPP. The price discovery and liquidity resilience of those securities is then measured from March 2014 until March 2016. This research utilizes Reuters Datastream’s data on prices and bid-ask quotes. The results suggest that the PSPP did not undermine the market liquidity of purchased securities to a significant degree. Indeed, price discovery and liquidity resilience did not deteriorate among those securities that were most likely purchased under the PSPP. However, after the EAPP announcement, the relative bid-ask spreads widened among those PSPP-eligible securities with <b>remaining</b> <b>maturities</b> of over ten years...|$|R
