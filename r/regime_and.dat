40|$|Global {{production}} and trade networks have significant transformative effects on production regimes across the Global South, {{and tend to}} produce particular work <b>regimes</b> <b>and</b> workplaces at the sites of production. CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) interventions similarly seek to reshape production processes in their search to improve labour conditions and protect workers’ rights. However, workers’ voices and their preferences for particular work <b>regimes</b> <b>and</b> employment conditions are rarely considered in such debates. Drawing on data from the Tiruppur garment cluster in South India, the article presents ethnographic evidence on what workers themselves make of the work <b>regimes</b> <b>and</b> ethical codes of labour practice produced under neoliberal governance. It explores how garment workers engage with different labour <b>regimes</b> <b>and</b> why some workers actively seek to avoid employment in companies where Fordist <b>regimes</b> prevail <b>and</b> CSR policies are implemented. Such avoidance and exit strategies amount to a critique of particular neoliberal labour regimes that seek to control labour and curtail its freedom and dignity at work...|$|R
5|$|While {{incurring}} significant casualties {{fighting the}} Black Legion, the Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia {{benefited from the}} mass desertion of Partisans and the many pro-Chetnik coups in Partisan and volunteer detachments. Despite their lack of unity, the Chetnik movement thrived in eastern Bosnia for the reminder of 1942 because some Chetnik leaders made accommodations with the Ustaše <b>regime</b> <b>and</b> as many Chetniks and Partisans were unwilling to kill fellow Bosnian Serbs of the opposing faction.|$|E
5|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did {{not have}} any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of Health. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered nothing. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political <b>regime,</b> <b>and</b> that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.|$|E

5|$|By 829, {{when the}} young emperor Theophilos ascended the Byzantine throne, the Byzantines and Arabs had been {{fighting}} {{on and off for}} almost two centuries. At this time, Arab attacks resumed both in the east, where after almost twenty years of peace due to the Abbasid civil war Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) launched several large-scale raids, and in the west, where the gradual Muslim conquest of Sicily was under way since 827. Theophilos was an ambitious man and also a convinced adherent of Byzantine Iconoclasm, which prohibited the depiction of divine figures and the veneration of icons. He sought to bolster his <b>regime</b> <b>and</b> support his religious policies by military success against the Abbasid Caliphate, the Empire's major antagonist.|$|E

As to Finland's separation from Russia, Germany hastened it, in order to get Finland within the German power sphere. France broke off diplomatic relations to the White government of the 1918 war, due to the Whites' co-operation with Germany.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{football}} managers in the modern sense of the word, taking full charge of the team, rather than letting board members pick the side. As well as his tactical innovations, he was also a strong believer in physical fitness in football – he instituted a strict training <b>regime</b> <b>and</b> the use of physiotherapists and masseurs. He encouraged his players to openly discuss tactics and the game, instituting weekly team meetings at his clubs, and encouraged them to socialise in extra-curricular activities such as golf. He wrote regularly on football for the Sunday Express newspaper, and a collection of his writings was published after his death in a book, entitled Herbert Chapman on Football.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{political}} differences among factions in the Polish exile government, and in particular, SZP {{ties to the}} Sanacja regime which dominated the Polish government since mid-1920s, the SZP was reorganized into the Union of Armed Struggle (Związek Walki Zbrojnej, ZWZ) on 13 November 1939. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski supported that move, aiming to include parties marginalized by the Sanacja <b>regime,</b> <b>and</b> supported {{the formation of the}} Main Political Council (Główna Rada Polityczna, GRP). Sikorski named General Kazimierz Sosnkowski the head of the ZWZ and Colonel Stefan Rowecki was appointed the commander of the ZWZ German occupation zone. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski became the commander of the ZWZ Soviet zone, but was arrested in March 1940 by the Soviets when attempting to cross the new German-Soviet border. In June Sikorski appointed Rowecki as the commander of both zones.|$|E

On 2 May, General Helmuth Weidling unconditionally surrendered Berlin to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov. Hitler was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as Reich President and Goebbels as Reich Chancellor. Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide the next day after murdering their six children.

The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire, and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the Interahamwe paramilitary group. By late 1996, the Hutu militants represented a serious threat to the new Rwandan <b>regime,</b> <b>and</b> Kagame launched a counteroffensive.|$|E
5|$|Following the Soviet {{occupation}} of Latvia in 1940 Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition, but no such move was carried out. Soviet sculptor Vera Mukhina is sometimes credited for rescuing the monument, because she considered {{it to be}} of high artistic value. Soviet propaganda attempted to alter the symbolic meaning of the monument to better fit with Communist ideology, but it remained a symbol of national independence to the general public. Indeed, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people gathered at the monument to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Soviet <b>regime</b> <b>and</b> to lay flowers. This rally renewed the national independence movement, which culminated three years later in the re-establishment of Latvian sovereignty {{after the fall of the}} Soviet regime.|$|E
5|$|For {{the coup}} to be successful, the {{military}} committee needed {{to gain the}} support {{of some of the}} Syrian officer corps. The collapse of the UAR, coupled with mutinies, purges and transfers left the officer corps in complete disarray and open to anti-government agitation. At the time, the officer corps was split into five different factions; the Damascus faction which supported the ancien régime, supporters of Akram al-Hawrani, a Nasserist faction, a Ba'athist faction and a group of independents. The Damascus faction was the enemy of the military committee because of their support for Nazim al-Kudsi's <b>regime</b> <b>and</b> the Hawranist were considered as rivals because of their stance against pan-Arabism. The Nasserists became allies of the Ba'ath, even while they supported Gamal Abdel Nasser and the reestablishment of the UAR.|$|E
