40|$|Piston {{telemetry}} research involves {{monitoring the}} temperatures at specific internal location points within a combustion engine piston. The temperatures are detected with type K thermocouples as voltages and processed to convert them into temperatures using cold <b>junction</b> <b>compensation</b> methods. The present system uses a specific sensor designed {{to operate in}} the high temperature environment within the piston, reading multiple thermocouples. Because of the reciprocating motion of the piston, power generation is intermittent and available only when the piston reaches near bottom dead centre, using inductive coupling to power the sensors and transmit data to an evaluation unit for data processing. The planned system involves designing and building a prototype telemetry unit using ¿off the shelf¿ components that integrate the reading of thermocouple outputs, signal processing and cold <b>junction</b> <b>compensation.</b> Wireless telemetry is adopted for data transmission with an integrated Bluetooth and microcontroller module. The data acquisition module can be adapted for other sensors by adapting the firmware uploaded to the microcontroller. The hardware electronics are envisaged to be encased in thermal insulation to enable operation in high temperature environments. The considered system requires a power supply for the integrated components {{in the form of a}} power generator and that it should meet two criteria: to be located within confined spaces and to be permanently available, without having to dismantle systems to change batteries. The selected method is an induction generator constructed from a coil stator connected to the piston connection rod big end and a permanent magnet rotor connected to the crankshaft. The suggested mechatronic system is validated against the present system by comparing both systems to determine whether wireless telemetry can perform within acceptable tolerances and limits for the specified task. Then, for acceptable performances, reduce costs and include flexibility to operate in multiple environments. Bench testing shows that the power generator is capable of driving the sensors and the Bluetooth integrated DAQ system. EPSRC and University of Bradfor...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the National Launch System (NLS) program was to design an operationally efficient, highly {{reliable}} vehicle with minimal recurring launch costs. To achieve this goal, trade studies of key main propulsion subsystems were performed to specify vehicle design requirements. These requirements {{include the use of}} passive recirculation to thermally condition the liquid hydrogen (LH 2) and liquid oxygen (LO 2) propellant feed systems and Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) fuel pumps. Rockwell International (RI) proposed a joint independent research and development (JIRAD) program with Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to study the LH 2 feed system passive recirculation concept. The testing was started in July 1992 and completed in November 1992. Vertical and sloped feedline designs were used. An engine simulator was attached {{at the bottom of the}} feedline. This simulator had strip heaters that were set to equal the corresponding heat input from different engines. A computer program is currently being used to analyze the passive recirculation concept in the LH 2 vertical feedline tests. Four tests, where the heater setting is the independent variable, were chosen. While the JIRAD with RI was underway, General Dynamics Space Systems (GDSS) proposed a JIRAD with MSFC to explore passive recirculation in the LO 2 feed system. Liquid nitrogen (LN 2) is being used instead of LO 2 for safety and economic concerns. To date, three sets of calibration tests have been completed on the sloped LN 2 test article. The environmental heat was calculated from the calibration tests in which the strip heaters were turned off. During the LH 2 testing, the environmental heat was assumed to be constant. Therefore, the total heat was equal to the environmental heat flux plus the heater input. However, the first two sets of LN 2 calibration tests have shown that the environmental heat flux varies with heater input. A Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer and Fluid Integrator (SINDA/FLUINT) model is currently being built to determine if this variation in environmental heat is due to a change in the wall temperature. During the third set of calibration tests, a faulty <b>reference</b> <b>junction</b> was found.

40|$|Refractometry of air is {{a central}} problem for interferometer-based {{dimensional}} measurements. Refractometry at the 10 − 9 level is only valid if air temperature gradients are controlled at the millikelvin (mK) level. Very precise tests of second-generation National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) refractometers involve comparing two instruments (two optical cavities made from ultralow expansion glass) that are located in nominally the same environment; temperature gradients must be kept below a few millikelvin to achieve satisfactory precision of these tests. In this paper we describe a thermal stabilization scheme that maintains< 1 mK thermal gradients over 100 h in a 0. 5 m× 0. 15 m× 0. 15 m volume. Our approach uses passive (aluminum envelopes and foam insulation) and active (thermistors, foil heaters, and proportional–integral–derivative control) temperature stabilization. Thermal gradients are sensed with thermocouples and a nanovoltmeter and switch; the <b>reference</b> <b>junctions</b> of the thermocouples being in thermal contact with a thermistor temperature standard.

30|$|The {{temperature}} difference (between the sample and control thermocouple) tends to decrease as the heater on the HPMD gradually deteriorates with {{use and the}} heating rate decreases, thus giving more time for the gas and sample temperatures to equilibrate; without a sample, the temperature differential decreases as well, approximately {{by a factor of}} two to three. It appears to vary significantly depending on the choice of the heater, gas, and pressure, which is related to a competition between the irradiative and convective heating rates. For example, the lower-molecular-mass helium equilibration times are much shorter than they are for CO 2, and the resulting gas temperature increase can be faster than direct irradiative heating of the sample; on the other hand, the CO 2 density increases with pressure much faster than that of helium, which results in increasing role of the convective heat exchange between the high-pressure gas/fluid and sample. Combined with another potential error due to a “cold” junction on the inner side of the instrument—that we had found in the original control thermocouple—this could possibly account for the entire “softening effect” previously observed in the presence of pressurized CO 2 (Khan 1985). Both the magnitude (~ 100  °C) and the sign of the total plausible error in the temperature are in line with the reported effect. The problem with having the thermocouple’s <b>reference,</b> “cold” <b>junction</b> on the inner side of the HPMD is that its temperature may increase significantly; without proper cooling of the instrument’s base, especially at a higher density of the filling gas, which requires higher thermal power inflow {{to keep up with the}} preset, fixed temperature ramp. Therefore, the unintended increase in the <b>reference</b> <b>junction</b> temperature could result in observation of an apparent decrease (relative to the designated-hot-junction temperature) in the thermocouple readout as caused by reduction in electromotive force. All these issues have been addressed in this study per improved experimental design and procedures as outlined in the Experimental Section.|$|R

The analysis of coherent magnetotransport in both microstructures is successfully performed within the random matrix theory of Andreev transport and ballistic effects are included by directly solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The impact of junction morphology on reflectionless tunneling and the application of the employed fabrication technique to the realization of complex semiconductor-superconductor systems are furthermore discussed.
