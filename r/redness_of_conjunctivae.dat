25|$|Conjunctivitis is {{identified}} by irritation and <b>redness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctiva.</b> Except in obvious pyogenic or toxic/chemical conjunctivitis, a slit lamp (biomicroscope) {{is needed to}} have any confidence in the diagnosis. Examination <b>of</b> the tarsal <b>conjunctiva</b> is usually more diagnostic than the bulbar conjunctiva.|$|R
50|$|Endophthalmitis {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} by severe pain, loss <b>of</b> vision, and <b>redness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctiva</b> {{and the underlying}} episclera. Hypopyon can be present in endophthalmitis and should be looked for on examination by a slit lamp.|$|R
5000|$|Conjunctival suffusion is an eye finding {{occurring}} {{early in}} Weil’s disease, {{which is caused}} by Leptospira interrogans. Conjunctival suffusion is characterized by <b>redness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctiva</b> that resembles conjunctivitis, {{but it does not}} involve inflammatory exudates. [...] Swelling <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctiva</b> (chemosis) is seen along the corners of the eye (palpebral fissures).|$|R
50|$|It is a {{leukocytic}} exudate, seen in {{the anterior}} chamber, usually accompanied by <b>redness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctiva</b> and the underlying episclera. It {{is a sign of}} inflammation of the anterior uvea and iris, i.e. iritis, which is a form of anterior uveitis. The exudate settles at the dependent aspect of the eye due to gravity. It can be sterile (in bacterial corneal ulcer) or not sterile (fungal corneal ulcer).|$|R
50|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of cluster headache include grouped occurrence and recurrence (cluster) of headache attack, severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and/or temporal pain. If left untreated, attack frequency may range from one attack every {{two days to}} eight attacks per day. Cluster headache attack is accompanied {{by at least one}} of the following autonomic symptoms: drooping eyelid, pupil constriction, <b>redness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctiva,</b> tearing, runny nose, and less commonly, facial blushing, swelling, or sweating, typically appearing on the same side of the head as the pain.|$|R
50|$|Enophthalmos (recession of the eyeball {{within the}} orbit) {{is the most}} common eye {{abnormality}} observed in Parry-Romberg syndrome. It is caused by a loss of subcutaneous tissue around the orbit. Other common findings include drooping of the eyelid (ptosis), constriction of the pupil (miosis), <b>redness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctiva,</b> and decreased sweating (anhidrosis) of the affected side of the face. Collectively, these signs are referred to as Horner's syndrome. Other ocular abnormalities include ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of {{one or more of the}} extraocular muscles) and other types of strabismus, uveitis, and heterochromia of the iris.|$|R
40|$|Of 57 {{patients}} with chronic renal failure who all had deposition of calcium salts in the conjunctival and corneal tissue two developed a brief episode of painful irritation and <b>redness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctiva</b> and subconjunctiva. This hyperaemia was adjacent to erosions of the corneal epithelium of the eye {{as a consequence of}} exfoliation of calcium concretions from the superficial corneal epithelium. Eight patients showed inflammatory reactions <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctivae</b> that were clinically identical to inflamed pingueculae. Three patients showed an inflammatory reaction of the eye that was characterised by a waxy red, more or less diffuse, episcleral and conjunctival hyperaemia extending beyond the palpebral fissure. The average value of the serum calcium concentration in these patients was particularly high and statistically significantly higher than in {{patients with}} calcification but without inflammatory signs and also higher than in patients who showed pingueculitis. We propose to reserve the term 'red eye of renal failure' for the latter group of patients...|$|R
40|$|A 36 -year-old man visited our {{hospital}} because of blurred vision and <b>redness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctiva.</b> Slit-lamp examination showed panuveitis. Two days later, he suddenly experienced dizziness, speech disturbance, paralysis {{of his right}} extremities, and gait disturbances. Neurological examinations suggested that his symptoms were caused by a left lateral medullary lesion. He also had erythema mainly on his trunk. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain demonstrated a small infarct {{on the left side}} of the medulla oblongata. Clinical presentation and MRI findings were consistent with the diagnosis of a Wallenberg’s syndrome. He also had bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. A skin biopsy showed granulomatous nodular dermatitis compatible with sarcoidosis. He was treated with steroid pulse therapy and his neurological and ocular symptoms immediately improved. Only seven similar cases of intracranical sarcoidosis have been reported, but none had been treated with steroid pulse therapy. We recommend that steroid pulse therapy be considered to treat patients with sarcoidosis with signs of lesions in the central nervous system...|$|R

Please click on the {{hyperlink}} in Additional LinkPurpose: Although eye drops {{are the most common}} form of ocular drugs, they have several limitations. Drug absorption into the eye is, in general, less than 5 %, addition of preservatives is often necessary, and many drugs cannot be formulated as eye drops. Formulating ocular drugs as powder may solve these problems. The aim of this study was to investigate ocular irritation in rabbits following powder administration. Methods: Timolol maleate (TM) powder was administered to pigmented lop rabbits. Both pure TM powder and freeze-dried with PVP-polymer (2. 4 % of mass) were tested in 1. 0 - and 0. 1 -mg doses. Additionally, 4 rabbits received 0. 1 mg of the pure powder 3 times a day for 8 d. <b>Redness</b> <b>of</b> the bulbar <b>conjunctiva</b> and the amount of discharge was rated from photographs (0 - 3 points, randomized and masked evaluation). The 8 -d experiment additionally included examination with a slit lamp and examination of hematoxylin-eosin stained sections of eyes with light microscopy. Results: No serious or irreversible signs of irritation were noted. Doses of 1. 0 mg were more irritating than 0. 1 -mg doses. There was no detectable difference in irritation between pure or freeze-dried powder. Slit-lamp examination, surface photographs and histology showed a negligible difference between drug and control eyes following the 8 -d experiment. Conclusions: The results suggest that 0. 1 mg of timolol powder does not irritate the eye and that testing topical timolol powder in humans is feasible...|$|R
50|$|Allergic {{conjunctivitis}} is inflammation <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctiva</b> (the membrane {{covering the}} white {{part of the}} eye) due to allergy. Although allergens differ among patients, {{the most common cause}} is hay fever. Symptoms consist <b>of</b> <b>redness</b> (mainly due to vasodilation of the peripheral small blood vessels), edema (swelling) <b>of</b> the <b>conjunctiva,</b> itching, and increased lacrimation (production of tears). If this is combined with rhinitis, the condition is termed allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.|$|R

40|$|Petechial {{bleeding}} <b>of</b> <b>conjunctivae</b> and eyelids is {{a typical}} finding in different causes of death. Petechiae can be important corroborative evidence of asphyxia. In some studies the authors found petechiae following cardiopulmonary resuscitation and concluded that petechiae was developed from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Other authors contradict this theory. During a period of 30 months, 196 patients with in life-threatening situations (of different, natural causes) were examined for petechial bleeding <b>of</b> <b>conjunctivae</b> and eyelids before, directly after and 122 (62 %) patients after 24 hours following CPR.
