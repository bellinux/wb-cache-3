5|$|Compounds {{that have}} failed to prevent or slow {{progression}} of Huntington's disease in human trials include remacemide, coenzyme Q10, <b>riluzole,</b> creatine, minocycline, ethyl-EPA, phenylbutyrate and dimebon.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients {{do not respond}} to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or <b>riluzole.</b> People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E

25|$|No {{cure for}} ALS is known. A {{medication}} called <b>riluzole</b> may extend life by about {{two to three}} months. Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life. The disease usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50. The average survival from onset to death is two to four years. About 10% survive longer than 10 years. Most die from respiratory failure. In much of the world, rates of ALS are unknown. In Europe and the United States the disease affects about two people per 100,000 per year.|$|E
25|$|Ion {{channels}} {{located on}} the surface membrane of the neuron allows for an influx of sodium ions and outward movement of potassium ions during an action potential. Selectively blocking these ion channels will decrease the likelihood of an action potential to occur. The drug <b>riluzole</b> is a neuroprotective drug that blocks sodium ion channels. Since these channels cannot activate, there is no action potential, and the neuron does not perform any transduction of chemical signals into electrical signals and the signal does not move on. This drug is used as an anesthetic {{as well as a}} sedative.|$|E
50|$|Contraindications for <b>riluzole</b> include: known prior {{hypersensitivity}} to <b>riluzole</b> {{or any of}} the excipients {{inside the}} preparations, liver disease, pregnancy or lactation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Riluzole</b> can be {{prepared}} beginning with the reaction of 4-(trifluoromethoxy)aniline with potassium thiocyanate followed by reaction with bromine. Displacement of bromine atom by sulfur forms the thiazole ring to afford <b>riluzole.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Riluzole</b> (marketed as Rilutek and Teglutik) {{is a drug}} used {{to treat}} {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis. <b>Riluzole</b> delays the onset of ventilator-dependence or tracheostomy in selected patients and may increase survival by approximately two to three months.|$|E
50|$|<b>Riluzole</b> {{preferentially}} blocks TTX-sensitive sodium channels, {{which are}} associated with damaged neurons. <b>Riluzole</b> has also been reported to directly inhibit the kainate and NMDA receptors. However, the action of <b>riluzole</b> on glutamate receptors has been controversial, as no binding of the drug to any known sites has been shown for them. In addition, as its antiglutamatergic action is still detectable {{in the presence of}} sodium channel blockers, it is also uncertain whether or not it acts via this way. Rather, its ability to stimulate glutamate uptake seems to mediate many of its effects. In addition to its role in accelerating glutamate clearance from the synapse, <b>riluzole</b> may also prevent glutamate release from presynaptic terminals. These effects combined could significantly reduce glutamate signaling and cause indirect antagonism without acting at glutamate receptors themselves.|$|E
50|$|A prodrug of <b>riluzole,</b> trigriluzole, {{is under}} {{investigation}} for spinocerebellar ataxia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Riluzole</b> {{has been}} found to {{modestly}} improve survival by approximately two to three months. It may have a greater survival benefit for those with a bulbar onset. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (England and Wales). <b>Riluzole</b> does not reverse damage already done to motor neurons.|$|E
50|$|<b>Riluzole</b> {{was also}} studied as a {{treatment}} for spinal muscular atrophy; however, efficacy was not observed.|$|E
50|$|CYP1A2 substrates, inhibitors and {{inducers}} {{would probably}} interact with <b>riluzole,</b> due its dependency on this cytochrome for metabolism.|$|E
50|$|A {{clinical}} study on mice has shown <b>riluzole</b> {{to compensate for}} harmful glutamate levels and promote dendritic spine clustering in hippocampal circuits implicated in memory and emotion. Therefore, the drug may act as an effective treatment for age-related memory loss {{and other forms of}} cognitive decline. The effect of <b>riluzole</b> on glutamate dysfunction in humans with Alzheimer's disease is unknown; however, a clinical trial is taking place to investigate this.|$|E
50|$|A November, 2008 study {{conducted}} in Europe {{failed to find}} an effect for the drug <b>riluzole</b> in treating MSA or PSP.|$|E
50|$|<b>Riluzole</b> is {{available}} in a tablet and liquid form. The liquid formulation may be more suitable for patients with swallowing difficulties.|$|E
50|$|A related {{functional}} {{group is the}} trifluoromethoxy group (-OCF3). Compounds having this {{functional group}} are of some relevance as pharmaceuticals. One example is <b>riluzole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Compounds {{that have}} failed to prevent or slow {{progression}} of Huntington's disease in human trials include remacemide, coenzyme Q10, <b>riluzole,</b> creatine, minocycline, ethyl-EPA, phenylbutyrate and dimebon.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in and {{decreased}} expression of this protein {{are associated with}} amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The drug <b>riluzole</b> approved {{for the treatment of}} ALS upregulates EAAT2.|$|E
5000|$|Cytotoxicity can {{be blocked}} by noncompetitive NMDA antagonists, such as {{dextrorphan}} and MK-801. These compounds are only effective when {{present at the}} same time as the toxin, as opposed to post-exposure. Tetrodotoxin, a sodium channel antagonist, was found to prevent the sodium and calcium influxes caused by antillatoxin.Other voltage gated sodium channel antagonists also inhibit the effects of antillatoxin, such as lidocaine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, <b>riluzole,</b> and SKA-19. <b>Riluzole,</b> SKA-19, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine were capable of near complete inhibition of membrane depolarization, based on their concentration.|$|E

50|$|A {{reformulation}} of <b>riluzole</b> {{that originated}} at Yale University {{and is known}} by the code name BHV-0223 is under development {{for the treatment of}} generalized anxiety disorder and mood disorders now by Biohaven Pharmaceuticals.|$|E
50|$|Much current {{research}} {{is devoted to}} the therapeutic potential of the agents that affect the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate or the binding to its receptors. These include <b>riluzole,</b> memantine, gabapentin, N-acetylcysteine, topiramate and lamotrigine.|$|E
50|$|By 1991, {{researchers}} had linked chromosome 21 to familial ALS (FALS). In 1993, the SOD1 gene on chromosome 21 {{was found to}} play a role in some cases of FALS. In 1996, <b>riluzole</b> became the first FDA-approved drug for ALS.|$|E
50|$|Examples of antagonists of the NMDA {{receptor}} are APV, amantadine, dextromethorphan (DXM), ketamine, magnesium, tiletamine, phencyclidine (PCP), <b>riluzole,</b> memantine, methoxetamine (MXE), methoxphenidine (MXP) and kynurenic acid; {{the latter}} is the only known endogenous antagonist. They are {{commonly referred to as}} NMDA receptor antagonists.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} recent case studies have {{indicated}} that <b>riluzole</b> may have clinical use in mood and anxiety disorders. It has been shown to have antidepressant properties in the treatment of refractory depressionand act as an anxiolytic in obsessive-compulsive disorder and in generalized anxiety disorder.|$|E
50|$|Most Progressive-Onset {{variants}} {{does not}} have any approved disease-modifying treatment currently. Some possible treatments have been published, such as methylprednisolone pulses or <b>riluzole,</b> and some reduction of spasticity was reported in a pilot Italian study on low dose naltrexone but there is nothing conclusive still.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variety of}} other agents have been tried in bipolar disorder, {{including}} benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, L-methylfolate, and thyroid hormone. Modafinil (Provigil) and Pramipexole (Mirapex) show promise in treating cognitive deterioration related to bipolar depression. [...] In addition <b>Riluzole,</b> an ALS treatment, {{has been shown to}} be effective treatment. The breast cancer medicine tamoxifen has shown quick response to manic phases.|$|E
50|$|Of {{clinically}} studied compounds {{which did}} not show efficacy, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) held some promise in an open-label uncontrolled clinical trial but did not prove effective in a subsequent double-blind placebo-controlled trial. <b>Riluzole,</b> a drug that has mild clinical benefit in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was proposed to be similarly tested in SMA, however a 2008-2010 trial in SMA types 2 and 3 was stopped early {{due to lack of}} satisfactory results.|$|E
5000|$|Excitotoxicity, or {{cell death}} caused by {{high levels of}} {{intracellular}} calcium caused by excessive activity of excitatory neurotransmitters, may be a mechanism of ALS. This concept has been supported by increased glutamate and dysfunctional glutamate transporter - RNA in cerebrospinal fluid of those with ALS. [...] This is further supported by the only effective treatment being an anti-glutaminergic drug (<b>Riluzole),</b> {{as well as the}} poor ability to buffer calcium in motor neurons relative to other neurons.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{also have}} focused on the role of {{glutamate}} in motor neuron degeneration. Glutamate is one of the neurotransmitters in the brain. Scientists have found, compared with healthy people, people with ALS have higher levels of glutamate in their serum and spinal fluid. <b>Riluzole,</b> which targets glutamate transporters, is currently the only FDA-approved drug for treatment of ALS. It has only a modest effect on survival, however, suggesting that excess glutamate is not the sole cause of the disease.|$|E
50|$|His {{research}} focusses preclinically on translationally relevant {{models of}} spinal cord and brain injury and clinically on disorders of the spine/spinal cord. His peer-reviewed publications number over 600 spanning clinical and basic science. Work for his 1996 publication in the Journal of Neuroscience (Agrawal and Fehlings, 1996) resulted in receipt of the Gold Medal from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. This {{work has been}} translated into ongoing clinical trials examining <b>riluzole</b> for traumatic and nontraumatic spinal cord injury.|$|E

5000|$|This heterocyclic {{scaffold}} {{is readily}} substituted at the unique methyne centre in the thiazole ring. It is a thermally stable electron-withdrawing moiety with numerous applications in dyes such as thioflavin. Some drugs contain this group, examples being <b>riluzole</b> and pramipexole. The heterocycle {{is found in}} nature. Accelerators for the vulcanization of rubber are based on 2-mercaptobenzothiazole. [...] This ring is a potential component in nonlinear optics (NLO). The compound is used also used as an insecticide and food flavoring agent.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} some {{evidence}} to show that higher doses might produce more significant improvements in ALS patients but at almost £6 (US$10) per tablet it is at risk of being prohibitively expensive given the modest benefit to patients. One study in the Netherlands found that <b>riluzole</b> is metabolized differently by males and females, and its levels in plasma are decreased in patients who smoke cigarettes or take omeprazole. A Cochrane Library review states a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has focused}} on finding a {{pharmacological}} treatment that is specific for intention tremor. Limited success has been seen in treating intention tremor with drugs effective at treating essential tremor. Clinical trials of levetiracetam, typically used to treat epilepsy, and pramipexole, used to treat resting tremor, were completed in 2009-2010 to establish their effectiveness in treating kinetic tremor. A clinical trial for <b>riluzole,</b> typically used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was completed at the Sapienza University of Rome to evaluate its effectiveness of treating cerebellar ataxia and kinetic tremor.|$|E
