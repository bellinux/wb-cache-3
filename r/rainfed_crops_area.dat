40|$|Soil erosion is a {{major problem}} in the Yellow River Basin: the river {{is one of the most}} sediment-laden in the world. Although there is a {{rainfall}} gradient from 750 mm in southern Shandong, to 200 mm per year in northern Ningxia, most of the <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> is in regions with more than 400 mm per year – it is here that the project concentrated. Conservation agriculture (featuring reduced or zero tillage, mulch retention, crop rotations and cover crops) offers a possible solution to problems of soil erosion and low crop productivity. Conservation agriculture (CA) systems typically result in increased crop water availability and agroecosystem productivity, reduced soil erosion, increased soil organic matter and nutrient availability, reduced labor and fuel use and increased biological control of pests. Most of the recent advances in conservation agriculture in China have been in irrigated areas, from which technologies and approaches were adapted for this project. The project goal was to improve the incomes and livelihoods of smallholder farm families in the <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping</b> <b>areas</b> of Henan, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and Shandong (Shanxi was added later) while simultaneously improving soil quality and reducing land degradation and soil erosion that threaten system sustainability. Specific objectives included fostering farm family adoption of conservation agriculture practices through participatory research, farmer experimentation and farmer-to-farmer interaction and extension; assessing the (biophysical, social and economic) consequences of conservation agriculture adoption; encouraging a policy environment that does not discriminate against conservation agriculture; and strengthening the capacity of local partners. Project partners include two international Centers (CIMMYT and IWMI), Provincial and County NARES, and Universities.

Although yield increases by supplemental irrigation are well {{established at the}} field level, its potential extent and impact on water resources at the basin level are less researched. This work presents a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) -based methodology for identifying areas that are potentially suitable for supplemental irrigation and a computer routine for allocating streamflow for supplemental irrigation in different sub-basins. A case study is presented for the 42   908  km 2 upper Karkheh River basin (KRB) in Iran, which has 15   840  km 2 of <b>rainfed</b> <b>crop</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Rainfed</b> <b>crop</b> <b>areas</b> within 1  km from the streams, with slope classes 0 – 5, 0 – 8, 0 – 12, and 0 – 20  %, were assumed to be suitable for supplemental irrigation. Four streamflow conditions (normal, normal with environmental flow requirements, drought and drought with environmental flow) were considered for the allocation of water resources. Thirty-seven percent (5801  km 2) of the rainfed croplands had slopes less than 5  %; 61  % (3559  km 2) of this land was suitable for supplemental irrigation, but only 22  % (1278  km 2) could be served with irrigation in both autumn (75  mm) and spring (100  mm), under normal flow conditions. If irrigation would be allocated to all suitable land with slopes up to 20  %, 2057  km 2 could be irrigated. This would reduce the average annual outflow of the upper KRB by 9  %. If environmental flow requirements are considered, a maximum (0 – 20  % slopes) of 1444  km 2 could receive supplemental irrigation. Under drought conditions a maximum of 1013  km 2 could be irrigated, while the outflow would again be reduced by 9  %. Thus, the withdrawal of streamflow for supplemental irrigation has relatively {{little effect on the}} outflow of the upper KRB. However, if the main policy goal would be to improve rainfed areas throughout the upper KRB, options for storing surface water need to be developed...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{degradation}} {{on large}} tracts of cultivable land is seriously undermining millions of people’s livelihoods. Attempts to overcome this problem have been made through large investments in watershed management throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America (Lal, 2000). In India {{in the last three}} decades, watersheds have become the pivotal unit for rural development programmes. In India, about 6. 2 million ha of rainfed land in 5 200 micro-watersheds was under treatment in financial year 2001 / 2002 at an estimated cost of US$ 175 million. Yet, the coverage is far from complete. Of India’s total cultivable area of 142 million ha, 89 million ha of unirrigated land needs similar investments. This land grows 45 percent of India’s foodgrains. The irrigated area has reached a production plateau of about 110 million tonnes; so, efforts to increase foodgrain production need to focus on improving the productivity of rainfed agriculture.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{district and}} agro-ecoregional level study comprising the 604 districts of India was undertaken to (i) identify dominant rainfed districts for major <b>rainfed</b> <b>crops,</b> (ii) make a crop-specific {{assessment of the}} surplus runoff water available for water harvesting and the irrigable area, (iii) estimate the efficiency of regional rain water use and incremental production due to supplementary irrigation for different crops, and (iv) conduct a preliminary economic analysis of water harvesting/supplemental irrigation to realize the potential of rainfed agriculture. A climatic water balance analysis of 225 dominant rainfed districts provided information on the possible surplus runoff during the year and the cropping season. On a potential (excluding very arid and wet <b>areas)</b> <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> of 28. 5 million ha, a surplus rainfall of 114 billion m 3 (Bm 3) was available for harvesting. A part of this amount of water is adequate to provide one turn of supplementary irrigation of 100 mm depth to 20. 65 Mha during drought years and 25. 08 Mha during normal years. Water used in supplemental irrigation had the highest marginal productivity and increase in rainfed production above 12 % was achievable even under traditional practices. Under improved management, an average increase of 50 % in total production can be achieved with a single supplemental irrigation. Water harvesting and supplemental irrigation are economically viable at the national level. Net benefits improved by about threefold for rice, fourfold for pulses and sixfold for oilseeds.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} {{a global scale}} analysis of cropping intensity, crop duration and fallow land extent computed by using the global dataset on monthly irrigated and <b>rainfed</b> <b>crop</b> <b>areas</b> MIRCA 2000. MIRCA 2000 was mainly derived from census data and crop calendars from literature. Global cropland extent was 16 million km 2 around the year 2000 of which 4. 4 million km 2 (28 %) was fallow, resulting in an average cropping intensity of 0. 82 for total cropland extent and of 1. 13 when excluding fallow land. The lowest cropping intensities related to total cropland extent were found for Southern Africa (0. 45), Central America (0. 49) and Middle Africa (0. 54), while highest cropping intensities were computed for Eastern Asia (1. 04) and Southern Asia (1. 0). In remote or arid regions where shifting cultivation is practiced, fallow periods last 3 – 10 years or even longer. In contrast, crops are harvested two or more times per year in highly populated, often irrigated tropical or subtropical lowlands where multi-cropping systems are common. This indicates that intensification of agricultural land use is a strategy that {{may be able to}} significantly improve global food security. There exist large uncertainties regarding extent of cropland, harvested <b>crop</b> <b>area</b> and therefore <b>cropping</b> intensity at larger scales.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to "investigate, study, analyse, and report conditions under which Syrian "rainfed" wheat farmers live interact and adopt innovations and improved cropping practices. The purpose of this was to help in understanding forces that can influence farmers' decisions to adopt innovations and which influence their adoption behaviour. The research, also, has attempted to develop concepts and methods which have rarely been used before in Syrian conditions. The recommendations for the policy makers and the Extension organisations in Syria were based on the major findings as well as other findings which were revealed throughout the research. The study was carried out in the two largest <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping</b> <b>areas</b> in the country; Aleppo province to the north and Hassakeh province to the east, the sample of farmers was distributed in First Stability Zone (Zone 1) and Second Stability Zone (Zone 2). A total sample of 60 farmers were randomly selected from both areas. Nine agricultural innovations and improved cropping practices were selected and farmers' adoption behaviour with regard to these innovations and improved practices were investigated. The nine innovations and practices were; "the use of nitrogen", the use of "phosphorus", "following the recommended time of nitrogen application", "the use of improved wheat varieties", "the degree of following the seed renewal for wheat", "the use of herbicides", "the use of pesticides", "the use of sowing machines", and "following the recommended seed bed preparation". The "Sten Score" method was adopted in order to score the adoption behaviour of farmers for the nine selected innovations and improved cropping practice. The method was modified in order to achieve the best classification of farmers {{on the basis of their}} adoption behaviour. Four major aspects and characteristics were selected, investigated and later were analysed in relation to the adoption behaviour of farmers with regard to the nine selected innovations and improved practices. These aspects and characteristics were Personal and Socio-Economic, Economic and Institutional, Communicational, and Psychological Factors. The study has concentrated on characteristics which usually have been ignored or avoided in past adoption and diffusion research. Special methods have been devised in order to help in measuring these aspects and characteristics. Special attention was paid to the role of personality and the Self-image of farmers as important aspects affecting their adoption behaviour. Until recently research into farmers' decision making to adopt or reject innovations did not pay attention to the role played by these factors at the time of taking the decision to adopt innovations. The major findings in Zone 1 revealed that the adoption of innovations and improved practice by farmers were related highly and significantly with farmers' "Self-image", the "availability of credit and cash money" and "having an Extension plot or field demonstration on the farm". The three variables together explain over 70 % of the variation in the adoption behaviour of farmers. In Zone 2, the farmers' "Self-image", and the "availability of machinery and equipment on the farm" were found to be the best related variables with the adoption behaviour of farmers. The two variables together explain over 60 % of the variation in the adoption behaviour of farmers.

40|$|Favorable {{climate and}} soils for <b>rainfed</b> <b>crop</b> production, {{together}} with a relatively low population density,results in 70 – 90 % of Argentina grain production being exported. No assessment to date has tried to estimate the potential for extra grain production for soybean, wheat and maize, which account for 78 %of total harvested area, by yield gap closure on existing cropland area and its impact at a global scale. The objectives of this paper are (i) to estimate how much additional grain could be produced without expanding <b>crop</b> <b>area</b> by closing yield gaps in Argentina, (ii) to investigate how this production and yield gaps varies across regions and years, and (iii) to analyze how these inter-annual variations are related to El Niño—Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO). Production increase on existing <b>crop</b> <b>area</b> was assessed for soybean, wheat and maize by quantifying the yield gap (Yg), that is, the difference between water-limited yield potential (Yw) and actual yield (Ya). A bottom-up approach was followed to estimate Yw and Yg, in which these parameters were first estimated for specific locations in major <b>crop</b> producing <b>area</b> sand subsequently up-scaled to country level based on spatial distribution of <b>crop</b> <b>area</b> and climate zones. Locally-calibrated crop simulation models were used to estimate Yw at each selected location based on long-term weather data and dominant soil types and management practices. For the analyzed period,the national level Yg represented 41 % of Yw for both wheat and maize and 32 % of the Yw for soybean. If farmers had closed Yg from these levels to 20 % of Yw, Argentina could have increased soybean, wheat and maize production by a respective 7. 4, 5. 2, and 9. 2 Mt, without expanding cropland area. This additional production would have represented an increase of 9 %, 4 %, and 9 % of soybean, wheat, and maize global exports. This potential grain surplus was, however, highly variable because of the ENSO phenomenon:attainable soybean production was 12 Mt higher in favorable “El Niño” years compared with unfavorable“La Niña” years. Interestingly, Yg tended to be higher in wet years, suggesting that farmers do not {{take full advantage of}} years with favorable conditions for <b>rainfed</b> <b>crop</b> production. Regional variation in Yg was found in Argentina highlighting the usefulness of this work as a framework to target research and,ultimately, reduce gaps in areas where current yields are well below their potential...|$|R

40|$|A {{data set}} of monthly growing areas of 26 {{irrigated}} crops (MGAG-I) and related crop calendars (CC-I) was compiled for 402 spatial entities. The {{selection of the}} crops consisted of all major food crops including regionally important ones (wheat, rice, maize, barley, rye, millet, sorghum, soybeans, sunflower, potatoes, cassava, sugar cane, sugar beets, oil palm, rapeseed/canola, groundnuts/peanuts, pulses, citrus, date palm, grapes/vine, cocoa, coffee), major water-consuming crops (cotton), and unspecified other crops (other perennial crops, other annual crops, managed grassland). The data set refers to the time period 1998 - 2002 and has a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes by 5 arc minutes which is 8 km by 8 km at the equator. This {{is the first time}} that a data set of cell-specific irrigated growing <b>areas</b> of irrigated <b>crops</b> with this spatial resolution was created. The data set is consistent to the irrigated area and water use statistics of the AQUASTAT programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) ([URL] and the Global Map of Irrigation Areas (GMIA) ([URL] At the cell-level it was tried to maximise consistency to the cropland extent and cropland harvested area from the Department of Geography and Earth System Science Program of the McGill University at Montreal, Quebec, Canada and the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE) of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, USA ([URL] Datasets/Datasets. html and [URL] The consistency between the grid product and the input data was quantified. MGAG-I and CC-I are fully consistent to each other on entity level. For input data other than CC-I, the consistency of MGAG-I on cell level was calculated. The consistency of MGAG-I with respect to the area equipped for irrigation (AEI) of GMIA and to the cropland extent of SAGE was characterised by the sum of the cell-specific maximum difference between the MGAG-I monthly total irrigated area and the reference area when the latter was exceeded in the grid cell. The consistency of the harvested area contained in MGAG-I with respect to SAGE harvested area was characterised by the crop-specific sum of the cell-specific difference between MGAG-I harvested area and the SAGE harvested area when the latter was exceeded in the grid cell. In all three cases, the sums are the excess areas that should not have been distributed under the assumption that the input data were correct. Globally, this cell-level excess of MGAG-I as compared to AEI is 331, 304 ha or only about 0. 12 % of the global AEI of 278. 9 Mha found in the original grid. The respective cell-level excess of MGAG-I as compared to the SAGE cropland extent is 32. 2 Mha, corresponding to about 2. 2 % of the total cropland area. The respective cell-level excess of MGAG-I as compared to the SAGE harvested area is 27 % of the irrigated harvested area, or 11. 5 % of the AEI.

The four case studies contrasted in key systems characteristics: opportunism in decision making, i. e. flexible versus rigid crop rotations; function, i. e. production of livestock or crops; and level of intensification, i. e. dryland versus irrigated agriculture. Tested tactical and strategic changes under a baseline and climate change scenario (CCS) involved changes in the allocation of land between cropping and grazing enterprises, alternative allocations of limited irrigation water across cropping enterprises, and different management rules for planting wheat and sorghum in <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping.</b> The results show that expected impacts from a likely climate change scenario were evident in the following increasing order: the irrigated cropping farm case study, the cropping and grazing farm, the more opportunistic <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping</b> farm and the least opportunistic <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping</b> farm. We concluded that in most cases the participating farmers were operating close to the efficiency frontier (i. e. in the relationship between profits and risks). This indicated that options to adapt to climate change might need to evolve from investments in the development of more innovative cropping and grazing systems and/or transformational changes on existing farming systems. We expect that even though assimilating expected changes in climate seems to be rather intangible and premature for these farmers, as innovations are developed, adaptation is likely to follow quickly. The multiple interactions among farm management components in complex and dynamic farm businesses operating in a variable and changing climate, make the use of whole farm participatory modelling approaches valuable tools to quantify benefits and trade-offs from alternative farming systems designs in the search for improved profitability and resilience...|$|R
50|$|Although {{on paper}} {{most of the}} basin of the Burdekin appears perfect for <b>rainfed</b> <b>crops</b> like cotton and maize, in fact the {{rainfall}} is so erratic that in almost every year a would-be farmer will experience either too little or too much rain for the crop to mature properly. Thus, most of the basin of the Burdekin can be used only for low-density grazing of sheep and cattle which {{is less likely to}} be damaged economically and ecologically by the extreme risks of an extraordinarily erratic climate.|$|R
