5|$|Brasilia Center then unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to contact the}} Embraer six more times, between 16:30 and 16:34. At 16:30 the Embraer's primary radar target became intermittent, and disappeared completely from the <b>radar</b> <b>screen</b> by 16:38, eight minutes later. Brasilia Center unsuccessfully {{attempted to}} effect a handoff of the Embraer to Amazonic Center at 16:53, by calling the Embraer in the blind.|$|E
5|$|ATC {{maintained}} normal {{two-way radio}} {{contact with the}} Embraer up until 15:51, when the last successful radio exchange with the Embraer was made on VHF frequency 125.05MHz with Brasilia Center. At that point the Embraer was just approaching the Brasilia VOR. The Embraer overflew the Brasilia VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasilia VOR, secondary radar contact was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude (Mode C) on the controller's <b>radar</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
5|$|E-3 Sentry {{aircraft}} {{were among}} the first to deploy during Operation Desert Shield, where they immediately established as an around-the-clock <b>radar</b> <b>screen</b> to defend against Iraqi forces. During Operation Desert Storm, E-3s flew 379 missions and logged 5,052 hours of on-station time. The data collection capability of the E-3 radar and computer subsystems allowed an entire air war to be recorded for the first time in history. In addition to providing senior leadership with time-critical information on the actions of enemy forces, E-3 controllers assisted in 38 of the 41 air-to-air kills recorded during the conflict.|$|E

50|$|Just {{minutes after}} the first crash, Siberia Airlines Flight 1047, which had left Domodedovo International Airport at 21:35 on 24 August 2004, {{disappeared}} from the <b>radar</b> <b>screens</b> and crashed. The Tu-154 aircraft, registered RA-85556, which had been in service since 1982, was flying from Moscow to Sochi. According to an unnamed government source of the Russian news agency Interfax, the plane had broadcast a hijack warning while flying over Rostov Oblast at 22:59. The plane disappeared from <b>radar</b> <b>screens</b> shortly after that and crashed. 38 passengers and 8 crew members were on board the plane, {{and there were no}} survivors after the crash. The debris of the aircraft was found on the morning of 25 August 2004, 9 km from the work settlement of Gluboky in Kamensky District of Rostov Oblast.|$|R
25|$|Speed is {{the change}} in {{distance}} to an object with respect to time. Thus the existing system for measuring distance, combined with a memory capacity {{to see where the}} target last was, is enough to measure speed. At one time the memory consisted of a user making grease pencil marks on the <b>radar</b> <b>screen</b> and then calculating the speed using a slide rule. Modern radar systems perform the equivalent operation faster and more accurately using computers.|$|E
25|$|During its {{operation}} the battery {{consisted of a}} two searchlights in Horseshoe and Florence Bays, a <b>radar</b> <b>screen</b> in the hinterland of Arthur Bay, a permanent living encampment and a Command Post, Observation Post and two Gun Emplacements overlooking Cleveland Bay. While {{the majority of the}} buildings no longer remain, the fortified concrete command post, observation post, munitions bunker and gun emplacements still remain along with the foundations of many of the buildings within the living encampment. These remains form part of the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service's The Forts Walk, a popular 3.8km environmental and heritage walk for visitors to Magnetic Island.|$|E
25|$|The {{show has}} no on-camera host. A narrator {{provides}} commentary connecting the storylines {{as the show}} shifts from one boat to another. Discovery Channel voice artist Mike Rowe narrates the action for North American airings; UK voice artist Bill Petrie, reading from a slightly altered script, offers a regionally familiar accent for a British audience. The show transitions between boats using a mock-up <b>radar</b> <b>screen</b> that shows {{the positions of the}} boats relative to one another and to the two ends of the fishing grounds, St. Paul Island to the north and Dutch Harbor to the south.|$|E

25|$|Flight 7628 {{was flying}} on Airway 50 (Magdalinovka – Ball, course 201°) and Flight 7880 was on Airway 147 {{corridor}} (Dnepropetrovsk – Kremenchug, course 300°). These corridors intersect {{at an angle}} of 99° north-east of Dneprodzerzhinsk. Because of previous errors, the controllers perception of the location of each aircraft was incorrect. When Zhukovsky's supervisor Sumy overheard the radio traffic and saw the aircraft converging on the <b>radar</b> <b>screen</b> he realized the catastrophic situation and attempted to correct it. At 13:34:07 controller Sumy ordered aircraft 86676 (IL-62) from 9000 meters to 9600 meters. At 13:34:21 Sumy repeated the order then directed Flight 7880 from 8400 meters to the now vacant altitude at 9000 meters.|$|E
25|$|Their {{numbers were}} {{reinforced}} {{by at least}} 25 Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF) members. Graham Bound, an islander who lived through the Argentine occupation, reports in his book Falkland Islanders At War that the higher figure of approximately 40 (both serving and past) members of the FIDF reported for duty at their drill hall. Their commanding officer, Major Phil Summers, tasked the volunteer militiamen (including his son Brian Summers) with guarding such key points as the telephone exchange, the radio station and the power station. Skipper Jack Sollis, on board the civilian coastal ship Forrest, operated his boat as an improvised <b>radar</b> <b>screen</b> station off Stanley. Two other civilians, former Royal Marines Jim Fairfield and a Canadian citizen, Bill Curtiss, also offered their services to the governor.|$|E
25|$|I helped him. If I'd opposed him, he wouldn't {{have been}} on the <b>radar</b> <b>screen.</b> I'd have been {{opposing}} Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 19 June, Yorktown {{aircraft}} began strikes on Japanese air bases on Guam in order to deny them to their approaching carrier-based air {{and to keep the}} land-based planes out of the fray. Duels with Guam-based aircraft continued until mid-morning. At about 10:17, however, she got her first indication of the carrier plane attacks when a large bogey appeared on her <b>radar</b> <b>screen.</b> At that point she divided her attention, sending part of her air group back to Guam and another portion of it out to meet the raid closing from the west. Throughout the battle, Yorktowns planes continued to strike the Guam airfields and intercept the carrier raids. During {{the first day of the}} Battle of the Philippine Sea, Yorktown aircraft claimed 37 enemy planes destroyed and dropped 21tons of bombs on the Guam air bases.|$|E
25|$|The {{transponder}} {{problem had}} been growing before the introduction of AIS. IFF worked {{on the basis of}} a small receiver/transmitter set that listened for pulses from a radar and produced a low-power pulse broadcast on the same frequency but slightly delayed. The signal returned to the radar-equipped aircraft along with the original radar signal. When the two were amplified and displayed, the IFF signal caused the blip seen on the <b>radar</b> <b>screen</b> to stretch out. The original 1.5m radar system had by this time been adapted to a wide range of roles including AI, ASV and acting as the basis for both the CHL and the new AMES Type 7 ground control interception radars. To avoid interference problems, each of these operated on slightly different frequencies, from about 180 to 210MHz. The Navy and Army added their own variations. The IFF Mk. II, originally designed to respond to the Mk. IV, had to be repeatedly modified to respond to new radar frequencies, and none of the many models were able to respond to all of these.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} actions taken by the hijackers on 9/11 was to turn off or disable {{each of the four}} aircraft's on board {{transponder}}s.
