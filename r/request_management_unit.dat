Complexity level of this process would become complicated should software was distributed in many places. There are several techniques and tools have been produced to perform change <b>request</b> <b>management.</b> But most of these techniques do not give enough attention towards dynamic aspect of information management such as temporal base elements for the associated data. Therefore, this paper presents {{a new dimension to}} support software change <b>request</b> <b>management.</b> Temporal elements such as valid time and transaction time are the main attributes considered, to be inserted into the software change <b>request</b> <b>management</b> system database.

Through a case study, <b>request</b> <b>management</b> is identified as a profitable process due to long-term accumulated profit from developed products. Request profitability is not identified as related to profitability or turnover of existing customers, and thus profitability of requests cannot be predicted based on these customer data.

5000|$|The first {{commonly}} defined {{challenge is}} the need for meaningful and appropriate <b>management</b> <b>units.</b> These units must be broad and contain value for people in and outside of the protected area (Slocombe 1998b). For example, Aberley (1993) suggests the use of [...] "bioregions" [...] as <b>management</b> <b>units,</b> which can allow peoples involvement with that region to come through. To define <b>management</b> <b>units</b> as inclusive regions rather that exclusive ecological zones would prevent further limitations created by narrow or restricting political and economic policy created from the units. Slocombe (1998b) suggests that better <b>management</b> <b>units</b> should be flexible and build from existing units and that the biggest challenge is creating truly effect units for managers to compare against.|$|R
