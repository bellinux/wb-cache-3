These behaviors have been attributed to the unlikeliness of bisexuals to discuss their sexuality and proper protection with health professionals for fear of judgement or discrimination, leaving them uneducated.|$|E
25|$|A {{large body}} of {{international}} research has shown the efficacy of methadone maintenance treatment programmes {{for the treatment of}} drug addiction and subsequent reduction in HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors.</b> In acknowledgment of this evidence, in 2004 the Chinese government called for the use of such practices to mitigate HIV transmission. Immediately, under the governance of the Ministries of Health and Public Security and the State Food and Drug Administration, a pilot study of eight clinics in five provinces was done. Inclusion in the programme required: (1) several failed attempts to quit the use of heroin, (2) at least two terms in a detoxification centre, (3) age at least 20 years, (4) being a registered local resident of the area in which the clinic is located, and (5) being of good civil character. Those testing HIV positive need only fulfill criteria 4 and 5. To monitor the progress of the clinics, a database was established to gather data on demographics, medical issues, drug use, and other information about the patients. These data were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and indicated reductions in heroin use, drug-related crime, and unemployment in those who received methadone maintenance treatment.|$|E

A subsample of 606 adolescents ages 11 to 14 (Mage = 12. 50) from the SNARE project participated.

40|$|Borderline {{personality}} disorder (BPD) is a persistent psychological disorder characterized by pervasive emotional difficulties, unstable relationships, identity disturbance and {{high rates of}} engagement in self-damaging <b>risk</b> <b>behavior.</b> Prominent theoretical perspectives on BPD suggest that the primary motivational basis for <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> is the regulation of negative emotional states. The goal {{of this study was}} to test several of the hypotheses suggested by emotion regulation models of <b>risk</b> <b>behavior,</b> using a rigorous experimental design. Specifically, we sought to demonstrate the causal effect of distress on <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> among individuals with and without BPD, and to examine motivational and self-regulatory mediators of: a) the relationship between emotion and engagement in risk behavior; and b) the relationship between BPD and distress-induced change in <b>risk</b> <b>behavior.</b> To this end, participants with and without BPD provided ratings of emotion, motivation for emotion regulation and <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> in the context of induced calm and distress, and completed a self-report measure of trait self-efficacy for emotion regulation. Results provide partial support for the study hypotheses. Only women with BPD showed an increase in <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> in the distress condition, and distress-induced change in <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> was predicted by both the intensity of emotion regulation goals and self-efficacy for emotion regulation. Findings support the perspective that <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> is enacted strategically in response to negative emotions and associated motivational states. For those with BPD, distress-induced <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> may reflect a type of emotion-regulatory resourcefulness that becomes maladaptive when used inflexibly or to the exclusion of other strategies...|$|R
30|$|Biases are {{expected}} to overestimate {{the effects of the}} program. In general, individuals who self-select in youth training programs may make better choices and, hence, should show lower levels of <b>risk</b> <b>behavior.</b> Hence, a simple comparison on the <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> of individuals who are treated by the youth training program and those who are not is likely to overestimate the effects of the program. Differences on the <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> between treatment and control groups may also be exacerbated in time. As individuals receive more training, for example, they could also become more informed on smart choices subsequently reducing their <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> and, hence, may decide to receive further training reducing their <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> even more, and so on.|$|R

The increase may also be because of new treatments. In developing countries, HIV infection rates have been characterized as skyrocketing among MSM.

40|$|UnrestrictedBackground: Injection {{drug users}} (IDUs) {{are at risk}} for HIV and other {{bloodborne}} pathogens. Though reductions in injection <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> have been observed, residual <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> persists. Female IDUs are at elevated risk compared to their male counterparts, and this elevated risk appears to be grounded in the social and environmental context. The perceived consequences of refusing to share injection equipment have yet to be investigated as a factor that may help explain persistent injection risk behavior.; Methods: The current study used a two-phase, mixed-methods design to identify the perceived consequences of refusing to share injection equipment, assess the relationship between perceived consequences and injection <b>risk</b> <b>behavior,</b> and explore whether perceived consequences moderate the effects of other correlates of injection <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> in a sample of IDUs recruited from a large syringe exchange program. In addition, the study assessed gender differences in the both the qualitative and quantitative data.; Results: Findings from the qualitative analysis suggest that perceived consequences of refusing to share can be organized into four domains: individual, social, physical, and economic/policy. Gender differences were particularly evident in the social domain. Findings from the first quantitative analysis suggest that the consequences can be assessed using two sub-scales: perceived social/internal and structural/external consequences. In multiple linear regression perceived social/internal consequences were associated with greater frequency of reported injection <b>risk</b> <b>behavior,</b> even when controlling for other correlates of injection <b>risk</b> <b>behavior.</b> The perceived structural/external consequences were not associated with injection <b>risk</b> <b>behavior.</b> Few gender differences emerged in the quantitative results. Findings from the second quantitative analysis suggested that perceived consequences moderated the association between peer norms and injection <b>risk</b> <b>behavior,</b> and also moderated the associations amongst other correlates of injection <b>risk</b> <b>behavior.</b> Moderation results suggest that the associations between some theoretical correlates of behavior may be stronger in individuals who report greater influence of perceived consequences.; Conclusion: Assessing the perceived consequences of refusing to share injection equipment may help explain some residual injection <b>risk</b> <b>behavior.</b> Addressing the individual, social, physical, and economic/policy-level consequences of safer behavior may help IDUs reduce injection <b>risk</b> <b>behavior...</b>|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThere {{is a large}} {{controversy}} in the literature about the inter-relations between perceived risk, knowledge and <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> in different settings, and people at HIV risk are not an exception. Aim To assess additive and multiplicative effect of perceived HIV risk and HIV knowledge on sexual <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> of Injecting Drug Users (IDUs). MethodWe enrolled 162 street based IDUs to this analysis. Data came from {{a national survey of}} IDUs in Iran, with a cross sectional design. Socio-demographics (employment, education, marital status), HIV knowledge, perceived HIV risk and four different sexual <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> were registered. In the first step, using spearman test, the association of HIV knowledge and <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> were tested, then possible moderating effect of perceived HIV risk on this association was determined. ResultsAlthough among IDUs with low perceived HIV risk, HIV knowledge was negatively associated with sexual <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> (P 0. 05 for all).

Objectives of this study are to identify the types and prevalence of HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> in a sample of African American women ages 25 - 44, and to determine the extent to which seven identified psychosocial variables predict HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> in this sample of women. The variables are HIV risk knowledge, perceived HIV <b>risk,</b> <b>risk</b> reduction <b>behavior</b> intentions, perceptions of safer sex peer norms, condom barrier beliefs, conversations with male partners about condom and AIDS concerns, and substance use patterns. Anonymous questionnaires were administered to 148 African American women ages 25 - 44 who were enrolled in graduate classes at Clark Atlanta University. The purpose was to determine their levels of HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> and predictors of HIV risk practices. Results indicate over one half of the women were at high risk for HIV because of inconsistent or no condom use during sexual intercourse and sexual relationships with multiple and high risk male partners. HIV risk was significantly higher among women who held weak behavioral intentions to reduce <b>risk</b> <b>behavior</b> through condom use, perceived more relationship barriers to condom use, believed peer norms did not support condom use, and accurately perceived themselves at high personal risk for HIV infection.
