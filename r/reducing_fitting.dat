40|$|This paper verifies and corrects the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) nadir mapper (NM) level 1 B v 2. 0 {{measurements}} {{with the}} aim of producing accurate ozone profile retrievals using an optimal-estimation-based inversion method to fit measurements in the spectral range 302. 5 – 340  nm. The evaluation of available slit functions demonstrates that preflight-measured slit functions represent OMPS measurements well compared to derived Gaussian slit functions. Our initial OMPS fitting residuals contain significant wavelength and cross-track-dependent biases, resulting in serious cross-track striping errors in the tropospheric ozone retrievals. To eliminate the systematic component of the fitting residuals, we apply soft calibration to OMPS radiances. With the soft calibration the amplitude of fitting residuals decreases from [*]∼[*]  1 to 0. 2  % over low and middle latitudes, and thereby the consistency of tropospheric ozone retrievals between OMPS and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is substantially improved. A common mode correction is also implemented for additional radiometric calibration; it improves retrievals especially at high latitudes where the amplitude of fitting residuals decreases by a factor of [*]∼[*]  2. We estimate the noise floor error of OMPS measurements from standard deviations of the fitting residuals. The derived error in the Huggins band ([*]∼[*]  0. 1  %) is twice the OMPS L 1 B measurement error. OMPS noise floor errors constrain our retrievals better, leading to improving information content of ozone and <b>reducing</b> <b>fitting</b> residuals. The final precision of the fitting residuals is less than 0. 1  % in the low and middle latitudes, with [*]∼[*]  1 degrees of freedom for signal for the tropospheric ozone, meeting the general requirements for successful tropospheric ozone retrievals...|$|E

However, a 5 &# 176;-rotation added {{on the original}} orbital inclination is needed in the GEOs ephemeris parameters fitting algorithm {{as well as in}} the user satellite position computation because of the singularity due to small inclination. Besides, the phenomena of exceeding the given boundary happen occasionally for some ephemeris parameters of GEOs.

40|$|Negation words, such as no and not, play a {{fundamental}} role in modifying sentiment of textual expressions. We will {{refer to a}} negation word as the negator and the text span within the scope of the negator as the argument. Commonly used heuristics to estimate the sentiment of negated expressions rely simply on the sentiment of argument (and not on the negator or the argument itself). We use a sentiment treebank to show that these existing heuristics are poor estimators of sentiment. We then modify these heuristics to be dependent on the negators and show that this improves prediction. Next, we evaluate a recently proposed composition model (Socher et al., 2013) that relies on both the negator and the argument. This model learns the syntax and semantics of the negator's argument with a recursive neural network. We show that this approach performs better than those mentioned above.

In this paper, we have developed a new pursuit method, named CF-Pursuit, which has been based on Pure-Pursuit but with certain differences. In CF-Pursuit, in order to <b>reduce</b> <b>fitting</b> errors, we used a clothoid C 1 curve to replace the circle employed in Pure-Pursuit. This improvement to the fitting method helps the Pursuit method to decrease tracking errors. As regards the selection of look-ahead distance, we employed a fuzzy system to directly consider the path's curvature. There are three input variables in this fuzzy system, 6 mcurvature, 9 mcurvature and 12 mcurvature, calculated from the clothoid fit with the current position and the goal position on the defined path. A Sugeno fuzzy model was adapted to output a reasonable look-ahead distance using the experiences of human drivers as well as our own tests.

Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that the performance of an AAM built to model the variation in appearance of a single person across pose, illumination, and expression (a Person Specific AAM) is substantially better than the performance of an AAM built to model the variation in appearance of many faces, including unseen subjects not in the training set (a Generic AAM). In this paper we present an empirical evaluation that shows that Person Specific AAMs are, as expected, both easier to build and more robust to fit than Generic AAMs. Moreover, we show that: (1) building a generic shape model is far easier than building a generic appearance model, and (2) the shape component is the main cause of the <b>reduced</b> <b>fitting</b> robustness of Generic AAMs. We then proceed to describe two refinements to Generic AAMs to improve their performance: (1) a refitting procedure {{to improve the quality of}} the ground-truth data used to build the AAM and (2) a new fitting algorithm. For both refinements we demonstrate dramatically improved fitting performance. Finally, we evaluate the effect of these improvements on a combined model construction and fitting task. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} trace gas {{retrieval}} from Airborne Compact Atmospheric Mapper (ACAM) during the DSICOVER-AQ campaigns, we characterize {{the signal to}} noise ratio (SNR) of the ACAM measurement. From the standard deviations of the fitting residuals, the SNRs of ACAM nadir measurements are estimated to vary from ~ 300 at 310 [*]nm to ~ 1000 in the blue spectral region; the zenith data are noisier due to reduced levels of illumination and lower system throughput and also show many more pixels with abrupt anomalous values; therefore, a new method is developed to derive a solar irradiance reference {{at the top of the}} atmosphere (TOA) from average nadir measurements, at instrument spectral resolution and including instrument calibration characteristics. Using this reference can significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>fitting</b> residuals and improve the retrievals. This approach derives an absolute reference for direct fitting algorithms involving radiative transfer calculations and thus can be applied to both aircraft and ground-based measurements. The comparison of ACAM radiance with simulations using coincident ozonesonde and OMI data shows large wavelength-dependent biases in ACAM data, varying from ~− 19 % at 310 [*]nm to 5 % at 360 [*]nm.

Using different cross sections can significantly affect the retrievals, by up to 12 Dobson Units (DU, 1 DU= 2. 69 &times; 10 16 molecules cm&minus; 2 ) in total column ozone, up to 10 DU in tropospheric column ozone, and up to 100 % in retrieved ozone values for individual atmospheric layers.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{describe}} the temporal evolution of milk yield (MY) and composition in extended lactations, 21 658 lactations of Italian Holstein cows were analyzed. Six empirical mathematical models currently used to fit 305 standard lactations (Wood, Wilmink, Legendre, Ali and Schaeffer, quadratic and cubic splines) and one function developed specifically for extended lactations (a modification of the Dijkstra model) were tested to identify a suitable function for describing patterns until 1000 days in milk (DIM). Comparison was performed on individual patterns and on average curves grouped according to parity (primiparous and multiparous) and lactation length (standard ≤ 305 days, and extended from 600 to 1000 days). For average patterns, polynomial models showed better fitting performances {{when compared with the}} three or four parameters models. However, LEG and spline regression, showed poor prediction ability at the extremes of the lactation trajectory. The Ali and Schaeffer polynomial and Dijkstra function were effective in modelling average curves for MY and protein percentage, whereas a <b>reduced</b> <b>fitting</b> ability was observed for fat percentage and somatic cell score. When individual patterns were fitted, polynomial models outperformed nonlinear functions. No detectable differences were observed between standard and extended patterns in the initial phase of lactation, with similar values of peak production and time at peak. A considerable difference in persistency was observed between 200 and 305 DIM. Such a difference resulted in an estimated difference between standard and extended cycle of about 7 and 9 kg/day for daily yield at 305 DIM and of 463 and 677 kg of cumulated milk production at 305 DIM for the first- and second-parity groups, respectively.
