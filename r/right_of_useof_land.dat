40|$|Objectives: We {{investigated}} {{the level of}} adoption of Health Information Technologies (HIT) services, and {{the factors that influence}} this, amongst specialised and primary care physi-cians; in Andalusia, Spain. Methods: We analysed the physicians’ responses to an online survey. First, we performed astatistical descriptive analysis of the data; thereafter, a principal component analysis; and finally an order logit model to explain the effect of the use in the adoption and to analysewhich are the existing barriers. Results: The principal component analysis revealed three main uses of Health InformationTechnologies: Electronic Health Records (EHR), ePrescription and patient management andtelemedicine services. Results from an ordered logit model showed that the frequency <b>of</b> <b>useof</b> HIT is associated with the physicians’ perceived usefulness. Lack of financing appearedas a common barrier to the adoption of the three types of services. For ePrescription and patient management, the physician’s lack of skills is still a barrier. Inthe case of telemedicine services, lack of security and lack of interest amongst professionalsare the existing barriers. Conclusions: EHR functionalities are fully adopted, in terms of perceived usefulness. EPrescription and patient management are almost fully adopted, while telemedicine is in anearly stage of adoption. JRC. J. 3 -Information Societ...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. Maternal smoking during {{pregnancy}} {{has been shown}} to be the mostsignificant risk factor for the foetus and it is associated with complications{{during pregnancy}}, unfavourable results in childbirth and avariety of health problems in newborn infants and children. Most ofthese negative effects are reversible if smoking cessation is achievedduring the first trimester of gestation. Smoking cessation has beenfound to contribute to a decrease in low birth weight and prematurityrates and reduced needs for health care in childhood. Successfulinterventions for smoking cessation can be considered cost effectivebecause, regardless of their intensity, their cost is minimal comparedwith the beneficial results. The interventions that are considered tobe the most effective are the intensive, cognitive-behavioural type,which involve face-to-face contact, more and longer sessions, andthe use of a self-help manual, and accompanied with sessions afterchildbirth to prevent a post-partum smoking relapse. There is somedebate in the international scientific community on the issue <b>of</b> <b>useof</b> medication for smoking cessation during pregnancy. Recently,the use of nicotine replacement products has been suggested,for highly dependent smokers only, after careful assessment andwith close supervision, and provided that the pregnant woman isdetermined to stop smoking. The effectiveness and safety of theseproducts, however, have not been sufficiently evaluated. Pneumon 2011, 24 (1) : 385 - 395...|$|R
