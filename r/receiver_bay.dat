5000|$|Bruce Edward Hill (born February 29, 1964) is {{a former}} {{professional}} American football player who selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL Draft. A 6'0", 180-lb. wide receiver from Arizona State, Hill played his entire NFL career for the Buccaneers from 1987 to 1993. His best year as a pro came during the 1988 season when he led all Tampa <b>Bay</b> <b>receivers</b> with 58 receptions for 1,040 yards and 9 touchdowns and was named Most Valuable Player.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{a federal judge}} in Massachusetts {{appointed}} Pepper <b>receiver</b> for the <b>Bay</b> State Gas Company, a bankrupt Massachusetts utility which had been promoted by former Philadelphian J. Edward Addicks, who had also caused controversy (and the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by trying to buy the Senate seat from Delaware). Pepper then sued a number of nationally-known businessmen, including William Rockefeller, Henry Rogers, and Thomas Lawson, for enriching themselves {{at the expense of the}} utility, and secured several recoveries, as well as a successful receivership of the utility.|$|R
50|$|Green <b>Bay</b> <b>receiver</b> Antonio Freeman {{returned}} {{the second half}} kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown, but a holding penalty on Darren Sharper eliminated the score and moved the ball {{all the way back}} to their own 11-yard line. Green Bay still managed to drive into scoring range, but on the eighth play of the drive, Bucs defensive back Donnie Abraham intercepted a pass from Favre on the Tampa Bay 6-yard line. Dilfer subsequently led the Bucs offense 94 yards in 8 plays to score on fullback Mike Alstott's 6-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 13-7. But two possessions later, the Packers drove 54 yards and scored with a 2-yard touchdown run by Levens. Then, Favre closed out the scoring by running in the 2-point conversion on a quarterback draw.|$|R
50|$|Born in Sharon, Connecticut, Judd {{graduated}} from Albany Medical College and practiced medicine in Dutchess County, New York. In 1829, 1835, and 1836, Judd {{served in the}} New York State Legislature. Then, in 1841, President William Henry Harrison appointed Judd land <b>receiver</b> in Green <b>Bay,</b> Wisconsin Territory. He moved to Fox Lake, Wisconsin in 1845. Judd was also involved in the railroad business, serving {{as president of the}} La Crosse Railroad. He served the first and second Wisconsin Constitutional Conventions of 1846 and 1847-1848. Judd was a Democrat, but he backed the Republican candidate, John C. Frémont, in the 1856 election. Judd also served in the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1860 and in the Wisconsin State Senate in 1866 and 1867, at which point he was the oldest member of the senate (at age 69). He died in Fox Lake, Wisconsin on March 2, 1873.|$|R
5|$|The Buccaneers almost {{exceeded}} their worst-ever loss, a 42–0 {{loss to the}} Pittsburgh Steelers, on its 10th anniversary. They {{were shut}} out until the fourth quarter, and only scored when Chicago Bears safety Todd Bell intercepted a Steve Young pass and lateraled it to Mike Richardson, who attempted to lateral it to Shaun Gayle, only to have Tampa <b>Bay</b> <b>receiver</b> Vince Heflin intercept the lateral and run it in for a score. Mike Tomczak ran for the Bears' first score. Later, a Walter Payton touchdown was called back on a holding penalty. The Buccaneers stopped the Bears on fourth-and-1, but an offside penalty on Craig Swoope gave the Bears another chance. Tomczak fumbled, however, causing him to be benched in favor of Doug Flutie. Flutie scored two touchdowns, one passing and one running, before Tomczak returned in the second half. Tampa Bay scored a second time on Young's 14-yard pass to Calvin Magee, but Lew Barnes returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown. Magee's 143 receiving yards remain (as of 2009) the Buccaneers' single-game record for a tight end.|$|R

But two possessions later, Brooks' 14-yard punt return gave the Packers the ball on their 46-yard line, where they proceeded to drive 54 yards and score with a 2-yard touchdown run by Levens. Then, Favre closed out the scoring by running in the two-point conversion on a quarterback draw. Tampa Bay's final three possessions would result in two turnovers on downs and an interception by Packers defensive back Mike Prior.|$|R
5000|$|After {{retirement}} as {{an active}} player, Cromwell began his coaching career with the Rams. He served as a defensive and special teams assistant in 1991 before being hired by Mike Holmgren to coach special teams for the Green Bay Packers in 1992. From 1992-97, Cromwell headed up the special teams for the Packers. The Packers' punt return unit led the NFL in 1996 with a 15.1-yard return average. Five different times during the 1996 season, one of Cromwell's players was honored as Special Teams Player of the Week. Also in 1996, the Packers won Super Bowl XXXI against the New England Patriots in New Orleans with special teams player Desmond Howard winning the Super Bowl MVP honors. The following year, the Packers reached Super Bowl XXXII in San Diego against the Denver Broncos. In 1998, he moved from special teams to coach the Packers' wide receivers and Cromwell worked with the wide <b>receivers</b> at Green <b>Bay</b> in 1998 helping Pro Bowler Antonio Freeman lead the NFL with 1,424 yards on 84 catches ...|$|R

40|$|Movements of 30 lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) tagged with {{acoustic}} transmitters were monitored {{over one}} year using {{an array of}} acoustic <b>receivers</b> in Carmel <b>Bay,</b> California. For all tagged lingcod, residence times in the array varied from 3. 8 to 100 %of their respective days at liberty. On average, lingcod spent 42. 5 ± 17. 9 (SE) consecutive days in and 8. 1 ± 1. 5 (SE) consecutive days out of the array. Residency significantly decreased with total length for female lingcod, while a significant relationship was not exhibited for male lingcod. Large female lingcod, at lengths > 90 % maturity, spent {{the least amount of}} time in the array but were present during the fall spawning season and briefly during the spring. There was an observed decline in residency in April for males and small female lingcod, the timing of which coincided with the post nest-guarding dispersal period for males and with the return of large females into the array. Large female lingcod were recorded at significantly greater depths within the array compared to male and small female lingcod. Lingcod exhibited strong site fidelity, with tagged fish recorded on one receiver for an average of 76. 8 % (± 3. 7 SE) of all l-hour time bins containing signals and on two adjacent receivers for 91. 0 % (± 4. 3 SE) of all l-hour time bins. There {{was no significant difference in}} site fidelity among sexes and size classes of tagged lingcod, and patterns of movements were not found to be different among lingcod released in high, medium, and low relief habitats...|$|R
40|$|To study {{horseshoe}} crab Limulus polyphemus spawning behavior and migration over a large-spatial extent (> 100 km), we arrayed fixed station radio <b>receivers</b> throughout Delaware <b>Bay</b> and deployed radio transmitters and archival tags on adult {{horseshoe crab}}s {{prior to their}} spawning season. We tagged and released 160 females and 60 males in 2004 and 217 females in 2005. The array covered approximately 140 km of shoreline. Recapture rates were > 70 % with multi-year recaptures. We categorized adult age by carapace wear. Older females tended to spawn {{earlier in the season}} and more frequently than young females, but those tendencies were more apparent in 2004 when spawning overall occurred earlier than in 2005 when spawning was delayed possibly due to decreased water temperatures. Timing of initial spawning within a year was correlated with water temperature. After adjusting for day of first spring tide, the day of first spawning was 4 days earlier for every 1 degree (°C) rise in mean daily water temperature in May. Seventy nine % of spawning occurred during nighttime high tides. Fifty five % of spawning occurred within 3 d of a spring tide, which was slightly higher than the 47 % expected if spawning was uniformly distributed regardless of tidal cycle. Within the same spawning season, males and females were observed spawning or intertidally resting at more than one beach separated by > 5 km. Between years, most (77 %) did not return to spawn at the same beach. Probability of stranding was strongly age dependent for males and females with older adults experiencing higher stranding rates. Horseshoe crabs staging in the shallow waters east of the channel spawned exclusively along the eastern (NJ) shoreline, but those staging west of the channel spawned throughout the bay. Overall, several insights emerged from the use of radio telemetry, which advances our understanding of horseshoe crab ecology and will be useful in conserving the Delaware Bay horseshoe crab population and habitats[Current Zoology 56 (5) : 563 – 574, 2010]...|$|R
