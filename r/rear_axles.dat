25|$|Audi's 'trademark' quattro {{permanent}} (or semi-permanent, {{dependent on}} gearbox type) four-wheel drive system {{was the only}} offering for the drivetrain. This normally distributes the engine torque as a 'default' 50:50 between front and <b>rear</b> <b>axles,</b> but can automatically dynamically apportion up to a bias of 20:80 to 80:20 front and rear. The automatic transmission utilizes a hydraulically controlled multi-plate clutch to apportion drive between front and <b>rear</b> <b>axles,</b> whereas the manual transmission variants utilize a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing center differential. The rear axle final drive unit contains a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing differential, instead of the more common hypoid open differential.|$|E

25|$|Some all {{wheel drive}} {{electric}} vehicles solve this challenge using one motor for each axle, thereby eliminating a mechanical differential between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>axles.</b> An {{example of this is}} the dual motor variant of the Tesla Model S, which on a millisecond scale can control the torque distribution electronically between its two motors.|$|E
25|$|Locking {{differentials}} work by temporarily locking {{together a}} differential's output shafts, causing all wheels to {{turn at the}} same rate, providing torque in case of slippage. This is generally used for the center differential, which distributes power between the front and the <b>rear</b> <b>axles.</b> While a drivetrain that turns all wheels equally would normally fight the driver and cause handling problems, {{this is not a}} concern when wheels are slipping.|$|E

25|$|The {{differential}} {{does this}} by distributing angular force (in {{the form of}} torque) evenly, while distributing angular velocity (turning speed) such that the average for the two output shafts is {{equal to that of}} the differential ring gear.

The fatigue damage of the broken crack at the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> on the durable enhancement roads was calculated and contrasted detailedly. At the same time, a six-channel MTS coupling system is used to conduct the vibration mode frequency sweep to the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> and car body of test car and the benchmarking car, and through vibration frequency sweep, {{an analysis of the}} reason of differences between the two cars and its relationship with the car body vibration frequency is made. The enhancement test and frequency sweep results show that the fatigue damage of two vehicles focuses mainly on the washboard road, the impact of the speed on the fatigue damage of the test car fluctuates significantly, the damages of the two cars vary greatly when the forced vibration excitation frequency of the washboard road is greater than 20 Hz and the vibration modal frequency of the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> is close to the excitation frequency of the washboard road, causing high stress distribution and then fatigue fracture to the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> of the test car.

25|$|Lancia {{is renowned}} in the {{automotive}} world for introducing cars with numerous innovations. These include the Theta of 1913, {{which was the}} first European production car to feature a complete electrical system as standard equipment. Lancia's first car adopting a monocoque chassis – the Lambda produced from 1922 to 1931 - featured 'Sliding Pillar' independent front suspension that incorporated the spring and hydraulic damper into a single unit (a feature that would be employed in subsequent Lancia's, up to the Appia that was replaced in 1963). 1948 saw the first 5 speed gearbox to be fitted to a production car (Series 3 Ardea). Lancia premiered the first full-production V6 engine, in the 1950 Aurelia, after earlier industry-leading experiments with V8 and V12 engine configurations. It was also the first manufacturer to produce a V4 engine. Other innovations involved the use of independent suspension in production cars (in an era where live axles where common practice for both the front and <b>rear</b> <b>axles</b> of a car) and rear transaxles, which were first fitted to the Aurelia and Flaminia range. This drive for innovation, constant quest for excellence, fixation of quality, complex construction processes and antiqued production machinery meant that all cars essentially had to be hand-made. With little commonality between the various models, the cost of production continued to increase extensively, while demand did not eventually affecting Lancia's viability.|$|E
25|$|Models were well-proportioned {{and looked}} similar in style to {{contemporary}} Matchbox or Budgie Toys. For example, similar to Matchbox, the Land Rover (which {{came with a}} horse trailer) had windows, grey or black plastic wheels and a black base (see photo, Force 1988, p.47).The model in the photograph is a very poor example and any self respecting collector wouldn't have it on the shelf. Wheels, however, (the Land Rover had one on the bonnet {{as well as one}} underneath) were somewhat flatter and wider than those of Matchbox and their circumference was not ribbed at the beginning but this feature was added later. The baseplate, however, was pressed steel with etched lettering (not diecast with moulded lettering {{as was the case with}} Matchbox, Budgie Toys or Lone Star vehicles). Finally, the Land Rover had a trailer hook behind which was a cut, curved extension of the baseplate. The front and <b>rear</b> <b>axles</b> were held to the vehicle differently. The front was covered by the tube of the baseplate and held pinched on each side by extensions of the diecast body. The rear axle was exposed and run through holes in rounded sections folded over on each side of the plate.
