The reports of assault included a local registered sex offender breaking and entering into the college's Mayflower Apartments and raping a student, and a convicted sex offender photographing female students while showering or undressing. In response to events, Bowdoin requested that the Brunswick police increase patrols near the college and issued alerts to students, faculty, and staff. With a reported 17 rapes occurring in 2014, the college has stated {{that the increase in}} number is attributed to [...] "new federal <b>reporting</b> <b>rules</b> and an increased awareness on campus." [...] The following summer the college would be listed in an article by The Washington Post analyzing crime statistics entitled [...] "Grade Point: These colleges have the most reports of rape", placing 7th in the country for most reported rapes per 1,000 students.|$|E

I find that there is a substantial increase in the diversification discount under SFAS No. 131. Further analysis indicates that the changes in the diversification discount are unrelated to the changes in firm value or investment efficiency. Instead, the measures of diversity appear to be more associated with the changes in excess value. This indicates that excess value is not a clean measure of diversification discount...|$|R

40|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} {{increasing}} at epidemic rates, and thus {{there is a}} need to target appropriate childhood behaviors that contribute to obesity. Many factors contribute to childhood weight status. The aim of this study was to look at relationships between parental rules to limit snacking while watching television and childhood weight status. The study looked at the presence of the behavior of snacking while watching television yesterday, congruence between child- and parent-reported perception of the presence of rules to limit snacking while watching television, and parent-reported frequency of children following rules to limit snacking while watching television. The outcomes were examined in a multi-ethnic population of children ages 6 to 9 years in Southeast Texas. ^ This study was a cross-sectional secondary data analysis of the pilot program, Fun Families. This study examined baseline data from 202 parent-child dyads, which included both the control (N= 101) and intervention groups (N= 101). Data were gathered using validated questions that were administered to 6 - 9 year old children and their primary caregiver (referred to as parent in the rest of the discussion) in Southeast Texas, between 2006 and 2008. The main study outcome was childhood weight status based on CDC BMI-for-age categories. The independent variables are (1) the presence of parental rules to limit snacking while watching television, (2) the congruence between child and parent about the presence of rules to limit snacking while watching television, and (3) the parent-reported frequency of the child following the rules to limit snacking while watching television. Chi-Square analyses were used to determine if weight status was different for (1) children who <b>reported</b> <b>rules</b> to limit snacking yesterday, (2) children who reported snacking, (3) children whose parents <b>reported</b> <b>rules</b> were present, and (4) those who had rule congruence with the parents not. Chi-Square analyses also examined if there was a difference in the presence of snacking behavior for children who <b>reported</b> <b>rules,</b> for children whose parents <b>reported</b> <b>rules,</b> and for those children who had congruence about rules. Linear regressions were used to determine if any of the studied variables predicted increased weight status or reported snacking while watching television yesterday. ^ This study found that child-reported snacking yesterday was significantly different for children who <b>reported</b> <b>rules</b> (4. 12, p= 0. 04). Child-reported rules was significantly associated with (p= - 0. 14, α= 0. 04) and predicted child-reported snacking yesterday (R 2 0. 021, p= 0. 04, t= - 2. 04, 95 % CI - 0. 31, - 0. 01). There was statistical significant incongruence between child and parent perception about the presence of rules to limit snacking yesterday (15. 06, p= 0. 00). For this population, parent education level was significantly associated with child-reported rules (r= - 0. 16, p= 0. 02), child-reported snacking yesterday (r= - 0. 15, p= 0. 04), and parent-reported frequency of child following rules to limit snacking (r= 0. 29, p= - 0. 01). Parent-reported speaking another language besides English at home was significantly associated with parent-reported rules (r= 0. 17, p= 0. 02). ^ Although the studied variables did not show any significant associations or predictors for childhood weight status, the significant discord between parent and child perception about the presence of rules provides valuable information to future interventions that aim to reduce childhood weight status. Including the creation and enforcement of parental rules in interventions to reduce childhood weight status will be beneficial for future studies. ...|$|R
