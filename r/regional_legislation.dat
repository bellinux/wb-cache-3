40|$|Access to {{effective}} acute stroke services {{is a crucial}} factor to reduce stroke-related death and disability, but is limited {{in different parts of}} Italy. Our study addresses this inequality across the Italian regions by examining the <b>regional</b> <b>legislations</b> issued to adopt and implement the State-Regional Council agreement 03 / 02 / 2005 as to the acute stroke management. All decrees and resolutions as to acute stroke were collected from each region and examined by the means of a check list including quantitative and qualitative characteristics, selected in accordance with the recommendations from the State-Regional Council document. Each completed check list was then sent to each regional reference person, who filled in the section on the implementation of the indications and compliance, with the collaboration of stroke specialists if necessary. The study was carried out from November 2009 to September 2010. The documents and information were collected from 19 regions. Our survey revealed disparities both in terms of number of decrees and resolutions and of topics covered by the <b>regional</b> <b>legislations</b> about stroke care. Most legislations lacked practical and economical details. This feedback from national and regional stroke regulations revealed a need of more concrete indications. Involvement of various stakeholders (legislators, consumers, providers) might possibly ensure that policies are actually adopted, implemented and maintained. Although considerable challenges are present to the development of standard and optimal stroke care more widely across Italian regions, the potential gains from such developments are substantial. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Italia...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time {{introduced}} on the Japanese market, bioactive fish hydrolysates are now available {{all over the world}} as food supplements, functional food ingredients or nutricosmeceuticals. They are generally produced from low value fish waste, an almost inexhaustible source of raw material, and are sold as high value products, making them economically interesting from a manufacturer's view point. Most of these products have health or structure/function claims on their packages with different actions like antihypertensive, blood-glucose lowering, anxiolytic, and skin anti-aging activities. Although the different <b>regional</b> <b>legislations</b> all aim to assure consumer safety and prevent misleading of the consumer, the number of legally approved fish hydrolysate containing products drastically differs among different regions. This is because products that have been positively evaluated based on safety and efficacy in one region were found to have not enough evidence for efficacy in another region. These findings call for further international harmonization of the regulation and classification of these products. Moreover, interaction studies of these bioactive products with the normal diet or medicines are generally not performed, keeping the consumer uninformed of the possible risks of combining these products with medicinal products or other food ingredients...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyze {{different}} forms of international protection of children before forced child marriages. This text focuses on introduction into the issue which {{represents one of the}} most alarming and the most quickly spreading problems in the field of human rights of children. In spite of the fact, that every few seconds is a child deliberately married to become a sexual and domestic slave, this topic remains rather on the edge of public interest. The thesis can be divided into two main parts. We could call them theoretical descriptive part which is covered by first four chapters and analytic part which works mainly with case studies and UN documents and aims at pointing out some problems of application of law in practice. This part is covered by chapter five and six. As it was said, this thesis is composed of seven chapters. The aim of first two of them is to explain nature and risks of child marriages as well as reasons why they are occurring. Third chapter sums up current international legal documents dealing with the topic of child protection in general and in its subchapters are treated <b>regional</b> <b>legislations</b> (American, Asian, and European).
