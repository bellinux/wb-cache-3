25|$|The ongoing {{controversy}} over high-level <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> {{is a major}} constraint on the nuclear power’s global expansion. Most scientists agree that the main proposed long-term solution is deep geological burial, either in a mine or a deep borehole. However, almost six decades after commercial nuclear energy began, no government has succeeded in opening such a repository for civilian high-level nuclear waste, although Finland is in the advanced stage {{of the construction of}} such facility, the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository. Reprocessing or recycling spent nuclear fuel options already available or under active development still generate waste and so are not a total solution, but can reduce the sheer quantity of waste, and there are many such active programs worldwide. Deep geological burial remains the only responsible way to deal with high-level nuclear waste. The Morris Operation is currently the only de facto high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCompacted {{expansive}} clays {{are often}} {{considered as a}} possible buffer material in high-level deep <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposals.</b> After the installation of waste canisters, the engineered clay barriers are subjected to thermo-hydro-mechanical actions {{in the form of}} water infiltration from the geological barrier, heat dissipation from the <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> canisters, and stresses generated by clay swelling under almost confined conditions. The aim of the present work is to develop a constitutive model that is able to describe the behaviour of compacted expansive clays under these coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical actions. The proposed model is based on two existing models: one for the hydro-mechanical behaviour of compacted expansive clays and another for the thermo-mechanical behaviour of saturated clays. The elaborated model has been validated using the thermo-hydro-mechanical test results on the compacted MX 80 bentonite. Comparison between the model prediction and the experimental data show that this model is able to reproduce the main features of volume changes: heating at constant suction and pressure induces either expansion or contraction; the mean yield stress changes with variations of suction or temperature...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHighly {{compacted}} sand-bentonite mixtures {{are often}} considered as possible engineered barriers in deep high-level <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposals.</b> In-situ, the saturation of these barriers from their initially unsaturated {{state is a}} complex hydro-mechanical coupled process in which temperature effects also play a role. The key parameter {{of this process is}} the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the barrier. In this paper, isothermal infiltration experiments were conducted to determine the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity according to the instantaneous profile method. To do so, total suction changes were monitored at different locations along the soil specimen by using resistivity relative humidity probes. Three constant volume infiltration tests were conducted showing, unexpectedly, a decrease of the hydraulic conductivity during infiltration. One test performed under free-swell conditions showed the opposite and standard trend. These observations were interpreted in terms of microstructure changes during wetting, both under constant volume and free swell conditions...|$|R
