5|$|Dangerous or not, Bache {{soon began}} a lifelong crusade to win {{popularity}} for Liszt's works in England. In 1865 {{he began a}} series of annual concerts in conjunction with singer Gustave Garcia. They began modestly, in Collard's Rooms, Grosvenor Street. As they increased in popularity, they were relocated to the more spacious Beethoven <b>Rooms</b> <b>in</b> Cavendish Square, then to the Queen's Concert <b>Rooms</b> <b>in</b> Hanover Square, and finally to St. James's Hall in Regents Square. At first these concerts were of instrumental and chamber works and piano arrangements. In 1868, they had grown to include choral works, which allowed pieces such as Liszt's Soldatenlied and choruses from Wagner's Tannhäuser and Lohengrin to be programmed. By 1871, the concerts had been changed to an orchestral format.|$|E
5|$|Despite the limitations, Robinett {{was able}} to {{introduce}} concepts {{that at the time}} were unfamiliar to players.

Further, off-screen objects such as the bat would continue to move according to their programming behavior.|$|E
5|$|From 11 to 14 February 1945, the Yalta Conference {{took place}} in the neighbouring, former {{imperial}} Livadia Palace; this was between representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union.

Within two weeks, construction workers had restored 22 <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> the main palace, 23 <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> the Shuvalov wing, and even replanted the palace gardens. The palace's English-inspired architectural style gained praise from Churchill himself: Churchill was so taken by the garden's Medici lions that he later asked Stalin if he could take them home; Stalin declined the request.|$|E

5|$|The Checkers, is a {{restaurant}} with <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> Montgomery, Powys, Wales. Historically, the building {{was used as a}} coaching inn dating from the 17th century.

There are two main <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> the restaurant, and three hotel rooms. It has received a mixed reception from critics, who have praised particular dishes but criticised the atmosphere. It serves both modern and classic French dishes, and in 2016, switched to only using set menus.|$|E

5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho is a {{striking}} example of the mid-century modern architectural style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and poured concrete, natural stone, and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment. Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. <b>Rooms</b> <b>in</b> the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century design standards, for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged <b>rooms,</b> <b>in</b> some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level, but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally roomy and airy thanks to its original decision to buck design trends.|$|E
