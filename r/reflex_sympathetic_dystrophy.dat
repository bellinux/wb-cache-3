40|$|Calcium {{hydroxyapatite}} crystal {{deposits in}} the rotator cuff {{are a common}} source of shoulder pain. Calcified tendinitis can lead to chronic disability and may interfere with daily living activities. Traditionally, the initial conservative therapeutic approach consists of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical rehabilitation to prevent loss of joint mobility and local steroid injections. When conservative treatment fails, open surgical or arthroscopic excision of calcium deposits can be performed. Removal of the calcium deposits from the tendon significantly accelerates healing of the tendonopathy, however, the open surgical and even arthroscopic techniques are prone to prolonged post-operative disability and complications such as <b>reflex</b> <b>sympathetic</b> muscle <b>dystrophy.</b> Image-guided interventions to remove calcium deposits in the rotator cuff {{have been used as}} far back as 30 years ago. However, these procedures were mainly done under X-ray fluoroscopic guidance and utilized two large-bore needles, one to inject normal saline and the other to fragment the calcification and aspirate the fluid containing the calcium fragments. Use of these needles generally resulted in significant damage to the tendon. More recently, ultrasound (US) (figure 1) has been utilized to guide the intervention; this allows better visualization of smaller deposits, while avoiding radiation exposure to the patient and the performer. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In 1900, Sudeck first {{described}} a post-traumatic pain syndrome with edema and trophic changes.

CRPS usually develops after a minor trauma {{such as an}} injury or fracture or after surgery, but spontaneous development of CRPS type 1 (CRPS 1) has also been described. There {{are two types of}} CRPS described; CRPS 1 arises without an obvious, detectable nerve lesion, and type 2 (CRPS 2) manifests with an obvious, detectable lesion. The observation that only certain patients develop CRPS 1 after a common trauma has led to the idea that some patients are susceptible to developing CRPS 1. There are indications for a genetic susceptibility for CRPS 129 - 33, and there is growing evidence for immunological attainment of this syndrome, but a definitive conclusion cannot yet be made.

2500|$|The {{condition}} currently {{known as}} CRPS was originally described during the American Civil War by Silas Weir Mitchell, who is sometimes also credited with inventing the name [...] "causalgia." [...] However, this term was actually coined by Mitchell's friend Robley Dunglison from the Greek words for heat and for pain. Contrary {{to what is}} commonly accepted, it emerges that these causalgias were certainly major by {{the importance of the}} vasomotor and sudomotor symptoms but stemmed from minor neurological lesions. Mitchell even thought that the cause of CRPS came from the cohabitation of the altered and unaltered cutaneous fibres on the same nerve distribution territory. In the 1940s, the term <b>reflex</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>dystrophy</b> came into use to describe this condition, based on the theory that sympathetic hyperactivity was involved in the pathophysiology. In 1959, Noordenbos observed in causalgia patients that [...] "the damage of the nerve is always partial." [...] Misuse of the terms, as well as doubts about the underlying pathophysiology, led to calls for better nomenclature. In 1993, a special consensus workshop held in Orlando, Florida, provided the umbrella term [...] "complex regional pain syndrome", with causalgia and RSD as subtypes.|$|E

40|$|Acid-sensing ion {{channels}} (ASICs) in sensory nerves are {{responsive to}} increases in the levels of protons in the extracellular medium. Prior {{studies suggest that the}} muscle metabolite, lactic acid, plays a role in <b>reflex</b> <b>sympathetic</b> and cardiovascular responses via stimulation of thin muscle afferent nerves. Also, femoral artery occlusion augments the <b>reflex</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerve response in rats. ASIC 3 is a main subtype to appear in sensory nerves in mediating the response induced by increases in protons in the interstitial space of contracting muscles. Thus, in this article, we hypothesized that femoral occlusion increases the expression of ASIC 3 in primary afferent neurons innervating muscles, and this contributes to the exaggerated <b>reflex</b> <b>sympathetic</b> responses. Femoral occlusion/vascular insufficiency of the hindlimb muscles was induced by the femoral artery ligation in rats. First, Western blot analysis shows that 24 – 72 h of femoral artery ligation significantly increased the expression of ASIC 3 protein in dorsal root ganglion (optical density, 1. 0 ± 0. 07 in control vs. 1. 65 ± 0. 1 after 24 h of occlusion, P < 0. 05; n = 6 in each group). There were no significant differences for increases in ASIC 3 24 and 72 h postocclusion. Second, experiments using fluorescent immunohistochemistry and retrograde-labeling technique show that a greater percentage of ASIC 3 staining neurons are localized in muscle-innervating dorsal root ganglion neurons after the arterial occlusion (78 ± 3 % in 24 h post occlusion vs. 59 ± 5 % in control, P < 0. 05; n = 6 in each group). Third, the reflex responses in renal sympathetic nerve and arterial blood pressure induced by the stimulation of ASIC were examined after an injection of lactic acid into the arterial blood supply of hindlimb muscles of control rats and ligated rats. The results demonstrate that the sympathetic and pressor responses to lactic acid were significantly augmented after femoral occlusion compared with those in the control group. The data {{of this study suggest that}} enhanced ASIC 3 expression in muscle afferent nerves contributes to the exaggerated <b>reflex</b> <b>sympathetic</b> and pressor responses to lactic acid as seen in arterial occlusion...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sympathetic</b> <b>reflexes</b> in an {{in vitro}} frog spinal cord {{appeared}} to be qualitatively similar to those observed in cats in vivo. The present {{study was conducted to}} determine whether or not this similarity extended to catecholamine effects on spinal sympa-thetic reflexes and to examine the adrenoceptor mechanisms responsible for these effects. Norepinephrine inhibited spinal <b>sympathetic</b> <b>reflexes</b> elicited by supramaximal electrical stim-ulation of the second spinal nerve in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibition could be mimicked by other alpha adrenoceptor agonists and was antagonized by phentolamine. No effect of norepinephrine was observed when submaximal stimuli were employed. Epinephrine facilitated reflex activity elicited by both submaximal and supramaximal stimulation; however, in the presence of propranolol, an inhibitory effect of epinephrine was observed. At high concentrations, dopamine inhibited spinal <b>sympathetic</b> <b>reflex</b> activity and this inhibition was antagonized by phentolamine. l-Dopa produced a slow-onset, long-lasting inhibition which could be blocked by pre-treatment with a decarboxylase inhibitor. It is concluded that alpha adrenoceptor agonists acting on alpha receptors can inhibit spinal <b>sympathetic</b> <b>reflex</b> activity and that the inhibition is dependent on the intensity of stimulation. Activation of beta adrenoceptors facilitates, whereas activation of dopamine re-ceptors has no effect on, spinal <b>sympathetic</b> <b>reflexes.</b> These alpha and beta adrenoceptor mechanisms may function in the modulation of sympathetic preganglionic activity in the intact animal.
