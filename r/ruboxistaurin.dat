40|$|Platelets are {{essential}} in the initiation, growth and stabilisation of thrombi in normal haemostasis upon {{injury to the}} vasculature, or in cardiovascular disease upon rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. Protein kinases are a crucial component in platelet signalling pathways, playing a combination {{of positive and negative}} regulatory roles. The AGC kinase family contains several known key regulatory kinases in platelet signalling, most notably PKC. PKC is largely considered a positive regulator of platelet function, although recent data suggests that some PKC isoforms play minor negative regulatory roles. Secretion of pro-aggregatory and pro-inflammatory mediators from platelet granules, a process previously shown to be PKC-dependent, is necessary for propagation of activation and for thrombus growth and stability. For this reason, in this study a clinically relevant PKCP inhibitor <b>ruboxistaurin,</b> used in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, has been demonstrated to be an effective anti-platelet compound acting primarily through the inhibition of secretion. <b>Ruboxistaurin</b> ablated platelet aggregation which could be restored by exogenous ADP, unlike secretion which remained strongly inhibited. Additionally, thrombus formation under flow was significantly reduced in the presence of <b>ruboxistaurin.</b> This promising data suggests there may be potential clinical uses of <b>ruboxistaurin</b> as an anti-thrombotic agent. The mechanism by which PKC regulates granule secretion is yet to be elucidated. Unc 13 d'inx mice lack Munc 13 - 4, a protein responsible for coordinating components of the secretory complex, possibly directly regulated by or downstream of PKC. Munc 13 - 4 was shown to be absolutely essential for dense granule secretion, and knockdown of the gene caused a reduction in aggregation and thrombus formation, both of which were rescued by exogenous ADP. However, this study also reveals the existence of a Munc 13 - 4 independent pathway, and a novel positive feedback mechanism for u granule release via ADP and P 2 Y 12. The role of another AGC kinase, PKN, had not previously been studied in platelets. It was, hypothesised that, like PKC, PKNl and PKN 3, the isoforms identified in platelets, would act as regulatory proteins via secretion and cytoskeletal reorganisation. Using PKNl/ 3 -I- mice, PKN was revealed to be a negative regulator of aggregation, integrin UlIbP 3 activation and spreading. The work presented here demonstrates the varied positive and negative roles that protein kinases play in platelet function, including, but by no means exclusively, in secretion. It also reveals a novel ADP-dependent pathway in platelet secretion and demonstrates that a clinically tested PKC inhibitor has potential as a novel anti-thrombotic therapy.

40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} {{has been}} associated with the progression of chronic kidney disease in both diabetes and obesity. In order to determine the cellular mechanisms contributing to this, we characterized insulin signaling in renal tubules and glomeruli during diabetic and insulin-resistant states using streptozotocin-diabetic and Zucker fatty-insulin-resistant rats. Compared with nondiabetic and Zucker lean rats, the insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate- 1 (IRS 1), Akt, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 α were selectively inhibited in the glomeruli but not in the renal tubules of both respective models. Protein, but not mRNA levels of IRS 1, was decreased only in the glomeruli of streptozotocin-diabetic rats likely due to increased ubiquitination. Treatment with the protein kinase C-β inhibitor, <b>ruboxistaurin,</b> enhanced insulin actions and elevated IRS 1 expression. In glomerular endothelial cells, high glucose inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 α; decreased IRS 1 protein expression and increased its association with ubiquitin.

However, {{our understanding of}} how PVAT potentially contributes to coronary disease as a complication of obesity/metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains limited. The current study investigated whether PVAT-derived leptin impairs coronary vascular function via PKC- in MetS. Methods and Results—Coronary arteries with and without PVAT were collected from lean or MetS Ossabaw miniature swine for isometric tension studies. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation to bradykinin was significantly reduced in MetS. PVAT did not affect bradykinin-mediated dilation in arteries from lean swine but significantly exacerbated endothelial dysfunction in arteries from MetS swine. PVAT-induced impairment was reversed by inhibition of either PKC- with <b>ruboxistaurin</b> (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Ind) or leptin receptor signaling with a recombinant, pegylated leptin antagonist. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated increased PVAT-derived leptin and coronary leptin receptor density with MetS. Coronary PKC- activity was increased in both MetS arteries exposed to PVAT and lean arteries exposed to leptin. Finally, leptin-induced endothelial dysfunction was reversed by <b>ruboxistaurin.</b> Conclusion—Increases in epicardial PVAT leptin exacerbate coronary endothelial dysfunction in MetS via a PKC [...] dependent pathway.

40|$|AbstractDiabetic retinopathy, {{the most}} common {{long-term}} complication of diabetes mellitus, {{remains one of the}} leading causes of blindness worldwide. Strict metabolic control, tight blood pressure control, laser photocoagulation, and vitrectomy remain the standard care for diabetic retinopathy. Focal/grid photocoagulation is a better treatment than intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in eyes with diabetic macular edema and should be considered as the first-line therapeutic option. The current evidence suggests that intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents result in a temporary improvement of visual acuity and a short-term reduction in central macular thickness in patients with refractory diabetic macular edema and are an effective adjunctive treatments to laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy. However, triamcinolone is associated with risks of elevated intraocular pressure and cataract. Vitrectomy with the removal of the posterior hyaloid without internal limiting membrane peeling seems to be effective in eyes with persistent diffuse diabetic macular edema, particularly in eyes with associated vitreomacular traction.

However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains uncertain. Accordingly, {{this study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that periadventitial adipose tissue releases agents that attenuate coronary endothelial nitric oxide production via a protein kinase C (PKC) -β-dependent mechanism. Isometric tension studies were conducted on isolated canine circumflex coronary arteries with and without natural amounts of periadventitial adipose tissue. Adipose tissue significantly diminished coronary endothelial-dependent vasodilation and nitric oxide production in response to bradykinin and acetylcholine. The selective inhibition of endothelial PKC-β with <b>ruboxistaurin</b> (1 μM) abolished the adipose-induced impairment of bradykinin-mediated coronary vasodilation and the endothelial production of nitric oxide. Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in eNOS phosphorylation at the inhibitory residue Thr 495 in arteries exposed to periadventitial adipose tissue.

40|$|A {{polymorphic}} {{variant of}} the phosphatase PTPN 22 {{has been associated with}} increased risk for multiple autoimmune diseases. The risk allele is thought to function by diminishing antigen-receptor signals responsible for negative selection of autoreactive lymphocytes. We now show that PTPN 22 is markedly overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a common malignancy of autoreactive B lymphocytes. We also show that overexpression of PTPN 22 significantly inhibits antigen-induced apoptosis of primary CLL cells by blocking B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways that negatively regulate lymphocyte survival. More importantly, we show that PTPN 22 positively regulates the antiapoptotic AKT kinase, which provides a powerful survival signal to antigen-stimulated CLL cells. This selective uncoupling of AKT from other downstream BCR signaling pathways is a result of inhibition of a negative regulatory circuit involving LYN, CD 22, and SHIP. Finally, we show that PTPN 22 can be effectively down-regulated by the PKC inhibitors <b>ruboxistaurin</b> and sotrastaurin, resulting in enhanced killing of CLL cells exposed to proapoptotic BCR stimuli. Collectively, these data suggest that PTPN 22 overexpression represents a protective mechanism that allows autoantigen-activated CLL cells to escape from negative selection and indicate that this mechanism could be exploited for therapeutic purposes by targeting PTPN 22 with PKC inhibitors...|$|E

Diacylglycerol (DAG) concentration and PKC activity were increased in the aorta of Zucker fatty compared with Zucker lean rats. Insulin-stimulated increases in Akt phosphorylation and cGMP concentration (a measure of NO bioavailability) after euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp were blunted in the aorta of fatty compared with lean rats but were partly normalized after 2 weeks of treatment with the PKC inhibitor <b>ruboxistaurin</b> (LY 333531).

Although clozapine is associated with a low likelihood of extrapyramidal symptoms and other neurological side effects, it is well known for the weight gain and metabolic side effects, which expose the patient to a greater risk of cardiovascular disorders and premature death, as well as psychosocial issues, leading to non-adherence to therapy. The mechanisms underlying these iatrogenic metabolic disorders are still controversial. We have therefore investigated the in vivo effects of the selective PKCβ inhibitor, <b>ruboxistaurin</b> (LY- 333531), in a preclinical model of long-term clozapine-induced weight gain. Cell biology, biochemistry, and behavioral tests have been performed in wild-type and PKCβ knockout mice to investigate the contribution of endogenous PKCβ and its pharmacological inhibition to the psychomotor effects of clozapine. Finally, we also shed light on a novel aspect of the mechanism underlying the clozapine-induced weight gain, demonstrating that the clozapine-dependent PKCβ activation promotes the inhibition of the lipid droplet-selective autophagy process. This paves the way to new therapeutic approaches to this serious complication of clozapine therap...|$|E
40|$|Diabetic {{neuropathy}} (DN) is {{a widespread}} disabling disorder comprising peripheral nerves' damage. DN develops on a background of hyperglycemia and an entangled metabolic imbalance, mainly oxidative stress. The majority of related pathways like polyol, advanced glycation end products, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, hexosamine, and protein kinase c all originated from initial oxidative stress. To date, no absolute cure for DN has been defined; although some drugs are conventionally used, much more can be found if all pathophysiological links with oxidative stress would be taken into account. In this paper, although current therapies for DN have been reviewed, we have mainly focused on the links between DN and oxidative stress and therapies on the horizon, such as inhibitors of protein kinase C, aldose reductase, and advanced glycation. With reference to oxidative stress and the related pathways, the following new drugs are under study such as taurine, acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha lipoic acid, protein kinase C inhibitor (<b>ruboxistaurin),</b> aldose reductase inhibitors (fidarestat, epalrestat, ranirestat), advanced glycation end product inhibitors (benfotiamine, aspirin, aminoguanidine), the hexosamine pathway inhibitor (benfotiamine), inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (nicotinamide), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril). The development of modern drugs to treat DN is a real challenge and needs intensive long-term comparative trials...|$|E
40|$|Kidney glomeruli are {{important}} targets of diabetic nephropathy. We hypothesized a {{high concentration of}} glucose could suppress glomerular eNOS by a protein kinase C mechanism, as has been found in other tissues. Mouse kidney slices (150 - 200 µm) were bathed in Hank's solution with 100 µM L-arginine and exposed to either 5 mM or 20 - 30 mM D-glucose. Immunofluorescence identified only eNOS in normal mouse glomeruli. Measurements of glomerular NO concentration with NO-sensitive fluorescent dye (DAF 2 -DA) using confocal microscopy and NO-sensitive microelectrodes verified that resting glomeruli had active production of NO that was inhibited by L-NAME. High concentration (20 mM – 30 mM) D-glucose inhibited 60 %- 70 % of the NO production within 15 - 30 minutes; L-glucose at same concentration did not have any effect. Inhibition of PKC-β with 100 nM <b>ruboxistaurin</b> prevented eNOS suppression in high glucose media. Activation of protein kinase C with 100 nM phorbol ester also suppressed the glomerular NO concentration. We concluded that eNOS in the renal glomerular capillary endothelial cells is suppressed by activity of PKC at high glucose concentrations comparable to those in diabetic animals and humans. The consequence is a rapid decline in the generation of NO in the glomerular endothelial cells in the presence of {{a high concentration of}} glucose...|$|E
40|$|The International Diabetes Federation {{estimates}} that 316 {{million people are}} currently affected by impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Most importantly, recent forecasts anticipate a dramatic IGT increase with more that 470 million people affected by the year 2035. Impaired insulin sensitivity is major feature of obesity and diabetes and is strongly linked with adverse cardiometabolic phenotypes. However, the etiologic pathway linking impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular disease remains to be deciphered. Although insulin resistance {{has been attributed to}} inflammatory programs starting in adipose tissue, emerging evidence indicates that endothelial dysfunction may represent the upstream event preceding peripheral impairment of insulin sensitivity. Indeed, suppression of reactive oxygen species-dependent pathways in the endothelium has shown to restore insulin delivery to peripheral organs by preserving nitric oxide (NO) availability. Here we describe emerging theories concerning endothelial insulin resistance, with particular emphasis on the role oxidative stress. Complex molecular circuits including endothelial nitric oxide synthase, prostacyclin synthase, mitochondrial adaptor p 66 (Shc), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase oxidase and nuclear factor kappa-B are discussed. Moreover, the review provides insights on the effectiveness of available compounds (i. e., <b>ruboxistaurin,</b> sildenafil, endothelin receptor antagonists, NO donors) in restoring endothelial insulin signalling. Taken together, these aspects may significantly contribute to design novel therapeutic approaches to restore glucose homeostasis in patients with obesity and diabetes...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the change in neuropathy symp-toms and disease progression in placebo-administered patients from two 1 -year studies in which the impact of <b>ruboxistaurin</b> (RBX) in mild diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was tested. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Data from 262 placebo-administered pa-tients from two identical phase 3, randomized, double-blind trials were combined and analyzed. RESULTS — After 1 year, change in the neuropathy impairment score of lower limbs [NIS(LL) ] (0. 63 points; P 0. 005), vibration detection threshold (VDT) (0. 42 just notice-able difference units; P 0. 003), and Neuropathy Total Symptom Score- 6 (NTSS- 6) question-naire (3. 73 points; P 0. 001) improved, whereas some electrophysiology measures and heart rate deep breathing (HRDB) (0. 78 beats; P 0. 003) worsened compared with baseline values. There was a small but significant worsening of A 1 C (0. 28 %; P 0. 001), and a greater percentage of patients were using analgesics at the end of the trials (33. 6 %; P 0. 003). At 1 year, the change in NTSS- 6 directly correlated with changes in NIS(LL) and VDT and inversely correlated with the peroneal nerve conduction velocity. On logistic regression analyses, a 50 % reduction in NTSS- 6 score was less likely in patients who used antihypertensive or chronic symptom medi...|$|E
40|$|Diabetic {{nephropathy}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Current renoprotective treatment for diabetic nephropathy includes strict glycemic and optimal blood pressure control, proteinuria/albuminuria reduction and the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blocking agents. However, the renoprotection provided by these treatments is only partial, and many patients still have progressive disease, thus suggesting that a more effective approach is urgently needed. This review examines emerging strategies for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, including aggressive RAAS blockade, statins, pentoxifylline, glitazones, <b>ruboxistaurin,</b> as well as sulodexide. Pilot studies that used surrogate end points, mainly albuminuria, will be discussed. New insights suggest that treating microalbuminuric diabetic patients with statins, pentoxifylline, glitazones and sulodexide could be a new approach for reducing the incidence of clinical proteinuria. In diabetic patients with overt nephropathy, the administration of statins, pentoxifylline, sulodexide or aggressive RAAS inhibition, including RAAS dual blockade (i. e., angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors plus angiotensin receptor blockers or aldosterone antagonists plus ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers), seems to be a promising way to preserve renal function and to prevent progression to ESRD. Results of ongoing, long-term trials on major renal and cardiovascular clinical outcomes, as well as on mortality are needed to establish whether the current standard of care of diabetic nephropathy might be improved with these new strategie...|$|E
