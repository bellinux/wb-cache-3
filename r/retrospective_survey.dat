40|$|Several {{recent studies}} in labour and {{population}} economics use <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys</b> {{to substitute for}} the high cost and limited availability of longitudinal survey data. Although a single interview can obtain a lifetime history, inaccurate long-term recall could make such <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys</b> a poor substitute for longitudinal surveys, especially if it induces non-classical error that makes conventional statistical corrections less effective. In this paper, we use the unique Panel Study of Income Dynamics Validation Study to assess the accuracy of long-term recall data. We find underreporting of transitory events. This recall error creates a non-classical measurement error problem. A limited cost-benefit analysis is also conducted, showing how savings from using a cheaper <b>retrospective</b> recall <b>survey</b> might {{be compared with the}} cost of applying the less accurate recall data to a specific policy objective such as designing transfers to reduce chronic poverty. longitudinal data; measurement error; <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys...</b>|$|R

40|$|This book chapter reviews 14 <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys</b> inquiring into respondent’s {{child abuse}} {{experiences}} {{and whether they}} ever disclosed abuse as children. I discuss the advantages of <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys</b> (representativeness, reduced likelihood of false allegations, reduced suspicion bias). However, I also emphasize the likelihood of survey reluctance, and explain how this biases upwards estimates of abuse victims’ prior disclosure. If respondents who previously disclosed abuse {{are more likely to}} acknowledge abuse to a surveyor than respondents who never previously disclosed abuse, respondents who acknowledge abuse are disproportionately likely to be those who have previously disclosed. Difficulties notwithstanding, the research supports the proposition that most sexual abuse is not disclosed during childhood, and that, indeed, disclosure is difficult even for older respondents, particularly so in cases of intrafamilial abuse...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Mortality data provide {{essential}} {{evidence on}} the health status of populations in crisis-affected and resource-poor settings and to guide and assess relief operations. <b>Retrospective</b> <b>surveys</b> are commonly used to collect mortality data in such populations, but require substantial resources and have important methodological limitations. We evaluated the feasibility of an alternative method for rapidly quantifying mortality (the informant method). The study objective {{was to assess the}} economic feasibility of the informant method. METHODS: The informant method captures deaths through an exhaustive search for all deaths occurring in a population over a defined and recent recall period, using key community informants and next-of-kin of decedents. Between July and October 2008, we implemented and evaluated the informant method in: Kabul, Afghanistan; Mae La camp for Karen refugees, Thai-Burma border; Chiradzulu District, Malawi; and Lugufu and Mtabila refugee camps, Tanzania. We documented the time and cost inputs for the informant method in each site, and compared these with projections for hypothetical <b>retrospective</b> mortality <b>surveys</b> implemented in the same site with a 6 month recall period and with a 30 day recall period. FINDINGS: The informant method was estimated to require an average of 29 % less time inputs and 33 % less monetary inputs across all four study sites when compared with <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys</b> with a 6 month recall period, and 88 % less time inputs and 86 % less monetary inputs when compared with <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys</b> with a 1 month recall period. Verbal autopsy questionnaires were feasible and efficient, constituting only 4 % of total person-time for the informant method's implementation in Chiradzulu District. CONCLUSIONS: The informant method requires fewer resources and incurs less respondent burden. The method's generally impressive feasibility and the near real-time mortality data it provides warrant further work to develop the method given the importance of mortality measurement in such settings...|$|R

If a researcher wants to extract medical information today, {{it has to be}} done manually because the data are stored in unstructured textual format in a system created by hospital staff.

This paper is going to introduce an information extraction application for EPR system that allows the researcher to set up a study with inclusion and parameters for extraction for <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys</b> in a webuser-interface environment.

40|$|In <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys,</b> {{records on}} {{important}} {{variables such as}} the respondent's educational level and social class refer to what is achieved by {{the date of the}} survey. Such variables are then used as covariates in investigations of behavior such as marriage and divorce in life segments that have occurred before the survey. To what extent can any change in the behavior be attributed to the misclassification of respondents across the various levels of the anticipatory variable? To what extent do they reflect real differences in the behavior across the levels? The connection is obtained by a Bayesian adjustment, by specifying a continuous-time Markov model for the incompletely observed time-varying anticipatory covariates, and by implementing standard Bayesian data augmentation techniques. The issues are illustrated by estimating effects of educational level on risks of divorce in a multiplicative piecewise-constant hazard model. Results show that ignoring the time-inconsistency of anticipatory variables may seriously plague the analyses because the relative risks across the anticipatory educational level are overestimated. anticipatory analysis, Bayesian analysis, divorce, education, event-history analysis, MCMC, <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys,...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{information}} about the lifetime prevalence of mental disorders comes from <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys,</b> but how much these surveys have undercounted due to recall failure is unknown. We compared results from a prospective study with those from retrospective studies. METHOD: The representative 1972 - 1973 Dunedin New Zealand birth cohort (n= 1037) was followed to age 32 years with 96 % retention, and compared to the national New Zealand Mental Health Survey (NZMHS) and two US National Comorbidity Surveys (NCS and NCS-R). Measures were research diagnoses of anxiety, depression, alcohol dependence and cannabis dependence from ages 18 to 32 years. RESULTS: The prevalence of lifetime disorder to age 32 was approximately doubled in prospective as compared to retrospective data for all four disorder types. Moreover, across disorders, prospective measurement yielded a mean past-year-to-lifetime ratio of 38 % whereas retrospective measurement yielded higher mean past-year-to-lifetime ratios of 57 % (NZMHS, NCS-R) and 65 % (NCS). CONCLUSIONS: Prospective longitudinal studies complement <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys</b> by providing unique {{information about}} lifetime prevalence. The experience {{of at least one}} episode of DSM-defined disorder during a lifetime may be far more common in the population than previously thought. Research should ask what this means for etiological theory, construct validity of the DSM approach, public perception of stigma, estimates of the burden of disease and public health policy...|$|R

30|$|On a {{research}} note, {{often in the}} literature, the matching process in <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveys</b> is rather inadequate since the compared groups are not morphologically similar [8, 15, 21, 22]. The improper matching of the groups inevitably introduces susceptibility bias, which {{is defined as the}} difference in prognostic expectations due to pre-existing differences between and/or among treatment groups. When contemplating between different-mutually exclusive-treatment approaches or techniques, a clinician takes into careful consideration the patient’s morphological features. These features usually include cephalometric and model measurements along with other parameters like patient’s age and sex. In statistics, such patient’s features that lead a clinician to a specific treatment decision are called confounding variables.|$|R
