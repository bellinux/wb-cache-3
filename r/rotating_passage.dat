40|$|The {{objectives}} of the HOST Turbine Heat Transfer subproject were to obtain {{a better understanding of}} the physics of the aerothermodynamic phenomena occurring in high-performance gas turbine engines and to assess and improve the analytical methods used to predict the fluid dynamics and heat transfer phenomena. At the time the HOST project was initiated, an across-the-board improvement in turbine design technology was needed. Therefore, a building-block approach was utilized, with research ranging from the study of fundamental phenomena and analytical modeling to experiments in simulated real-engine environments. Experimental research accounted for 75 percent of the project, and analytical efforts accounted for approximately 25 percent. Extensive experimental datasets were created depicting the three-dimensional flow field, high free-stream turbulence, boundary-layer transition, blade tip region heat transfer, film cooling effects in a simulated engine environment, rough-wall cooling enhancement in a <b>rotating</b> <b>passage,</b> and rotor-stator interaction effects.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} thermal fluid-flow {{transport}} phenomena in an axially <b>rotating</b> <b>passage</b> in which twin concentric orifices of different radii are installed. Emphasis {{is placed on}} the effects of pipe rotation and orifice configuration on the flow and thermal fields, i. e. both the formation of vena contracta and the heat-transfer performance behind each orifice. The governing equations are discretized by means of a finite-difference technique and numerically solved for the distributions of velocity vector and fluid temperature subject to constant wall temperature and uniform inlet velocity and fluid temperature. It is found that: (i) for a laminar flow through twin concentric orifices in a pipe, axial pipe rotation causes the vena contracta in the orifice to stretch, resulting in an amplification of heat-transfer performance in the downstream region behind the rear orifice, (ii) simultaneously the heat transfer rate in the area between twin orifice is intensified by pipe rotation, (iii) the amplification of heat transfer performance is affected by the front and rear orifice heights. Results may find applications in automotive and rotating hydraulic transmission lines and in aircraft gas turbine engines. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of model orientation as well as buoyancy and Coriolis forces on heat transfer in turbine blade internal coolant passages. Turbine blades have internal coolant passage surfaces at the leading and trailing edges of the airfoil with surfaces at angles which are as large as +/- 50 to 60 degrees to the axis of rotation. Most of the previously-presented, multiple-passage, rotating heat transfer experiments have focused on radial passages aligned with the axis of rotation. Results from serpentine passages with orientations 0 and 45 degrees to the axis of rotation which simulate the coolant passages for the mid chord and trailing edge regions of the rotating airfoil are compared. The experiments {{were conducted}} with rotation in both directions to simulate serpentine coolant passages with the rearward flow of coolant or with the forward flow of coolant. The experiments were conducted for passages with smooth surfaces and with 45 degree trips adjacent to airfoil surfaces for the radial portion of the serpentine passages. At a typical flow condition, the heat transfer on the leading surfaces for flow outward in the first passage with smooth walls was twice as much for the model at 45 degrees compared to the model at 0 degrees. However, the differences for the other passages and with trips were less. In addition, the effects of buoyancy and Coriolis forces on heat transfer in the <b>rotating</b> <b>passage</b> were decreased with the model at 45 degrees, compared to the results at 0 degrees. The heat transfer in the turn regions and immediately downstream of the turns in the second passage with flow inward and in the third passage with flow outward was also a function of model orientation with differences as large as 40 to 50 percent occurring between the model orientations with forward flow and rearward flow of coolant...|$|E

Both time-dependent and time-averaged cooling effectiveness distributions on the rotor {{under the influence of}} shock waves and unsteady wake flows are presented with blowing ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5. The results show that (a) the unsteady wake passing caused by the blade rotation significantly influences the time-dependent pressure coefficients, especially in the forward region downstream of the stagnation point on both the suction and pressure sides on the rotor. This effect can be evidenced by the "wrapping behavior " of a strong vorticity field wrapping around the blade leading edge after the wake hit the blade (b) On the suction side, over the crown area of the rotor, the wake-induced pressure fluctuations are augmented by the weak shock wave emanating from the stator's trailing edge, appearing as a primary peak followed by a secondary peak. The weak oblique shock wave can be evidenced by the dense Mach contour curves. The effect of the wake (rotational) is distinguished from that of the shock (inviscid and non-rotational) by comparing the pressure gradient field with the vorticity field. (c) Similar effects of passing wakes and shock waves on the surface pressure on a rotor are observed on the film cooling effectiveness, except that these effects are of the same magnitude. (d) The effect of the blowing ratio on the static pressure distribution at the rotor wall is not significant, whereas its effect on the film cooling effectiveness is more pronounced...|$|E

A detailed analysis in a meridional plane is given, assuming axial symmetry. A simplified approach to the blade to blade solution is also presented. The merits of these theories are compared with other proposed methods. The inverse, or design, approach is considered, and found to be unnecessary. A numerical solution for incompressible flow is derived and applied to the flow solution in the impeller of a mixed flow compressor with backwards-bent blades of arbitrary shape.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new Navier-Stokes solver for complex {{three-dimensional}} geometries, adopting arbitrary modelling of the Reynolds stresses, is presented. Ak-s model, adopting a modelling of the turbulent transport {{not based on}} the eddy viscosity, has been written in generalised coordinates and solved with a finite volume approach, using both a GMRES solver and a direct solver for {{the solution of the}} linear systems of equations. The results presented show that the modification adopted for the modelling of'the turbulent transport also provides a more accurate value of the physical diffusion and, as a consequence, improves the increase in accuracy when using higher-order convection schemes. A simple non-linear modelling of the Reynolds stresses has been designed introducing an additional term, quadratic in the main strain rate, to the basic Boussinesq's form; the corresponding constant has been evaluated through comparison with experimental data. The computational procedure is implemented for the flow analysis in a 90 ° square section bend and the obtained results show that with the non- linear modelling a much better agreement with the measured data is obtained, both for the velocity and the pressure. The importance of the convection scheme is also discussed, showing how the effect of the non-linear correction added to the Reynolds stresses is effectively hidden by the additional numerical diffusion introduced by a low- order convection scheme as the first-order Upwind, thus making necessary the use of higher-order schemes.

50|$|Cone valves or {{ball valves}} are another alternative. These are {{commonly}} found as the service shut-off valves in more-expensive water systems and usually found in gas taps (and, incidentally, the cask beer taps referred to above). They {{can be identified}} by their range of motion—only 90°—between fully open and closed.

A cone valve consists of a shallowly tapering cone in a tight-fitting socket placed across the flow of the fluid. In UK English this is usually known as a taper-plug cock. A ball valve uses a spherical ball instead. In either case, a hole through the cone or ball allows the fluid to pass if it is lined up with the openings in the socket through which the fluid enters and leaves; turning the cone using the handle <b>rotates</b> the <b>passage</b> away, presenting the fluid with the unbroken surface of the cone through which it cannot pass.

40|$|The aero-engine {{industry}} and the power generation industry operate in a highly competitive market. Therefore high requirements in terms of high technology development as well as cost and development times reduction are constant major objectives. On the other hand, environmental and safety constraints are an increasingly stringent necessity, which enforces the demand for new technologies. Currently the industry relies on expensive and time consuming rig test programs, whereas the existing numerical design tools {{have a number of}} deficiencies in accurately describing the complex multi-pass coolant channel flow. Under these conditions the Institute of Propulsion Technology is involved in national and European research programs aimed to providing the industry with high quality experimental data from the flow field for CFD validation. In past projects the flow behaviour in <b>rotating</b> <b>passages</b> was analysed at DLR using wall pressure measurements to obtain the pressure drop. In addition, Laser- 2 -Focus velocimetry (L 2 F) was used to obtain flow velocity components and fluctuations. Although time-consuming, this non-intrusive, single-point measurement technique worked very well within straight and smooth duct flows, which generally have a moderate degree of turbulence. However, state of the art, serpentine shaped, multi-pass systems are equipped with ribbed walls, in order to improve heat exchange which is typical in realistic configurations. In this case L 2 F velocimetry was not able to measure accurate flow properties due to the increased turbulence intensities {{in the vicinity of the}} ribs as in the bend region and further downstream. The dividing wall separating the two passages forces the flow into a sharp turn which generally results in a flow separation. The flow within the separation bubble itself is very unsteady. Modern planar measurement techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) are capable of obtaining complete maps of flows even at high turbulence. As a first step toward applying this technique, a multi-pass cooling system is investigated in stationary (e. g. non-rotating) mode using two-component PIV. The new results are compared with results from L 2 F, pressure, wall flow visualisation and CFD. The high quality of the obtained new results encourage the application of two-component PIV to the rotating system. As a logical consequence, the application of three-component PIV will be necessary to obtain the complete flow field information within the complex flow passages. The comparison of the axial velocity component near to the wall and mid-span between L 2 F and PIV measurement in the second pass at the position z = 193 mm is presented in Figure A.

The flow field within the impeller passages for the shrouded case was notably more uniform than for the unshrouded case. In addition, the turbulence kinetic energy within the passages was substantially lower. The efficiency of the shrouded pump was, however, lower than the unshrouded version. This was attributed primarily to losses due to leakage in the clearance region between the impeller shroud and the pump casing; a rather large passage was necessary to permit optical access.

It is found that the flow inside the <b>rotating</b> impeller <b>passages</b> is well described by the flow distribution postulated by potential-flow arguments and boundary-layer considerations. Using a custom-designed two-component laser-Doppler-velocimetry flow measurement system, mounted on a frame co-rotating with an impeller, the radial and circumferential velocity components of the relative flow inside an impeller passage were measured. Measurements were taken from blade to blade, and from this the passagewise fluid velocity was determined. The measured passagewise fluid velocity is compared to the potential-flow solution of the impeller passage-flow velocity that holds asymptotically in a region {{well away from the}} blade tips. Additional potential-flow finite-element calculations are used for comparison for those regions where the asymptotic expansion does not hold. The agreement between the experimental and theoretical values is seen to be good for the core flow region, which extends from the blade pressure side to the viscous boundary layer at the blade suction side. Furthermore, the calculation of the boundary-layer development along the suction side of the impeller blades is highlighted. Contrary to the blade pressure side, only there a significant departure from inviscid flow behaviour is observed.

His room is under the stairs, in a secret passage behind a bench, where he must push a set of toy soldiers to <b>rotate</b> the <b>passage.</b> Nino's room has many toys and the wallpaper is full of comic pages. Nino's parents don't appear in the program because they are traveling. In 1990 they set off to travel in space for 10 years. In 1994, when the show aired, they had been traveling for four years and finally came back in 2000.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{results are}} {{presented}} for flow in a <b>rotating</b> internal <b>passage</b> with a 180 degree turn and ribbed walls. Reynolds numbers ranging from 5200 to 7900, and Rotation numbers of 0. 0 and 0. 24 were considered. The straight sections of the channel have a square cross section, with square ribs spaced one hydraulic diameter (D) apart on two opposite sides. The ribs have a height of 0. 1 D and are not staggered {{from one side to}} the other. The full three dimensional Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved combined with the Wilcox k-omega turbulence model. By solving an additional equation for mass transfer, it is possible to isolate the effect of buoyancy in the presence of rotation. That is, heat transfer induced buoyancy effects can be eliminated as in naphthalene sublimation experiments. Heat transfer, mass transfer and flow field {{results are presented}} with favorable agreement with available experimental data. It is shown that numerically predicting the reattachment between ribs is essential to achieving an accurate prediction of heat/mass transfer. For the low Reynolds numbers considered, the standard turbulence model did not produce reattachment between ribs. By modifying the wall boundary condition on omega, the turbulent specific dissipation rate, much better agreement with the flow structure and heat/ mass transfer was achieved. It is beyond the scope of the present work to make a general recommendation on the omega wall boundary condition. However, the present results suggest that the omega boundary condition should take into account the proximity to abrupt changes in geometry...|$|R
40|$|For the {{efficient}} design of transonic turbomachinery systems, {{understanding of the}} complex flow phenomena inherent in the flow passages is essential. In the present study, a computational technique is adopted to meet this formidable goal. A code using a time-marching technique has been developed first for quasi three-dimensional cascades (that is two-dimensional computation with the varying streamtube height in the third dimension taken into consideration) and then extended to fully three-dimensional flows within the <b>rotating</b> flow <b>passages.</b> Each code has a built-in switch for in viscid and viscous flows. The basis of the codes is the conservative form of the Reynolds- averaged Navier-Stokes equations in a rotating framework. This is supplemented by either the Baldwin-Lomax (algebraic) or the k-e (two-equation) turbulence model. For solving the hyperbolic type governing equations, spatial derivatives are first discretized on the easily-constructed H-type grid system using a central-difference finite-volume approximation with the flow variables stored at the cell centre. An explicit multistage Runge-Kutta scheme is then employed for the time integration o f the resulting ordinary differential equations. The accuracy of the quasi three-dimensional code is initially evaluated by predicting the flows through cascades with simple geometry. Its robustness is then confirmed by two realistic configurations {{with a wide range}} o f operating conditions. Finally the fully three-dimensional code is applied to two highly loaded transonic rotors with complicated geometry at peak efficiency and near stall operating conditions. An extensive comparison in terms of detailed flowfield and overall performance between the predictions and experiments with laser anemometry and conventional probes shows the accuracy o f the codes and also indicates that the present study has great potential to be a viable aerodynamic design and analysis tool in the development of transonic turbomachinery systems...|$|R
