One type of analysis determines whether the [...] "polluter pays" [...] principle holds, i.e. whether those who pollute are also the ones who pay for <b>remediation</b> <b>and</b> <b>clean-up.</b> It {{can also be used to}} analyse the effects on enterprise competitiveness, for cost-effective analysis related to propositions of new regulations and policies.|$|R
40|$|This {{white paper}} has been {{prepared}} to document the approach to develop strategies to address Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) science and technology needs/uncertainties to support completion of INEEL Idaho Completion Project (Environmental Management [EM]) projects against the 2012 plan. Important Idaho Completion Project <b>remediation</b> <b>and</b> <b>clean-up</b> projects include the 2008 OU 10 - 08 Record of Decision, completion of EM by 2012, Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center Tanks, INEEL CERCLA Disposal Facility, and the Radioactive Waste Management Complex. The objective of this effort was to develop prioritized operational needs and uncertainties that would assist Operations in <b>remediation</b> <b>and</b> <b>clean-up</b> efforts at the INEEL and develop a proposed path forward {{for the development of}} science strategies to address these prioritized needs. Fifteen needs/uncertainties were selected to develop an initial approach to science strategies. For each of the 15 needs/uncertainties, a detailed definition was developed. This included extracting information from the past interviews with Operations personnel to provide {{a detailed description of the}} need/uncertainty. For each of the 15 prioritized research and development needs, a search was performed to identify the state of the associated knowledge. The knowledge search was performed primarily evaluating ongoing research. The ongoing research reviewed included Environmental Systems Research Analysis, Environmental Management Science Program, Laboratory Directed Research and Development, Inland Northwest Research Alliance, United States Geological Survey, and ongoing Operations supported projects. Results of the knowledge search are documented as part of this document...|$|R

40|$|The South Tank Farm (STF) is {{a series}} of six, 170, 000 -gal underground, domed storage tanks that were placed into service in 1943. The tanks were {{constructed}} of a concrete mixture known as gunite. They were used as a portion of the liquid low-level waste (LLLW) system for the collection, neutralization, storage, and transfer of the aqueous portion of the radioactive and/or hazardous chemical wastes produced as part of normal facility operations at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Although the last of the tanks was taken out of service in 1986, they have been shown by structural analysis to continue to be structurally sound. An attempt was made in 1983 to empty the tanks; however, removal of all the sludge from the tanks was not possible with the equipment and schedule available. Since removal of the liquid waste in 1983, liquid continues to accumulate within the tanks. The in-leakage {{is believed to be the}} result of groundwater dripping into the tanks around penetrations in the domes. The tanks are currently being maintained under a Surveillance and Maintenance Program, which includes activities such as level monitoring, vegetation control, High Efficiency Particulate Air filter leakage requirement testing/replacement, sign erection/repair, pump-out of excessive liquids, and instrument calibration/maintenance. These tanks are to undergo <b>remediation</b> <b>and</b> <b>clean-up</b> using sludge removal techniques and equipment planned for use in other waste storage tanks throughout the US DOE complex. The technical safety requirements are those operational requirements that specify the operating limits and surveillance requirements, the basis thereof, safety boundaries, and the management or administrative controls necessary to ensure the safe operation of the STF remediation project...|$|R

She was reelected in 1978. She faced a major crisis in 1978 when [...] "The Blizzard of 78" [...] dropped 30 inches of snow across the state, crippling highways and making virtually all roads impassible. She [...] "Closed the State" [...] by proclamation, and forbade all use of public roads by businesses and citizens, closing all businesses. Effectively residents were restricted to their homes.
