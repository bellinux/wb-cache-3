At last, the inhabitants of [...] "Level 7" [...] are wiped out after a malfunction in their nuclear power pile results in lethal contamination of their erstwhile sanctuary. They are apparently the last human beings on Earth to perish, and X-127 is the very last one at the story's conclusion.

Growth of research facilities, projects in progress, and more stringent Department of Energy (DOE) orders which involve exposure to nuclear radiation have placed substantial burdens on the existing radiation calibration facility. The facility currently {{does not meet the}} requirements of DOE Order 5480. 4 or American National Standards Institute (ANSI) N 323 - 1978, which establish calibration methods for portable radiation protection instruments used in the detection and measurement of levels of ionizing radiation fields or levels of <b>radioactive</b> <b>surface</b> <b>contaminations.</b> Failure to comply with this standard could mean instrumentation is not being calibrated to necessary levels of sensitivity. The Laboratory has also recently obtained a new neutron source and gamma beam irradiator which can not be made operational at existing facilities because of geometry and shielding inadequacies. These sources are needed to perform routine periodic calibrations of radiation detecting instruments used by scientific and technical personnel and to meet BNL`s substantial increase in demand for radiation monitoring capabilities. To place these new sources into operation, it is proposed to construct an addition to the existing radiation calibration facility that would house all calibration sources and bring BNL calibration activities into compliance with DOE and ANSI standards. The purpose of this assessment is to identify potential significant environmental impacts associated with the construction and operation of an improved radiation calibration facility at BNL...|$|R

50|$|Large area {{scintillation}} counters {{used for}} <b>surface</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination</b> measurements use plate or planar radioactive sources as calibration standards. The Surface Emission Rate (SER), not the source activity, {{is used as}} a measure of the rate of particles emitted from the source of radiation. The SER is the true emission rate from the surface, which is usually different to the activity. This difference is due to self-shielding within the active layer of the source which will reduce the SER, or backscatter which will reflect particles off the backing plate of the active layer and will increase the SER. Beta particle plate sources usually have a significant backscatter, whereas alpha plate sources usually have no backscatter, but are easily self-attenuated if the active layer is made too thick.|$|R

The removal of <b>radioactive</b> <b>surface</b> <b>contamination</b> was performed {{in order to reduce}} potential impacts to human health and the environment. The predominant radiological contaminant of concern was depleted uranium (DU). Between October 1993 and November 1996 scanning surface radiation surveys, using gamma scintillometers, were conducted at 65 sites covering approximately 908 acres. A total of 9, 518 radiation anomalies were detected at 38 sites. Cleanup activities were conducted between October 1994 and November 1996. A total of 9, 122 anomalies were removed and 2, 072 waste drums were generated. The majority of anomalies not removed were associated with a site that has subsurface contamination {{beyond the scope of this}} project. Verification soil samples (1, 008 total samples) were collected from anomalies during cleanup activities and confirm that the soil concentration achieved in the field were far below the target cleanup level of 230 pCi/g of U- 238 (the primary constituent of DU) in the soil.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of applying and adapting a two-dimensional laser heated thermoluminescence dosimetry {{system to the}} problem of surveying for <b>radioactive</b> <b>surface</b> <b>contamination</b> was studied. The system consists of a CO{sub 2 } laser-based reader and monolithic arrays of thin dosimeter elements. The arrays consist of 10, 201 thermoluminescent phosphor elements of 40 micron thickness, covering a 900 cm{sup 2 } area. Array substrates are 125 micron thick polyimide sheets, enabling them to easily conform to regular surface shapes, especially for survey of surfaces that are inaccessible for standard survey instruments. The passive, integrating radiation detectors are sensitive to alpha and beta radiation at contamination levels below release guideline limits. Required contact times with potentially contaminated surfaces are under one hour to achieve detection of transuranic alpha emission at 100 dpm/ 100 cm{sup 2 }. Positional information obtained from array evaluation is useful for locating contamination zones. Unique capabilities of this system for survey of sites, facilities and material include measurement inside pipes and other geometrical configurations that prevent standard surveys, and below-surface measurement of alpha and beta emitters in contaminated soils. These applications imply a reduction of material that must be classified as radioactive waste by virtue of its possibility of contamination, and cost savings in soil sampling at contaminated sites...|$|E
40|$|The US Department of Energy (DOE) is in {{the process}} of {{defining}} the nature and magnitude of decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) obligations at its sites. With disposal costs rising and available storage facilities decreasing, DOE is exploring and implementing new waste minimizing D and D techniques. Technology demonstrations are being conducted by LMES at a DOE gaseous diffusion processing plant, the K- 25 Site, in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The gaseous diffusion process employed at Oak Ridge separated uranium- 235 from uranium ore for use in atomic weapons and commercial reactors. These activities contaminated concrete and other surfaces within the plant with uranium, technetium, and other constituents. The objective of current K- 25 D and D research is to make available cost-effective and energy-efficient techniques to advance remediation and waste management methods at the K- 25 Site and other DOE sites. To support this objective, O`Brien and Gere tested a decontamination system on K- 25 Site concrete and steel surfaces contaminated with radioactive and hazardous waste. A scouring system has been developed that removes fixed hazardous and <b>radioactive</b> <b>surface</b> <b>contamination</b> and minimizes residual waste. This system utilizes an abrasive sodium bicarbonate medium that is projected at contaminated surfaces. It mechanically removes surface contamination while leaving the surface intact.

The chapter containing results and collected data includes a definition of the measured parameter and it stresses the <b>surface</b> <b>contamination</b> as a major health risk factor, which is demonstrated by conversion of <b>surface</b> <b>contamination</b> values into absorbed doses in the exposed body organs.

To prove {{the safety of}} recycling and reuse of crane scrap, a particular calculation method for <b>surface</b> <b>contamination</b> was used. Because <b>surface</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination</b> of steel {{is limited to a}} few-microns-thick layer, we can calculate the total(removable and fixed contamination) activity of the sample conservatively by this surface removal sampling means. If we multiply the ratio of total surface and the area of the selected surface by its activity, total activity of the scrap can be estimated. Conservatively, the sampled portion {{can be used as a}} representative sample of the scrap. Both the inner and outer part of the scrap was sampled separately, and gamma spectra were analyzed to check whether activation had occurred. Before sampling, the entire surface of the steel is scan surveyed by several kinds of GM and GP detectors. Contaminated parts were segregated, or decontaminated to the background. Almost one sample per one ton of steel was collected. Gamma spectra of 62 samples were analyzed by 100 % efficiency HP Ge detector. Only 60 Co was detected, and its highest activity was 0. 01 Bq/g,. This level of activity is much lower than the ''clearance levels'' outlined in IAEA TecDoc- 855. (4). The total alpha and total beta for 6 samples were measured in the laboratory by low background alpha, using a beta gas proportional counter. Activities were much lower than 0. 005 Bq/g. A representative sample was taken from the complete mixture of 62 samples. Gamma activities of nuclides were measured to estimate the dose to the public. This study revealed that activities of nuclides were lower than 'clearance levels' if decontaminated until the lower limit of detection level of the portable field instrument.

40|$|Earth-moving {{vehicles}} (e. g., dump trucks, belly dumps) commonly haul radiologically contaminated {{materials from}} a site being remediated to a disposal site. Traditionally, each vehicle must be surveyed before being released. The logistical difficulties of implementing {{the traditional approach}} {{on a large scale}} demand that an alternative be devised. A statistical method for assessing product quality from a continuous process was adapted to the vehicle decontamination process. This method produced a sampling scheme that automatically compensates and accommodates fluctuating batch sizes and changing conditions without the need to modify or rectify the sampling scheme in the field. Vehicles are randomly selected (sampled) upon completion of the decontamination process to be surveyed for residual <b>radioactive</b> <b>surface</b> <b>contamination.</b> The frequency of sampling is based on the expected number of vehicles passing through the decontamination process in a given period and the confidence level desired. This process has been successfully used for 1 year at the former uranium millsite in Monticello, Utah (a cleanup site regulated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act). The method forces improvement in the quality of the decontamination process and results in a lower likelihood that vehicles exceeding the surface contamination standards are offered for survey. Implementation of this statistical sampling method on Monticello projects has resulted in more efficient processing of vehicles through decontamination and radiological release, saved hundreds of hours of processing time, provided a high level of confidence that release limits are met, and improved the radiological cleanliness of vehicles leaving the controlled site...|$|E

We still need to study the following issues from an atmospheric science point of view (Igarashi 2009): (1) primary source terms including emissions inventory and temporal changes (e.g., Chino et al. 2011; Katata et al. 2012, b, 2014; Maki et al. 2013; Stohl et al. 2012; Terada et al. 2012; Winiarek et al. 2012), (2) transport and diffusion (e.g., Masson et al. 2011; Morino et al. 2011; Sekiyama et al. 2015; Stohl et al. 2012; Takemura et al. 2011; Tanaka 2013; Terada et al. 2012), and (3) dry and wet removal (e.g., Adachi et al. 2013; Hirose et al. 1993; Kristiansen et al. 2012), which governed <b>radioactive</b> <b>surface</b> <b>contamination</b> during the early phase of the accident.

In addition, secondary emissions from contaminated surfaces to the atmosphere (re-suspension; Igarashi 2009) have become important during the later phases. Re-suspension comes from contaminated surfaces, terrestrial ecosystems, and open-field burning. These sources have undoubtedly supported atmospheric radionuclides but are not yet well understood and are thus considered briefly. Other information about the accident, related to our immediate monitoring and modeling endeavors and data analysis approaches to short-lived γ-emitters and 89 Sr, is summarized in the Appendices.|$|E
