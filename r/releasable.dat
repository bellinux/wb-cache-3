5|$|The {{game has}} been {{compared}} by the developer as akin to skateboarding games, but where the player controls a goat aimed at doing as much damage as possible around an open world map, without any other larger goals. The game, initially developed as a joke prototype from an internal game jam and shown in an early alpha state in YouTube videos, was met with excitement and attention, prompting the studio to build out the game into a <b>releasable</b> state while still retaining various non-breaking bugs and glitches to maintain the game's entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Relic Entertainment {{was bought}} by THQ, which {{confirmed}} in 2007 that it had acquired {{the rights to the}} series from Relic and Sierra. No further game in the series was made before THQ declared bankruptcy in 2013; on April 22, 2013, Gearbox Software announced that they had bought the rights to the series at auction for US$1.35 million. On July 19, 2013, Gearbox announced the production of remakes of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 as Homeworld HD, later renamed Homeworld Remastered Collection. The following month, collection producer Brian Burleson stated that Gearbox had purchased the property with the express purpose of making a collection including the original and remastered versions of the game. He also noted that neither game had code in a <b>releasable</b> or playable state when purchased, and they ended up recreating many of the original development tools {{with the assistance of the}} Homeworld mod community. A later posting by a developer at Gearbox further praised the mod community for their assistance in getting the original code to be playable on modern computers. The stand-alone expansion Homeworld: Cataclysm was not announced for a remake, despite the outspoken interest of Gearbox, as they were unable to find the original source code for the game.|$|E
25|$|Vesicles in {{the nerve}} {{terminal}} are grouped into three pools: the readily <b>releasable</b> pool, the recycling pool, and the reserve pool. These pools are distinguished by their function and {{position in the}} nerve terminal. The readily <b>releasable</b> pool are docked to the cell membrane, making these {{the first group of}} vesicles to be released on stimulation. The readily <b>releasable</b> pool is small and is quickly exhausted. The recycling pool is proximate to the cell membrane, and tend to be cycled at moderate stimulation, so that the rate of vesicle release is the same as, or lower than, the rate of vesicle formation. This pool is larger than the readily <b>releasable</b> pool, but it takes longer to become mobilised. The reserve pool contains vesicles that are not released under normal conditions. This reserve pool can be quite large (~50%) in neurons grown on a glass substrate, but is very small or absent at mature synapses in intact brain tissue.|$|E
25|$|The current {{hypothesis}} of calcium-dependent exocytosis at retinal ribbon synapses {{suggests that the}} ribbon accommodates a reservoir of primed <b>releasable</b> vesicles. The vesicles that are in closest contact with the presynaptic plasma membrane {{at the base of}} the ribbon constitute the small, rapidly <b>releasable</b> pool of vesicles, whereas the remaining vesicles tethered to the ribbon constitute the large, readily (slower) <b>releasable</b> pool. These regularly aligned rows of synaptic vesicles tethered to either side of the ribbon along with the expression of the kinesin motor protein KIF3A at retinal ribbon synapses can move vesicles like a conveyor belt to the docking/release site at the ribbon base.|$|E
25|$|The cuff {{stabilizer}} is used {{to assist}} snug cuff application and to prevent the cuff from shifting during use. Cuff shifting can interfere with the surgical site and may result in loss of arterial occlusion. Generally, tie ribbons are used as the stabilizer, {{as shown in the}} top figure to the left. However, some newer cuffs use <b>releasable</b> application handles as the stabilizer, as shown in bottom figure to the left. <b>Releasable</b> application handles allow more consistent cuff application, faster cuff removal, and maintain the cuff in a stable position on the limb during use.|$|E
25|$|Synaptic fatigue or {{depression}} is usually {{attributed to the}} depletion of the readily <b>releasable</b> vesicles. Depression can also arise from post-synaptic processes and from feedback activation of presynaptic receptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Releasable</b> abseil - Used by some guides with inexperienced abseilers. A rope {{is set up}} by {{anchoring}} it with a munter hitch and locking off the non-rappelling {{strand of}} the rope. The client descends on the non-locked strand of the rope. The guide unlocks the other strand and lowers the client or the rappeller if the client gets into trouble. Useful with an inexperienced rappeller or when the rappeller gets into trouble, for example, by getting {{a piece of clothing}} or hair entangled in the descender.|$|E
25|$|In {{pancreatic}} β-cells, cAMP signaling, {{which can}} be activated by various extracellular stimuli including hormonal and neural inputs primarily through Gs-coupled receptors, is of importance for normal regulation of insulin secretion to maintain glucose homeostasis. Activation of cAMP signaling amplifies insulin secretion by Epac2-dependent as well as PKA-dependent pathways. Epac2-Rap1 signaling is critical to promote exocytosis of insulin-containing vesicles from the readily <b>releasable</b> pool. In Epac2-mediated exocytosis of insulin granules, Epac2 interacts with Rim2, which is a scaffold protein localized in both plasma membrane and insulin granules, and determines the docking and priming states of exocytosis. In addition, piccolo, a possible Ca2+ sensor protein, interacts with the Epac2-Rim2 complex to regulate cAMP-induced insulin secretion. It is suggested that phospholipase C-ε (PLC-ε), one of the effector proteins of Rap, regulates intracellular Ca2+ dynamics by altering the activities of ion channels such as ATP-sensitive potassium channel, ryanodine receptor, and IP3 receptor.|$|E
500|$|During early {{production}} of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided {{that half of the}} songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in the follow-up album, Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were [...] "polished and reworked" [...] until judged to be <b>releasable.</b> To promote Reload, Metallica performed [...] "Fuel" [...] and [...] "The Memory Remains" [...] with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{trains and}} {{accessories}} of similar gauge and/or scale existed {{as early as}} 1927, modern commercially produced N scale models were first launched by the Arnold company of Nuremberg in 1962. Unlike other scales and gauges, which were de facto standards at best, within two years N scale manufacturers defined the gauge and voltage, {{as well as the}} height and type of couplers. [...] For example, Arnold developed the now ubiquitous [...] "Rapido" [...] coupler to provide a simple and robust <b>releasable</b> coupler design. [...] Although the original Arnold coupler has been joined by more functional and aesthetically pleasing designs, Arnold allowed use of the Rapido design by other manufacturers, so established a common standard to couple together rolling stock from different sources [...]|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{was generally}} negative, with Rotten Tomatoes giving it an approval rating of 29% based on 42 reviews. Roger Ebert {{gave it a}} half-star rating, criticizing it for excessive use of vulgar language and demeaning portrayal of women, describing it as a [...] "train wreck" [...] and finishing his review by bluntly stating [...] "This film {{is not in a}} <b>releasable</b> condition". Nathan Rabin at The A.V. Club said Pootie Tang [...] "borders on audience abuse" [...] and [...] "confuse idiocy for absurdity and randomness for wit". In 2009, fellow A.V. Club writer Scott Tobias revisited the film and included it in his New Cult Canon series, noting that [...] "Pootie Tang repelled mainstream critics and audiences, but it holds an exalted status among alt-comedians and fans of subversive anti-comedy in general".|$|E
2500|$|C.K. {{wrote and}} {{directed}} the feature film Pootie Tang (2001), which was adapted from a sketch that was featured on The Chris Rock Show and featured Chris Rock in a supporting role. The film received largely negative reviews from critics, but has become a cult classic; in a half-star review, Roger Ebert declared it a [...] "train wreck" [...] and felt the film was [...] "not in a <b>releasable</b> condition". Though C.K. is credited as the director, he was fired {{at the end of}} filming with the film being re-edited by the studio. C.K. has since co-written two screenplays with Rock: Down to Earth (2001) and I Think I Love My Wife (2007). His first comedy album, Live in Houston, was released in 2001. In 2002, he voiced Brendon Small's estranged father, Andrew Small, in the animated sitcom Home Movies. C.K. was amongst the writing staff of the sketch comedy show Cedric the Entertainer Presents (2002–03).|$|E
2500|$|The bipolar cell {{active zone}} of the ribbon synapse can release {{neurotransmitter}} continuously for hundreds of milliseconds during strong stimulation. This release of neurotransmitters occurs in two kinetically distinct phases: a small fast pool where about {{twenty percent of the}} total is released in about 1 millisecond, and a large sustained pool where the remaining components are released over hundreds of milliseconds. [...] The existence of correspondence between the pool of tethered vesicles and the pool for sustained release in the rods and bipolar cells of the ribbon reveals that the ribbon may serve as a platform where the vesicles can be primed to allow sustained release of neurotransmitters. This large size of the sustained large component is what separates the ribbon synapse active zones from those of conventional neurons where sustained release is small in comparison. Once the presynaptic vesicles have been depleted, the bipolar cell’s <b>releasable</b> pool requires several seconds to refill with the help of ATP hydrolysis.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Gold, in 2002 Adams was blocked by his label from {{releasing}} his choice for a follow-up. This would be {{the second time this}} happened, the first being with Gold; Adams had recorded [...] "the Suicide Handbook" [...] which was rejected {{on the grounds that it}} was [...] "too sad". The label opted this time around to cherry pick from the four recorded albums already dismissed as <b>releasable</b> full albums ("48 Hours", [...] "The Suicide Handbook", [...] "The Pinkhearts" [...] and [...] "The Swedish Sessions") for a mix tape type record assembled without his involvement. [...] Demolition, a compilation of tracks from these recording sessions, was released in 2002. Although the album garnered more critical attention, it failed to sell as well as Gold. That same year, Adams produced Jesse Malin's first album, The Fine Art of Self Destruction, and later worked with Malin to form the punk-rock group The Finger (under the pseudonyms, [...] "Warren Peace" [...] and [...] "Irving Plaza" [...] respectively), who released two E.P.s which were collected together to form We Are Fuck You, released on One Little Indian Records in 2003. He also starred in a Gap advertisement with Willie Nelson, performing a cover of Hank Williams's [...] "Move It on Over".|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews. The Ninth Gate holds a 41% rating at Rotten Tomatoes and a metascore of 44 on Metacritic. Most movie reviewers {{said that}} the suspense in The Ninth Gate was {{less than that of}} Rosemary's Baby (1968), director Polanski's famous supernatural-themed film. Roger Ebert said the ending was lackluster, [...] "while at the end, I didn't yearn for spectacular special effects, I did wish for spectacular information — something awesome, not just a fade-to-white". In his review for The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell said the movie was [...] "about as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of The Blair Witch Project, and not nearly as funny". Entertainment Weekly rated the film [...] "D+", and Lisa Schwarzbaum said it had an [...] "aroma of middle-brow, art-house Euro-rot, a whiff of decay and hauteur in a film not even a star as foxed, and foxy, as Johnny Depp, himself, could save". In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan said the film was [...] "too laid-back, and unconcerned about the pacing of its story to be satisfying", because [...] "a thriller that's not high-powered, is an intriguing concept, in reality it can hold our attention for only so long". In the Village Voice, J. Hoberman said the film was [...] "barely <b>releasable</b> hokum, stuffed with cheesy blah-blah". European reviews were generally more attentive and praised the film's fine pace and irony.|$|E
