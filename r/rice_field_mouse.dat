We identified five main mtDNA lineages which show a similar level of differentiation as the subspecies of M. musculus and probably diverged during the Middle Pleistocene. Two of the lineages are restricted to large islands (Taiwan and Java) and their existence is explicable in terms of regional palaeogeographic factors including changes in sea level and climate. The remaining lineages are distributed in different regions on mainland Southeast Asia but vicariant explanations are inappropriate given the relatively short time frame. Dispersal across barriers followed by local differentiation probably explains the observed phylogeographic patterning on the mainland. A close genetic link between Okinawan M. caroli and populations in Laos confirms previous suggestions that people carried this species to the Ryukyu Archipelago. However, more intensive regional sampling is needed to identify a precise source area...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Recent studies {{indicate}} that <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> contribute to the conservation of aquatic plants, however, repeated cultivation can reduce the species diversity harbored by <b>rice</b> <b>fields.</b> Repeated tillage, agrochemical application and environmental homogeneity can reduce plant diversity and select for species more tolerant to disturbance. Our hypotheses were: 1) macrophyte richness and biomass decrease with increased rice crop age; and 2) macrophyte species of <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> are a subsample of natural wetlands and species loss will increase with crop age. We investigated three <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> of each different ages (old, intermediate and new ones) and three natural intermittent wetlands for this study. Each area was sampled four times throughout the rice cultivation cycle (off-season, initial growth, final growth and post-harvest). Our {{results showed that the}} mean macrophyte richness and biomass were similar between <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> of different ages and lower than that of natural wetlands. Although species composition in the different-aged <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> was not markedly different, there was nestedness in the <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> as age increased. In this study, we verified that macrophyte richness and biomass in <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> was lower than natural wetlands and the species composition was different among wetland types (<b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and natural wetlands), however our hypothesis that species richness and biomass will decrease with crop age was not confirmed. All rice crops had similar macrophyte assemblage structure (richness, biomass and species composition). However, the another hypothesis tested was confirmed, macrophyte assemblage of <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> is a subset of natural wetlands and as, the age of a <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> increases, the species that occur in older <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> are subsets of species that occur in younger ones...|$|R

However, little is known on how fish and crayfish use <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> in Mediterranean areas. In this work we analyze fish communities and crayfish populations occupying <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and their associated irrigation network (inflow and outflow channels) in the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). We set fyke nets in 104 sites and captured almost 23, 000 fish belonging to 19 species, 9 of which were found to occupy <b>rice</b> <b>fields,</b> as well as over 3000 red swamp crayfish (. Procambarus clarkii). Stone moroko (Pseudorasbora parva), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), dojo loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) and Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were the most common fish found in <b>rice</b> <b>fields.</b> More than 95 % of the fish individuals captured belonged to non-native species. Dojo loach, a recently introduced species well adapted to rice cultivation cycles in its native range, used <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> as reproduction ground. Outflow channels seemed to be a more important source of fish colonizing <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> than inflow channels. Colonization was the main limitation for the establishment of fish populations in <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and fish tended to be more abundant in <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> than in channels for any given frequency of occurrence. The importance of fish as trophic resource for natural predators and the possible interactions between fish occupying <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and <b>rice</b> yield, largely unexplored in the Mediterranean areas, could be managed by modulating connectivity between <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and irrigation channels. <b>Rice</b> <b>fields,</b> however, are not important areas for the conservation of native fish biodiversity, being largely occupied by non-native fishes.

40|$|Background: Japanese {{encephalitis}} virus (JEV), the causative {{agent of}} Japanese encephalitis (JE), is endemic to the Republic of Korea (ROK) where unvaccinated United States (U. S.) military Service members, civilians {{and family members}} are stationed. The primary vector of the JEV in the ROK is Culex tritaeniorhynchus. The ecological relationship between Culex spp. and <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> has been studied extensively; <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> {{have been shown to}} increase the prevalence of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. This research was conducted to determine if the quantification of <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> land cover surrounding U. S. military installations in the ROK should be used as a parameter in a larger risk model that predicts the abundance of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus populations. Mosquito data from the U. S. Forces Korea (USFK) mosquito surveillance program were used in this project. The average number of female Cx. tritaeniorhynchus collected per trap night for the months of August and September, 2002 - 2008, was calculated. <b>Rice</b> <b>fields</b> were manually digitized inside 1. 5 km buffer zones surrounding U. S. military installations on high-resolution satellite images, and the proportion of <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> was calculated for each buffer zone. Results: Mosquito data collected from seventeen sample sites were analyzed for an association with the proportion of <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> land cover. Results demonstrated that the linear relationship between the proportion of <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> and mosquito abundance was statistically significant (R 2 = 0. 62, r =. 79, F = 22. 72, p < 0. 001) ...|$|R

The mapping was done using the overlay technique aided Geographical Information System (GIS) in which the 2002 land use map and the 2009 land use map. The analysis {{of the effectiveness of}} the local government policy was done using regulating documents, observation of in the field, and analysing community evaluation (involving subak leader/pekaseh, farmer/subak member, and chairman traditional village/klian). The study shows that the spatial distribution of the <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> land conversion form cluster pattern. This pattern emerged because of the contagious nature of the <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> land conversion that influenced by development in the sorrounding environment. The implementation of the local government policy is not effective. This is supported by some weakness in the regulation system, an increase in <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> conversion facts and negative respon from the community of the local government policy implementation. In order to make the control of the <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> land conversion run effectively, the local government should reorient the development priorities to the agricultural sector by engaging the partisipant of the local community such as subak...|$|R

On this study determines 4 scenarios consists of a basic scenario, <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> cropping intensity scenarios (RFCI), necessity standard of land settlement scenarios (NSLS), and food diversification scenarios (FD). The final result of this study states that the necessity standard of land settlement scenarios result in a decrease in the rate of land conversion is smaller and the rice stock inventory is more stable compared to other scenarios. Under these conditions, policies that support the above scenario should be established, namely the policy of land-saving settlement development and establishment of sustainable <b>rice</b> <b>field...</b>|$|R
