Here, we report genetic pulse-chase experiments that define osteoblastic cells as short-lived and nonreplicative, requiring replenishment from bone-marrow-derived, Mx 1 + stromal cells with “MSC” features. These cells respond to tissue stress and migrate to sites of injury, supplying new osteoblasts during fracture healing. Single cell transplantation yielded progeny that both preserve progenitor function and differentiate into osteoblasts, producing new bone.

While these cells meet current definitions of MSCs in vitro, they are osteolineage restricted in vivo in growing and adult animals.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} examine {{the use of the}} cohort {{component}} method as a method of deriving <b>replacement</b> <b>demand</b> for manpower forecasting. Design/methodology/approach – The paper explains the principal concepts of <b>replacement</b> <b>demand</b> and how <b>replacement</b> <b>demand</b> has been estimated in two alternative ways: the cohort component method and using longitudinal data on individuals. The paper focuses on one of these ways, the cohort component method, and illustrates how this method can fail to capture all the relevant flows driving <b>replacement</b> <b>demand.</b> It also compares the method to the alternative approach based on individual data and discusses US and Irish results using both methods. Findings – The cohort component method is found to underestimate <b>replacement</b> <b>demand</b> significantly in many occupations. Research limitations/implications – Research estimates of <b>replacement</b> <b>demand</b> should be based on individual longitudinal data rather than the cohort component method. Originality/value – Many countries undertake some form of occupational employment forecasting including, in many cases, making estimates of <b>replacement</b> <b>demand.</b> This paper should help to clarify the appropriate choice of methodology for estimating <b>replacement</b> <b>demand.</b> Forecasting, Manpower planning, Supply and demand...|$|E

40|$|I Net <b>replacement</b> <b>demand</b> {{is defined}} as the number ofjob {{openings}} that arise from individuals leaving an occupation, net 1 of jobs taken by individuals re-entering an occupation. This gives us a measure of the demand for labour required to ' replace the current workforce and may be used for resource allocation planning/or education and training. This may also be used as an additional diagnostic measure for occupations experiencing recruitment and retention difficulties. The average net replacement rate estimated across all occupations in New Zealand was in the order of 1. -/%for 3 - digit and 1. 7 % for 5 -digit occupations during 2001 - 06. The 5 -digit rates varied considerably between 0. 1 (e. g. microbiologists) and 10 (e. g. checkout operators). Average net <b>replacement</b> <b>demand</b> rates for occupations in New Zealand when compared with those derived in the US (2. 4 %). Australia (2. 0 %) and the Netherlands (3. 8 %) suggest somewhat lower domestic rates. Variations in estimates between countries could be explained by differences in the level of occupational mobility as well as the age and gender structure of the workforce. Social and economic policies and differences in each country 's retirement schemes and social assistance policies also give rise to d(ffering net <b>replacement</b> <b>demand</b> rates.

Prior to the recession, claimants with third-Level certificates/diplomas and degrees had between 6 and 10 times the odds of finding employment relative to individuals with a Junior Certificate education (lower secondary) or lower, which is quite large. However, by 2011 those with a third-Level certificate/diploma qualification were almost 40 times more likely to find a job relative to those with a Junior Certificate education or lower, while those with a third-Level degree were 126 times more likely to obtain employment. These results suggest that new and <b>replacement</b> labour <b>demand</b> in Ireland post-recession was heavily skewed towards graduates.|$|R

40|$|<b>Replacement</b> <b>demand</b> due {{to regular}} and early retirement, disablement, {{temporary}} withdrawals of women owing to birth and child raising, et cetera, constitutes {{an important element}} of the future demand for newcomers on the labour market. It is, however, often neglected in manpower forecasting studies. In this paper, we develop a flow model with which we can forecast the <b>replacement</b> <b>demand</b> at a detailed level of types of education. The essential element of the model is the determination of the yearly outflow coefficients for each type of education, distinguished by age category and gender. Instead of applying a fixed coefficient approach (Willems and De Grip (1993), we will introduce the random coefficient estimation technique in the model. This technique takes the reliability of the flow coefficients explicitly into account. If a specific flow coefficient is unreliable, the random coefficient estimate will tend towards the mean value for that age category over the types of education. This means that ad hoc corrections based on judgmental forecasting can be considerably reduced. Moreover, it will be shown that the random coefficient estimates of labour market outflow are more reliable than the estimates of the Willems/De Grip model. ...|$|E

On the demand side, we distinguish between job openings due to employment growth (expansion demand) and due to outflow (<b>replacement</b> <b>demand).</b> Employment of RSE’s is modelled as an error correction mechanism with R&D expenditure as the explanatory variable. A recent survey of European R&D establishments enables us to determine <b>replacement</b> <b>demand.</b> On the supply side, the labour market inflow of RSE’s is derived from data on S&T-graduates and RSE employment. We produce forecasts for demand and supply for 14 Member States of the EU under four alternative scenarios, which are based on two dimensions: economic growth and human capital policy. The forecasts are first used to identify labour market discrepancies by country and by field of study. Then we identify the opportunities for international labour mobility to solve the bottlenecks in the labour markets. The forecasting results indicate considerable shortages of RSE’s in certain fields of study in various Member States of the EU under certain scenarios.
