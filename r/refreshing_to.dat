25|$|Chan's {{first major}} {{breakthrough}} was the 1978 film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, shot {{while he was}} loaned to Seasonal Film Corporation under a two-picture deal. Director Yuen Woo-ping allowed Chan complete freedom over his stunt work. The film established the comedic kung fu genre, and proved <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> the Hong Kong audience. Chan then starred in Drunken Master, which finally propelled him to mainstream success.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> bang {{unrelated}} facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E
500|$|USA Today {{rated the}} film three-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} and Claudia Puig felt that Nolan [...] "regards his viewers as {{possibly}} smarter than they are—or at least as capable of rising to his inventive level. That's a tall order. But it's <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> find a director who makes us stretch, even occasionally struggle, to keep up." ...|$|E

500|$|Docter created Dug {{as he felt}} {{it would}} be <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> show what a dog thinks, rather than what people assume it thinks. Knowledge of canine communication, body {{language}} and pack behaviors for the artists and animators to portray such thoughts came from consultant Dr. Ian Dunbar, veterinarian, dog behaviorist and trainer. The idea for Alpha's voice derived from thinking {{about what would happen}} if someone broke a record player and it always played at a high pitch. Russell was added to the story at a later date than Dug and Kevin; his presence, as well as the construction workers, helped to make the story feel less [...] "episodic".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to the protagonist's {{character has}} been positive. GameSpy's Patrick Joynt praised the character's social life in Persona 3 as it allowed the player {{to interact with}} several other characters and learn about their interesting stories. GamesRadar commented that while Makoto is a [...] "Japanese RPG stereotype" [...] it was <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> see him dealing with his social life. Damian Thomas from RPGFan saw the interactions between the main character and his dorm mates {{as one of the}} game's best parts due to the character growth in each social link. He was also listed as the 10th best Persona character by Kimberley Wallace from Game Informer who found his role in Persona 3 admirable.|$|E
500|$|Working on studio sets {{was a new}} {{experience}} for Rathborne, whose previous work had all been filmed on location. She also found it <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> work with the series' ensemble cast, recalling that Miguel Ferrer often had {{the cast and crew}} laughing at the way he approached his material, imbuing the atmosphere during filming with a mix of comedy and drama. Rathborne has also noted the use of ordinary, almost banal, daily life in the series, finding it a necessary element {{to be able to play}} the series' more violent and surreal elements against effectively. She particularly singled out Cooper as a wholesome [...] "boy next door" [...] character who allowed the town's more unusual residents to stand out more starkly.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing the 1899 revival, The Athenaeum {{managed to}} praise the piece while joining in the musical establishment's {{critique}} of Sullivan. On the one hand, [...] "The Pinafore... sounds fresher than ever. The musical world has become serious – very serious – and it is indeed <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> hear a merry, humorous piece, and music, unassuming in character... it is delicately scored, {{and in many ways}} displays ability of a high order". On the other hand, it wrote that if Sullivan had pursued the path of composing more serious music, like his symphony, [...] "he would have produced still higher results; in like manner Pinafore set us wondering what the composer would have accomplished with a libretto of somewhat similar kind, but one giving him larger scope for the exercise of his gifts".|$|E
500|$|Talpade, who {{previously}} featured {{as the title}} character of Kukunoor's Iqbal (2005), observed the bahuroopiyas in Rajasthan and incorporated their dialect, accent, and their body language for his character. About Kukunoor, he said that, [...] "though one tends to go overboard as an actor most of the times, the way he handles the character as a director, Nagesh makes you {{feel that it is}} very simple for you to delineate the character." [...] Through his character of a bahuroopiya, Talpade was required to perform mimicry. While he was good at mimicry in college, it was during the filming of Iqbal, Kukunoor noted this talent of his and thus Dor came into Talpade's hands. About his co-actors, he said that it was <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> work with Panag and Takia despite the scorching heat of [...]|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Smith {{performed}} her own off-Broadway one-woman show entitled More at the Union Square Theatre in New York City. Directed by Judith Ivey, {{the play}} is about her mixed feelings over the success of The Simpsons, her parents, her relationships, and her struggles with bulimia. The New York Times critic Margo Jefferson called it an [...] "appealing if overlong show", adding that [...] "The career narrative needed shortening. This would involve some editing and revising but wouldn't taint {{the best parts of}} More. It is <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> hear a celebrity talk cleanly about being fame-driven and about not getting the degree or the kind of fame you craved. It's fun to watch a skilled actress use her craft to the full." [...] She would later perform the play for three weeks in Los Angeles the following year.|$|E

500|$|When Les {{threatens to}} inform the police about her blackmail, Babe {{increases}} {{the price of the}} blackmail so Pam tries to appeal to Babe's [...] "better nature". A reporter from Soaplife believed that this would [...] "get Pam absolutely nowhere" [...] because Babe does not have a better side. Pam is unable to appeal to her better nature and a show insider explained that Pam [...] "doesn't see that she has any other option but to pay up". Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) discovers Les's secret, which made Kilkelly (Digital Spy) believe that [...] "it's {{only a matter of time}} before more characters find out." [...] He opined that it would [...] "be <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> see Babe receive the backlash for putting the Cokers through months of misery". He also described Babe as a [...] "vicious blackmailler" [...] who should be [...] "ashamed".|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Hologram" [...] {{was directed by}} Hideharu Ueki. It opens with a woman walking down a beach front, with her subsequently holding and letting go of her bikini strap by the pre-chorus. Over {{the rest of the}} visual, she is portrayed being engaged alone or with a man in the water or playing around the beach shore; several of the scenes repeat throughout the music video.

A reviewer for Kerrang! wrote, [...] "A truly inspired single... Garbage combine a slightly sinister acidic approach with an infectious melodic atmosphere and an alternative punch. The result is awesome," [...] and a reviewer for Music Week stated that [...] "Shirley Manson's vocals veer between fuzzy darkness, grinding catchy and crystal brilliance." [...] Alastair Mabbot, writing for The List, described the song as [...] "Spitting Images notion of alternative rock".|$|E
500|$|Alan Clayson approves of {{the more}} [...] "understated {{production}} aesthetic" [...] next to what he views as an at-times [...] "bloated" [...] sound found elsewhere on All Things Must Pass. Simon Leng also acknowledges Harrison's success in [...] "temper Phil Spector's taste for the extreme" [...] and describes [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] {{as one of its}} composer's [...] "more attractive" [...] songs, with a fine lead vocal. [...] " [...] is <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> hear Harrison singing about another's pain," [...] Leng adds, [...] "suggesting that, unlike some of his contemporaries, he was able to displace himself as the center of his universe {{for a moment or two}} at least." [...] In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams identifies [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] as an example of [...] "how sympathetic to the performer" [...] Spector could be as a producer, in this case, by giving the recording a [...] "mellow, autumnal mix" [...] that [...] "beautifully display" [...] Drake's pedal steel.|$|E

500|$|Rap-Up {{commented that}} {{by having the}} two {{different}} videos, it shows that [...] "every good girl has a bad side."

[...] In another review of the video, Bain wrote that the daytime version presented Rihanna as [...] "having the most fun she's had in ages." [...] Bain continued to praise the creative direction for the video, writing [...] "It's so <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> see RiRi smiling and ready to party after her gun-weilding , lake-drowning, loving-the-way-you-lie humorless somber phase." [...] Amy Lee for Metro compared the daytime video's colorful stylization to Katy Perry's video for [...] "California Gurls".

500|$|Fans were [...] "widely against" [...] O'Malley's {{affair with}} Meredith {{in the second}} season, however certain fans who {{supported}} their relationship were critical when Torres was introduced as a love interest for him. Fans and critics were also against O'Malley's relationship with Stevens in the fourth season; Maclean's said: [...] "George must die. He's slept with virtually everyone except the male cast {{and has been in}} love with virtually everyone except the male cast. And he's not that great of a doctor. Evolve or die." [...] Christopher Monfette of IGN said O'Malley and Stevens were a [...] "mismatch", adding: [...] "Unfortunately, while it's <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> see a plotline driven by activity versus apathy, the idea of these two ever-affable, best-friend characters suddenly discovering their potential, out-of-nowhere love for each other quickly feels both force-fed and emotionally-incorrect." [...] Similarly, DVD Verdict stated that George and Izzie were [...] "one of the strongest 'best friend' vibes on television" [...] for the first three seasons, explaining [...] "they were perfect as friends [...] George and Callie made a good couple." [...] UGO.com put the two on their list of [...] "Character Couples Who Should Have Never Happened".|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt <b>refreshing</b> <b>to</b> witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you." ...|$|E
