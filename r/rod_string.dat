2500|$|The early {{applications}} of CPT mainly determined the soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity. The original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical {{measurements of the}} total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a conical tip into the soil. Different methods were employed to separate the total measured resistance into components generated by the conical tip (the [...] "tip friction") and friction generated by the <b>rod</b> <b>string.</b> A friction sleeve was added to quantify this component of the friction and aid in determining soil cohesive strength in the 1960s. Electronic measurements began in 1948 and improved further in the early 1970s. Most modern electronic CPT cones now also employ a pressure transducer with a filter to gather pore water pressure data. The filter is usually located either on the cone tip (the so-called U1 position), immediately behind the cone tip (the most common U2 position) or behind the friction sleeve (U3 position). Pore water pressure data aids determining stratigraphy and is primarily used to correct tip friction values for those effects. CPT testing which also gathers this piezometer data is called CPTU testing. CPT and CPTU testing equipment generally advances the cone using hydraulic rams mounted on either a heavily ballasted vehicle or using screwed-in anchors as a counter-force. One advantage of CPT over the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is a more continuous profile of soil parameters, with data recorded at intervals typically of 20cm but as small as 1cm.|$|E

50|$|Rod blanks can be {{purchased}} with guide locations preset for the individual rod or placed by hand. Rod sections tend to be directional, wanting to flex in a certain direction over others. Rod builders usually test each rod section to find the point of greatest flex (aka spining the rod) so that guides can be aligned along it. With the placement around the rod determined, the rod builder next determines where {{along the length of}} the rod to place the guides. This is usually done by taping the guides onto the <b>rod,</b> <b>stringing</b> the <b>rod,</b> flexing it and moving each guide to achieve the best fit to the rod's natural flex.|$|R

50|$|The {{surface unit}} {{transfers}} energy for pumping the well from the prime-mover to the sucker <b>rod</b> <b>string.</b> In doing this, it must change the rotary {{motion of the}} prime-mover to reciprocating motion for the sucker rod. And it must reduce {{the speed of the}} prime-mover to a suitable pumping speed. Speed reduction is accomplished by using a gear reducer, and rotary motion of thencrank shaft is converted to oscillatory motion by means of a walking beam. The crank arm is connected to the walking beam by means of a pitman arm. The walking beam is supported by a Samson post and saddle bearing. The horse head and bridle are used to ensure that the pull on the sucker <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> is vertical all times so that no bearing movement is applied to that part of sucker <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> above stuffing box.

5000|$|Although RC {{drilling}} is air-powered, {{water is}} also used to reduce dust, keep the drill bit cool, and assist in pushing cutting back upwards, but also when [...] "collaring" [...] a new hole. A mud called [...] "Liqui-Pol" [...] is mixed with water and pumped into the <b>rod</b> <b>string,</b> down the hole. This helps to bring up the sample to the surface by making the sand stick together. Occasionally, [...] "Super-Foam" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "Quik-Foam") {{is also used}}, to bring all the very fine cuttings to the surface, and to clean the hole. When the drill reaches hard rock, a [...] "collar" [...] is put down the hole around the rods, which is normally PVC piping. Occasionally the collar may be made from metal casing. Collaring a hole is needed to stop the walls from caving in and bogging the <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> {{at the top of the}} hole. Collars may be up to 60 metres deep, depending on the ground, although if drilling through hard rock a collar may not be necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Temporary casing completion: the MLS is {{inserted}} down {{the inside of}} temporary drill casing or core rods extending {{to the bottom of}} the borehole and, the seals are emplaced from the bottom as the casing/core <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> is slowly retracted. Hence, the drill casing/core rods acts as the temporary protective shield during the installation. This type of installation is most common when the drilling is done by sonic methods in overburden or in unstable bedrock. Installations using rotary wireline coring tools and air-rotary casing hammer (ARCH) methods are also of this type.|$|E
5000|$|Diamond {{drilling}} is {{much slower}} than reverse circulation (RC) drilling {{due to the}} hardness of the ground being drilled. Drilling of 1200 to 1800 metres is common and at these depths, ground is mainly hard rock. Techniques vary among drill operators and what the rig they are using is capable of, some diamond rigs need to drill slowly to lengthen the life of drill bits and rods, which are very expensive and time consuming to replace at extremely deep depths. As a diamond drill rig cores deeper and deeper the time consuming {{part of the process}} is not cutting 5 to 10 more feet of rock core but the retrieval of the core with the wire line & overshot tool.Core samples are retrieved via the use of a core tube, a hollow tube placed inside the <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> and pumped with water until it locks into the core barrel. As the core is drilled, the core barrel slides over the core as it is cut. An [...] "overshot" [...] attached {{to the end of the}} winch cable is lowered inside the <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> and locks on to the backend (aka head assembly), located on the top end of the core barrel. The winch is retracted, pulling the core tube to the surface. The core does not drop out of the inside of the core tube when lifted because either a split ring core lifter or basket retainer allow the core to move into, but not back out of the tube.|$|E

50|$|For {{percussion}} techniques, {{the main}} limitation is air pressure. Air must {{be delivered to}} the piston at sufficient pressure to activate the reciprocating action, and in turn drive the head into the rock with sufficient strength to fracture and pulverise it. With depth, volume {{is added to the}} in-rod string, requiring larger compressors to achieve operational pressures. Secondly, groundwater is ubiquitous, and increases in pressure with depth in the ground. The air inside the <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> must be pressurised enough to overcome this water pressure at the bit face. Then, the air must be able to carry the rock fragments to surface. This is why depths in excess of 500 m for reverse circulation drilling are rarely achieved, because the cost is prohibitive and approaches the threshold at which diamond core drilling is more economic.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used RC drill bits are 5-8 inches (13-20 cm) in diameter and have round tungsten 'buttons' that protrude from the bit, which are required to drill through shale and abrasive rock. As the buttons wear down, drilling becomes slower and the <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> can potentially become bogged in the hole. This is a problem as trying to recover the rods may take hours {{and in some cases}} weeks. The rods and drill bits themselves are very expensive, often resulting in great cost to drilling companies when equipment is lost down the bore hole. Most companies will regularly re-grind the buttons on their drill bits in order to prevent this, and to speed up progress. Usually, when something is lost (breaks off) in the hole, it is not the drill string, but rather from the bit, hammer, or stabilizer {{to the bottom of the}} drill string (bit). This is usually caused by operator error, over-stressed metal, or adverse drilling conditions causing downhole equipment to get stuck in a part of the hole.|$|E

40|$|The {{sucker rod}} pump is an {{artificial}} lift method frequently applied in onshore petroleum wells. This system can be described using a numerical simulation based {{on the behavior of}} a <b>rod</b> <b>string.</b> In the past, the elastic behavior of the <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> made it difficult to model the system. However, since the 1960 s and with the advent of digital computers, it has been modeled numerically. The <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> be-haves like a slender bar, and thus, the propagation of elastic waves along the bar can be represented by a one-dimensional equation. Gibbs (1963) presented a mathematical model based on the wave equation, which is described {{on the basis of the}} analysis of forces on the <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> and is incorporated into a boundary value problem involving partial differential equations. The use of the finite differ-ence method allows for a numerical solution by the discretization of the wave equation developed in the mathematical formulation with appropriate boundary and initial conditions. This work presents a methodology for implementing an academic computer code that allows simulation of the upstroke and downstroke motion of the <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> described by the wave equation under ideal operating conditions, assuming a harmonic motion of the rod at one end and downhole pump at the other end. The goal of this study is to generate the downhole dynamometer card, an important and consolidated tool that controls the pump system by diagnosing oper-ational conditions of the downhole pump...|$|E

30|$|The {{load reducer}} for the sucker rod could {{decrease}} the suspension load {{and increase the}} pumping system efficiency, and could increase {{the depth of the}} pump by the same type beam pumping units.

40|$|The {{existing}} {{design of}} sucker <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> mainly {{focuses on the}} simplifying assumptions that <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> was exposed to simple tension loading. And its goal was to have equal modified stress {{at the top of}} each taper. The improved rod design was to have the same degree of safety at each section, and it used a dynamic force distribution that was proportional along the whole string. However, the available procedures did not provide the desired accuracy of its pertinent analysis, and the operators could not identify the specific phenomena that occur in CBM wells. In this paper, the mathematical models of rod loads and string length were developed based on the cyclic nature of <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> loading; the fatigue endurance method is used to design the single rod string; and the tapered <b>rod</b> <b>string</b> is designed to have an equal equivalent stress at the top of each section. Its application characteristics are demonstrated by the example of CBM wells in Ordos Basin. The interpretations of results show that the previous design gave the single rods a larger diameter and the top rods in the string a greater percent than the proposed method. The calculation should concern about inertial, vibration and friction forces to illustrate the elastic force waves travelling in the rod material with the speed of sound. The single string should be designed using fatigue endurance ratings due to asymmetric pulsating tension of rod loading; and the tapered string should involve a balanced design by setting the fatigue endurance at each section equal. A shorter stroke length gives a greater rod taper percentage and an increased load capacity results to an enhanced rod diameter. The rod diameter increases with the pump size and load capacity for the single string, and the rod taper percentage of the top rod strings increases with plunger diameter for the tapered string. The proposed research improves efficiency of the pumping system, assures good operating conditions, and reduces total production costs...|$|E

5000|$|The {{pedagogical}} {{aim is to}} {{show that}} rotations have extra consequences when one considers properties of the object being subjected to them in relation with its surroundings or space itself. Without trying to make a direct analogy one can be convinced of the importance of considering these extra properties following the rationale implied by this game: an object is defined here consisting of two <b>rods</b> and <b>strings</b> connecting them. Applying a rotation means here rotating one of the two rods 360 degrees. The rod returns in the same place as before the rotation, thus we say that it transforms as a vector under rotations in three-dimensional space (i.e. under the special orthogonal group of dimension 3). We are not saying any more here other than that if you turn a full circle around your self you will end up where you were before. However, the object as we defined it being the two <b>rods</b> and <b>string</b> is not in the same state as before, the strings are entangled and cannot be unentangled without applying again a rotation in any part of the system. If we rotate the rod again in the same directions so that it will have completed a 720 degrees rotation in total the strings can be untangled without rotating any part (e.g. by [...] "sliding" [...] the rods and/or stretching the strings). We then say it transforms as a spinor. This is actually how an electron behaves and we say it is a spin-1/2 particle.|$|R
