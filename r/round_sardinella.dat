40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} <b>round</b> <b>sardinella,</b> Sardinella aurita Valenciennes, 1847, was studied {{for the first}} time in the north-eastern Mediterranean Sea. <b>Round</b> <b>sardinella</b> has gained much attention lately because of its biomass increase, which might be the result of climatic changes occurring across the Mediterranean Sea. Monthly samples were collected on board commercial purse-seiners for two complete year cycles (September 2000 to August 2002). <b>Round</b> <b>sardinella</b> is a gonochoristic fish. The overall female to male ratio was not statistically different (P= 0. 34) from unity, although it varied monthly and with the length of the fish. The seasonal changes in the gonadosomatic index and the macroscopic characteristics of gonads showed that <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> in the northern Aegean spawns between May and July. Male <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> reach first sexual maturity at a smaller total length than females (155. 0 and 168. 3 mm respectively). Mean absolute fecundity (FA) increased exponentially with body length (FA= 0. 0949 xL 4. 22) and weight (FA= 511. 19 xW 1. 02), with an average of ~ 21, 000 oocytes produced per spawning female. Relative fecundity (FR) ranged between 242 and 681 oocytes/g of body weight (average: 445 oocytes/g).

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the temporal}} and spatial changes in abundance and distribution of the warm water species <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> (Sardinella aurita) in the western Mediterra-nean over the last decades in relation to sea water temperature. In the western Mediterranean basin (1950 – 2003), a significant positive relationship was found between <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> landings and temperature anomalies. Along a latitudinal gradient off the Mediterranean Iberian coast (1989 – 2004), a gradual increase in species abundance was observed from south to north, with a certain time lag going northwards, associated {{with the increase in}} sea water temperature. The abundance of <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> in the two warmest and southernmost areas was positively and significantly correlated with sea surface temperature registered during the start of gonad maturation the previous year. In addition, the positive relationship established between water temperature and abun-dance of <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> in the coldest and northernmost study area demonstrates that there is a temperature limit for the distribution of this species in the western Mediterra-nean. In addition, this study analyses <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> larvae distribution and abun-dance in the summers of 2003 and 2004, and conducts a comparison with the situation 20 years ago (summer 1983). Results show a marked increase in larval abundance during the last decades and the present appearance of larvae in the northernmost study areas, where they did not occur 20 years ago.

[...] 1 pageGlobal {{change has}} been {{recognized}} as the main driver of the expansion of species outside to their native range, posing an important modification in the ecosystems through their potential effects on native biodiversity and community structure and functioning. Although {{a variety of factors}} may influence expansion success, how expanding species manage trophic resources may be the most critical factor to ensure survival and reproduction {{and one of the most}} important ways to impact native communities. Two main trophic pathways have been suggested to explain resource acquisition by expanding species: expanding species may behave aggressively over the resources exploited by natives, displacing them from their niches, or they may exploit niche opportunities that most native species are unable to use efficiently. The recent expansion in the Mediterranean Sea by the <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> Sardinella aurita, a tropical pelagic fish, as a consequence of the increase in the temperature of the Mediterranean waters provides an excellent field-laboratory to investigate the trophic strategies of marine species in expansion, as well as to quantify the trophic impact of these new species on populations and communities of ecological similar native species. We examined the main trophic pathways of the <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> and the trophic relationships with other ecological similar pelagic fish species in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea by analysing their stable isotopic values throughout the year. Results revealed that <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> overlapped its trophic niche with medium pelagic species (Atlantic horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus and Atlantic chub Scomber colias).

Discards on the marketable ratio fluctuated over years and seasons without showing any particular trend. At the species level, sardine and mackerel were seldom discarded while large amounts of anchovy were discarded only during its recruitment period (autumn), when juvenile fish dominate the population. The discarding ratio for bogue, picarel and <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> ranged from zero to total discarding because they constitute a supplementary source of income for the fishers.

We hypothesized that these clusters corresponded to a materialisation of the microcohorts originating from successive spawnings of fish populations in their vital domain. A candidate individual-based model was developed to investigate this hypothesis. This model is based on pattern-oriented modelling of a concrete documented case: the dynamics of the <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> (Sardinella aunita) population living off the West African coasts and subject to environmental fluctuations caused by seasonal upwelling. The simulated agents were <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> microcohorts situated and moving in a discretised physical environment. The combined effects of environmental forcing (temperature, wind, retention) and inner biological dynamics (reproduction, growth and mortality, competition) condition the dynamics of this population. The modelled behaviour generated realistic dynamic patterns (population distribution, spawning zones, periods and plasticity, biomass fluctuations), which were obtained simultaneously and successfully compared with observations. The steady-state number of microcohorts obtained after simulation convergence was similar to the number of clusters observed in situ in this area for this population. The realism and diversity of the patterns simultaneously simulated suggested the cluster-microcohort equivalence hypothesis as a candidate framework accounting for the origin of the clusters observed in situ. Within this preliminary exploration, we discuss the consistency of the hypothesis and the accuracy of the model. If the correspondence between clusters and microcohorts proves to be real, it may be transient and progressively modified by other environmental factors. If stable over time, as simulated in the model, the number of observed clusters should be related to the number of spawning events in the species' lifetime...|$|E

Data have been obtained by the 'Scientific Observer Program', which monitors the catch (both landings and discards) of the Dutch fishery for small pelagics in Mauritania. The Dutch pelagic fleet in Mauritania focuses mainly on the group of sardinella (Sardinella aurita and Sardinella maderensis). Additional target species are pilchard (Sardina pilchardus) and chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus). The landings by weight in 2003 consisted for 95 % of these 4 species, S. aurita being the dominant species (58 % of the landings). In the year 2003, 91. 6 % of the estimated total catch by weight has been landed and 8. 4 % was discarded, which is reasonably comparable to previous years (1999 - 2002). The total estimated catch of the Dutch fleet has remained about the same, approximately 170 thousand tons per year. The dominance of S. aurita in the total estimated catch has gradually diminished throughout the years 1999 - 2003. Pilchard (S. pilchardus) and chub mackerel (S. japonicus) gradually replaced the <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> in the catches of the Dutch fleet since 1999.

For the past four decades, climatic conditions ha ve been found to be changing in the country. This period coincided with the conspicuous fluctuations in the landings of the most significant pelagic species exploited by the canoe fleet. This study provides an assessment of the influence of precipitation and sea surface temperature changes on yield and catch of <b>Round</b> <b>Sardinella</b> (Sardinella aurita), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus), Flat Sardinella (S. maderensis) and Guinea Shrimp (Parapenaeopsis atlantica). The abundance of these stocks is believed to be correlated with upwelling and sea surface temperature conditions and a local manifestation of global scale climatic changes is suspected to be taking place. It was hypothesized that climate as represented by sea surface temperature (SST) and precipitation affects either catchability or the population growth rate of each species. Forty years of climatological data (mean air temperature and precipitation) were assessed; 38 and 33 years each of hydrological data (sea surface temperature and salinity) were then used to investigate the possible relation between climatic changes and species production. Forecasts of future climate scenarios were made, and stock dynamics were simulated with an environmentally coupled dynamic surplus production model. Stock production and, to a lower extent, catchability were found to be closely tied to climatological factors. Lower catch rates of the <b>Round</b> <b>Sardinella</b> coincided with years of higher SST and the reverse was true for the anchovy. For the shrimp and flat sardine, precipitation was found to have the most substantial effect on production and total annual catchability. It was concluded that changes in climate directly affect the productivity of the ecosystem as well as its catchability and most importantly, the population growth rate of the species. For sustainable management of the fishery resources, it is imperative that climatic and hydrological parameters be incorporated into fishery management models...|$|E

However, the scientific community is struggling to make satisfactory assessments of important pelagic species such as sardinella, due {{to the absence of}} relevant indices of abundance to adjust stock assessment models.

Acoustic energy is divided into binomial variables representing zero, low, medium, large and very large densities. A multidimensional geostatistical approach makes it possible to (i) map the spatial distribution of density classes and (ii) compute a new acoustic index of abundance for Sardinella aurita. The data used in this work are those of the Fridtjof Nansen research vessel surveys and the Mauritanian research vessel Al-Awam (2007 - 2010).

40|$|The {{fluctuating}} {{abundance of}} <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> (Sardinella aurita) in Mauritanian waters {{over the past}} ca. 20 years {{can be related to}} environmental dynamics off Northwest Africa. Trends in the fishery are evaluated using FAO data, acoustic surveys, and catch statistics from the EU fleet (1996 - 2006). Remote sensing data demonstrate rising annual sea surface temperatures, up to 3 °C higher than the long-term average in 2002 - 2003, following a shift in ocean climate in 1995. Fish abundance and repeated expansion of the sardinella population in the past 10 years are attributed to favorable oceanographic conditions and increased recruitment success. Sardinella thrives with intense upwelling and high primary production during spring, and retention of waters over the shelf during summer and autumn. The stock of S. aurita over the Northwest African shelf oscillates with the cold-warm states of the habitat. Favorable hydrographic conditions and extended habitat has resulted in unprecedented rise of sardinella abundance in the late 1990 s, which was counterbalanced by the impact of fisheries. A backshift to a cold-state ecosystem, with extensive regional upwelling and decreased sardinella habitat, would topple that balance. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The adults of several larvae caught, although sometimes at very low concentrations, are species with high commercial value or represent a major proportion of the captured production of the northern Aegean Sea. The larvae of European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) were most abundant in both years followed by the brown comber (Serranus hepatus), the gobies (Gobius sp.) and, only for 2003, <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> (Sardinella aurita). Maximum anchovy larval densities reached 4145 / 10 m(2) and 13852 / 10 m(2) in the 2002 and 2003 surveys, respectively. The spatial extent Of anchovy larvae was also high as they were collected at 12 stations in 2002 and at 15 in 2003. Besides water circulation, the spatial distribution of fish larvae was largely influenced by temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen...|$|E
40|$|The {{wide variety}} of marketed fishery {{products}} sometimes makes the recognition of species difficult, especially in processed food. So the consumer can be exposed to several commercial and health frauds. The European law obliges to indicate the species by specific commercial names only in fresh and prepared fishery products, but not in processed ones, in which the species can be named using generic denominations. In the present study, {{the use of a}} PCR-RFLP technique for species identification in anchovy paste, a widespread product in Italy, is described. After the PCR amplification of a common 272 bp fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from different fish species used as standards (European anchovy, European pilchard, European sprat, twaite shad, <b>round</b> <b>sardinella,</b> Atlantic horse mackerel and Mediterranean horse mackerel), the amplicons were digested using four restriction enzymes (MspI, HincII, Eam 1104 I and Alw 26 I). These patterns were compared with patterns from DNA extracted from anchovy pastes purchased from the market enabling to detect the presence of species different from anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in some of them. The suitability of extending the obligation to indicate the species using specific commercial denominations even to processed fishery products is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceConcentrations of 11 {{elements}} (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se,V and Zn) were quantified in {{liver and}} muscle from two commercially important fish species from the Senegalese coast. The fish, a {{small pelagic species}} (the <b>round</b> <b>sardinella)</b> and a benthic species (the Senegalese sole) were collected from five sites during the dry and wet seasons in 2013. For both species, elements were more concentrated in liver than in muscle. There was no clear seasonal pattern in concentration of elements, however inter-site differences were observed. We found significant differences in element concentrations between the two studied species, likely associated with their behavior, feeding and habitat use. The concentrations of Cd, Fe, and Pb were significantly higher in sardinella whereas concentration of As, Cu, Cr, Mn and Se were highest in sole. The concentration of cadmium was particularly high in the liver of sardinella (from 0. 9 to 56 mg kg− 1, with a mean ± sd of 17. 2 ± 11. 5 mg kg− 1) and {{may be related to}} anthropogenic pressure such as the phosphate industry but also to the upwelling current which brings dissolved elements to the surface that are taken up by plankton. The results showed that concentrations of Cd and Pb were below the limit values established by the European Community and pose no threat to public health...|$|E
40|$|Small {{and medium}} pelagic fishes {{play a central}} role in marine food webs by {{transferring}} energy from plankton to top predators. In this study, direct calorimetry was used to analyze the energy density of seven pelagic species collected over four seasons from the western Mediterranean Sea: anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardina pilchardus, <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> Sardinella aurita, horse mackerels Trachurus trachurus and T. mediterraneus, and mackerels Scomber scombrus and S. colias. Inter-specific differences in energy density were linked to spawning period, energy allocation strategies for reproduction and growth, and feeding ecologies. Energy density of each species varied over time, with the exception of S. colitis, likely due to its high energetic requirements related to migration throughout the year. In general, higher energy density was observed in spring for all species, regardless of their breeding strategy, probably as a consequence of the late-winter phytoplankton bloom. These results provide new insights into the temporal availability of energy in the pelagic ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea, which are pivotal for understanding how the population dynamics of small and medium pelagic fishes and their predators may respond to environmental changes and fishing impacts. In addition, the differences found in energy density between species highlighted the importance of using species specific energy values in ecosystem assessment tools such as bioenergetic and food web models...|$|E
40|$|The Small-Scale Fisheries (SSF) in the Canary Islands {{are not an}} exception. They {{have been}} {{traditionally}} under-studied and not enough historical statistics are available. Therefore, most of the exploited resources remain unassessed. After tunas, the small pelagic fish (targeted by artisanal purse-seiners) are the most captured group in the area. The main species landed are chub mackerel (Scomber colias Gmelin, 1789), blue jack mackerel (Trachurus picturatus (Bowdich, 1825)), sardine (Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792)) and <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> (Sardinella aurita Valenciennes, 1847).

It started in 2013, through the UE Data Collection Framework (Commission Regulation (EC) 665 / 2008). In order to estimate the population parameters and to describe the fishing effort and landings trends, monthly commercial catches of all these species are sampled in the laboratory and, since 2009, weekly length samplings are performed in fish markets by the IEO-Network of Sampling and Information. Besides, useful general information is analyzed from the Official Sales Notes, available since 2007.

40|$|The European {{industrial}} pelagic traw {{fishery in}} Mauritanian waters targeted at {{small pelagic species}} is geared towards sardine (Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792)), <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> (Sardinella aurita Valenciennes, 1847), flat sardinella (Sardinella maderensis (Lowe, 1838)), mackerel (Scomber colias Gmelin, 1789) and horse mackerel (Trachurus spp.). In 2003 the Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO) through its Centro Oceanográfico de Canarias (COC) began to follow up this activity under the European Project Data Collection (Regulation (EC) 1543 / 2000). In 2008 the COC-IEO began the study of horse mackerel (Trachurus spp.) under commercial codification “JAX”. Discharges were about 1, 500 tonnes in that year (22 fishing trips) and 2, 000 tonnes in 2009 (29 fishing trips). During this period, 5, 180 specimens of these commercial catches were analyzed. Four different species were identified (in order of importance in commercial landings analyzed) : Trachurus trecae Cadenat, 1950, Caranx rhonchus Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1817, Trachurus trachurus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Trachurus picturatus (Bowdich, 1825). The assessments {{of the status of}} these resources carried out by International Working Groups are focused on T. trecae and T. trachurus. Previous studies of the area had not considered this. The present study aims to highlight the need to identify the mixture of these species in the landings, in order to ameliorate the quality of data used in the assessments and in the establishment of the level of exploitation...|$|E

Annual mean value of SST from 1982 to 2006 around the Canary Islands waters showed an increase of temperatures from 1994, reaching a maximum in 1997. After this period, in 2000 a decrease was observed, followed by a new increase, reaching in 2006 the maximum value in the whole series. In 2005 and 2006 lower SST values were observed in February−March (18. 0 º C− 20. 0 º C) and in September−October (23. 5 º C− 25. 0 º C) the greatest. With the exception of January and February 2005, SSTA values were always positive. An inverse relationship was noted between catch-index (CI) and SSTA series. Increments of CI were associated with negative SSTA events and vice versa, always with some lag of time. Certain stability of SSTA coincided with the lowest CI values along the studied period.

40|$|Reliable biomass {{estimates}} {{by means of}} hydroacoustics largely depend on the correct identification of acoustic targets. Data collected during five summer acoustic surveys (2004 - 2008) in the North Aegean Sea (Greece) were analyzed to explore effective discrimination of small pelagic fish schools according to the species they belong. Discriminant Function Analyses (DFA) using bathymetric, energetic and morphometric school descriptors as explanatory variables were applied per research cruise {{as well as to}} pooled data from all surveys. Results revealed that the schools can be successfully classified into the five species considered (anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardina pilchardus, <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> Sardinella aurita, blue whiting Micromessistius poutassou, and Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus). The percentage of correct classifications in terms of number of schools was higher in the analyses of the annual cruises (75. 6 %- 95. 36 %) than in the analysis of pooled data (≈ 72 %). This is because of (i) the lower number of species, as well as (ii) the reduced intraspecific variability, occurring in each separate cruise. Significant differences were detected among school descriptors for the different species, revealing discrete aspects of schooling behaviour for each species. The benefit of the specific approach is that the classification functions of the DFAs can be used to classify a larger set of schools, which has not been possible to assign to specific species. Overall the approach constitutes an objective, more automated and less time consuming procedure for the analysis of acoustic data and can contribute to the improvement of biomass estimates in the area...|$|E
40|$|Small {{pelagic fish}} (SPF) species are heavily {{exploited}} {{in the four}} main eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUS), including both Atlantic African ones, as their transformation are increasingly used in the world food chain. Management rely on regular monitoring, {{but there is a}} lack of model for population traits emergence and evolution according to the variability of the environment. We attempt to extract some general rules based on the analysis of a life cycle biophysical individual based model applied to the <b>round</b> <b>sardinella</b> (Sardinella aurita, Clupeidae) population off North West Africa. Our analysis focused on the processes responsible for seasonal migrations, spatio-temporal body-length distribution, and inter-annual biomass fluctuations. These patterns were found at individual level in the dynamic change of preferred habitat, and variability in exploration capacities. The former resulted from complex interactions between natal homing behavior and environmental variability, while the last was determined by individual swimming capacities, the mesoscale structure of the habitat and the horizontal currents. Observed spatio-temporal abundance variability emerged from a superposition of numerous distinct individual life histories. This work also suggested an alongshore pattern in size distributions confirmed by in situ surveys. New insights about population structure are provided, with a focal area in Mauritania and mainly two migrating sub-populations centered at 18 °N and 21 °N, respectively. Inter-annual biomass fluctuations were linked to variability in Sahara Bank's fish recruitment, itself depending on southward current intensity. The identified processes constitute an analytical frame that can be transposed to study Small pelagic fish in all eastern boundary upwelling systems and used to study potential effect of regional climate change...|$|E
