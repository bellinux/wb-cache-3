40|$|Different {{scientific}} {{approaches to}} the problem of nations and nationalism have appeared during the last thirty years. Nations and nationalism are no longer observed as natural, unchangeable and autochthonous processes, but as hybrid, imaginary and artificial activities. The question of the role of cultural practices in the creation of national identity is very often a burning issue for the scholars dealing with the nation state. This paper contributes to this topic. It focuses on the analyses of the roles of literary, but also nonfictional programmatic texts of the Croatian Illyrians who {{played a key role in}} constructing the nation as an imaginary community (Anderson). By creating an active context for »modeling« of the Croatian national being, the Illyrians sometimes had to resort to forgetting, <b>refreshing</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> fabrication of tradition (Hobsbawm), and similar methods in order to imagine a steady and continuous history of the Illyrian movement and inscribe it perspicaciously with new meanings. In that sense, this interpretation is an attempt to illuminate the strategies of memory, remembrance and forgetting as the tropes for construction of the national culture...|$|E
40|$|Four {{models of}} working memory {{processes}} in the complex span paradigm were tested: The task-switching model of Towse, Hitch, and Hutton (1998), the interference account of Saito and Miyake (2004), and {{two versions of the}} time-based resource-sharing model of Barrouillet, Bernardin, and Camos (2004). On the basis of a reading span paradigm that used segmented sentences, the effect of processing time on the recall of words was investigated while the amount of processing was held constant. Two conditions of reading (continuous vs. normal) were compared in order to study the influence of brief pauses during reading {{that could be used for}} articulatory rehearsal. The results favor a version of the time-based resource-sharing model: A faster reading rate had a negative effect on recall. The effect of reading rate was obtained with continuous as well as normal reading, revealing that even continuous articulation does not prevent simultaneous <b>refreshing</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> traces. A second experiment showed that continuous reading made concurrent articulatory rehearsal virtually impossible. These findings imply that a second rehearsal mechanism for verbal working memory, other than articulatory rehearsal, exists...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} four experiments that tested predictions of SOB (Serial Order in a Box), an interference-based theory of short-term memory. Central to SOB {{is the concept}} of novelty-sensitive encoding, which holds that items are encoded {{to the extent that they}} differ from already-encoded information. On the additional assumption that distractors are encoded into memory in the same manner as list items, the theory predicts differential effects of interfering activity based on the similarity structure of distractors. Consistent with predictions, three experiments showed that overt articulation of distractors in between recalls of list items did not affect forgetting when the same distractor was repeated multiple times, whereas forgetting was observed if several different distractors were articulated within the same time span. A fourth experiment showed that the absence of forgetting with repeated articulations of the same item was not due to compensatory attentional <b>refreshing</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> traces. The data support the notion that forgetting from short-term memory arises from interference and are difficult to reconcile with temporal decay...|$|E

The buffer design uses a 1 T DRAM topology for its unit memory cell component, a sense amplifier, and two circular shift registers for implementing refresh and read-write pointers. The sense amplifier uses bit-line decoupling to improve readout performance. Our particular application requires the storage of 800 samples of a received ultrasound signal that pass through 48 channels consisting of a preamplifier, a sample-and-hold, and an 8 -bit ADC.

40|$|Abstract. The {{emergence}} of data-intensive applications in mobile en-vironments {{has resulted in}} portable electronic systems with increasingly large dynamic memories. The typical operating pattern exhibited by these applications is a relatively short burst of operations followed by longer periods of standby. Due to their periodic refresh requirements, dynamic memories consume substantial power even during standby and thus {{have a significant impact}} on battery lifetime. In this paper we investigate a methodology for designing dynamic mem-ory with low data-retention power. Our approach relies on the fact that the <b>refresh</b> period <b>of</b> a <b>memory</b> array is dictated by only a few, worst-case leaky cells. In our scheme, multiple refresh periods are used to reduce energy dissipation by selectively refreshing only the cells that are about to lose their stored values. Additional energy savings are achieved by using error-correction to restore corrupted cell values and thus allow for extended refresh periods. We describe an exact O(nk− 1) -time algorithm that, given a memory array with n refresh blocks and two positive in-tegers k and l, computes k refresh periods that maximize the average <b>refresh</b> period <b>of</b> a <b>memory</b> array when refreshing occurs in blocks of l cells. In simulations with 16 Mb memory arrays and a (72, 64) modified Hamming single-error correction code, our scheme results in an average <b>refresh</b> period <b>of</b> up to 11 times longer than the original refresh period. ...|$|R

Attempts have been made at producing GaAs DRAM cells, but these have dealt with modifications to the fabrication process, are expensive, and have met with little success. An eight-address by one-bit memory is designed, simulated, and laid out for a standard GaAs digital fabrication process. Three different configurations of RAM cells are considered: the Three-Transistor RAM Cell, the One-Transistor RAM Cell with a Diode and the One-Transistor RAM Cell with a capacitor. All are tested and compared using the circuit simulator HSPICE. The chosen DRAM design uses the One- Transistor RAM Cell with a parallel plate capacitor and a five-transistor differential sense amplifier that handles reading as well as <b>refresh</b> <b>of</b> the <b>memory</b> cells. The differential sense amplifier compares a dummy cell with a memory cell to perform a read. The required timing is presented and demonstrated with read, write, and refresh cycles. Actions to minimize charge leakage are also considered and discussed. The design is simulated for access rates of approximately five nanoseconds, but the basic design can work at much faster rates with little modification. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{regard the}} word-length effect (WLE) {{as one of}} the strongest pieces of evidence for timebased decay in short-term memory. We argue that the WLE is, in fact, undiagnostic for the decay hypothesis for two reasons. First, the WLE represents a correlation across words between articulation duration and memory performance, and articulation duration is inevitably confounded with other word characteristics. Recent research has confirmed that such confounds are responsible for much, maybe all, of the WLE. Second, there is strong evidence for an attentional mechanism <b>of</b> <b>refreshing</b> <b>memory</b> traces that can operate concurrently with articulation. Any viable decay-based model must include such a mechanism, but such a model no longer necessarily predicts a WLE, because longer spoken duration does not imply longer postponement <b>of</b> <b>refreshing.</b> We conclude that the WLE is not diagnostic for decay in short-term memory.

5000|$|The storage cells on {{a memory}} chip {{are laid out}} in a {{rectangular}} array of rows and columns. The read process in DRAM is destructive and removes the charge on the memory cells in an entire row, so there is a row of specialized latches on the chip called sense amplifiers, one for each column <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> cells, to temporarily hold the data. During a normal read operation, the sense amplifiers after reading and latching the data, rewrite the data in the accessed row before sending the bit from a single column to output. So the normal read electronics on the chip has the ability to refresh an entire row <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> in parallel, significantly speeding up the refresh process. A normal read or write cycle <b>refreshes</b> a row <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> but normal memory accesses cannot be relied on to hit all the rows within the necessary time, necessitating a separate refresh process. Rather than use the normal read cycle in the refresh process, to save time an abbreviated cycle called a refresh cycle is used.
