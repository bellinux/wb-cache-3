40|$|Optical mapping is an {{integrated}} {{system for the}} analysis of single DNA molecules. It constructs restriction maps (noted as “optical map”) from individual DNA molecules presented on surfaces after they are imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Because restriction digestion and fluorochrome staining are performed after molecules are mounted, resulting restriction fragments retain their order. Maps of fragment sizes and order are constructed by image processing techniques employing integrated fluorescence intensity measurements. Such analysis, in place of molecular length measurements, obviates need for uniformly elongated molecules, but requires samples containing small fluorescent <b>reference</b> <b>molecules</b> for accurate sizing. Although robust in practice, elimination of internal <b>reference</b> <b>molecules</b> would reduce errors and extend single molecule analysis to other platforms. In this paper, we introduce a new approach that does not use <b>reference</b> <b>molecules</b> for direct estimation of restriction fragment sizes, by the exploitation of the quantiles associated with their expected distribution.

The indications for the use of citrulline malate are functional asthenia, asthenic syndrome, overfatigue, increased fatigue, and rehabilitation during recovery following diseases. Objective: to simulate the biological properties of citrulline malate. Material and methods. Reliable estimates of more than 2, 500 biological activities were obtained for this molecule, which were compared with those of the <b>reference</b> <b>molecules</b> of acetylcarnitine and meldonium. Results and discussion. The data obtained from chemoreactome simulation may suggest that there are substantial differences between the pharmacological effects of citrulline malate and the <b>reference</b> <b>molecules.</b> Malate anion as a component of citrulline malate significantly enhances the absorption of citrulline molecules in the gastrointestinal tract regardless of gastric acidity. Citrulline malate improves renal bicarbonate anion absorption, which contributes to the overcoming of acidosis. The results of chemoreactome simulation indicate that citrulline malate has antidepressant, anxiolytic, and anti-inflammatory properties, which can make a substantial contribution to the development of anti-asthenic and detoxifying effects of the drug. Citrulline malate can also show anticoagulant, antivasopressor, hypoglycemic, antihypercholesterolemic, and antimicrobial effects. These properties of citrulline malate can contribute to the earliest recovery of patients after asthenia or intensive strenuous exercises as compared to those of the <b>reference</b> <b>molecules</b> (meldonium, acetylcarnitine). Conclusion. The findings are consistent with the available experimental and clinical data and are indicative of promising clinical applications of citrulline malate.  </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a new algorithm for multiple semi-flexible superpositioning of drug-sized molecules. The algorithm identifies structural similarities {{of two or}} more molecules. When comparing a set of molecules {{on the basis of their}} three-dimensional structures, one is faced with two main problems. (1) Molecular structures are not fixed but flexible, i. e., a molecule adopts different forms. To address this problem, we consider a set of conformers per molecule. As conformers we use representatives of conformational ensembles, generated by the program ZIBMol. (2) The degree of similarity may vary considerably among the molecules. This problem is addressed by searching for similar substructures present in arbitrary subsets of the given set of molecules. The algorithm requires to preselect a <b>reference</b> <b>molecule.</b> All molecules are compared to this <b>reference</b> <b>molecule.</b> For this pairwise comparison we use a two-step approach. Clique detection on the correspondence graph of the molecular structures is used to generate start transformations, which are then iteratively improved to compute large common substructures. The results of the pairwise comparisons are efficiently merged using binary matching trees. All common substructures that were found, whether they are common to all or only a few molecules, are ranked according to different criteria, such as number of molecules containing the substructure, size of substructure, and geometric fit. For evaluating the geometric fit, we extend a known scoring function by introducing weights which allow to favor potential pharmacophore points. Despite considering the full atomic information for identifying multiple structural similarities, our algorithm is quite fast. Thus it is well suited as an interactive tool for the exploration of structural similarities of drugsized molecules...|$|E
