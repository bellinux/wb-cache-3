40|$|Although {{transport}} of oxygen via the aerenchyma tissue and subsequent oxygen loss across root surfaces is well-documented for <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grasses,</b> only {{few studies have}} measured the oxygenation of sediment surrounding roots and rhizomes. In this study, sediment oxygenation was assessed in situ in rhizospheres of the intertidal <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grass,</b> Spartina anglica - an invading species, vigorously spreading in many wetlands around the world. The rhizospheres of two populations of S. anglica with differing plant morphology growing in different sediment types were investigated in situ using a novel multifiber optode system with 100 oxygen probes. No oxygen was detected inside the rhizospheres at any depth in either location, indicating a limited impact of plant-mediated sediment oxygenation on the bulk anoxic sediment. Subsequent planar optode studies imaging the oxygen content around the roots substantiated these findings showing that sediment oxygenation was present in both locations, but it was confined only to the immediate vicinity of the root tips. The size of the oxic zones surrounding the root tips differed between sediment-types: in S. anglica growing in permeable sandy sediment, oxic root zones extended 1. 5 mm away from the roots surface compared to only 0. 4 mm in muddy tidal flat deposit, which had a substantially higher oxygen demand. The oxygen concentration inside the oxic root zones remained stable during continuous light and air-exposure of the aboveground biomass. In comparison, sediment oxygenation generated by burrowing infauna (Hediste diversicolor) showed to be markedly more temporally variability, reaching anoxic conditions multiple times during a 5 -h period...|$|R

40|$|The <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grass</b> Spartina anglica is an {{important}} habitat-modifying ecosystem engineering agent that facilitates large-scale <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> formation by enhancing sediment accretion. It dominates many European tidal environments and is invasive in {{many other parts of}} the world. We question (1) to what extent the ecosystem engineering ability of patchy Spartina vegetation depends on large-scale abiotic processes, and (2) whether tussock shape provides an indicator for future lateral <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> development. Analysing the topography of 83 individual tussocks in contrasting environments revealed that there are 6 clearly distinguishable tussock shapes, and that the classical example of a sediment-accumulating dome-shaped tussock only occurs under a limited set of abiotic conditions. The outcome of habitat modification by S. anglica is shown to be conditional, depending on large-scale morphodynamics and sediment grain size. Resulting tussock shape provides a clear indication for the long-term development of the pioneer zone. Understanding of the conditional outcome of ecosystem engineering is highly relevant in this era of climate change and ongoing anthropogenic influences on coastal ecosystems. ...|$|R

40|$|Prawn {{fisheries}} {{are among}} the main sources of income in several tropical countries, where juveniles of many species inhabit estuarine wetlands. Although plants in these wetlands {{are considered to be}} essential food sources for juvenile prawns, some studies suggest that wetland producers are of limited importance. In the present study, δ 13 C and δ 15 N were used to identify differences in diet between penaeid species and size classes, and to determine if terrestrial wetland producers are important for nutrition. Two estuarine floodplain pools were sampled: one surrounded by mangroves and one surrounded by <b>salt</b> <b>marsh.</b> There were differences in diet between species and size classes. As mangrove δ 13 C (− 29. 7 to − 26. 3 ‰) was very different from <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> δ 13 C (− 16. 3 to − 15. 4 ‰), the importance of these producers was examined by comparing the isotopic composition of the prawns between sites and by using the IsoSource model. Although aquatic sources were the most important, <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grass</b> was also a significant contributor, supporting the hypothesis that these wetland producers are important for juvenile prawn nutrition.

Although marine bacterioplankton used the lignin-rich humic substances more slowly and less efficiently than other components of the DOC pool, a significant fraction (24 %) of these substances was mineralized within 7 weeks. Concentrations of vascular plant biomarkers (lignin phenols) indicate that 1 l- 75 % of the dissolved humic substances on the southeastern U.

Calculations indicate that about half this material is contributed by the coastal <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> and half by river export.

Sequence analysis of 149 pcaH clones revealed 85 unique sequences. Thirteen of the 53 amino acid residues compared were invariant in the PcaH proteins, suggesting that these residues have a required catalytic or structural function. Fifty-eight percent of the clones matched sequences amplified from a collection of 36 bacterial isolates obtained from seawater, marine sediments, or senescent Spartina. Fifty-two percent of the pcaH clones could be assigned to the roseobacter group, a marine lineage of the class α-Proteobacteria abundant in coastal ecosystems. Another 6 % of the clones matched genes retrieved from isolates belonging to the genera Acinetobacter, Bacillus, and Stappia, and 42 % of the clones could not be assigned to a cultured bacterium based on sequence identity.

A 2. 81 m core was retrieved from JoCo, a high marsh area located {{on the eastern side}} of Jamaica Bay. The lithology of the core differs from high levels of sand, with small amounts of clay, in the bottom 0. 8 meters, to <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> peat in the upper 2 meters of the core. Basal wood in the sand was dated to about 2060 yr BP. Elphidium foraminifera dominate the basal sands, along with Scirpus seeds, wood, and charcoal.

40|$|Common {{preliminary}} {{treatments of}} samples of decaying material can involve changes in water content (e. g., via storage in relatively dry air or rinsing) that could conceivably result in loss or gain of fungal membranes and, consequently, ergosterol. A related {{problem is that}} collecting of ergosterol content data from widely distributed locales by shipment of samples ideally requires an inexpensive, safe alternative to submerging the samples in methanol for prevention of ergosterol loss. Experimental testing showed that fungal occupants of decaying <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grass</b> leaves did not exhibit loss or gain of ergosterol during air drying (to a water potential of <- 8 MPa) or rewetting (to - 0. 8 MPa). Wet leaves of one grass species (Juncus roemerianus, black needlerush) could be fixed and dried for shipment by microwaving, or by fully drying after alcoholic or pentane fixation, without ergosterol loss, but those of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) lost about 40 % of their ergosterol content by {{all three of these}} drying methods.

40|$|Dynamic {{transformations of}} iron occur {{seasonally}} at Great Sippewissett Marsh, Massachusetts. Small {{changes in the}} dissolved iron concentration in porewater represent {{only a small fraction}} of the iron involved in transformation reactions during the year. During the growing season, <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grasses</b> oxidize the sediment, and a large percentage of sedimentary pyrite is converted to an oxidized iron mineral [...] Over the fall and winter there is a net increase in pyrite as the grass is anaerobically decomposed. When oxidation rates in summer are high enough to neutralize the alkalinity produced by sulfate reduction and substantially lower the pH, oxidized iron minerals become increasingly soluble and iron levels in the porewater increase. If large amounts of soluble iron are lost by tidal flushing, iron availability may limit pyrite formation in later years. Sulfide concentrations in the porewater would then increase, leading to depressed growth of Spartina alternijlora. For most of the year the porewaters of Great Sippewissett were undersaturated with respect to all iron monosulfide minerals and supersaturated with respect to pyrite (Fe!!&). Thus pyrite formation at Great Sippewissett probably occurs directly by reaction of polysulfides with iron and not b...|$|R

The DMSP synthesis pathway was therefore investigated in the <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grass</b> Spartina alterniflora Loisel. Leaf tissue metabolized supplied [35 S]methionine (Met) to S-methyl-l-Met (SMM), 3 -dimethylsulfoniopropylamine (DMSP-amine), and DMSP. The 35 S-labeling kinetics of SMM and DMSP-amine {{indicated that they were}} intermediates and, consistent with this, the dimethylsulfonium moiety of SMM was shown by stable isotope labeling to be incorporated as a unit into DMSP. The identity of DMSP-amine, a novel natural product, was confirmed by both chemical and mass-spectral methods. S. alterniflora readily converted supplied [35 S]SMM to DMSP-amine and DMSP, and also readily converted supplied [35 S]DMSP-amine to DMSP; grasses that lack DMSP did neither. A small amount of label was detected in 3 -dimethylsulfoniopropionaldehyde (DMSP-ald) when [35 S]SMM or [35 S]DMSP-amine was given. These results are consistent with the operation of the pathway Met → SMM → DMSP-amine → DMSP-ald → DMSP, which differs from that found in Compositae by the presence of a free DMSP-amine intermediate. This dissimilarity suggests that DMSP synthesis evolved independently in Gramineae and Compositae...|$|R
40|$|Silicon (Si) plays a {{critical}} role in plant functional ecology, protecting plants from multiple environmental stressors. While all terrestrial plants contain some Si, wetland grasses are frequently found to have the highest concentrations, although the mechanisms driving Si accumulation in wetland grasses remain in large part uncertain. For example, active Si accumulation is often assumed to be responsible for elevated Si concentrations found in wetland grasses. However, life stage and differences in Si availability in the surrounding environment also appear to be important variables controlling the Si concentrations of wetland grasses. Here we used original data from five North American <b>salt</b> <b>marshes,</b> as well as all known published literature values, to examine the primary drivers of Si accumulation in Spartina, a genus of prolific <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grasses</b> found worldwide. We found evidence of multiple modes of Si accumulation in Spartina, with passive accumulation observed in non-degraded marshes where Spartina was native, while rejective accumulation was found in regions where Spartina was invasive. Evidence of active accumulation was found in only one marsh where Spartina was native, but was also subjected to nutrient over-enrichment. We developed a conceptual model which hypothesizes that the mode of Si uptake by Spartina is dependent on local environmental factors and genetic origin, supporting the idea that plant species should be placed along a spectrum of Si accumulation. We hypothesize that Spartina exhibits previously unrecognized phenotypic plasticity with regard to Si accumulation, allowing these plants to respond to changes in marsh condition. These results provide new insight regarding how <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> ecosystems regulate Si exchange at the land-sea interface...|$|R
40|$|Rhizosphere diazotroph assemblages of <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grasses</b> {{are thought}} to be {{influenced}} by host plant species and by a number of porewater geochemical parameters. Several geochemical variables can adversely affect plant productivity and spatial distributions, resulting in strong zonation of plant species and growth forms. This geochemically induced stress may also influence the species compositions and distributions of rhizosphere diazotroph assemblages, but little is currently known about these organisms. The diversity and key physiological features of culturable, O 2 -tolerant rhizosphere diazotrophs associated with the tall and short growth forms of Spartina alterniflora and with Juncus roemerianus were examined. A total of 339 gram-negative strains were isolated by a root stab culture approach and morphologically and physiologically characterized by using API and BIOLOG tests. Eighty-six distinct groups composed of physiologically similar strains were identified. Of these groups, 72 % were shown to be capable of N 2 fixation through molecular analyses, and a representative strain was chosen from each diazotroph group for further characterization. Cluster and principal-components analysis of BIOLOG data allowed the designation of physiologically distinct strain groupings. Most of these groups were dominated by strains that were not identifiable to species on the basis of API or BIOLOG testing. Representatives of several families including the Enterobacteriaceae, Vibrionaceae, Azotobacteraceae, Spirillaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Rhizobiaceae were recovered, as well as strains with no clear taxonomic affiliations.

In this study, we measured leaf gas exchange in a multifactorial greenhouse experiment with and without mycorrhizal fungal additions and under ﬁeld conditions in Distichlis spicata, a dioecious C 4 <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grass,</b> displaying extreme spatial sex ratio variation. Pivotal results. We found a signiﬁcant interaction between gas exchange, plant sex, and mycorrhizal fungal infection. Speciﬁcally, females but not males had signiﬁcantly lower transpiration rates and higher water use efﬁciency (WUE) in treatments with increased mycorrhizal fungi. Additionally, ﬁeld data showed similar WUE between plants at female-majority sites and male-majority sites, despite signiﬁcantly lower rates of net assimi- lation and stomatal conductance in plants at female-majority sites. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the higher WUE associated with increased mycorrhizal fungi in female D. spicata plants may be an important physiological attribute enabling female success in the higher-stress salt- water environment contributing to the spatial segregation of the sexes observed in this dioecious species...|$|R
