5|$|The region's climate {{has been}} dry since the Tertiary. The area around Licancabur is {{dominated}} by year-round high pressure caused by the South Pacific High, giving it a very sunny climate. Because {{of the lack of}} moisture, solar <b>radiation</b> <b>energy</b> is dissipated primarily by wind. In the Llano de Chajnantor area, wind generally reaches its maximum strength during the day. Its prevailing direction is from the west, except in summer when winds are more variable. Because of the area's tropical location (where the ozone layer is thinner) and high altitude, it receives a large amount of ultraviolet radiation. The world's highest level of ultraviolet radiation was reported from Licancabur, although the high irradiation might have caused measurement artifacts.|$|E

25|$|The {{magnitude}} of the energy of cosmic ray flux in interstellar space is very {{comparable to that of}} other deep space energies: cosmic ray energy density averages about one electron-volt per cubic centimeter of interstellar space, or ~1eV/cm3, which is comparable to the energy density of visible starlight at 0.3eV/cm3, the galactic magnetic field energy density (assumed 3 microgauss) which is ~0.25eV/cm3, or the cosmic microwave background (CMB) <b>radiation</b> <b>energy</b> density at ~ 0.25eV/cm3.|$|E

25|$|For air bursts {{at or near}} sea-level, 50–60% of the explosion's energy {{goes into}} the blast wave, {{depending}} on the size and the yield of the bomb. As a general rule, the blast fraction is higher for low yield weapons. Furthermore, it decreases at high altitudes because there is less air mass to absorb <b>radiation</b> <b>energy</b> and convert it into blast. This effect is most important for altitudes above 30km, corresponding to less than 1 percent of sea-level air density.|$|E
25|$|For the Moiré pattern {{configuration}} the {{constraint on}} the <b>radiation</b> <b>energy</b> {{is a bit}} stricter, because a finite bandwidth of energy instead of monochromatic radiation causes {{a decrease in the}} visibility of the Moiré fringes and thus the image quality, but a moderate polychromaticity is still allowed. A great advantage of the usage of polychromatic radiation is the shortening of the exposure times and this has recently been exploited by using white synchrotron radiation to realize the first dynamic (time-resolved) Phase contrast tomography.|$|E

25|$|A common {{photonic}} crystal nanocavity design shown {{is essentially a}} {{photonic crystal}} with an intentional defect (holes missing). This structure having periodic changes in refractive index {{on the order of}} the length of the optical wavelength satisfies Bragg reflection conditions in the y and z directions for a particular wavelength range, and the slab boundaries in the x direction create another reflective boundary due to oblique reflection at dielectric boundaries. This results in theoretically perfect wave confinement in the y and z directions along the axis of a lattice row, and good confinement along the x direction. Since this confinement effect along the y and z directions (directions of the crystal lattice) is only for a range of frequencies, it has been referred to as a photonic bandgap, since there is a discrete set of photon energies which cannot propagate in the lattice directions in the material. However, because of the diffraction of waves propagating inside this structure, <b>radiation</b> <b>energy</b> does escape the cavity within the photonic crystal slab plane. The lattice spacing can be tuned to produce optimal boundary conditions of the standing wave inside the cavity to produce minimal loss and highest Q.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} magnetic field (...) the optical absorption spectrum (3) of the polaron at weak coupling is determined by the absorption of <b>radiation</b> <b>energy,</b> which is reemitted in the form of LO phonons. At larger coupling, , the polaron can undergo transitions toward a relatively stable internal excited state called the [...] "relaxed excited state" [...] (RES) (see Fig. 2). The RES peak in the spectrum also has a phonon sideband, which is related to a Franck-Condon-type transition.|$|E
2500|$|Gamma rays {{from the}} nuclear {{processes}} preceding the true explosion may be partially {{responsible for the}} following fireball, as they may superheat nearby air and/or other material. The {{vast majority of the}} energy that goes on to form the fireball is in the soft X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum, with these X-rays being produced by the inelastic collisions of the high speed fission and fusion products. [...] It is these reaction products and not the gamma rays which contain most of the energy of the nuclear reactions in the form of kinetic energy. [...] This kinetic energy of the fission and fusion fragments is converted into internal and then <b>radiation</b> <b>energy</b> by approximately following the process of blackbody radiation emitting in the soft X-ray region. As a result of numerous inelastic collisions, part of the kinetic energy of the fission fragments is converted into internal and <b>radiation</b> <b>energy.</b> Some of the electrons are removed entirely from the atoms, thus causing ionization, others are raised to higher energy (or excited) states while still remaining attached to the nuclei. Within an extremely short time, perhaps a hundredth of a microsecond or so, the weapon residues consist essentially of completely and partially stripped (ionized) atoms, many of the latter being in excited states, together with the corresponding free electrons. The system then immediately emits electromagnetic (thermal) radiation, the nature of which is determined by the temperature. Since this is of the order of 107 degrees, most of the energy emitted within a microsecond or so is in the soft X-ray region. To understand this one must remember that temperature depends on the average internal energy/heat of the particles in a certain volume, and internal energy or heat is due to kinetic energy.|$|E

50|$|Kerma ("kinetic energy {{released}} {{per unit}} mass") {{is a measure}} of the liberated energy of ionisation due to irradiation, and is expressed in grays. Importantly, kerma dose is different from absorbed dose, depending on the <b>radiation</b> <b>energies</b> involved, partially because ionization energy is not accounted for. Whilst roughly equal at low energies, kerma is much higher than absorbed dose at higher energies, because some energy escapes from the absorbing volume in the form of bremsstrahlung (X-rays) or fast-moving electrons.|$|R

2500|$|The color {{temperature}} of the ensemble of decoupled photons has continued to diminish ever since; now down to , {{it will continue to}} drop as the universe expands. The intensity of the radiation also corresponds to black-body radiation at 2.726K because red-shifted black-body radiation is just like black-body radiation at a lower temperature. According to the Big Bang model, the radiation from the sky we measure today comes from a spherical surface called the surface of last scattering. This represents the set of locations in space at which the decoupling event is estimated to have occurred and at a point in time such that the photons from that distance have just reached observers. Most of the <b>radiation</b> <b>energy</b> in the universe is in the cosmic microwave background, making up a fraction of roughly [...] of the total density of the universe.|$|E

The work identified the key physics, engineering, and technology issues {{that need to}} be solved if inertial fusion is to become a practical energy source. [...] Among the many ideas advanced at that time was the use of a low-pressure gas in the chamber to absorb the primary radiation burst that accompanies each micro-explosion (not the neutrons generated) and cause that very short burst of <b>radiation</b> <b>energy</b> to be re-radiated to the walls over a much longer time scale. The SOLASE program studied numerous technological challenges, ranging from delivering fuel pellets {{to the center of the}} device at a rate of one to five per second, capturing the energy from the fusion events, shielding the laser beams from pellet explosion debris, and capturing the neutrons that carry 80 percent of the energy so as to make a practical power system.|$|E

2500|$|The Zn-world (zinc world) {{theory of}} Armen Y. Mulkidjanian is an {{extension}} of Wächtershäuser's pyrite hypothesis. Wächtershäuser based his theory of the initial chemical processes leading to informational molecules (RNA, peptides) on a regular mesh of electric charges at the surface of pyrite that may have facilitated the primeval polymerization by attracting reactants and arranging them appropriately relative to each other. The Zn-world theory specifies and differentiates further. Hydrothermal fluids rich in H2S interacting with cold primordial ocean (or Darwin's [...] "warm little pond") water leads to the precipitation of metal sulfide particles. Oceanic vent systems and other hydrothermal systems have a zonal structure reflected in ancient volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits (VMS) of hydrothermal origin. They reach many kilometres in diameter and date back to the Archean Eon. Most abundant are pyrite (FeS2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), and sphalerite (ZnS), with additions of galena (PbS) and alabandite (MnS). ZnS and MnS have a unique ability to store <b>radiation</b> <b>energy,</b> e.g. from UV light. During the relevant time window of the origins of replicating molecules, the primordial atmospheric pressure was high enough (>100bar, about 100 atmospheres) to precipitate near the Earth's surface, and UV irradiation was 10 to 100 times more intense than now; hence the unique photosynthetic properties mediated by ZnS provided just the right energy conditions to energize the synthesis of informational and metabolic molecules and the selection of photostable nucleobases.|$|E
