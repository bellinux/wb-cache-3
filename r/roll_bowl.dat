2500|$|Ten-pin bowling is a {{sport in}} which a player (called a [...] "bowler") <b>rolls</b> a <b>bowling</b> ball down a wood-structure or {{synthetic}} (polyurethane) lane and towards ten pins positioned {{at the end of}} the lane. The objective is to score the highest pinfall by knocking down as many pins as possible. Three finger holes are drilled into a traditional bowling ball, and weights vary considerably to make the sport playable for all ages. Generally, the heavier the ball, the more pins that will topple on two equivalent shots. The pins are arranged in a triangular position by an automated machine. While professional ten-pin bowling tournaments are held in numerous countries, the sport is commonly played as a hobby by millions of people around the world.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a strong}} product placement, Lethal {{alongside}} Sonjay Dutt, got fellow X Division superstar Chris Sabin ready for his match at No Surrender by watching clips of Jackass Number Two, which was being heavily promoted by TNA at the time. One night on Impact!, during Chris Sabin's match with Alex Shelley, Shelley's partner Johnny Devine was pushed {{in a shopping}} cart and rammed into the steel post, allowing Sabin to pin Shelley. The following week, Lethal was able to defeat Petey Williams after Sabin and Dutt distracted the referee, allowing Lethal to <b>roll</b> a <b>bowling</b> ball into Petey's groin. Following in this storyline, Lethal went on to defeat Williams again on September 24, 2006, at the No Surrender pay-per-view, following Williams allegedly being given laxatives by stable mate Dutt, rendering him incapable of doing most of his moves, and giving Lethal the victory when Williams could no longer [...] "hold it". He and Dutt were also involved in Sabin's match later in the night with similar antics involving a blow-up doll, {{but to no avail}} as Sabin would lose the match despite the interference. These, too, were designed as advertising for Jackass Number Two, as were other moments for Mortal Kombat: Armageddon.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{is usually}} {{played on a}} large, rectangular, {{precisely}} levelled and manicured grass or synthetic surface known as a bowling green, but an indoor variation on carpet is also played. In the simplest competition, singles, {{one of the two}} opponents begins a segment of the competition (in bowling parlance, an [...] "end"), by placing the mat and rolling the jack {{to the other end of}} the green as a target. Once it has come to rest, the players take turns to <b>roll</b> their <b>bowls</b> from the mat towards the jack and thereby build up the [...] "head". Bowls reaching the ditch are dead and removed from play, except in the event when one has [...] "touched" [...] the jack on its way. [...] "Touchers" [...] are marked with chalk and remain alive in play even though they are in the ditch. Similarly if the jack is knocked into the ditch it is still alive unless it is out of bounds to the side resulting in a [...] "dead" [...] end which is replayed. After each competitor has delivered all of their bowls (four each in singles), the distance of the closest bowls to the jack is determined (the jack may have been displaced) and points are awarded for each bowl which a competitor has closer than the opponent's nearest to the jack. For instance, if a competitor has bowled two bowls closer to the jack than their competitor's nearest, they are awarded two points. The exercise is then repeated for the next end.|$|R
