5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an element of shared attention. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object. Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant. Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face. If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E

Mulder believes that Max was abducted from the plane and that his body will not be found. Meanwhile, Scott Garrett, a Man in Black posing as an NTSB investigator, steals the zip gun from the assassin's body and erases his face and fingerprints with acid. Larold Rehbun, a passenger who sat next to Max, is found alive. His injuries indicate exposure to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a {{price to be paid}} for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E

5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an element of shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason that}} the Zariski {{topology}} does not work well {{is that it is}} too coarse: it has too few open sets. There seems to be no good way to fix this by using a finer topology on a general algebraic variety. Grothendieck's key insight was to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no reason why the more general open sets should be subsets of the algebraic variety: the definition of a sheaf works perfectly well for any category, not just the category of open subsets of a space. He defined étale cohomology by replacing the category of open subsets of a space by the category of étale mappings to a space: roughly speaking, these {{can be thought of as}} open subsets of finite unbranched covers of the space. These turn out (after a lot of work) to give just enough extra open sets that one can get reasonable cohomology groups for some constant coefficients, in particular for coefficients Z/nZ when n is coprime to the characteristic of the field one is working over.|$|E

500|$|Series writer Brian Peterson {{discusses}} how {{the writing}} staff chose {{to develop the}} character: [...] "In the Smallville pilot, Al and Miles established Lex and Clark as best friends, which is, to me, {{one of the best}} aspects of the show. So when you're introducing his future love interest, why not introduce her, not as an enemy, but as the one who is constantly going to butt heads with him, where they're not gonna like each other at all at first? I think that because we chose such a different take on her, it wasn't that intimidating. She could grow into the person that everybody sees on-screen later." [...] For season six, the writers chose to start Lois down the path of investigative journalism, only in this version of the character she gets her start working for a tabloid newspaper. Writer Kelly Souders felt that if tabloid beginnings were good enough for Perry White—an additional character established in season three's [...] "Perry"—then they are good enough for Lois Lane. It adds depth to the character by showing how she struggled before becoming [...] "the reporter we all know and love". As Lois steps closer to her ultimate destiny at the Daily Planet, the writers have continued to evolve the character by having her grow out of the [...] "black and white" [...] mindset and have her begin seeing shades of gray. The writers wanted the character to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> sometimes a middle road that has to be taken. In season eight, Durance sees Clark taking a job at the Daily Planet as a chance for her character to [...] "step it up and be more involved". In this case, Lois is acting more mature, taking charge in being a mentor to Clark as he transitions into his new job. Durance describes the eighth season as a lesson in duality, with Clark realizing that he has to be two different people if he wants to have a life and save the day; Durance believes that the same applies to Lois. As Durance explains, [...] " [...] got her confidence as a journalist and on the inside, she's going oh my god I'm truly in love with , more in love than I've ever been with anyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but {{you may have a}} little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it {{to the best of your}} ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, you have to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E

2500|$|Closely {{linked with}} the former is Bitul ha-Yesh, [...] "Negation of the Existent", or of the [...] "Corporeal". Hasidism teaches that while a {{superficial}} observance of the universe by the [...] "eyes of the flesh" [...] (Einei ha-Basar) purportedly reflects the reality of all things profane and worldly, a true devotee must transcend this illusory façade and <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing but God. It {{is not only a}} matter of perception, but very practical, for it entails also abandoning material concerns and cleaving only to the true, spiritual ones, oblivious to the surrounding false distractions of life. The practitioner's success in detaching from his sense of person, and conceive himself as Ein (in the double meaning of 'naught' and 'infinite'), is regarded as the highest state of elation in Hasidism. The true divine essence of man – the soul – may then ascend and return to the upper realm, where it does not possess an existence independent from God. This ideal is termed Hitpashtut ha-Gashmi'yut, [...] "the expansion (or removal) of corporeality". It is the dialectic opposite of God's contraction into the world.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{controversy}} about Lindner’s remarks his lawyer sent a routine legal request for discovery to Rep. Neva Walker, an African-American DFL member from Minneapolis. The letter was addressed to her as “Walker-Black”. Walker had never been married, didn’t use a hyphenated name, and had never had the last name Black. It appeared as if someone forgot to remove the race notation before signing and sending out that letter. James Anderson, Lindner's lawyer, apologized to Walker saying it was a [...] "simple mistake. [...] I {{can tell you that the}} person typing the letter apparently looked at the file and put the words together wrong [...]” Walker said [...] "I do believe it was an accident and somebody forgot to erase it. ...I am an elected official and I deserve respect, and that misprint is a lack of respect." [...] The lawyer said [...] "Basically, it's a tempest in a teapot," [...] he said, adding that [...] "some people are just hypersensitive if from a simple mistake they can call someone a racist." [...] Walker responded, [...] "It's easy to say that when you're not on the receiving of a racist comment, but racist attacks are emotionally and mentally draining. And I am far from sensitive. It takes a lot to offend me. ...Folks who are so focused on this issue don't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a pattern with this particular representative." ...|$|E

The Barnetts catch what appear to be three black burglars, as Melvin and R.W. are wearing stocking masks over their faces.

[...] Voris discussed his upbringing and the story of how he returned to Catholicism. He also challenged the label of far-right or hate group.

2500|$|Passionate {{about the}} art of winemaking, in 1981 Baron moved to the Bordeaux region of France to gain {{experience}} {{in one of the}} world's finest wine producing regions. He was involved in the production of two vintages in various chateaus, gaining a valuable insight into its history and in cultivating top-notch wines, changing his perception of winemaking. While in France, Daniel was hired at the legendary Chateau Petrus where he met owner Christian Moueix, winemaker Jean-Claude Berrouet, and cellarmaster Jean Veyssiere and his son Francois, who he credits with providing him detailed knowledge into the history of viticulture and the business of winemaking. Baron has said that they [...] "taught me about wine as a part of culture and how history, quality and tradition are intertwined with the practical aspects of winemaking." [...] Moueix {{is considered to be a}} major winemaker of the Bordeaux region of France. After a successful harvest at Chateau Petrus in 1982, Moueix established a new winery, Dominus Estate, in the Napa Valley, and asked Baron to manage the facility; he worked there until 1994. In 1994, Baron met co-founder of Silver Oak Cellars, Justin Meyer, after seeing a quirky classified ad in the newspaper Wine Country. Meyer soon began training Baron as his eventual successor, and Baron was ultimately appointed Silver Oak winemaker in 1994. Baron said of Meyer, [...] "Justin instilled in me both pride in what Silver Oak had accomplished and the humility to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> always room to improve. He constantly searched for ways to raise quality, and that’s become one of our core values at Silver Oak. Baron quickly became successful; Meyer considered the 1995 variety to be the best of the 1990s, and noted wine critic Robert M. Parker was also impressed with Silver Oak’s 1997 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.|$|E
