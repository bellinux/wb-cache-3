40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original non-rigid image <b>registration</b> approach, {{which tends to}} improve the <b>registration</b> by establishing a symmetric image interdependence.

40|$|In {{this article}} a {{comprehensive}} set of <b>registration</b> methods is utilized to provide image-to-physical space <b>registration</b> for image-guided neurosurgery {{in a clinical}} study.

The objective is to perform a systematic comparison of <b>registration</b> methods that include both extracranial (skin marker point-based <b>registration</b> (PBR), and face-based surface <b>registration)</b> and intracranial methods (feature PBR, cortical vessel-contour <b>registration,</b> a combined geometry∕intensity surface <b>registration</b> method, and a constrained form of that method to improve robustness). The platform facilitates the selection of discrete soft-tissue landmarks that appear on the patient’s intraoperative cortical surface and the preoperative gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) image volume, i. e., true corresponding novel targets. In an 11 patient study, data were taken to allow statistical comparison among <b>registration</b> methods within the context of <b>registration</b> error. The results indicate that intraoperative face-based surface <b>registration</b> is statistically equivalent to traditional skin marker <b>registration.</b> The four intracranial <b>registration</b> methods were investigated and the results demonstrated a target <b>registration</b> error of 1. 6 ± 0. 5 mm, 1. 7 ± 0. 5 mm, 3. 9 ± 3. 4 mm, and 2. 0 ± 0. 9 mm, for feature PBR, cortical vessel-contour <b>registration,</b> unconstrained geometric∕intensity <b>registration,</b> and constrained geometric∕intensity <b>registration,</b> respectively.

30|$|<b>Registration</b> {{methods can}} be roughly {{classified}} {{into three categories}} according to the DOF of their transformation models. Rigid <b>registration</b> has a DOF of 6 and allows for global translations and rotations. Affine <b>registration,</b> i.e., linear <b>registration,</b> allows for translation, rotation, scaling and skew of the images. Rigid and affine <b>registration</b> methods are usually sufficient for registering the multimodal datasets of same subject. However, deformable <b>registration,</b> which supports local deformations, is frequently needed to register images with large differences, e.g., registering an image to a template, or registering pre- and post-contrast images of the same subject. Deformable <b>registration</b> always requires rigid or affine <b>registration</b> to obtain a rough initial alignment. In many multimodal studies, {{a combination of these}} <b>registration</b> methods were used. For example, we recently jointly analyzed the ADNI FDG-PET and T 1 -weighted MRI datasets to classify AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients [79]. The PET images were aligned to MRI using an affine <b>registration</b> method (FSL FLIRT) [120]. The MRI datasets were registered to the MNI template using a deformable method (IRTK) [121], and the output <b>registration</b> coefficients by IRTK were applied to register the PET images to the same template. There are many other widely used <b>registration</b> algorithms, such as B-Spline <b>registration</b> [119, 122], Demons [123], and SyN [124], and ITK [54] <b>registration</b> framework is a standard-bearer for all of these popular <b>registration</b> methods.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{clinical}} relevance of a slice-to-volume <b>registration</b> algorithm, this technique was compared to manual <b>registration.</b> Reformatted images obtained from a diagnostic CT examination of the lower abdomen were reviewed and manually registered by 41 individuals. The results were refined by the algorithm. Furthermore, a fully automatic <b>registration</b> of the single slices to the whole CT examination, without manual initialization, was also performed. The manual <b>registration</b> error for rotation and translation {{was found to be}} 2. 7 +/- 2. 8 degrees and 4. 0 +/- 2. 5 mm. The automated <b>registration</b> algorithm significantly reduced the <b>registration</b> error to 1. 6 +/- 2. 6 degrees and 1. 3 +/- 1. 6 mm (p = 0. 01). In 3 of 41 (7. 3 %) <b>registration</b> cases, the automated <b>registration</b> algorithm failed completely.

Here, a <b>registration</b> took 91 +/- 6 s, on average.
