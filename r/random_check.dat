5|$|Hamilton {{completed}} the second Grand Slam {{of his career}} by winning the race, taking pole position, setting the fastest lap and leading every lap of the race. He finished 25 seconds ahead of Vettel, while Felipe Massa finished third for Williams. Rosberg retired with three laps to go due to an engine failure, resulting in Hamilton extending his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 53 points. Hamilton's victory was confirmed {{a few hours after}} the race following an investigation from race stewards after it was discovered that the left-rear tyre on his Mercedes was below Pirelli's recommended minimum tyre pressure standards in a <b>random</b> <b>check</b> but due to procedural inconsistencies, no sanctions were imposed against either Mercedes driver or the team.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was {{forfeited}} {{after he was}} caught with an electronic device in a <b>random</b> <b>check</b> conducted prior to leaving the venue. The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in {{a change in the}} match score. Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did not bother to check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating per se, Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment. The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanović later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar Čolooviḱ.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the police}} report, {{initially}} the suspects were 12 men, Greeks and foreigners, who either worked by the beach and the crime scene or had been seen by witnesses in the area. As the investigation continued, the suspects were narrowed to four and police concluded, {{with the help of}} several eyewitnesses, that the suspect was a man who worked by the crime scene. Specifically the mother of the teenage girl reported that she saw a man, wearing white trousers and a colorful shirt, walking away from the crime scene.

50|$|Section 14: The Wine - {{symbol of}} {{decadence}} and defiance After the border towns, Tehran itself became a target and {{the basement of}} Marji’s building {{was turned into a}} bomb shelter. This was part of an anxious new way of life for Marji’s family, where they routinely went to the basement with every siren that announced an air raid, followed by calling all their loved ones to ensure everyone was well. They lived in fear of being caught and punished for indulging in decadent (Western) behaviour, like playing cards, or chess, listening to music or watching videos and drinking alcohol. Nonetheless, having weekly parties or card games with wine expertly and secretly made by Marji’s uncle, was their only way to alleviate the stress of their new lives and a way to privately revolt against the new regime. On their way home from a celebration, Marji’s family is stopped by some very young Guardians of the Revolution, at one of their <b>random</b> <b>check</b> points. The Guardians threaten to punish Marji’s father (suspected of drinking and for wearing a necktie - symbol of Western decadence) and to search their house for more banned items, but her parents successfully convince them to forget the idea with a few sympathetic words and a small bribe while Marji and her grandmother needlessly destroy their entire stash of wine.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{states now}} use {{electronic}} bypass systems (or AVI - Automatic Vehicle Identification) to alleviate {{some of the}} truck traffic through the weigh station. Some {{of the best known}} are PrePass, NORPASS and Drivewyze. The system may consist of equipment at the weigh station itself, as well as a truck mounted transponder or smartphone, usually placed {{on the inside of the}} windshield or on the dashboard. These are similar to transponders used for toll collection. Each transponder is directly registered to a specific truck, and contains a unique identification. The registration process propagates information such as carrier name, unit number, and elected gross weight to weigh stations. In addition, the system keeps a basic safety and compliance record for each vehicle. As a truck approaches a weigh station (approximately one mile before), an electronic [...] "reader" [...] on a boom over the freeway reads the information from the truck transponder. It also looks at the safety and compliance record on the database. A display shows the results to the weigh master, including the speed of the vehicle. The weigh master may have the system automatically determine if a truck needs to stop or may override the system. Approximately one-half to one full mile after passing under the [...] "reader", the truck will pass under another boom which has an electronic unit to send the transponder a signal. If the safety information is acceptable the truck may receive a green light and can continue without entering the weigh station at all. There are weight detecting devices in the roadway itself. A driver may get a red light. On these occasions, the truck must pull into the weigh station for the normal weigh-in procedure. The most common reason a truck is [...] "redlighted" [...] is a weight problem, or a <b>random</b> <b>check.</b> Each time a truck is randomly pulled in, it is noted in the system whether the driver was compliant or not during the check. This affects how often a truck (or different trucks from the same company) are pulled in. For example, a company which is very compliant with the law will probably only have 5% of its trucks [...] "redlighted." ...|$|E

Single excercises at the traning have been chosen under authority of the literature, the consultations and my personal experience. Results: The athletic jumping training is effective for the developement of the bouncing skills of handball players. The probands of the experimental group reached within the tracking period considerable improvement in most of the excercises.

30|$|We only {{performed}} a <b>random</b> <b>check</b> with rather few chemicals but demonstrate that proper chemical knowledge {{as well as}} familiarity with indexing practices improves the search results significantly.In many cases {{it is necessary to}} scrutinize the substances under consideration individually for different trivial names, technical names, CAS numbers or isomers. Also, knowledge of the structure or mixtures involving the chemical at hand may lead to improved search results.The CAS number of a substance is a great advantage in most cases. Our study has found some notable exceptions. As an example, the CAS number of chlordane from the Stockholm list produces almost no articles in SciFinder although a fair number of articles in Scopus. Instead, SciFinder discriminates between different isomeric forms as well as ‘technical’ chlordane. All instances leads to a different number of articles. A complete result is only obtained by combining the different searches. The use of acronyms for substances also makes exhaustive literature searches difficult. In some cases substances are only registered under the acronym or refer to different isomeric forms. The former is observed with the substance DES while the latter is demonstrated with PFOS as an example.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presented}} the methodic {{as well as}} selected results of own empiric research (face-to-face questionings in seven different questioning regions, n = 1488) {{to the analysis of}} the shopping behaviour and the attitudes towards direct purchase. To the analysis of the buying patterns a Kaufverhaltensindex (KVI) was introduced. In the regional comparison will be clear that the questioning regions of Baden-Württemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia show KVI by far highest, while the eastern questioning-regions (particularly Thuringia) are marked by the lowest KVI. Within the attitude measurement (factor analysis) six attitude-dimensions could be extracted. In particular are these: confidence in the emotional product quality, price- consciousness, socio-political motivation, confidence in the conventional food-offer, the orientation to convenience food and health consciousness. The analysis of the buying patterns-relevance (regression analysis) showed the distinct dominance of the attitude dimension to price consciousness. From the segmentation of the whole <b>random</b> <b>check</b> (cluster analysis) result four clusters (DV-sympathizers, price-conscious not-DV- buyers, direct buyers oriented to organic farming and a conventionally oriented DV-cluster).

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the effects of varying stimulus check size on multifocal visual evoked potential (VEP). We also evaluated the currently used cortical scaling of stimulus segments. The ObjectiVisionTM multifocal objective perimeter stimulates the eye with <b>random</b> <b>check</b> patterns at 56 cortically scaled segments within the visual field extending to a radius of 26 °. All cortically scaled segments have equal number of checks, which gradually increase in size from the center to the periphery, proportional {{to the size of the}} segment. Stimuli with 9, 16, 25, 36 and 49 checks/segment were tested on 10 eyes belonging to 10 normal subjects. The check size varied inversely with number of checks per segment. VEP was recorded using bipolar occipital cross electrodes (7 min/eye), the amplitude and latency of responses obtained were compared with the check size at different eccentricities. Our findings suggest that the existing setting with 16 checks/segment subtending 26 ′ to 140 ′ from center to periphery, is the most effective amongst all the check sizes. Decreasing the check size prolongs the latency in the central field only. Cortical scaling of segments generates responses of the same order of magnitude throughout the field, but could be improved slightly to enhance the signal from the outer two rings. 6 page(s...|$|E
