50|$|These upper lavas {{are almost}} entirely {{restricted}} within the caldera but have spilled {{out over the}} caldera rim on the outer slopes at two points. The most conspicuous overspill is close to a line of small craterlets South-West of nakuru {{and there may be}} some genetic connection. The massive trachyte exposed in the Amolak Sigh Quarry is believed to belong to the upper lava series, though unlike most of these late lavas it is holocrystallive. The overspill probably represents one of the very earliest of these second series eruptions. The later lava seems to continue down the caldera wall into the caldera, and this may well be a <b>ring</b> <b>feeder</b> structure similar to the famous backward flow Crater Lake,USA, a <b>ring</b> <b>feeder</b> actually cut through by the caldera fault. Similar structures are seen in Suswa caldera.|$|E
50|$|A large round bale can be {{directly}} used for feeding animals by placing it in a feeding area, tipping it over, removing the bale wrap, and placing a protective ring (a <b>ring</b> <b>feeder)</b> around the outside so that animals don't walk on hay that has been peeled off the outer perimeter of the bale. The round baler's rotational forming and compaction process also enables {{both large and small}} round bales to be fed out by unrolling the bale, leaving a continuous flat strip in the field or behind a feeding barrier.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJoel M. DeRoucheySeven {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effect of alfalfa and cornstalk round bale processing type on animal performance, wastage, preference, and mixing characteristics. All bales were baled using a round baler (John Deere) that {{had the ability to}} cut forage being baled prior to wrapping. This machine processed all bales used in these experiments, with those termed conventional being baled with the cutter disengaged. In Exp. 1, 46 heifers (initially 270 kg BW) were used in a 27 d experiment with ADG being higher (P 0. 05) difference in forage wastage from <b>ring</b> <b>feeders</b> between precut or conventional alfalfa. In Exp. 3, 26 beef heifers, (initially 305 kg) were used to show that there was no (P = 0. 48) difference in the preference of conventional alfalfa or precut alfalfa when offered simultaneously in different <b>ring</b> <b>feeders</b> for 2 d. In Exp. 4, 75 bulls (initially 317 kg BW) were used to show that tub ground bales had smaller TMR particle size (P = 0. 01) than TMR’s with conventional or precut alfalfa bales. In Exp. 5, 60 heifers (initially 332 kg BW) were used to show that different discharge locations from each of the different cornstalk treatments had similar (P > 0. 11) DM, CP, ADF, and NDF. Mixing time and fuel usage of a vertical mixer were evaluated in Exp. 6 and 7. In Exp. 6, bale mixing time was shorter (P 0. 05) among precut and conventionally-processed cornstalk bales. In conclusion, precutting alfalfa or cornstalk bales prior to net wrapping improved heifer performance and decreased mixing time and tractor fuel usage, but did not affect wastage and preference...|$|R

40|$|Many factors affect forage quality, {{including}} {{moisture level}} at baling, compaction, bulk density, and maturity at harvest. Losses of dry matter and nutrient value occur during field curing. Hay baled {{at or above}} 18 % moisture should have less nutrient loss in the field. However, hay baled at these moisture levels {{has the potential to}} heat during storage, causing dry matter loss and nutrient degradation. Also, as particle length of forage decreases, packing ability of forage and bulk density of bales increase. Although particle length is reduced by grinding baled forage, this can result in nutrient losses. Also, when cattle are fed free choice in a <b>ring</b> <b>feeder,</b> precutting forage may help reduce waste because the smaller particles fall within the ring and are not pulled out by the animals and lost on the ground. Objectives of these experiments were to compare the effects of precutting alfalfa during round baling and conventional baling on heifer performance, forage wastage, and eating preference...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryK C OlsonThe {{objective}} of this series of studies was to examine select factors that affect behavior of beef cattle grazing native-tallgrass rangelands. Mineral supplements with divergent palatability characteristics were delivered to beef cows grazing native tallgrass range during various seasons {{of the year in}} order to measure mineral intake, frequency of supplement use, and duration of supplement use. We concluded that molasses-based mineral supplements influenced the activities of grazing cows more strongly than salt-based mineral supplements. These influences extended to the amount of supplement consumed {{as well as to the}} frequency, duration, and timing of use. Diet selection preferences of experienced, multiparous beef cows and naïve, primiparous beef cows grazing dormant, native tallgrass pastures were examined also during a short-term winter grazing bout. Naïve, primiparous cows selected more forbs and fewer grasses than experienced, multiparous cows. Previous research indicated that preference for broadleaf plants generally increased with grazing experience; however, these conclusions were based on research with greater-quality forages than those evaluated in our study. The differences in diet selection patterns between experienced, multiparous cows and naïve, primiparous cows during a short-term winter grazing period could be indicative of differences in long-term foraging strategies. In addition, the botanical composition of diets grazed by lactating beef cows with suckling calves and non-pregnant, non-lactating beef cows grazing either burned or unburned native tallgrass prairie during summer were evaluated. There were no differences in botanical diet composition between lactating cows suckling calves and non-lactating cows. In contrast, total graminoid selection was greater on burned (74. 2 %) than unburned pastures (71. 8 %) and total forb selection was greater on unburned (28. 2 %) than burned pastures (25. 8 %). We interpreted these data to suggest that forage selection preferences of beef cows can be altered with spring burning of native tallgrass pastures. Effects of large, round hay bale feeding method on intake of smooth bromegrass hay and eating behavior by beef cows were examined on dormant tallgrass prairie pastures during winter. Three large, round hay bale-feeding systems were evaluated: bales fed in a <b>ring</b> <b>feeder,</b> bales unrolled on the ground, and bales chopped with a flail-type hay processor (20 -cm particle length) and deposited on the ground. Hay intake, hay refusal, frequency of use, and duration of use were not influenced by hay-feeding method. Foraging behaviors of beef cows in our studies were influenced by supplement type, cow age, and prescribed burning of rangeland. Conversely, foraging behaviors of beef cows were not influenced by lactation or by hay-feeding method...|$|E
40|$|Passive Optical Networks (PONs) {{have become}} the most popular fibre based access {{networks}} over the last decade. They are widely deployed for use in Fibre-to-the-Premises (FTTP) scenarios. PON is a point-to-multipoint connection (P 2 MP) between an optical line terminal (OLT) located at the central office (CO) and multiple optical network units (ONU) at the customer premises. The next generation of PONs (NG-PON) are likely to deploy a ring-and-spur long reach PON (LR-PON). NG-PON aims to accommodate more ONUs, extend the network coverage out to 100 km, minimize complexity and improve operational outcomes. An all fibre access network, operating over extended distances, presents a reliability risk, thereby increasing {{the need for a}} reliable and cost-effective monitoring system to enhance protection and reduce restoration time. Among existing monitoring techniques, attention is focused on approaches that use optical code division multiplexing (OCDM), also known as optical coding (OC). The OC is applied to a signal that is sent from the network management system (NMS) to the ONUs. The monitoring signal is transmitted onto a fibre and split into a number of sub-signals that are equal in number to the ONUs. Each one of the ONUs receives a sub-signal, encodes it, and then reflects it back to the NMS. The NMS has the capability to identify faulty ONUs by examining the code received from the ONUs. A review of the literature has shown that the use of OCs does improve system performance, especially in the timely detection of faults. Many of the studies, found in the literature, focus on how to implement optical spreading codes that are used in OCDM Access (OCDMA) systems and currently the optical orthogonal code (OOC) is the dominant code implemented for time-domain coding. Although the OOC code performs well, its construction is relatively complex. The available code-words (cardinality) that are offered by OOC are proportional to the code length. Implementing OOC in a high capacity PON requires a long code length causes an inevitable degradation of system performance. Therefore, an improved optical coding technique for PONs should provide code-words that conform to PON split ratios. The main objective of the research was to develop an optical spreading code, based on a prime code family for OCDMA systems, that has the capability to accommodate different PON split ratios and with characteristics that improve transmission system performance when compared to existing prime code families. The novel code presented in this thesis is identified as the extended grouped new modified prime code (EG-nMPC). The number of code-words generated by the proposed codes are substantially higher than those generated by the existing code families and more compatible to the different PON splitting ratios. In addition, with a low code weight, both power consumption and hardware complexity decreases. The code performance was evaluated using mathematical models for two transmission formats - pulse position modulation (PPM) and on-off keying (OOK) modulation. The performance of EG-nMPC was compared to other prime codes, and the results show that the proposed code improves the performance of OCDMA in terms of bit-error rate (BER). As PON is a point-to-multipoint connection oriented access network, downstream traffic is encrypted and broadcast to all ONUs, while the unencrypted upstream traffic from each ONU terminal occurs in a burst mode. The OLT carries out a ranging process to determine transmission delays between ONUs, to prevent collisions between the burst mode traffic from each of the ONUs. In this research, the burst mode traffic ranging process has been replicated in the monitoring system, with this replication providing a fixed equalization delay time for the monitoring transmissions. To investigate the ring-and-spur LR-PON reliability several protection architectures were evaluated, in term of cost and availability, to determine the optimal protection architecture. In this thesis, the reliability parameter Failure Impact Robustness (FIR), has been used to calculate the failure impact of the different components in ring-and-spur LR-PON, hence selecting the optimal protection scheme. A PON-based optical communication system model was developed and the proposed EG-nMPC code was incorporated. Fibre split ratios of 32, 64 and 128, were considered in this study. The simulation results show that the EG-nMPC code improves the performance, efficiency and accuracy of the PON transmission monitoring system. To conclude, this research aims to enhance the PON performance by a fast detection of the fault and quick restoration. This research has contributed to knowledge by identifying a new and novel spreading code that is compatible with the different PON splitting ratios for OC monitoring techniques. By using the ranging process, a fixed equalization delay time has been assigned to each ONU to manage the upstream burst traffic. The spreading code has been implemented in a real-time simulation to show the status of each fibre link. The implementation was carried out based on 1 -D tree topology system. However, the proposed EG-nMPC can be exploited to enable network monitoring that is based on hybrid 1 D/ 2 D coding. This coding is complementary with the structure of LR-PON as explained in section ‎ 8. 2. 3. In addition, {{with the use of the}} FIR parameter for the different components in the ring-and-spur architecture, an optimal protection scheme for both OLT and the <b>ring</b> (<b>feeder</b> fibre), has been nominated. This protection scheme ensures that protection, availability and cost are at their optimal values...|$|E
40|$|Stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), are {{a serious}} pest to beef cattle in {{confined}} animal feeding operations (CAFOs) by causing economic {{losses in the}} form of reduced feed intake and feed efficiency, resulting in reduced weight gain. Integration of sanitation, parasitoids, and residual insecticides offers a much-needed reduction of this pest’s impact on CAFOs.

Further impact that stable flies have on cattle is when cattle seek protection from stable flies by standing in water, which results in water pollution with fecal matter, in addition to reduced foraging time.
