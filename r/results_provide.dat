25|$|There {{are several}} reasons for this discrepancy. First, some news sources include only pledged delegates in their total count, while others include superdelegates. Second, {{estimates}} of superdelegate votes are unreliable and are subject to change. Third, pledged delegates in many states are selected at county or state conventions late in the process; thus, the initial primary and caucus <b>results</b> <b>provide</b> only a projection of pledged delegates, highlighted by the discrepancies with the Iowa county convention results. Fourth, {{in the days after}} an election, results in individual precincts may be delayed, and news organizations may project the winners of those precincts based on statistical analysis or may wait for confirmed results. The Democratic nominating process is a complex system that has evolved over time, and in close races, it can be difficult under the current system to know who is leading in the delegate count.|$|E
500|$|The Shapley–Folkman lemma {{and related}} <b>results</b> <b>provide</b> an affirmative {{answer to the}} question, [...] "Is the sum of many sets close to being convex?" [...] A set is defined to be convex if every line segment joining two of its points is a subset in the set: For example, the solid disk is a convex set but [...] the circle is not, because the line segment joining two {{distinct}} points is not {{a subset of the}} circle. The Shapley–Folkman lemma suggests that if the number of summed sets exceeds the dimension of the vector space, then their Minkowskisum is approximately convex.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to calculations of spectra, this technique {{can be used}} to calculate expectation values. One such quantity, a correlator [...] of the stress energy tensor, has been computed as a test of a Maldacena conjecture. A very efficient Lanczos-based method was developed for this calculation. The most recent <b>results</b> <b>provide</b> direct evidence for the conjecture.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s Karlis Osis {{conducted}} many OBE {{experiments with}} the psychic Alex Tanous. For {{a series of}} these experiments he was asked whilst in an OBE state to try to identify coloured targets that were placed in remote locations. Osis reported that in 197 trials there were 114 hits. However, the controls to the experiments have been criticized and according to Susan Blackmore the final result was not particularly significant as 108 hits would be expected by chance. Blackmore noted that the <b>results</b> <b>provide</b> [...] "no evidence for accurate perception in the OBE".|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{in the role of}} homoerotic behaviour further support the [...] "affiliation hypothesis" [...] above. A study published in 2014 sought to measure homoerotic motivation, and to investigate the how an affiliative context would affect homoerotic motivation in men, and it is found that men in an affiliative priming condition are more open to engaging in homoerotic behaviour. This effect is most pronounced with men with high progesterone, a hormone that is associated with affiliative motivation in humans. In spite of the opportunity costs homoerotic behaviour and motivation were thought to incur, the <b>results</b> <b>provide</b> data constituting evidence that homoerotic motivation, and subsequently homoerotic behaviour, holds the adaptive function of encouraging alliance formation and bonding.|$|E
