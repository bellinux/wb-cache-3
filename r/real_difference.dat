25|$|Mark N. Franklin {{argues that}} salience, the {{perceived}} effect {{that an individual}} vote will have on how the country is run, has {{a significant effect on}} turnout. He presents Switzerland {{as an example of a}} nation with low salience. The nation's administration is highly decentralized, so that the federal government has limited powers. The government invariably consists of a coalition of parties, and the power wielded by a party is far more closely linked to its position relative to the coalition than to the number of votes it received. Important decisions are placed before the population in a referendum. Individual votes for the federal legislature are thus unlikely to have a significant effect on the nation, which probably explains the low average turnouts in that country. By contrast Malta, with one of the world's highest voter turnouts, has a single legislature that holds a near monopoly on political power. Malta has a two-party system in which a small swing in votes can completely alter the executive. On the other hand, countries with a two party system can experience low turnout if large numbers of potential voters perceive little <b>real</b> <b>difference</b> between the main parties. Voters' perceptions of fairness also have an important effect on salience. If voters feel that the result of an election is more likely to be determined by fraud and corruption than by the will of the people, fewer people will vote.|$|E

500|$|UNCRO was criticised {{for several}} reasons. The Secretary-General's Report to the Council {{described}} {{the failures of}} UNPROFOR, but the new mission did not address them.

As a result, fulfilment of the mission mandate was nearly impossible. While Croatian sources said that the [...] mission name was the only <b>real</b> <b>difference</b> from UNPROFOR, the RSK authorities were not satisfied with the UNCRO mission. Specifically, the RSK objected to the deployment of UNCRO troops along the international borders and to the mission name. Conversely, Croats were pleased that the mission acronym appeared to be an abbreviation of Croatia. In response, Czech UNCRO troops used vehicle licence plates bearing the new mission's acronym when operating in HV-controlled territory and UNPROFOR plates in areas held by the ARSK due to safety concerns.|$|E
