We develop a carrier maintenance scheduling model with a goal to meet, as best as possible, the FRP requirements over a ten-year period, while obeying simple maintenance facility constraints. This model allows us to anticipate gaps in coverage and also quantitatively assess the benefit, or burden, of re-sizing the fleet.

The scale is based on Savickas’ (1997) model of Career adaptability which is conceptualised as an aggregate model, where choice <b>readiness,</b> <b>planning,</b> exploration, and confidence jointly produce career adaptability measure. All items are measured on a 5 -point response format ranging from “ 1 : strongly disagree” to “ 5 : strongly agree”. High scores depict higher levels of career adaptability while low scores depict lower levels of career adaptability. The scale has been validated in several studies (Hirschi, 2009; Koena, Klehe, Van Vianen, Zikic, & Nauta, 2010) with Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.6 to 0.8.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) is the Navy’s principal institution for providing advanced {{education to the}} Navy and Marine Corps. Funded in part by direct funding through annual appropriations, NPS also receives {{a substantial amount of}} reimbursable funding through sponsored research, education, professional development, and other sponsored activities. In recent years, the amount of reimbursable funding NPS receives on an annual basis has grown considerably while direct funding has remained relatively constant. Consequently, the Naval Inspector General conducted inspections of NPS in 2009 and 2012 to address this as well as other issues. As a result, there has been ongoing discussion regarding NPS’s mission and the role reimbursable funded work should play at the school. Like other Navy organizations, NPS is also working toward achieving auditable financial statements in compliance with the Department of Defense Comptroller’s Financial Improvement and Audit <b>Readiness</b> <b>Plan</b> by 30 September 2017.

40|$|The {{electric}} power {{is one of}} the key products without which functioning of our society would be hard to imagine. The electricity distribution network is an interconnected system comprising of a manufacturing part producing electricity from various sources, a transmission system of conductors and equipment, distribution systems of high and low voltage, and of technical control stations suitably distributed to control the whole network. Energy security means ensuring continuity of necessary supplies of energy and energy services to accommodate the protected interests of the state. A long-term {{electric power}} failure may have serious consequences for the state security, for providing for basic subsistence needs of the population, individual?s health or the state economy. For their maintenance under ordinary as well as emergency conditions it is particularly necessary to ensure functioning of critical infrastructure. The aim of this thesis is to examine the level of preparedness of the subjects within the critical infrastructure for a long-term interruption of electric power supplies and to create a draft of an emergency preparedness plan of a subject within the critical infrastructure focused on a long-term electric power failure. The research part of the thesis has two parts. The first part includes processing and analysis of the data acquired though a questionnaire survey. The second one presents a draft of the emergency preparedness plan of a subject within the critical infrastructure. The results of the questionnaire survey showed a good readiness of the critical infrastructure for a long-term, extensive electric power failure, which confirms the set hypothesis. The thesis introduces the public, particularly the subjects of the critical infrastructure, to the possibilities of occurrence of long-term, extensive electric power failures, with available prevention of such emergency situations and their preparation, planning and solving. The presented emergency plan draft should help with preparation of an emergency <b>readiness</b> <b>plan</b> of a subject within the critical infrastructure, including outlining the ways to solve emergency situations that may arise in relation with a power failure, and thus to improve protection of the critical infrastructure elements...|$|E

40|$|Background]Ethiopia {{has high}} {{maternal}} mortality ratio and poor access to maternal health services. Attendance {{of at least}} four antenatal care (ANC) visits and delivery by a skilled birth attendant (SBA) are important in preventing maternal deaths. Understanding the reasons behind the poor use of these services is important in designing strategies to address the problem. This study aimed to determine the coverage of at least four ANC visits and delivery by a SBA and to identify determinants of utilisation of these services in three districts in South West Shoa Zone, Ethiopia. [Methods]A cross-sectional survey of 500 women aged 15 – 49 years with a delivery in two {{years prior to the}} survey was conducted in Wolisso, Wonchi and Goro districts in February 2013. Data were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to explore determinants of ANC attendance and SBA at delivery. [Results]Coverage of at least four ANC visits and SBA at delivery were 45. 5 and 28. 6 %, respectively. Most institutional deliveries (69 %) occurred at the single hospital that serves the study districts. Attendance of at least four ANC visits was positively associated with wealth status, knowledge of the recommended number of ANC visits, and attitude towards maternal health care, but was negatively associated with woman’s age. SBA at delivery was negatively associated with parity and time to the health facility, but was positively associated with urban residence, wealth, knowledge of the recommended number of ANC visits, perceived good quality of maternal health services, experience of a pregnancy/delivery related problem, involvement of the partner/family in decision making on delivery place, and birth preparedness. [Conclusions]Raising awareness about the minimum recommended number of ANC visits, tackling geographical inaccessibility, improving the quality of care, encouraging pregnant women to have a birth and complication <b>readiness</b> <b>plan</b> and community mobilisation targeting women, husbands, and families for their involvement in maternal health care have the potential to increase use of maternal health services in this setting. Furthermore, supporting health centres to increase uptake of institutional delivery services may rapidly increase coverage of delivery by SBA and reduce inequity...|$|E
40|$|Novartis International A. G. is {{well known}} for their {{effective}} research and development of life-changing pharmaceuticals, and in 2006, Novartis bought Chiron Corporation, thereby diversifying their portfolio with a vaccines and diagnostics division. Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics (NV&D) is dedicated to producing vaccines and diagnostics tools at the highest quality and lowest cost. This thesis is from a six-month internship that explores the Novartis Vaccine's Holly Springs, North Carolina flu-cell culture facility to assist management in better understanding the Novartis' Innovation, Quality, and Productive (IQP) system on the organization. This particular site employs approximately 350 full-time individuals and 150 contractors. The Holly Springs' facility is designed to manufacture and fill 50 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccine, and 150 million doses {{in the event of a}} pandemic (with the help of a dose sparing adjuvant). All processes, from incoming raw materials to syringe fill and finish, must be conducted at this site in order to meet a United States mandate for emergency readiness in the event of a pandemic. The facility is well on its way to finalizing the manufacturing process, installing all the production equipment, and hiring staff, however, all start ups experience difficulties and this is no different from Novartis. The site, in particular is experiencing many difficulties in their raw material release process.. NV&D management recognized the need to implement their IQP project improvement system to address the disruptions that are impacting their scheduled <b>readiness</b> <b>plan.</b> [Figure 1 displayed] Figure 1 : Causal Feedback Loop of Process Improvement on Process Performance] The approach for this project and thesis will be a mix of Novartis' IQP department, quality management, and technical operations methodologies in order to fully understand the current state of the raw material release process and identify gaps within the process. Combining the raw material release project with the theories of system dynamics, Novartis can better understand the impact of their Innovation, Quality, and Productive system at varying organizational levels.
