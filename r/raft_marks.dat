50|$|For {{the second}} Roadblock, teams {{traveled}} to Cow Bay Marina {{and took a}} water taxi, one departing every 20 minutes, to a log boom floating {{in the middle of}} the bay. Here, the team member who did not perform the first Roadblock had to choose a lane and pilot a small tugboat equipped with a dozer blade to find three small timber <b>rafts</b> <b>marked</b> with red flags and push them to a dispatcher at the other end of the lane. Once all three were delivered, they received their next clue.|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{changes in}} the surface and bottom water layers of the Ingøydjupet Basin and history of Atlantic water inflow to the southwestern Barents Sea during the last 16 ka are reconstructed {{on the base of}} planktic and benthic foraminiferal assemblages. A multiproxy study of {{sediment}} cores PSh- 5159 R and PSh- 5159 N, including AMS 14 C dating, provides time resolution of about 200 years for the deglaciation period, 100 years for Holocene, and 25 - 50 years for the last 400 years. Stable polar conditions with sea ice on the surface were typical for the early deglaciation period. Unstable bottom settings and onset of ice <b>rafting</b> <b>marked</b> Oldest Dryas. Cold Atlantic water inflow increased notably during the Boiling-Allerod interstadial nearby the site location and then decreased during the Younger Dryas. Early Holocene was characterized by abrupt warming in the bottom and surface water layers, especially ~ 9. 7 - 7. 6 ka BP. Stable conditions prevailed during Middle Holocene. Remarkable {{changes in the}} sea-surface temperature and bottom environments occurred during last 2. 5 cal. ka BP...|$|R
50|$|Two {{other bodies}} were {{subsequently}} found. The first, {{picked up by}} another picket boat, CGR-1989, at 17:30 on 11 May, was fully clothed, had an escape lung and life jacket on. He {{was found in a}} rubber <b>raft.</b> Identification <b>marks</b> indicated the man was a German sailor named Wilhelm Flade, aged about 17. The body was transferred from CGR-1989 to CGR-1338 on the morning of 12 May 1944 and was brought to Tompkinsville on Staten Island.|$|R
40|$|Cell surface {{proteins}} major {{histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class I–related chain A (MICA) and UL 16 -binding proteins (ULBP) 1, 2, and 3 are up-regulated upon infection or tumor transformation and can activate human natural killer (NK) cells. Patches of cross-linked raft resident ganglioside GM 1 colocalized with ULBP 1, 2, 3, or MICA, but not CD 45. Thus, ULBPs and MICA are expressed in lipid rafts at the cell surface. Western blotting revealed that glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored ULBP 3 but not transmembrane MICA, MHC class I protein, or transferrin receptor, accumulated in detergent-resistant membranes containing GM 1. Thus, MICA may have a weaker association with lipid rafts than ULBP 3, yet both proteins accumulate at an activating human NK cell immune synapse. Target cell lipid <b>rafts</b> <b>marked</b> by green fluorescent protein–tagged GPI also accumulate with ULBP 3 at some synapses. Electron microscopy reveals constitutive clusters of ULBP at the cell surface. Regarding a specific molecular basis for the organization of these proteins, ULBP 1, 2, and 3 and MICA are lipid modified. ULBP 1, 2, and 3 are GPI anchored, and we demonstrate here that MICA is S-acylated. Finally, expression of a truncated form of MICA that lacks the putative site for S-acylation and the cytoplasmic tail can be expressed at the cell surface, but is unable to activate NK cells.

5000|$|During the 1994 Cuban Rafter Crisis, {{the most}} {{commonly}} observed raft from the US tanker Coastal New York was constructed of 2 doors atop large truck-tire inner tubes, with the doors connected by 2"x4" [...] wooden beams. A rudimentary 2-3m mast was improvised that supported a small white cloth as a flag or banner that would increase the raft's visibility to vessels traveling nearby. The Coastal New York observed over 75 abandoned rafts in a 4-hour daylight period near the Gulf Stream off Florida's east coast. All the abandoned <b>rafts</b> had been <b>marked</b> with fluorescent orange paint, presumably marked by USCG personnel involved in rescue/recovery operations. USCG documentation {{would be a more}} thorough depiction of this event.|$|R
40|$|International audience: Previously, we {{demonstrated}} that eicosapentaenoic acid enhanced ethanol-induced oxidative stress and cell death in {{primary rat hepatocytes}} via an increase in membrane fluidity and lipid raft clustering. In this context, another n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), was tested with a special emphasis on physical and chemical alteration of lipid rafts. Pretreatment of hepatocytes with DHA reduced significantly ethanol-induced oxidative stress and cell death. DHA protection {{could be related to}} an alteration of lipid rafts. Indeed, <b>rafts</b> exhibited a <b>marked</b> increase in membrane fluidity and packing defects leading to the exclusion of a raft protein marker, flotillin. Furthermore, DHA strongly inhibited disulfide bridge formation, even in control cells, thus suggesting a disruption of protein-protein interactions inside lipid rafts. This particular spatial organization of lipid rafts due to DHA subsequently prevented the ethanol-induced lipid raft clustering. Such a prevention was then responsible for the inhibition of phospholipase C-γ translocation into rafts, and consequently of both lysosome accumulation and elevation in cellular low-molecular-weight iron content, a prooxidant factor. In total, the present study suggests that DHA supplementation could represent a new preventive approach for patients with alcoholic liver disease based upon modulation of the membrane structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This review {{provides}} an overview over the burden solar radiation confers to human skin. Individual exposure doses vary not only due to different ambient UV doses depending on season, time of day, geographical position and weather conditions, but just as importantly to seasonal variation in behaviour. The general photobiological mechanisms underlying UVA, UVB and infrared A signaling are <b>marked.</b> <b>Rafts</b> are tightly packed, ordered and dynamic membrane microdomains rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol. They contribute to signaling events by trapping signaling molecules e. g. receptors or enzymes in order to render them active or inactive. A special subtype of rafts are caveolae also found in basal keratinocytes representing a flask-shaped invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane which are stabilized by caveolins serving as a scaffolding protein to organize lipids and signal transducing proteins. Within UVA signaling these membrane domains have been identified to be a target and a source for formation of reactive oxygen species in keratinocytes. UVA responsiveness with regards to gene expression depends on the ratio of cholesterol vs ceramide in rafts and {{on the presence of}} caveolin- 1. Cholesterol, phytosterols or several triterpenoids can stabilize these raft structure leading to inhibition of UVA signaling, whereas increased levels of 7 -dehydrocholesterol found in Smith-Lemli-Opitz patients suffering from enhanced photosensitivity mainly towards UVA destabilize rafts...|$|R
40|$|The 1970 s {{are widely}} {{thought to have}} marked a {{watershed}} for women. Women’s lives underwent considerable transformations, even as the limits of those changes were bound by continued assumptions about gender roles. The British women’s movement enjoyed its most vibrant upsurge {{in half a century}} and a <b>raft</b> of legislation <b>marked</b> the most significant advance in women’s rights since the 1920 s. The landmark equality legislation is well known: the 1970 Equal Pay Act and the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act. The 1970 - 74 Conservative Government passed a series of laws strengthening the rights of married women. The 1974 - 9 Labour Governments introduced statutory maternity leave, child benefit, and addressed some gender inequalities in pension provision. They also passed the 1976 Domestic Violence Act, and the 1977 Sexual Offences Act, which offered women some new protections. This thesis concentrates on those measures which most directly affected women’s economic status and their treatment as workers, in the home and in formal paid employment. It shows how feminists, women rights activists, and other interested parties advanced the cause of reform, and how party and government politicians perceived and responded to these challenges within the context of their broader concerns. The exploration of this particular set of policies shows how governments began {{to move away from the}} Beveridge assumptions, whereby women were viewed as dependents, towards a view which saw all women as economically independent workers. This work also shows how these policies, and the ideas about gender equality which they embodied, evolved within a broader political context, which saw the end of the postwar consensus and its replacement with a different set of ideals and assumptions. By adopting a broadly chronological approach, this work shows how the notion and practice of equality for women developed throughout the period which we so closely associate with women’s liberation...|$|R
60|$|When Mark {{found his}} health {{completely}} re-established, {{he sat down}} and drew up a regular plan of dividing his time between work, contemplation, and amusement. Fortunately, perhaps, for one who lived in a climate where vegetation was so luxuriant when it could be produced at all, work was pressed into his service as an amusement. Of the last, there was certainly very little, in the common acceptation of the word; but our hermit was not without it altogether. He studied the habits of the sea-birds that congregated in thousands around so many of the rocks of the Reef, though so few scarce ever ventured on the crater island. He made voyages to and fro, usually connecting business with pleasure. Taking favourable times for such purposes, he floated several cargoes of loam to the Reef, as well as two enormous <b>rafts</b> of sea-weed. <b>Mark</b> was quite a month in getting these materials into his compost heap, which he intended should lie in a pile during the winter, in order that it might be ready for spading in the spring. We use these terms by way of distinguishing the seasons, though of winter, strictly speaking, there was none. Of the two, the grass grew better at mid-winter than at mid-summer, the absence of the burning heat of the last being favourable to its growth. As the season advanced, Mark saw his grass very sensibly increase, not only in surface, but in thickness. There were now spots of some size, where a turf was forming, nature performing all her tasks in that genial climate, in about a fourth of the time it would take to effect the same object in the temperate zone. On examining these places, Mark {{came to the conclusion that}} the roots of his grasses acted as cultivators, by working their way into the almost insensible crevices of the crust, letting in air and water to places whence they had hitherto been excluded. This seemed, in particular, to be the case with the grass that grew within the crater, which had increased so much in the course of what may be termed the winter, that it was really fast converting a plain of a light drab colour, that was often painful to the eyes, into a plot of as lovely verdure as ever adorned the meadows of a Swiss cottage. It became desirable to keep this grass down, and Kitty being unable to crop a meadow of so many acres, Mark was compelled to admit his pigs and poultry again. This he did at stated times only, however; or when he was at work himself in the garden, and could prevent their depredations on his beds. The rooting gave him the most trouble; but this he contrived in a great measure to prevent, by admitting his hogs only when they were eager for grass, and turning them out as soon as they began to generalize, like an epicure picking his nuts after dinner.|$|R
