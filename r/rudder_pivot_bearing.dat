40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the prototypes of new <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> having {{multiple}} degrees of freedom. The idea of the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> {{is based on a}} constant velocity joint(CVJ). First,two types of the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> with 2 DOF are designed and produced. Their design and some static specifications are described. Then,applying the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> with 2 DOF,three types of the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> with 3 DOF are prototyped. A full complement ball bearing mechanism is used in order to make smooth motion and downsizing is also aimed. Furthermore,process accuracy of the elements is examined...|$|R

Two motors, one {{either side of the}} bridge, turn shafts passing through the centre of the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings.</b> Further shafts take power {{to the rear of the}} counterweights, where there are pinions pressing against a rack mounted in the wall of the counterweight chamber, which drive the bascule.|$|R

In connection with this, there were two buffer springs, which, together with the centring springs of the mobile crosshead guides, counteracted any rolling of the bogie.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{studies done}} at HP Labs on the actuator <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> nonlinearity {{of a small}} disk drive. The nonlinear frictional behavior of the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> varies with actuator position, from drive to drive, and with time and temperature. This nonlinear behavior has made the traditional linear disk drive models inadequate. Part I of the paper shows how the sweptsine /describing function method was used to develop a nonlinear model of the pivot. This model departs from the classical friction models, but {{does a good job}} of matching laboratory frequency domain measurements. Part II of this paper presents several additional models and describes time domain comparisons between the laboratory measurements and the model simulations. 1. Introduction Friction in the actuator pivot of a small disk drive limits the low-frequency gain. This problem is much more pronounced in a small drive due to its small actuator inertia when compared with that of larger disk drives. Furthermore, such [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this rather serious defect, the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> were also subject to quite rapid wear since they carried a considerable additional load compared to those on the Garratt {{as a result of}} the water and coal bunkers which were mounted on the main frame instead of on the engine units. This resulted in increased frequency of maintenance and as a consequence, increased operating cost.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{since the}} coal bunker was {{mounted on the}} frame instead of on the engine unit, the rear <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> were subject to quite rapid wear since they carried a {{considerable}} additional vertical load compared to those on a purebred Garratt.

50|$|The <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> {{were also}} subject to quite rapid wear since they carried a {{considerable}} additional vertical load {{concentrated on the}} centre of the engine units {{as a result of their}} water and coal bunkers which were mounted on the main frame instead of on the engine units like those on the Garratt equivalent. This resulted in increased frequency of maintenance and, as a consequence, increased operating cost.|$|R
40|$|To {{find the}} {{relationship}} between the modal frequency of HDD actuator arm and the interested process parameter, the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> insertion process has been investigated. The non-conformance condition could be induced by various parameters such as the dimension of parts, and the friction inside the bearing. One of the interesting parameter is the depth of the glue groove between the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> and the actuator arm. The objective of this research is to prove the existence of relationship between depth of the glue groove and the actuator arm modal frequency. The variation of the modal frequency of actuator arm is investigated by the experiment and FEM. Representing the variation of the controlled parameter, the depth of the glue groove has been varied. The modal frequency of each specimen is measured and is compared to the expected standard condition. The experiment shows that the modal frequency of some vibration mode is significantly different in each group of specimen. The experiment results and the FEM results show {{the relationship between}} the variation of controlled dimension and the modal frequency of the Actuator Arm...|$|R

Strictly speaking {{it was not a}} valve gear but a variable expansion mechanism adapted to the Walschaerts layout replacing the expansion link and sliding die block. The Baker arrangement used more <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> or pin joints, but avoided the die slip inherent to the expansion link, with the aim of lessening wear and the need for service; it could also facilitate longer valve travel.|$|R

40|$|Because of the {{perceived}} lack of systematic analysis in illumination system design processes {{and a lack of}} criteria for design methods in vision detection a method for the design of a task-oriented illumination system is proposed. After detecting the micro-defects of a gyroscope <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> with a high curvature glabrous surface and analyzing the characteristics of the surface detection and reflection model, a complex illumination system with coaxial and ring lights is proposed. The illumination system is then optimized based on the analysis of illuminance uniformity of target regions by simulation and grey scale uniformity and articulation that are calculated from grey imagery. Currently, in order to apply the Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) method, structural parameters must be tested and adjusted repeatedly. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, in which the maximum between cluster variance rules is used as fitness function with a linearily reduced inertia factor. This algorithm is used to adaptively set PCNN connection coefficients and dynamic threshold, which avoids algorithmic precocity and local oscillations. The proposed method is used for <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> defect image processing. The segmentation results of the maximum entropy and minimum error method and the one described in this paper are compared using buffer region matching, and the experimental results show that the method of this paper is effective...|$|R
50|$|Each {{lower link}} is {{fabricated}} from a steel tube with a two-pronged fork welded to each end. The outer {{end of the}} lower link pivots about a fulcrum shaft, which runs longitudinally through {{the bottom of each}} hub carrier. The inner fulcrum mounting is adjacent {{to the bottom of the}} differential casing. Wide spacing of the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> provides both torsional and fore-and-aft rigidity to the hub carrier. This prevents the hub carrier from twisting relative to the differential and is also necessary because, with driveshafts acting as the upper suspension links, the hub carrier has no other way of resisting fore-and-aft movement.|$|R
50|$|The G 2/2+2/3 {{class had}} an {{external}} frame. The {{part of the}} chassis supporting {{the rear of the}} locomotive was pulled forward, and in the centre supported the rear bogie. The boiler was mounted forward of this point, and thus its rear was supported at fulcrum level. The locomotive had no pivot point, as a ball joint provided for steam injection. The bogie was connected with the chassis by <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings,</b> creating an articulated joint. In connection with this, there were two buffer springs, which, together with the centring springs of the mobile crosshead guides, counteracted any rolling of the bogie.|$|R
50|$|These {{demands are}} {{contradictory}} and impossible to realize (massless arms and zero-friction bearings {{do not exist}} in the real world), so tone arm designs require engineering compromises. Solutions vary, but all modern tonearms are at least relatively lightweight and stiff constructions, with precision, very low friction <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> in both the vertical and horizontal axes. Most arms are made from some kind of alloy (the cheapest being aluminium), but some manufacturers use balsa wood, while others use carbon fiber or graphite. The latter materials favor a straight arm design; alloys' properties lend themselves to S-type arms.|$|R

The gimbal included a lateral adjustment device for aligning the combustion chamber with the vehicle, so that, in addition to transmitting the thrust from the injector assembly to the vehicle thrust structure, the gimbal also provided a <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> for deflection of the thrust vector, thus providing flight attitude control of the vehicle.|$|R

Shorter seek times typically require more energy usage to quickly move the heads across the platter, causing loud noises from the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> and greater device vibrations as the heads are rapidly accelerated during {{the start of the}} seek motion and decelerated {{at the end of the}} seek motion.

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was placed}} in service on the Cape Midlands System. While it gave good service, it was not outstanding and proved to be not as successful as the Garratt. The 63 ft frame resulted in severe overhang on sharp curves. The heavily laden overhangs beyond the pivots also led to metal fatigue due to its tendency to oscillate up-and-down. The <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> were also subject to quite rapid wear, since they carried a considerable additional load compared to those on the Garratt {{as a result of}} the water and coal bunkers which were mounted on the long main frame instead of on the engine units.

It was bought from a Cornish Mine site by Harvey and Company of Hayle, who sold it on to Prestongrange complete with a new beam of their own manufacture.
