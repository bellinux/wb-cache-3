40|$|Since September 11, 2001, {{the focus}} on health among <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> has become an {{important}} issue. The focus on mental health has {{caught the attention of}} researchers and as a fairly new research area, there are still many issues that need to be answered. This study evaluates the preparation of <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> in two Swedish organizations (Swedish Civil Contingency Agency and Swedish Red Cross) by investigating how these preparations contribute in avoiding stress-related disorders among <b>relief</b> <b>workers.</b> The organizations were evaluated by comparing data of preparations, collected from interviews and documents, with a criteria mostly based on Walsh (2009) and scholars from the Antares Foundation Guidelines (2012). Compared to the criteria the organizations' strengths are found in information of the operation with the score 9 out of 10 (which is the fulfillment of the criteria). SRC's weakness is the education of <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> with the score 6 out of 10. MSB is relatively strong in that category, but weaker in requirements for employment with 2 out of 4 points. However, these weaknesses must not obscure the overall good results for both MSB and SRC. This study establishes that the preparation of <b>relief</b> <b>workers,</b> in two of the most important relief organizations in Sweden, is good. However, further research is necessary to facilitate the creation of generally recognized guidelines for how to prepare <b>relief</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

500|$|Through {{the winter}} of 1937–38 Mitford's main {{literary}} task was editing the [...] letters of her cousins the Stanleys of Alderley, with whom she was connected through her great-grandmother Blanche Airlie. Her preoccupation with this project—nine or ten hours a day, she informed her friend Robert Byron— further damaged her relationship with Rodd, who resented the time thus spent. Nevertheless, {{in the summer of}} 1938 she discovered she was pregnant. She hoped for a girl: [...] "2 Peter Rodds in 1 house is unthinkable", but in September she miscarried. Early in 1939 Rodd left for the South of France, to work with the relief organisations assisting the thousands of Spanish refugees who had fled from General Franco's armies {{in the final stages of}} the civil war. In May Mitford joined him, and spent several weeks there as a <b>relief</b> <b>worker.</b> She was much affected by what she saw: [...] "I have never cried so much in all my life". The experience hardened her anti-fascism to the extent that she wrote: [...] "I would join hands with the devil himself to stop any further extension of the disease".|$|E
500|$|When Bingiza {{made its}} first Madagascar landfall, it became the first cyclone to strike {{the country in the}} cyclone season. It first moved through the Masoala National Park, a sparsely-populated {{protected}} region with significant numbers of trees. In Vinanivao, located along the Masoala peninsula, the cyclone destroyed half of the buildings as well as the roads and bridges, leaving it only accessible by boat. The cyclone affected five districts, primarily Mananara Nord. There, an early report indicated that 80% of the houses were destroyed, along with one hospital and four other health facilities. The high winds caused heavy crop damage, including to rice and banana, which left minimal food supplies in some areas. The vanilla crop was also severely affected, and the mayor of Mananara was uncertain whether any of the crop could be harvested. Bingiza struck at what one <b>relief</b> <b>worker</b> described as the [...] "worst time of year for a cyclone", because many farmers were unable to replant their damaged crops. The cyclone damaged 40% of the food crops and 10% of the cash crops in Manambolosy, as well as 70% of the food crops in Antanambaobe. Overall, the cyclone destroyed 405.23km2 (156.46mi2) of rice fields, as well as 101.67km2 (39.26mi2) of other crops. The cyclone also damaged the road infrastructure in Mananara, which made it difficult to transport fish in the region to other areas of the country. The resulting crop and road damage resulted in increased food prices.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEffective {{communication}} amongst diverse {{rescue and}} <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> {{is a primary}} requirement in any disaster management. Since pre-existing communication infrastructure may not be available, the Opportunistic Network framework provides a potential platform for information communication, where individual smart-phones of rescue and <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> (the nodes) spread across an environment form a disjoint, peer-to-peer network. Here, a source node communicates with a destination node following hop-by-hop, store-wait-forward cycle, since an end-to-end route connecting them never exists. Also, due to mobility and disconnectedness, nodes have scarce or no knowledge about the network topology. However, {{in the context of}} disaster management, in order to evaluate the situation, rescue and <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> often need to generate different field-related queries and the response to those queries must come from other workers in the field. Since source node (generating the query) is not aware of the location of destination node (answering the query) and all nodes are mobile, it is difficult to implement a query-response mechanism. This paper proposes and evaluates a distributed query-response mechanism that enables any node to track approximate location of other rescue and <b>relief</b> <b>workers,</b> which is turn helps to handle query-response operations...|$|R
