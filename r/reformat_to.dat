Michael Stipe, {{in an interview with}} MTV UK in 2001, explained how the video was made. [...] "The entire video took 20 seconds to shoot. What you're watching is a loop that goes forwards for 20 seconds, backwards for 20 seconds, forwards for 20 seconds, backwards for 20 seconds, with one camera, static, and then using a technique called 'pan and scan', which is a technical thing that is used when they go from a widescreen format and <b>reformat</b> <b>to</b> fit your television or DVD, moving in on certain parts of the entire picture. And you'll see that we do that picking up various people within the frame." [...] During the music video, Stipe does not sing the whole song except for a brief second; however, several people mimed to the song.|$|E

40|$|Huge {{amounts of}} film and image content are in {{archives}} stored on analog media, slowly fading away. In professional environments new content is captured electronically. There {{has always been the}} wish to capture or <b>reformat,</b> <b>to</b> store and transmit images electronically in very high quality, but only today have the sensors been developed {{in a way that the}} capturing can be done at reasonable cost for everybody. These high quality levels for still and moving pictures come with high amounts of data. Therefore encoding is necessary for storage and transmission. In general, the encoding process is not lossless, but the aim is to preserve the perceived quality. Until recently, the only way to assess the quality of encoding schemes used to be visual tests, but meanwhile measurement schemes have been standardized in ITU-R and ITU-T which can estimate the perceived quality if some conditions are met: the measurement scheme must have access to the raw, non-coded, digital content, and the encoding scheme must be in a family of well-known coding schemes. Non-reference (NR) measurement and measurement of innovative coding schemes are an open issue. Within THESEUS, two new NR predictors were developed and their performance was evaluated. In this paper, the procedure for and the results of the assessment of a measurement scheme which estimates quality without access to the reference are presented...|$|E
