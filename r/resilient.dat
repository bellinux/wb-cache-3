5|$|German industry, {{rather than}} being fragile and fixed, proved to be <b>resilient</b> and mobile.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater-fed {{systems are}} <b>resilient</b> to impacts from ashfall, {{although}} airborne ash {{can interfere with}} the operation of well-head pumps. Electricity outages caused by ashfall can also disrupt electrically powered pumps {{if there is no}} backup generation.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, {{after much}} trouble with disease and stability, the surface was removed and {{replaced}} with a more <b>resilient</b> interwoven sand based Desso pitch.|$|E
5|$|A study {{commissioned}} by Experian rated Trafford as {{the strongest and}} most <b>resilient</b> borough in North West England to dealing with sudden changes in the economy. Trafford's low reliance on vulnerable businesses in the current recession and its high proportion of multinational companies were two factors which give the borough its high ranking.|$|E
5|$|Although bobcats {{have been}} hunted {{extensively}} by humans, both for sport and fur, their population has proven <b>resilient</b> though declining in some areas. The elusive predator features in Native American mythology and the folklore of European settlers.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} plant, {{meaning that}} it is <b>resilient</b> to cold and freezing climatic conditions, dies back {{at the end of}} its growing season, has creeping rootstalks, and lives for over two years. It grows vigorously from seed over a period of 2–5 years, and thrives particularly well in freshly disturbed, cut or eroded peat. E.angustifolium is protogynous.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne and his wife, artist Rosalie Gascoigne, {{had three}} children. After he retired, Gascoigne wrote several works on Australian astronomical history. He acted as Rosalie's {{photographer}} and assistant, using his technical skills {{to make her}} artworks <b>resilient</b> for public display.|$|E
5|$|Hawksbills {{are highly}} <b>resilient</b> and {{resistant}} to their prey. Some of the sponges they eat, such as Aaptos aaptos, Chondrilla nucula, Tethya actinia, Spheciospongia vesparium, and Suberites domuncula, are highly (often lethally) toxic to other organisms. In addition, hawksbills choose sponge species with {{significant numbers of}} siliceous spicules, such as Ancorina, Geodia (G. gibberosa), Ecionemia, and Placospongia.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the gradual}} {{replacement}} of {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles for electric cars and plug-in hybrids, electric drive vehicles can contribute significantly to lessen the dependence of the transport sector on imported oil as well as contributing {{to the development of}} a more <b>resilient</b> energy supply.|$|E
5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and <b>resilient</b> to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Drakken (voiced by John DiMaggio): born Drew Theodore P. Lipsky, Drakken is Kim's archnemesis {{and most}} <b>resilient</b> adversary; a mad {{scientist}} plotting world domination, {{although most of}} his schemes fail {{at the hands of}} Kim because he lacks both the patience and intelligence to perfect his ideas, which often suffer {{as a result of his}} own mistakes and oversights. His skin has permanently been turned blue as a result of a laboratory accident. Additionally, Drakken is a former college roommate of Kim's father James.|$|E
5|$|England {{were largely}} the better team and, {{if not for}} the <b>resilient</b> batting of Chanderpaul, they would have won by an even larger margin. The West Indies {{suffered}} greatly from his absence in the second Test, losing the match by an innings and 283 runs, their biggest defeat in Test history. England retained the Wisden trophy at Old Trafford by taking an unbeatable 2–0 lead, They ultimately won the series 3–0.|$|E
5|$|Episode Two {{featured}} a new Hunter enemy, which {{had just been}} seen briefly in a recorded message in Episode One. The Hunter serves {{as one of the}} most dangerous enemies within the game and as means of emotional development for Alyx Vance. The Hunter is a powerful and <b>resilient</b> enemy which players must often run from while seeking a means to fight back; Episode Twos environments are designed with this in mind.|$|E
5|$|Feynman {{played an}} {{important}} role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings became less <b>resilient</b> in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.|$|E
5|$|In a deleted scene set {{after the}} end of the episode, Walter talks with the first patient Joseph Slater, who wonders why he was chosen to have a piece of Walter's brain. Walter {{responds}} it was a matter of circumstance, as Slater shared his blood type and had a young <b>resilient</b> brain. Walter also says he himself cannot be cured, as his madness had nothing to do with the missing parts of his brain.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climactic changes shows the bird was <b>resilient</b> within its ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|John, like Basil II before him, was a {{slow but}} steady campaigner. His armies made careful, {{measured}} gains over time, rarely exposing themselves to excessive risks, but nevertheless advancing inexorably towards their objectives. However, the Turks were <b>resilient,</b> {{and they did not}} allow themselves to be decisively defeated in any one engagement. They knew that it was difficult for the emperor to remain in one theatre of war for a long time, as events elsewhere often intervened that required his attention.|$|E
5|$|MRO's main {{computer}} is a 133MHz, 10.4million transistor, 32-bit, RAD750 processor. This processor is a radiation-hardened {{version of a}} PowerPC 750 or G3 processor with a specially built motherboard. The RAD750 is a successor to the RAD6000. This processor may seem underpowered in comparison to a modern PC processor, but it is extremely reliable, <b>resilient,</b> and can function in solar flare-ravaged deep space. The operating system software is VxWorks and has extensive fault protection protocols and monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these {{can be stored in}} a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is <b>resilient</b> and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Technology is {{researched}} {{at specific}} buildings, {{to which they}} are generally related; for example, religious research is done in temples and improved armor is researched in the storage pit. Technological advances come in many categories, such as military upgrades (better arms and armor for units), economic upgrades (increasing the efficiency of resource gathering), religious upgrades (faster conversion rates and more abilities for priests) and infrastructure upgrades (stronger fortifications and more <b>resilient</b> buildings). As basic technology research is completed, more advanced technologies may become available. Some technologies are not available to certain civilizations.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{economy was}} among the most {{advanced}} in Europe and the Mediterranean for many centuries. Europe, in particular, could not match Byzantine economic strength until late in the Middle Ages. Constantinople operated as a prime hub in a trading network that at various times extended across nearly all of Eurasia and North Africa, in particular as the primary western terminus of the famous Silk Road. Until {{the first half of the}} 6th century and in sharp contrast with the decaying West, the Byzantine economy was flourishing and <b>resilient.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency and IEMA began doing {{preliminary}} damage assessments on March 5, 2012 {{in order}} to determine the need for public assistance. The storm damage in Harrisburg dominated national airwaves for several days, with both Anderson Cooper and Diane Sawyer doing special reports. Both the New York Times and Chicago Tribune published articles about the <b>resilient</b> history and nature of Harrisburg to rebound from the tornado and floods that have hit the city since its founding in 1889.|$|E
5|$|The State Stud of the Hungarian Royal and Imperial Court, Mezőhegyes, {{was founded}} in 1784 to help meet the demand for horses. At the time, Hungary was home to 1.5 million horses, with the Hungarian cavalry {{requiring}} between 10,000 and 15,000 new mounts per year. Different horses fulfilled different roles: courtiers and aristocrats wanted agile, responsive, impressive riding horses for their military endeavors, <b>resilient</b> mounts for hunting on horseback, and elegant carriage horses. Fulfilling these demands led Mezőhegyes to develop several different breeds and strains: the Arab-influenced Gidrán, half-bred Furioso-North Star, and the heavier Nonius.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} has enjoyed positive critical reception. Several sources commended Elaine's aberration of the damsel in distress stereotype. Elaine has been ranked {{on a number}} of lists regarding the best female characters in the video game industry, and has received praise for her visual design and <b>resilient</b> personality. Critics have also complimented Boyd's and James' voice acting for the character in the later installments of the series, though some expressed disappointment at the character's reduced lines in The Curse of Monkey Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{controllers}} {{were designed}} to be tough enough to survive the forces of launch, and proved to be extremely <b>resilient</b> to damage. During {{the investigation of the}} Challenger accident the two MECs (from engines 2020 and 2021), recovered from the seafloor, were delivered to Honeywell Aerospace for examination and analysis. One controller was broken open on one side, and both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled and the memory units flushed with deionized water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of wood that have been {{positively}} identified: teak (Tectona grandis) {{was used for the}} through-beams and is <b>resilient</b> to the teredo worm (the Teredinidae family), the ceiling was made from a Cupressus genus which was possibly Cupressus torulosa, the stem-post is made of rosewood from the Leguminosae family (now called the Fabaceae) and either the Dalbergia or Pterocarpus genus. The wooden box found in the stern area of the shipwreck was made from an Artocarpus genus of the family Moraceae, more commonly known as the Mulberry family.|$|E
5|$|These {{ecological}} systems are always changing due to environmental factors. Geographic {{features such as}} the Western Flatwoods, Eastern Flatwoods, and the Atlantic Coastal Ridge affect drainage patterns. Geologic elements, climate, {{and the frequency of}} storms and fire are formative processes for the Everglades. They help to sustain and transform the ecosystems in the Shark River Valley, Big Cypress Swamp, coastal areas and mangrove forests. Ecosystems have been described as both fragile and <b>resilient.</b> Minor fluctuations in water levels have far-reaching consequences for many plant and animal species, and the system cycles and pulses with each change.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more <b>resilient</b> than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E
5|$|Hunters {{primarily}} {{attack the}} player by bracing themselves and firing bursts from their flechette cannon. Four flechettes can vaporize an ordinary human soldier. If {{they do not}} strike a living target, the flechette charge up for several seconds and then explode, dealing minor damage to everything nearby. Hunters may also conduct a charging attack or strike with their legs if the player gets too close. Hunters are vulnerable to all weapons, but to compensate, are still quite <b>resilient,</b> making explosives and the pulse rifle's charged energy ball the most attractive options. Objects thrown with the gravity gun are also effective, especially if the player catches some of their flechettes with the object before hurling it (one of the in-game Achievements). In outdoor environments, they can be run over with a vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} yellow {{stingray}} under Least Concern, citing its wide distribution and high abundance in certain regions. In addition, its small size implies relatively high productivity, {{which would make}} its population more <b>resilient</b> to fishing pressure. This species is not targeted commercially, but is probably taken incidentally by inshore fisheries throughout its range. It is also harvested for the home aquarium trade, being the most frequently available member of its family on the North American market. The extent of this trade {{has not yet been}} quantified. Another potential threat is habitat degradation, particularly to seagrass beds. No conservation measures have been enacted for this species.|$|E
5|$|The sicklefin weasel shark is not {{dangerous}} to humans. It is caught by artisanal fishers throughout its range, mostly in drifting and bottom gillnets {{but also in}} bottom trawls and on longlines. The meat is eaten, the fins are used in shark fin soup, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. However, {{the small size of}} this shark limits its economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sicklefin weasel shark as Vulnerable, noting that it is naturally uncommon and resides in heavily fished regions. In addition, compared to the related Australian weasel shark it is less productive and thus less <b>resilient</b> to withstand fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} bacterial chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily <b>resilient</b> spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|When the North American Plate on its slow journey westwards {{encountered}} the Pacific Plate approximately 250 {{million years ago}} during the Paleozoic, the latter began to subduct under the North American continent. Intense pressure underground caused some of the Pacific Plate to melt, and the resulting upwelling magma pushed up and hardened into the granite batholith that makes up much of the Sierra Nevada. Extensive layers of marine sedimentary rock that originally made up the ancient Pacific seabed were also pushed up by the rising granite, and the ancestral Merced River formed on this layer of rock. Over millions of years, the Merced cut a deep canyon through the softer sedimentary rock, eventually hitting the hard granite beneath. The encounter with this <b>resilient</b> rock layer caused the Merced River to mostly stop its downcutting, although tributary streams continued to widen the ancient canyon.|$|E
5|$|With a very <b>resilient</b> {{high-pressure}} area to its north, {{the depression}} continued moving due west at an unusually low latitude {{for most of}} its existence. The system gradually organized due to low wind shear. After the outflow increased and the circulation became better established, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bret early on August5. Initially, the agency expected the storm would attain hurricane status while moving west-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea, although the storm would maintain its westward track. Early on August6, Bret attained peak winds of 60mph (95km/h), fueled by warm waters and increased banding around a central dense overcast. The circulation became exposed late on August6, but the thunderstorms soon refired over the center. At 07:00UTC on the next day, Bret struck the island of Trinidad near Galera Point. The storm moved across the northern portion of the island, and later made landfall in northeastern Venezuela near Macuro.|$|E
25|$|UNESCAP funded {{research}} on how communities show resiliency {{in the wake of}} natural disasters. They found that, physically, communities were more <b>resilient</b> if they banded together and made resiliency an effort of the whole community. Social support is key in <b>resilient</b> behavior, and especially the ability to pool resources. In pooling social, natural, and economic resources, they found that communities were more <b>resilient</b> and able to over come disasters much faster than communities with an individualistic mindset.|$|E
