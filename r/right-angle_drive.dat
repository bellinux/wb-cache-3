50|$|An axial-flow pump, or AFP, is {{a common}} type of pump that {{essentially}} consists of a propeller (an axial impeller) in a pipe. The propeller can be driven directly by a sealed motor in the pipe or by electric motor or petrol/diesel engines mounted to the pipe from the outside or by a <b>right-angle</b> <b>drive</b> shaft that pierces the pipe.|$|E
50|$|This {{principle}} of divided drive already being {{established for the}} front of the Trado, it was a minor step for van Doorne to divide the drive to the rear wheels as well. The DAF YA-328 used walking beams where the axle {{was no more than a}} pivot and the drive was supplied entirely by external longitudinal drive shafts, one on each side. As was usual for heavy vehicles of this period, the final drives and <b>right-angle</b> <b>drive</b> to the stub axles were combined through a worm gear box. This also had he advantage that it is easy to connect such boxes in series, using the rear end of the worm shaft as an output.|$|E

25|$|On August 12, 1996, Mayne Queen {{departed}} Swartz Bay {{terminal and}} ran aground off Piers Island after losing steering control. The grounding occurred while performing a regular weekly {{test of the}} batteries for the steering control system. A crew member overheard {{there was going to}} be a test, and in an attempt to be helpful and without direction, cut all power from the vessel's steering batteries, as he had done at night when the ship was stored, not realizing that the test in question only required the removal of a battery charger and that his assistance was neither requested nor required. No one was injured in the incident, and the vessel was assisted off the rocks at high tide, but it suffered extensive damage to its propulsion system, having two of the four steering and propulsion pods for the <b>right-angle</b> <b>drives</b> sheared off and one of the two remaining pods suffering propeller damage.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} a scheme for a {{noise suppression system}} {{to be used with}} an afocal coherent optical data processor. The noise averaging scheme is based on the simple principle of moving input and output film planes together during exposure; the noise pattern remains stationary while the desired (filtered) image moves through it. The noise suppression system consists of a <b>drive</b> motor, <b>right-angle</b> gear box, reversing gear assemblage, <b>right-angle</b> gear <b>drive,</b> and micrometer adjusting translation tables. The device was tested by using a Sayce target containing fundamental spatial frequencies from 5 lines/mm to 100 lines/mm as the input signal. The output was photographed on Pan-X 35 -mm film with and without the noise suppression system in operation. Microdensitometer scans of the exposed output film show that without noise averaging, resolution is good to about 80 lines/mm, while with noise averaging, it is good to about 35 lines/mm. A brief analysis of errors in the mechanical parts of the system reponsible for the upper limit of resolution is presented...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{to improve}} speed and energy {{efficiency}} of a sprawling-type quadruped robot, {{we focused on}} three design concepts (increase of walking velocity to reduce cost of transport, using the trot gait as low duty factor and safety gait, and increase of gear ratio of the actuator supporting gravitational force). Based on the concepts, we developed a sprawling-type quadruped robot named TITAN-XIII. To achieve a compact and low inertia leg, <b>right-angle</b> type wire <b>driven</b> mechanism was proposed and adopted to the robot. To confirm {{the validity of the}} developed sprawling-type quadruped robot, several experiments was conducted. In the experiment, the robot walked at 1.38 m/s and minimum cost of transport of 1.76 was achieved. We compared the walking speed and minimum COT with other quadruped robots. In comparison, TITAN-XIII shows almost the same level of walking velocity and energy efficiency. Considering advantages of the sprawling-type quadruped robot, which are static stability and wide range of motion, we can say the sprawling-type quadruped robot is highly practical on rough terrain.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{development}} of a sprawling-type quadruped robot named TITAN-XIII which is capable of high speed and energy efficient walking. We consider a sprawling-type quadruped robot is practical, because of its high stability which comes from the large supporting leg polygon and the low center of gravity. However in previous researches, the speed and the energy efficiency of a sprawling-type quadruped robot is lower than a mammal-type quadruped robot. Since cost of transport (COT) can be reduced by increase of walking velocity, we decided to design a fast walking sprawling-type quadruped robot. As a demonstrator, we developed the sprawling-type quadruped robot named TITAN-XIII. For a lightweight and compact leg, the <b>right-angle</b> type wire <b>driven</b> mechanism is adopted to the robot. To confirm its performance, several experiments were carried out and the robot walked at 1.38 m/s and COT of 1.76 was achieved. Finally, we compared the performance of TITAN-XIII with other quadruped robots, and confirm that its performance is almost same level as mammal-type quadruped robots.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: According to the {{microstructure}} {{characteristics of the}} optical components surface, the paper designs a bridge <b>right-angle</b> flexure hinge <b>driven</b> by a piezoelectric ceramic. It meets the driving micro-displacement magnification requirements and solves the coupling problem in work. Using the calculation formulas of statics and calculation formula of bending moment, the thesis explores the motion law of piezoelectric ceramics with 1 KHZ excitation frequency. Through {{the exploration of the}} factors of bridge flexure hinge angle stiffness and tensile stiffness, the mathematical model of input displacement and output displacement is established. Studying the theory about the elimination of motion process coupling, it excavates the function relationships of flexure hinge angle and magnification. And the relationship is unearthed among driving force of piezoelectric ceramic, the flexure hinge stiffness, cutting force and mass of cutter system. The paper establishes their mathematical model between the above elements and the output micro-displacement, and the theoretical result is calculated by Matlab. Finally, using Pro/Engineer 3 D digital modeling and analysis of simulation results by Ansys, it is found that the error can be controlled in an acceptable range by comparing the theoretical results with simulation results. Through the above analysis, the theoretical design is found to be reliable and effective...|$|R
30|$|One {{problem of}} this wire <b>driven</b> {{mechanism}} with <b>right-angle</b> type is that, as the output pulley rotates {{the point of}} separation of the wire on the input pulley moves up and down because of the winding of the wire as shown in Fig. 11. This motion changes the path length of the wire and adds extra tension on the wire. Theoretically speaking in order to solve this problem, an input pulley or an output pulley must have sliding degree of freedom along its axis to absorb {{the up and down}} motion, but this makes the mechanism large and complicated. Therefore, we examined the elongation of the wire in <b>right-angle</b> type wired <b>driven</b> mechanism. In Fig. 11, L is the length of the wire between the input pulley and the output pulley in the standard posture where theoretically the wire is perpendicular to the input pulley. Now assuming the output pulley rotates θ, and the input pulley rotates ϕ = reduction ratio ×θ. Then the point of separation of the wire is moved distance dl = d ×ϕ / 2 π, where d is diameter of the wire. Along with the moving of the point of separation of the wire, the length of wire between the input pulley and the output pulley is changed to L'. This new wire length L' can be expressed as √(dl^ 2 + L^ 2). As a result, wire elongation L'-L can be calculated. Since Axis 2 has larger reduction ratio of 8.46 than Axis 3 we will check elongation of Axis 2. Considering L is 40  mm and output pulley rotates ± 90 °, estimated elongation L'-L is only 0.06  mm. Thus we consider this elongation is sufficiently tolerable and does not need a complicated mechanism.|$|R
