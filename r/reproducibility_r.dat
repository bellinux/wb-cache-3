The use of mathematical models of infections may propitiate better comprehension of this phenomenon, and provide subsidies for intervention in public health. This study had as aim describe the <b>reproducibility</b> rate (<b>R</b> 0) through simplification of mathematical model of epidemiology, estimate the value of R 0 in influenza pandemic occurred in 2009 in Brazil and in Brazilian states, and compare R 0 with infected population. Methods: It is an ecological study that uses a public domain data bank with notifications of influenza occurred in Brazil in 2009. A simplified analysis of compartmental model was proposed: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R), in order to compare the viral <b>reproducibility</b> rate (<b>R</b> 0) in Brazilian states. The value of R 0 was also correlated with percentage of infected individuals. Results: An epidemic outbreak was configured in twelve states and in throughout Brazil, and more than one epidemic outbreak occurred in five states and in Distrito Federal. The correlation between R 0 and the percentage of infected was strong and positive (r = 0. 74), and demonstrated that a higher reproductive rate is associated with higher viral contagion. Conclusion: It is possible to conclude that the athematical simplification performed in this study points to another way to identify epidemic, because it is a basic analytical tool, and there is no complexity in computational implementations.

40|$|Polysaccharides are food {{ingredients}} that critically determine rheological properties and shelf life. A {{qualitative and quantitative}} assessment on food-specific polysaccharide mixtures by 1 H NMR is presented. The method {{is based on the}} identification of intact polysaccharides, combined with a quantitative analysis of their monosaccharide constituents. Identification of the polysaccharides is achieved by 1 H NMR line shape fitting with pure compound spectra. The monomeric composition was determined using the Saeman hydrolysis procedure, followed by direct monosaccharide quantification by 1 H NMR. In the quantification, both the monosaccharide degradation during hydrolysis, as well as a correction for the non-instantaneous polysaccharide dissolution were taken into account. These factors were particularly important for the quantification of pectins. The method showed overall good repeatability (RSD r = 4. 1 ± 0. 9 %) and within-laboratory <b>reproducibility</b> (RSD <b>R</b> = 6. 1 ± 1. 4 %) for various food polysaccharides.

PGE 2 is known to increase cellular cAMP levels, thereby activating PKA. The in-depth analysis revealed temporal regulation {{of a wide variety}} of phosphosites associated not only with PKA, but also with a variety of other classes of kinases. Following PGE 2 stimulation, several pathways became only transiently activated, revealing that in-depth dynamic profiling requires techniques with high temporal resolution. Moreover, the large publicly available dataset provides a valuable resource for downstream PGE 2 signaling dynamics in T cells, and cAMP-mediated signaling in particular. More generally, our method enables in-depth, quantitative, high-throughput phosphoproteome screening on any system, requiring very little sample, sample preparation, and analysis time...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A {{preoperative}} {{prediction of}} the 360 ° point insertion depth would aid {{the planning of}} electric acoustic stimulation (EAS) implantation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to establish whether the distance between the round window and the opposite cochlear wall on CT or MR imaging may be used to predict the length of a cochlear implant electrode array required to be inserted to the 360 ° point of the basal turn. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT and MR imaging data were studied in 19 patients undergoing cochlear implantation. Distances were measured between the round window and the opposite outer cochlear wall on an oblique paracoronal reformatted image. Adjusted distance measurements were applied to a spiral function to estimate the length of an electrode array extending between the round window entry point and the 360 ° point. This was compared with measurements of implant length to this insertion depth on postoperative CT. RESULTS: Intraobserver reproducibility for each of the 2 observers was r 0. 85 / 0. 55 for CT and r 0. 87 / 0. 67 for MR imaging. Interobserver <b>reproducibility</b> was <b>r</b> 0. 68 for CT and r 0. 84 for MR imaging. There was no bias between CT and MR imaging measurements, with a mean difference of less than 0. 1 mm. CT and MR imaging estimates markedly correlated with the actual length of th...|$|R
40|$|An interlaboratory {{validation}} study {{funded by the}} European Commission, Directorate Generale for Health and Consumer Protection (DG SANCO), was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for the determination of semicarbazide (SEM) in different types of baby food at a possible future European regulatory limit (10 ng/g). The test portion of the sample was extracted with hydrochloric acid, and the analyte was derivatized with 2 -nitrobenzaldehyde, with 1, 2 (15 N 2, 13 C) SEM as an internal standard. The extract was neutralized and then purified on a solid-phase extraction cartridge. The SEM was determined by reversed-phase LC with detection by MS/MS. Apple putee, rice pudding, and meat/vegetable meal baby food materials, spiked with SEM at levels of about 3, 10, and 30 ng/g, respectively, were sent to 20 laboratories in 12 different European countries, which submitted results from 17 participants. Recoveries ranged from 88. 8 to 106. 1 %. Based on results for spiked samples (blind pairs at 3 levels), the relative standard deviations for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 4. 2 to 6. 9 % and the relative standard deviations for <b>reproducibility</b> (RSD <b>R)</b> ranged from 16. 6 to 24. 3 %. The method showed acceptable within- and between-laboratory precision for all 3 matrixes, as evidenced by HorRat values, at the target levels for the determination of SEM. JRC.
