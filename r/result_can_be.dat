5|$|Some correctional facilities, like San Quentin State Prison, require {{visitors}} to either cut their bras {{and remove the}} underwire, or temporarily use a soft cup bra provided by the institution before being granted entry.

Other facilities require women to remove their underwire bras in a bathroom, pass through the metal detector, {{and return to the}} bathroom to put their bras back on.|$|E

25|$|An {{operation}} can {{be legal}} in principle, but the <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> impossible to represent in the specified format, because the exponent {{is too large}} or too small to encode in the exponent field. Such an event is called an overflow (exponent too large), underflow (exponent too small) or denormalization (precision loss).|$|E
25|$|Also in the 17th century, Girard Desargues, {{motivated}} by the theory of perspective, introduced the concept of idealized points, lines, and planes at infinity. The <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> considered {{as a type of}} generalized geometry, projective geometry, {{but it can also be}} used to produce proofs in ordinary Euclidean geometry in which the number of special cases is reduced.|$|E
25|$|A map graph is a graph {{formed from}} {{a set of}} finitely many simply-connected interior-disjoint regions in the plane by {{connecting}} two regions when they share at least one boundary point.

25|$|Using the Gelfond–Schneider theorem and Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem {{many of the}} {{standard}} elementary functions can be proved to return transcendental results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However, determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results need to be computed, before a correctly rounded <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> guaranteed, may demand a lot of computation time.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiment}} of Frederick Thomas Trouton (1902). A condenser {{was brought}} parallel to Earth's motion, {{and it was}} assumed that momentum is produced when the condenser is charged. The negative <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> explained by Lorentz's theory, according to which the electromagnetic momentum compensates the momentum due to Earth's motion. Lorentz could also show, that the sensitivity of the apparatus was much too low to observe such an effect.|$|E
25|$|A {{classification}} model (classifier or diagnosis) is {{a mapping}} of instances between certain classes/groups. The classifier or diagnosis <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a real value (continuous output), {{in which case}} the classifier boundary between classes must be determined by a threshold value (for instance, to determine whether a person has hypertension based on a blood pressure measure). Or it can be a discrete class label, indicating one of the classes.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} results obtained for Yang–Mills theory is asymptotic freedom. This <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> obtained by assuming that the coupling constant g is small (so small nonlinearities), as for high energies, and applying perturbation theory. The relevance of this result {{is due to the fact}} that a Yang–Mills theory that describes strong interaction and asymptotic freedom permits proper treatment of experimental results coming from deep inelastic scattering.|$|E
25|$|When the {{spruce and}} aspen forest types are mixed, the <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> quite {{different}} from the aspen or spruce stands. Animal and vegetation associations from each type combine to create considerable diversity of habitat which is typical of either spruce or aspen stands. The mixture of the transition soils provides an attractive environment with either pure spruce or pure aspen woodlands. An example of a bird which prefers a mixed wood habitat is the yellow-rumped warbler.|$|E
25|$|Multiplying {{permutations}} {{written in}} cycle notation follows no easily described pattern, and {{the cycles of}} the product can be entirely {{different from those of}} the permutations being composed. However the cycle structure is preserved in the special case of conjugating a permutation σ by another permutation π, which means forming the product π·σ·π−1. Here the cycle notation of the <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> obtained by taking the cycle notation for σ and applying π to all the entries in it.|$|E
