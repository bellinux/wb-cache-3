This impedes the ability to compare behaviour-change interventions, synthesise evidence on their effectiveness and replicate effective interventions. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a checklist of elements that should be described to ensure adequate reporting of GB-BCIs. Methods: A range of characteristics needed to replicate GB-BCIs were extracted from the literature and precisely defined. An abbreviated checklist and a coder manual were developed, pilot tested and refined. The final checklist and coder manual were used to identify the presence or absence of specified <b>reporting</b> <b>elements</b> in 30 published {{descriptions of}} GB-BCIs by two independent coders.

40|$|Accurate {{acquisition}} and effective translation of customer requirement s are two key links in product configuration design. In the paper, two concepts are introduced for customer requirement decomposition. One is the <b>requirement</b> <b>element,</b> {{and the other}} is the granularity of <b>requirement</b> <b>element.</b> Moreover, the controlling principle for granularity of <b>requirement</b> <b>element</b> is given and the method of requirement decomposition is proposed from the point of semantic meaning. This method means semantic segmentation, semantic translation, supplement or subdivision of human-machine-environment and semantic combination. Customer’s customized requirements could be decomposed effectively according to the proposed method of requirement decomposition as well as by controlling the granularity of <b>requirement</b> <b>element</b> reasonably. On that basis, in customer requirement translation, improved house of quality (IHoQ) is constructed by combining the characteristics of <b>requirement</b> <b>element</b> and the demands of configuration design and using the thought of quality function development (QFD). So, a new approach of customer requirement analysis based on <b>requirement</b> <b>element</b> and IHoQ is put forward by integrating organically the technology of requirement decomposition and the tool of requirement translation. Accurate {{acquisition and}} effective translation for customer requirement s could be realized by using this approach. Finally, the customized design of a money-binding machine is taken as an example to validate the effectivity of proposed method. </p...|$|R

Code requires DOD to <b>report</b> on 26 <b>elements</b> including readiness deficiencies, remedial actions, and data specific to the military services {{in the areas of}} personnel, training, and equipment. In analyzing DOD's reports, GAO found that DOD addressed 18 of the 26 elements, partially addressed 3 elements and did not <b>report</b> on 5 <b>elements.</b> For the elements partially addressed [...] personnel stability, training operations tempo, and deployed equipment [...] reporting was incomplete because some services reported information and others did not report. When all the services <b>reported</b> on an <b>element,</b> they at times did so inconsistently, with varying amounts and types of information. For example, the services all reported information on training commitments and deployments, but used different timeframes when providing information on planned training events in the future.

However, DOD has not taken steps to analyze whether this information could be used to meet the related <b>reporting</b> <b>element.</b> Without issuing guidance on the type and amount of information to be included by each service and analyzing alternative information it could provide to meet the required elements, DOD risks continuing to provide inconsistent and incomplete information to Congress. ...|$|R

Therefore, the use of Integrated Reports is seen as a critical move towards the integration of financial and non-financial information as it takes into consideration the economic, social and environmental factors. It is also expected that Integrated Reporting will create value to the organization. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the presence of integrated <b>reporting</b> <b>elements</b> among Malaysian companies as integrated reporting is still voluntary in nature in Malaysia. The internal and external forces that drive companies to embark on integrated reporting in the context of agency and stakeholder theory were investigated including the subsequent effect of such reporting in creating value to the organizations.
