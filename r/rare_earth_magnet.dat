50|$|This finding by the CPSC of {{consumer}} risk {{and the associated}} rule restricting <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnet</b> size was vacated by a US Federal court in November, 2016.

50|$|This type of sensor {{normally}} {{consists of}} two hall effect sensors, a <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnet</b> and appropriate evaluation electronics. The field of the magnet is modulated by the passing target teeth. This modulation is registered by the Hall sensors, converted by a comparator stage to a square wave signal and amplified in a driver stage.|$|E
50|$|A {{ureteric}} stent {{may also}} be retrieved {{without the use of}} a cystoscope by means of a magnetic removal system. The stent inserted has a small <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnet</b> attached to its bladder end which dangles freely within the bladder. When the stent needs to be removed a small catheter with a similar magnet is inserted into the bladder and the two magnets connect and the catheter and stent can be simply removed. This eliminates the need for a costly and invasive cystoscopy in both adults and children.|$|E

50|$|The greater {{strength}} of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnets</b> is mostly due to two factors. First, their crystalline structures have very high magnetic anisotropy. This means a crystal {{of the material}} preferentially magnetizes along a specific crystal axis but {{is very difficult to}} magnetize in other directions. Like other <b>magnets,</b> <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnets</b> are composed of microcrystalline grains which are aligned in a powerful magnetic field during manufacture so their magnetic axes all point in the same direction. The resistance of the crystal lattice to turning its direction of magnetization gives these compounds a very high magnetic coercivity (resistance to being demagnetized).|$|R

50|$|This design {{contains}} a linear electrical generator which charges a batterylike supercapacitor when the flashlight is shaken lengthwise. The battery or capacitor powers a white LED lamp. The linear generator {{consists of a}} sliding <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnet</b> which moves {{back and forth through}} the center of a solenoid (a coil of copper wire) when it is shaken. A current is induced in the loops of wire by Faraday's law of induction each time the magnet slides through, which charges the capacitor through a rectifier and some other circuitry.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{important}} properties used {{to compare}} permanent magnets are: remanence (Br), which measures {{the strength of the}} magnetic field; coercivity (Hci), the material's resistance to becoming demagnetized; energy product (BHmax), the density of magnetic energy; and Curie temperature (Tc), the temperature at which the material loses its magnetism. Rare earth magnets have higher remanence, much higher coercivity and energy product, but (for neodymium) lower Curie temperature than other types. The table below compares the magnetic performance of the two types of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnet,</b> neodymium (Nd2Fe14B) and samarium-cobalt (SmCo5), with other types of permanent magnets.Source: ...|$|E

Wilson Benesch were awarded £250,000 for an {{application}} that outlined a proposal {{to develop a new}} dynamic drive unit based around materials technology previously not used in drive unit design. The project was code named 'The Bishop Project' by Wilson Benesch. The outcome was the company's Tactic Multirole Drive Unit. The drive unit features a Neodymium <b>Rare</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Magnet</b> and an Isotactic Polypropylene cone that was developed through collaborative research with the University of Leeds and Professor Ian Ward. The first product which used this drive technology was the Bishop loudspeaker in 1999. The drive technology was also subsequently used in the company's Odyssey Range and the Square Series.|$|E

5000|$|An LED throwie {{is a small}} LED {{attached}} to a coin battery and a <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnet</b> (usually with conductive epoxy or electrical tape), used {{for the purpose of}} creating non-destructive graffiti and light displays. Artists use them by throwing individual LEDs onto metallic objects, like public sculpture or road infrastructure. By throwing LEDs onto an object, the object itself acts as a canvas. LED throwies were invented in 2006 by the artists Evan Roth and James Powderly the founder of Graffiti Research Lab at Eyebeam Atelier open lab NYC. After Graffiti Research Lab posted the instructions how to make a throwie on Instructables, [...] LED throwies went viral on the Internet and could be found in advertising, were for sale as DIY kits or further developed by other artists and hackers worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|A samarium-cobalt (SmCo) magnet, {{a type of}} <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnet,</b> is {{a strong}} {{permanent}} magnet made of an alloy of samarium and cobalt. They were developed in the early 1960s based on work done by Karl Strnat and Alden Ray at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the University of Dayton, respectively. In particular, Strnat and Ray developed the first formulation of SmCo5. [...] They are generally ranked similarly in strength to neodymium magnets, but have higher temperature ratings and higher coercivity. They are brittle, and prone to cracking and chipping. Samarium-cobalt magnets have maximum energy products (BHmax) that range from 16 megagauss-oersteds (MG&middot;Oe) to 33 MG·Oe, that is approx. 128 kJ/m3 to 264 kJ/m3; their theoretical limit is 34 MG·Oe, about 272 kJ/m3. They are available in two [...] "series", namely Series 1:5 and Series 2:17.|$|E
5000|$|Moving magnet stud {{detectors}} use {{a neodymium magnet}} that {{is suspended}} in an enclosure and free to move in response to hidden metal. The strength of this <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnet</b> and the easy movement of the magnet allow moving magnetic stud detectors {{to work on a}} broad range of construction types. The magnet is suspended {{in such a way that}} it always sits in its [...] "home" [...] position until it is moved directly over a metal fastener or metal stud. On walls with shallow fasteners, the magnet moves towards the wall with such velocity that it makes a distinct thud sound when it hits the wall. Because a moving magnet is not dependent on the operator to feel the attraction to the metal, fasteners buried more deeply under plaster or tile can be located with this detector. For deeper fasteners, the sound is softer since the speed of movement is slower.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new hybrid rotor {{geometry}} is suggested for line start permanent magnet synchronous motor, which uses circumferentially {{as well as}} radially magnetized magnets. It is derived from two basic configurations of interior permanent magnet motor and has the advantages of both the configurations. The main objective {{is to increase the}} air gap flux density of PM motor using ferrites magnets. The proposed geometry is also suitable for bonded <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnets.</b> The four pole configuration is studied using FEM analysis and different alternatives are suggested. A hybrid rotor using both ferrites and bonded <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnets</b> is also studied as a compromise between the performance and the cost.

50|$|The modern {{development}} of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnets</b> makes the simple magneto alternator {{a more practical}} proposition as a power generator, as these permit a greatly increased field strength. As the magnets are compact and of light weight, they generally form the rotor, allowing the output windings {{to be placed on}} the stator, avoiding the need for brushgear.|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{method is}} introduced here whereby using {{two sets of}} arrays of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnets</b> aligned opposite each other {{in order to create}} a repulsion force owing to the like poles when facing close to each other. Ballistic test samples of aramid fibre (Kevlar K 29) and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) were sandwiched by two sets of opposing magnets. Ballistic test was conducted using a gas gun with a 7. 62 mm diameter projectile at a velocity ranging from 160 to 220 m/s. High speed camera was used to capture the ballistics testing and it shows that the magnetic repulsion force created by the opposing <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnets</b> managed to suppress the projectile from advancing into the front face of the aramid fibre. Similarly, when magnets were used, the UHMWPE sample shows the projectile perforated through the first few sheets and finally rested on the last sheet showing partial perforation...|$|R
50|$|Non {{contact type}} TPS {{work on the}} {{principle}} of Hall effect or Inductive sensors, or magnetoresistive technologies, wherein generally the magnet or inductive loop is the dynamic part which is mounted on the butterfly valve throttle spindle/shaft gear and the sensor & signal processing circuit board is mounted within the ETC gear box cover and is stationary. When the magnet/inductive loop mounted on the spindle which is rotated from the lower mechanical stop to WOT, there is a change in the magnetic field for the sensor. The change in the magnetic field is sensed by the sensor and the voltage generated is given as the input to the ECU. Normally a two pole <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnet</b> is used for the TPS due to their high Curie temperatures required in the under-hood vehicle environment. The magnet may be of diametrical type, ring type, rectangular or segment type. The magnet is defined to have a certain magnetic field that does not vary significantly with time or temperature.In case of failure of the TPS operation the CHECK ENGINE light remains illuminated even if there is no problem or error in the ECU. It cannot be corrected by clearing ECU errors by running diagnostic software. In order to rectify the malfunction the TPS needs {{to be replaced by a}} new one.|$|E

40|$|Fundamental {{properties}} {{of a shock}} compaction technique of applying converged underwater shock waves have been investigated for <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnet</b> powders. The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnet</b> made from Fe-Nd-B powder is being developed {{to have a high}} magnet performance. Usually this powder is consolidated using static high pressure and bond materials. It is very difficult to obtain over 80 % magnet purity and, thus, it is difficult to achieve maximum performance. To solve this problem, shock compaction techniques involving use of explosives were tested and the results are presented here. The equation of state (EOS) of Fe-Nd-B powders is first verified by a quasi-static experiment. The applicability of the EOS is confirmed by a new shock loading test which is proposed in this paper. Both numerical simulation and experiments on the consolidation of the magnet poweders are carried out. A fine-bonded bulk with of over 96 % is obtained...|$|E
50|$|The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> (lanthanide) {{elements}} are metals that are ferromagnetic, meaning that like iron {{they can be}} permanently magnetized, but their Curie temperatures are below room temperature, so in pure form their magnetism only appears at low temperatures. However, they form compounds with the transition metals such as iron, nickel, and cobalt, {{and some of these}} compounds have Curie temperatures well above room temperature. <b>Rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnets</b> are made from these compounds.|$|R
40|$|The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> {{elements}} are {{a group of}} 17 elements consisting of the lantahnide series, scandium and yttrium. The application with the largest <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> consumption is the permanent <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnets.</b> The neodymium-iron-boron magnets are the strongest permanent magnetic material known and are widely used. There is a concern {{that there will be}} a shortage in Nd-Fe-B magnets in short time. This has lead to an increased interest in the recycling of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>magnets</b> in the world. This project gives a very brief introduction to the Nd-Fe-B magnets, their uses and recycling. Two types of experiments that aims at recovery of neodymium from Nd-Fe-B magnets have been performed; extraction of neodymium by the use of molten silver and extraction of neodymium by direct oxidation. In the liquid silver experiments, extraction was obtained, but the analysis gave equivocal results. In the direct oxidation experiment, the separation of an iron phase and a neodymium oxide phase failed, and the experiment was not seen as successful. Magnetic waste from WEEE Recycling was also performed, and it turned out to contain small amounts of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements. </p...|$|R
