40|$|Objective: Manual {{searches}} are supplemental {{approaches to}} database searches to identify additional primary studies for systematic reviews. The authors {{argue that these}} manual approaches, in particular hand-searching and perusing <b>reference</b> <b>lists,</b> are often considered the same yet lead to different outcomes. Methods: We conducted a PubMed search for systematic reviews in the top 10 dermatology journals (January 2006 –January 2016). After screening, the final sample comprised 292 reviews. Statements related to manual searches were extracted from each review and categorized by the primary and secondary authors. Each statement was categorized as either ‘‘Search of Reference List,’’ ‘‘Hand Search,’’ ‘‘Both,’’ or ‘‘Unclear. ’’ Results: Of the 292 systematic reviews included in our sample, 143 reviews (48. 97 %) did not report a hand-search or scan of <b>reference</b> <b>lists.</b> One-hundred thirty-six reviews (46. 58 %) reported searches of <b>reference</b> <b>lists,</b> while 4 reviews (1. 37 %) reported systematic hand-searches. Three reviews (1. 03 %) reported use of both hand-searches and scanning <b>reference</b> <b>lists.</b> Six reviews (2. 05 %) were classified as unclear due to vague wording. Conclusions: Authors of systematic reviews published in dermatology journals in our study sample scanned <b>reference</b> <b>lists</b> more frequently than they conducted hand-searches, possibly contributing to biased search outcomes. We encourage systematic reviewers to routinely practice hand-searching {{in order to minimize}} bias...|$|R
