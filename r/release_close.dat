[...] Jean Renoir compared Spielberg's storytelling to Jules Verne and Georges Méliès. Ray Bradbury declared it the greatest science fiction film ever made.

2500|$|The band {{aimed to}} have a more {{experimental}} and harder-edged rock sound to the album, not wanting to be pigeonholed into the pop rock genre after the success of [...] "Semi-Charmed Life" [...] from their prior album. Cadogan personally aimed for the album's sound to reflect all of the music he had encountered, due to it always being planned as one of the last albums released in the 20th century.

5000|$|... 1958: Zunow SLR (Japan): first {{internal}} auto-diaphragm (Zunow-matic Diaphragm System) 35 mm SLR and lenses. Well-integrated focal-plane shutter, instant return mirror, pentaprism and auto-diaphragm {{design with}} excellent lenses and good accessory system. Stopping down (closing) the lens aperture (iris) {{to prepare for}} exposure transmits less light to the mirror and the viewfinder may become very dim - perhaps even {{too dark to see}} the image. Auto-diaphragms coupled to the shutter release that automatically stop down when the mirror swings up and reopen when the mirror comes down provides almost continuous fully open aperture viewing. Auto-diaphragm lenses and instant return mirror, focal-plane shutter SLRs require precise camera-to-lens linkage, but can choreograph the entire shutter-button <b>release,</b> <b>close</b> lens, raise mirror, open shutter, close shutter, lower mirror, open lens exposure sequence in as little as ⅛th second. Originally, these were mechanical spring/gear/lever systems energized concurrent with manually winding the film, but modern systems are electronically timed and operated by an electromagnet. The financially weak Zunow company was unable to capitalize on its design; few examples of the camera (and much fewer of the wide and tele lenses for it) were produced before the company switched back to lenses for other companies' cameras. Zunow went bankrupt in 1961. Note, the 1954 version of the Ihagee Exakta VX (East Germany) 35 mm SLR introduced an external auto-diaphragm lens system using a spring-loaded shutter button plunger connection rod.|$|E
