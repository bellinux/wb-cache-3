40|$|With the {{implementation}} of the classes of <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> performance for construction products, the so-called "Euroclasses", a new test method has been introduced, namely the SBI test method (EN 13823). This method is an intermediate scale test and it has been developed to allow harmonization of the <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> classification in Europe. As the test is new and needs rather large samples there will be a need from the industry to have an easy and cost effective tool for product development and quality control with respect to this method. In the near future also the possibility of using an appeal procedure by running the reference scenario test, ISO 9705, will be possible. Also for this test it wouldbe an advantage to have a screening method. In this project such a tool has been developed by using cone calorimeter data according to ISO 5660. The tool allows prediction of the major classification parameters for HRR and SPR in the SBI and room corner. Within the project a software tool has also been developed. The results of the project show that the predictions are satisfactory and that the tool will be powerful for the product development by industry.

40|$|The fire {{technical}} {{properties of}} products are determining factors for the initiation {{and growth of}} fires. Measurement of fire technical properties and the understanding of how they relate to real hazards are therefore important for fire safety. This work deals with the fire technical properties of building products, their tendency to ignite and release heat in different fire scenarios. Building products have traditionally been tested and classified according to national building codes in most countries of the world. In Europe, the different countries all used to have different fire tests and classification systems {{and it was not}} possible to translate data between them. Therefore, a common European system for <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> testing and classification, known as the Euroclasses, was created. The SBI (Single Burning Item), used for testing and the FIGRA (FIre Growth RAte) parameter used for evaluation of a products <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> properties were introduced. This work deals with this development and its significance for the European evaluation system for <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> properties. A fire growth that leads to full room involvement, flashover, can happen fast. Predicting flashover times using product data is therefore important for fire safety. Frequently used are the so-called thermal models that by calculations of the products surface temperature predict ignition time and flame spread rate. Alternatively, the ignition time for different heat fluxes are used directly. The products heat release rate, HRR, from a small-scale test is also needed. This work discusses some of the thermal models and presents a straightforward analytical formulation that works well for different room sizes and for the SBI test. In the model formulations heat release rate divided by ignition time appears. These parameters when taken from a small-scale test can be seen as a product property for example for linings in a room fire scenario. In addition, the FIGRA parameter, defined as the maximum of heat release rate divided by time, is shown to predict well the tendency to fire growth for a number of different products in different scenarios. FIGRA is also shown to predict HRR and time to flashover in the Room Corner Test for interior linings...|$|E

The idea is to partition the node set into clusters so that each node can individually detect fires using classification techniques. Once a fire is detected, the corresponding node will send an alert to its cluster-head. This alert will then be routed via gateways and other cluster-heads to the sink in order to inform the firefighters. The approach is validated using the CupCarbon simulator.
