40|$|Background: Improvements to {{prognostic}} {{models in}} metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer {{have the potential}} to augment clinical trial design and guide treatment strategies. In partnership with Project Data Sphere, a not-for-profit initiative allowing data from cancer clinical trials to be shared broadly with researchers, we designed an open-data, crowdsourced, DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) challenge to not only identify a better prognostic model for prediction of survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer but also engage a community of international data scientists to study this disease. Methods Data from the comparator arms of four phase 3 clinical trials in first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were obtained from Project Data Sphere, comprising 476 patients treated with docetaxel and prednisone from the ASCENT 2 trial, 526 patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone, and placebo in the MAINSAIL trial, 598 patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone or prednisolone, and placebo in the VENICE trial, and 470 patients treated with docetaxel and placebo in the ENTHUSE 33 trial. Datasets consisting of more than 150 clinical variables were curated centrally, including demographics, laboratory values, medical history, lesion sites, and previous treatments. Data from ASCENT 2, MAINSAIL, and VENICE were released publicly to be used as training data to predict the outcome of interestnamely, overall survival. Clinical data were also released for ENTHUSE 33, but data for outcome variables (overall survival and event status) were hidden from the challenge participants so that ENTHUSE 33 could be used for independent validation. Methods were evaluated using the integrated time-dependent area under the curve (iAUC). The reference model, based on eight clinical variables and a penalised Cox proportional-hazards model, was used to compare method performance. Further validation was done using data from a fifth trialENTHUSE M 1 in which 266 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with placebo alone. Findings 50 independent methods were developed to predict overall survival and were evaluated through the DREAM challenge. The top performer was based on an ensemble of penalised Cox regression models (ePCR), which uniquely identified predictive interaction effects with immune biomarkers and markers of hepatic and renal function. Overall, ePCR outperformed all other methods (iAUC 0 · 791; Bayes factor > 5) and surpassed the reference model (iAUC 0 · 743; Bayes factor > 20). Both the ePCR model and reference models stratified patients in the ENTHUSE 33 trial into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different overall survival (ePCR: hazard ratio 3 · 32, 95 % CI 2 · 394 · 62, p< 0 · 0001; reference model: 2 · 56, 1 · 853 · 53, p< 0 · 0001). The new model was validated further on the ENTHUSE M 1 cohort with similarly high performance (iAUC 0 · 768). Meta-analysis across all methods confirmed previously identified predictive clinical variables and revealed aspartate aminotransferase as an important, albeit previously under-reported, prognostic biomarker. Interpretation Novel prognostic factors were delineated, and the assessment of 50 methods developed by independent international teams establishes a benchmark for development of methods in the future. The results of this effort show that data-sharing, when combined with a crowdsourced challenge, is a robust and powerful framework to develop new prognostic models in advanced prostate cancer.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{existing}} {{literature on the}} dual academic and commercial contexts of <b>doctoral</b> design <b>research.</b> In response I set out firstly to identify the value of previous professional experience of the research student in forming external collaborations, secondly, to identify the general characteristics of external research collaborations and thirdly to document {{ways in which the}} doctoral student interacts with industry to manage relationships effectively, obtain meaningful results and disseminate outcomes. The findings were relevant to both the research student/supervisor with regard to recruitment and training and the designer/producer with respect to commercial strategy and research exploitation. The paper draws directly on questionnaire evidence from a representative sample of twenty recent design <b>research</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>programmes</b> to identify and directly compare theoretical and practical aims. A questionnaire was deployed to explore both attitudes and experiences, focusing specifically on the relationship between scholarship and enterprise. Rigour was reinforced primarily by evaluating broader case-study evidence in conjunction with the questionnaire and by comparing direct entry student responses with those of students who were undertaking their study within an existing professional context, the work assesses the impacts of the PhD in design on professional practice.

The research demonstrates confusion in the discipline of doctorates globally. The research includes a case study on a globally significant Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) programme to demonstrate how professional doctorates are impacting on what might be regarded as more traditional doctorate programmes and causing confusion in the market place. Issues and observations arising from the research are discussed. A conclusion reached is that it may be time for Australian universities to consider establishing a new advanced higher research degree that clearly differentiates university research of a very high standard from other research.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} how often clinical <b>research</b> from <b>doctoral</b> degree <b>programmes</b> is unpublished {{and to see}} if one can characterise differences between those researchers who do or do not publish their work or between the institutions where they studied. DESIGN: Secondary research with data in the public domain: combining a national dataset of healthcare doctoral theses with related publications traceable in two widely accessible databases. Data sources The Index to Theses was searched for UK doctoral theses and the databases Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS searched by author name for literature derived from each thesis. Confirmatory details about student names or their <b>doctoral</b> <b>programmes</b> were obtained from university websites, if required. Eligibility criteria Search terms were chosen to identify only projects directly related to human health. Thesis records included 'clinical trials' or 'clinical research'.

40|$|In {{the light}} of {{concerns}} about the wider social and economic value of the PhD training programme, this article discusses the challenges being directed primarily at the traditional <b>doctoral</b> <b>programme</b> of study.

The United Kingdom Research Councils (UK GRAD, 2001. Joint Skills Statement of Skills Training Requirements. Available at [URL] 20 Statementpdf.

The seven domains are research skills and techniques, participation in the research environment, research management, personal effectiveness, communication, networking and team working, and career management. This article develops and extends these skill domains for the current healthcare context and considers how these should guide the development and evaluation of the value-added components of <b>doctoral</b> <b>research</b> degree <b>programmes</b> in nursing. The challenges that these issues present to academic departments are also discussed. Our conclusion is that PhD research training needs re-visioning and broadening so that the students’ experience includes these value-added components...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the connections between}} research, and practices of design including research by design. The paper argues that owing to different worldviews, what constitutes an effective practice within each paradigm is different. The received paradigm of scientific research benefits from high levels of coherence between its aims, methods, and outcomes {{as a result of}} many centuries of refinement. Alternative paradigms can be strengthened by reference to these structural features. If design wishes to develop a coherent response to the demands of design research it must therefore find a way of analysing the fitness of its practices to its problems and audience needs. This should come from a criterion-based analysis of research per se, plus any discipline-specific needs of design. The authors are working on a major project to develop such analyses, and this paper discusses their criterion-based approach from a theoretical point of view, and in relation to the <b>Research</b> by Design <b>doctoral</b> <b>programme</b> at TU Delft...|$|R
