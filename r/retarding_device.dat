50|$|Many Mark 84s {{have been}} {{retrofitted}} with stabilizing and <b>retarding</b> <b>devices</b> to provide precision guidance capabilities. They {{serve as the}} warhead {{of a variety of}} precision-guided munitions, including the GBU-10/GBU-24/GBU-27 Paveway laser-guided bombs, GBU-15 electro-optical bomb, GBU-31 JDAM and Quickstrike sea mines. The HGK is a Turkish guidance kit used to convert 2000-lb Mark 84 bombs into GPS/INS guided smart bombs.|$|R
50|$|Gunnery practices, {{at the end}} of the {{campaign}} with the East Indies Fleet, had clearly shown the origin of thedispersal of Richelieus main battery firings in the wake effect between shells fired simultaneously by the guns of the same half turrets. <b>Retarding</b> <b>devices</b> were installed on the outer guns at Cherbourg in March 1948, a delay of 60 milliseconds, corresponding to a distance of 50 m between shells, which reduced the dispersal by two-thirds, as observed during gunnery trials at Mers-el-Kebir, in May 1948.|$|R
50|$|A retarded bomb {{has a small}} {{parachute}} or {{air brake}} that opens to reduce {{the speed of the}} bomb to produce a safe horizontal separation between the two. The fuze for a retarded bomb requires that the retarder be open a minimum time to ensure safe separation. The pilots would have been aware of thisâ€”but due to the high concentration required to avoid SAMs, Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA), and British Sea Harriers, many failed to climb to the necessary release point. The Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised <b>retarding</b> <b>devices,</b> allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks on 8 June.|$|R

5000|$|Mark 81 Snakeye {{fitted with}} a Mark 14 TRD (Tail <b>Retarding</b> <b>Device)</b> to {{increase}} the bomb's drag after release. The bomb's increased air-time, coupled with its (relatively) forgiving safe drop envelope, allowed for very low-level bombing runs at slower speed. Used commonly in the close air support role in Vietnam (prior to wider availability of GBU-series precision ordnance). Nicknamed [...] "snake", as in the typical Vietnam support loadout of [...] "snake and nape" [...] (250-lb. Mk-81 Snakeye bombs and 500-lb. M-47 napalm canisters).|$|E
40|$|Silane nanolayers {{deposited}} {{from the}} vapor phase onto indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass are {{shown to be}} an effective means of tuning the work function and stabilizing the surface of this complex ternary oxide. Using this approach a pair of model hole-extracting electrodes have been developed to investigate how the performance of bi-layer organic photovoltaics is impacted by built-in positive space charge in the critical region close to the hole-extracting electrode. The magnitude and spatial distribution of positive space charge resulting from ground-state electron transfer from the donor layer to the ITO electrode upon contact formation, is derived from direct measurements of the interfacial energetics using the Kelvin probe technique. This judiciously designed experiment shows that it is unnecessary to engineer the work function of the hole-extracting electrode to match the ionization potential of the donor layer, rather only to ensure that the former exceeds the latter, thus simplifying an important aspect of device design. In addition, it is shown that silane nanolayers at the ITO electrode surface are remarkably effective at <b>retarding</b> <b>device</b> degradation under continuous illumination...|$|E
5000|$|In his autobiographical {{account of}} the Falklands War, Admiral Woodward blamed the BBC World Service for {{disclosing}} information that led the Argentines to change the <b>retarding</b> <b>devices</b> on the bombs. The World Service reported the lack of detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a Ministry of Defence official. He describes the BBC as being more concerned with being [...] "fearless seekers after truth" [...] than with the lives of British servicemen. Colonel 'H'. Jones levelled similar accusations against the BBC after they disclosed the impending British attack on Goose Green by 2 Para.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A rotary {{power head}} {{is a key}} {{component}} of the cutting drill. In this paper, first, we researched the current situation of the rotary power head; Second, we proposed a new <b>retard</b> <b>device</b> called higher-order elliptic end surface movable tooth transmission, and then designed a new rotary power head based on this device. The moving parts in the transmission such as input and output shafts are self-balancing, so the transmission can achieve the random tooth difference. A rotary power head of a drill with this transmission has many advantages, such as convenient disassembly or loading, large transmission torque, small radial size and the suitability for heavy loads. Finally, 3 D model based on Solidworks 2010 was established...|$|R
