40|$|Body-worn {{radiofrequency}} {{electromagnetic field}} (RF-EMF) personal exposure meters (PEMs) have been increasingly used for exposure assessment in epidemiological research. However, little {{research on the}} measurement accuracy of these devices is available. In this article a novel measurement setup and a measurement protocol are presented for characterizing and testing PEMs. The whole setup and procedure is tested using two EME SPY 120 devices. The performance of the PEM was analyzed for absolute measurements in an anechoic chamber. Modulated signals representing the different services as real signals generated by appropriate testers were used. Measurement results were evaluated {{with respect to a}} <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>detector.</b> We found that measurement accuracy depends strongly on the carrier frequency and also on the number of occupied time slots for Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) -based services. Thus, correction factors can only be derived if the distribution of the network configuration over the measurement time for all measurement points is available. As a result of the simplicity of the measurement setup and the straightforward measurement protocol, the possibility of fast validation leads to a higher accuracy in the characterization and testing of PEMs. Bioelectromagnetics.

40|$|The {{availability}} {{and performance of}} terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) communication systems are heavily deterred by the fluctuating conditions of the atmospheric channel, particularly {{in the presence of}} visibility-limiting fog effects. In this paper, we examine the viability of deploying hybrid FSO and radio frequency (RF) links through an experimental study, which takes advantage of a dedicated laboratory atmospheric chamber to emulate the fog scenarios encountered on outdoor environment. In particular, a <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> power <b>detector</b> is developed and introduced in the system under study to monitor the signal quality of the primary FSO link. The quasi-linear output voltage characteristics of the power detector device is utilized as a useful decision metric to implement hard switching in a hybrid FSO/RF link based upon the changes in the visibility. Our measurement results reveal that the selection of a desirable threshold voltage is dependent upon the intended data rate and minimum achievable bit error rate, in order to enable effective switching between the FSO and RF links...|$|R

40|$|The Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol) is a {{polarization}} sensitive receiver for the 6 -meter Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) {{and measures}} the small angular scale polarization anisotropies in {{the cosmic microwave}} background (CMB). The full focal plane is composed of three detector arrays, containing over 3000 transition edge sensors (TES detectors) in total. The first two detector arrays, observing at 146 gigahertz, were deployed in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The third and final array is composed of multichroic pixels sensitive to both 90 and 146 gigahertz and saw first light in February 2015. Fabricated at NIST, this dichroic array consists of 255 pixels, with a total of 1020 polarization sensitive bolometers and is coupled to the telescope with a monolithic array of broad-band silicon feedhorns. The detectors are read out using time-division SQUID multiplexing and cooled by a dilution refrigerator at 110 meter Kelvins. We present an overview of the assembly and characterization of this multichroic array in the lab, and the initial detector performance in Chile. The detector array has a TES detector electrical yield of 85 percent, a total array sensitivity of less than 10 microns Kelvin <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> speed, and <b>detector</b> time constants and saturation powers suitable for ACT CMB observations...|$|R
