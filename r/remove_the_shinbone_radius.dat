50|$|A {{standard}} oscillating saw is {{run along}} <b>the</b> guide wires, <b>removing</b> most of <b>the</b> bone wedge {{from underneath the}} outside of the knee, below the healthy cartilage. The cartilage surface {{on the top of the}} outside (lateral side) of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> is left intact. The top of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> is then lowered on the outside and attached with surgical staples or screws, depending on the size of the wedge that was <b>removed.</b> <b>The</b> layers of tissue in the knee are stitched together, usually with absorbable sutures.|$|R
25|$|Guide wires are drilled {{into the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> (tibia plateau) from the outside (lateral side) of the knee. The wires usually outline a {{triangle}} form in <b>the</b> <b>shinbone.</b>|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} autapomorphy, a unique {{combination}} of, in themselves not unique, traits was also demonstrated. The bottom surface of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> was, in its transverse width, about 1.5 times {{as wide as}} the longitudinal distance (measured from front to rear). In dinosaurs in general, the lower front of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> is covered by the talus bone. A ridge on the front surface demarcates the upper limit of this area. In Tachiraptor this ridge ran obliquely at an angle of about 35° to the lower edge of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone,</b> covering a vertical distance of about a quarter to a third of <b>the</b> lower <b>shinbone</b> height. At its lower end, this ridge slightly curved upwards, being at this point close to the outer edge of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone,</b> at about a fifth of its transverse width. <b>The</b> <b>shinbone</b> extends to below in two bumps, left and right. When seen from the front, with Tachiraptor a line drawn between the bumps made an angle of 80° with the vertical axis of the bone.|$|R

50|$|A {{common cause}} of {{anterior}} impingement is a bone spur on anklebone (talus) or <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> (tibia). Repeated kicking actions can cause the anklebone to hit the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone,</b> {{which can lead to}} a lump of bone (or bone spur) developing. This bone spur may then begin to impact on the soft tissue {{at the front of the}} ankle, causing inflammation and swelling. The condition is most common in athletes who repeatedly bend the ankle upward (dorsiflexion), such as footballers, hence the name.|$|R

50|$|The snout has a concave upper profile. A snout crest is absent. The parietal crest on {{the back}} of the skull is low and rounded. The teeth occupy the front quarter of the upper and lower jaws. Each upper jaw has {{thirteen}} teeth, each lower jaw twelve. The first four teeth in both the upper and lower jaws are longer and strongly inclined to the front; to the rear the teeth become shorter and more perpendicular. The pycnofibres in the holotype are visible as short hairs, pointing to the rear, at the back of the skull and the neck vertebrae. A deep groove incises the midline of the symphysis of the lower jaws. The longest neck vertebra is 4.1 times longer than wide. In the wing finger the first phalanx is the longest and equals <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> in length. <b>The</b> thighbone equals 61% of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> length. <b>The</b> third metatarsal equals 40% of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> length.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Shinbone</b> Alley Stilt Band {{emerged as}} the live band {{accompanying}} the street theatre shows in the early 1980s that were performed in New York City. Originally, the performers would parade and play music, while characters on stilts would parade around before the show. Eventually, all the company members learned to walk on stilts. <b>The</b> <b>Shinbone</b> Alley Stilt Band was named after the alley next to the theatre on Bond Street, and made its debut with its new name in 1988 at a performance in Nagasaki, Japan. The Band still plays frequently at events in and around New York City.|$|R
30|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament, {{otherwise known as}} the ACL, {{is a piece of}} tissue in the knee joint. The ACL keeps the knee stable. The ACL limits twisting motions on the knee and prevents <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> from sliding {{out in front of the}} thighbone.|$|R
2500|$|Overall, the hindlimb {{is built}} lightly and with long elements, {{contrary}} to the robust, stocky hind limbs of Utahraptor. Dakotaraptor more closely resembles the agile, springy smaller dromaeosaurids {{and would have been}} well-suited at running and pursuit predation. The length of the thighbone is [...] It is relatively shorter and more lightly built than that of Utahraptor. To <b>the</b> contrary <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> is rather elongated. <b>The</b> holotype <b>shinbone</b> is, with a length of , the longest dromaeosaurid tibia known. It is 22% longer than the thighbone, indicating a good running capability. <b>The</b> <b>shinbone's</b> cnemial crest has a sharp corner pointing to the front. Its fibular crest ends in a hook-shaped process pointing to above, a condition that is unique in the entire Theropoda. The astragalus and calcaneum, the upper ankle bones, are fused just as in Bambiraptor. The top of the calcaneum has but a small contact facet for the calfbone, indicating that this fibula must have had a very narrow lower end. The metatarsus has an estimated length of , which makes it rather long relative to the remainder of the hindlimb.|$|R
50|$|A low kick (also {{known as}} a leg kick) is a kick in which the {{attacker}} uses his or her leg to strike the opponent's lower body (thigh or calf) with <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> or foot. This type of kick, under different names, is utilized in numerous full-contact martial arts such as karate, kickboxing, lethwei, Hapkido, and Muay Thai.|$|R
50|$|After {{regional}} or general anesthesia is administered, the surgical team sterilizes the leg with antibacterial solution. Surgeons map out the exact {{size of the}} bone wedge they will remove, using an X-ray, CT scan, or 3D computer modeling. A four- to five-inch incision is made down the front {{and outside of the}} knee, starting below the kneecap and extending below the top of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone.</b>|$|R
40|$|The present studie {{shows the}} effect of rapid fluid shifts along the body axis through an {{increase}} in tissue thickness on the forehead and decrease on <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> in real and simulated microgravity. This effects {{are based on the}} cardiovascular adaptation in microgravity. In addition the investigation of the tissue thickness will be help to understand the mechanism of the heat emission of the head in microgravity...|$|R
50|$|The {{shoulder}} girdle {{was by the}} describers reconstructed with a low shoulder joint. The legs were relatively long with <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> over a third longer than the thighbone. In the wing the metacarpals were very elongated, the fourth metacarpal being longer than the lower arm. The first to fourth phalanges of the wing finger have the respective length of 119, 70.8, 50.8 and 50.6 millimetres.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{a unique}} {{combination}} of in themselves not unique traits is present. The coracoid is broad, with a constricted shaft. In the pelvis, the ischipubic plate, {{the fusion of}} the pubic bone with the ischium, is deep. <b>The</b> <b>shinbone</b> is relatively long, with a length of 57.7 millimetres attaining 70% {{of the length of}} the humerus and 92% of the length of the first phalanx of the (fourth) wingfinger.|$|R
50|$|There {{is direct}} {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} a system of ogham hand signals. The ogam tract In Lebor Ogaim mentions two forms of finger spelling; cossogam ('foot-ogham') and sronogam ('nose-ogham'). Cossogam involves putting the fingers to the right or left of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> for <b>the</b> first or second aicmi, and across it diagonally or straight for the third or fourth aicmi. One finger is used for the first letter, two for the second, and so on. Sronogam involves the same procedure with the ridge of the nose. Placing the finger straight across <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> or nose for the fourth aicme mimics the later, manuscript form of the letters. Another alphabet, basogam ('palm-ogham') is mentioned which seems to involve striking the hand in various ways against wood. Probably the angle of the hand indicated the aicme while the number of strikes indicated the letter. The inclusion of these alphabets in the Tract shows that a connection between the ogham letters and fingers was still known at the time the Book of Ballymote was written in the Middle Ages.|$|R

50|$|In the {{original}} description some distinguishing traits or autapomorphies were established. The front {{edge of the}} antorbital fenestra, the large skull opening {{in front of the}} eye socket, is straight and vertically oriented. The frontal bone shows a vertical ridge touching the lacrimal bone. The surangular in the lower jaw has a T-shaped cross-section. <b>The</b> <b>shinbone</b> has a vertical ridge on the upper outer side, the crista cnemialis, touching a lower vertical ridge, the crista fibularis.|$|R
50|$|Five sacrals are present, {{those of}} the middle being clearly larger. The ilium is {{relatively}} small. The ischium is bird-like: small with a low obturator process and processes on {{the upper and lower}} rear edge. <b>The</b> <b>shinbone</b> is wide at the top and has a roughly rectangular lower joint surface. The fourth metatarsal is not strongly developed but the second metatarsal is small. The third metatarsal is pinched at the top but still visible at the upper front of the metatarsus, conforming to the subarctometatarsal condition.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Pathological {{studies were}} {{performed}} on a case of bone tumor in a 7 year-old domestic shorthair female cat. Clinically, thè mass involved <b>thè</b> <b>shinbone</b> and ulcerated outside. The histological {{findings are consistent with}} a Giant Celi Tumour of bone, a rare prirnary neoplasm in thè cat. It was charactenzed by multinucleated giant cells with slight defined borders. Therefore, this tumor should be considered among thè difFerential diagnoses of a number of mass diseases of bone such as giant celi reparative granuloma and giant celi osteosarcoma...|$|R
50|$|The {{specimen}} {{is eight}} centimetres long and four centimetres wide {{at the lower}} end. From this a total length for <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> was estimated of about seventeen to twenty centimetres and for the animal as a whole of about two metres. Three diagnostic features were established enabling it to be upheld as a distinct species of dinosaur: the ascending process of the astragalus had a rectangular shape with a straight upper end; the astragalar facet had a vertical ridge; the medial condyle was weakly developed.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prominent}} tubercle of the tibia, a leg bone {{which is more}} commonly known as <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> or shankbone, is the tibial tuberosity. The tibial tuberosity {{is located on the}} tibia's anterior surface, distal to the medial condyle. It creates a bony prominence just below the patella, and can be easily located with the fingers. It creates an attachment point for the ligamentum patellae, or patellar ligament. Other tubercles of the tibia include the medial intercondylar tubercle, the lateral intercondylar tubercle, and Gerdy's tubercle.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 a {{group of}} four twelve-year-old Scotch College schoolboys found a fossil at the Bringo Railway Cutting site near Geraldton, which they showed to Professor Rex Prider of the University of Western Australia. He had a cast made that he sent to experts of the British Museum of Natural History in London who thought it likely belonged to an extinct turtle. Re-evaluation of the bone in the nineties after being {{prepared}} out of the rock by John Albert Long and Ralph Molnar showed that it actually was <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> {{of some sort of}} theropod.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to forming Riders in the Sky, he {{performed}} with The Boys from Shiloh, <b>The</b> <b>Shinbone</b> Alley All Stars, and The Doug Green Band. In 1967 and 1969 he worked two stints with Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys [...] {{and one with}} Jimmy Martin in 1969. He recorded two albums in 1972 with Vic Jordan and the Buck White Family, one of gospel songs (In God's Eyes) and one traditional bluegrass named after his daughters Liza Jane and Sally Anne. [...] Green has also recorded the solo album Songs of the Sage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{only known}} {{specimen}} of Yi qi preserved a heavy covering of feathers. Unusually, {{based on its}} classification as an advanced theropod in the clade Pennaraptora (a group containing theropods with advanced, bird-like feathers), the feathers were all very simple in structure and [...] "paintbrush-like", with long quill-like bases topped by sprays of thinner filaments. All these structures were rather stiff. The feathers covered most of the body, starting near {{the tip of the}} snout. The head and neck feathers were long and formed a thick coat, and the body feathers were even longer and denser, making it difficult for scientists to study their detailed structure. The longest feathers, with a length of about six centimetres, were present behind the upper arm and <b>the</b> <b>shinbone.</b> <b>The</b> metatarsus of the foot had a feather covering also.|$|R
50|$|The authors {{established}} {{a number of}} distinguishing traits. One of these is a possible autapomorphy, a unique evolutionary innovation shown just by Tachiraptor. It pertains to the profile, seen from above, of the upper surface of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone.</b> Such surfaces generally have two projections, corners jutting out to behind, left and right. In Tachiraptor the outer projection, {{at the side of}} the fibula, has a rear edge making a sharp angle with the outer edge. This way a uniquely sharp point is formed which, uniquely also, extends further to behind than the inner projection at the opposite side.|$|R
50|$|Like all stegosaurians, Yingshanosaurus was an herbivorous dinosaur. It {{was about}} four to five metres long. The thighbone has a length of 675 millimetres, <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> of forty-six {{centimetres}}. The humerus is forty centimetres long. Four vertebrae of the sacrum (S2-S5) were solidly fused to the ilia of the pelvis, the spaces between the sacral ribs being almost closed, reduced to oval depressions pierced from below by small openings, {{no more than a}} centimetre in cross-section. The neural arches are of medium height. The neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae are plate-like in side view and have a transversely expanded top.|$|R
60|$|Thus urged, Bryan {{broke away}} from his host (who had just split open <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> of a deer, and offered him the raw marrow, but without success), and, going towards La Roche, {{regarded}} the baby in question. It was a remarkably fine child, seemingly about ten months old, with a round, rosy, oily face, coal-black hair, and large, round, coal-black eyes, with which it returned the stare {{of the two men}} with interest. But that which amused the visitors most was a lump of fat or blubber, with a skewer thrust through it, which its mother had given to the child to suck, and which it was endeavouring to thrust down its throat with both hands.|$|R
5000|$|The sacrum {{consists}} of three sacral vertebrae, with a caudo-sacral vertebra behind them. Stiffened rear tail vertebrae or a tail club are absent. The shoulder blade resembles that of nodosaurids in possessing an acromion that is blade-like, but differs in the acromion originating from the front edge, not the outer side of the scapula, not being wrapped to behind and not ending in a knob. It is thus not a typical nodosaurid [...] "pseudoacromion". The coracoid is square in form, a typical ankylosaurid trait. The humerus has a large deltopectoral crest extending downwards {{to the middle of}} the shaft, a derived trait. The ulna is very robust with an enormous olecranon. <b>The</b> <b>shinbone</b> is very expanded at both the upper and lower end.|$|R
5000|$|Shin splints, {{also known}} as medial tibial stress {{syndrome}} (MTSS), {{is defined by the}} American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons as [...] "pain along the inner edge of <b>the</b> <b>shinbone</b> (tibia)." [...] Shin splints are usually caused by repeated trauma to the connective muscle tissue surrounding the tibia. They are a common injury affecting athletes who engage in running sports or other forms of physical activity, including running and jumping. They are characterized by general pain in the lower region of the leg between the knee and the ankle. Shin splints injuries are specifically located in the middle to lower thirds of the anterior or lateral part of the tibia, which is the larger of two bones comprising the lower leg.|$|R
