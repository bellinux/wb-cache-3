5|$|Recent {{attempts}} {{to develop the}} area between the park's western edge and High Street have proved controversial; Bristol City Council are keen to replace derelict buildings with a mixed-use development to help reconnect the Old City to Broadmead and raise funds to improve the park; others would <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> the park extended to High Street.|$|E
5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says that the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E

25|$|Bill and Denise Richard, {{parents of}} the {{youngest}} of the three killed in the bombings, urged against a death sentence for Tsarnaev. They stated that the lengthy appeals period would force them to continually relive that day, and would <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> him spend life in prison without possibility of release.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{emergence}} of modern clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care pharmacy practice {{has emerged as a}} unique pharmacy practice setting. Ambulatory care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic. Pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs, but <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> patients in office visits to manage chronic disease states.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, an {{attempt was made}} to name the college after Martin Luther King, but failed when UCSD {{students}} objected to naming the college after someone who was charged with plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation. More to the point, King's family announced that they would <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> a full-fledged King College built in the South, and preferable in Atlanta.|$|E

He has {{not found}} {{the body of the}} doe in the forest, and mysteriously, cannot seem to see Giselda now either, but <b>rather</b> <b>sees</b> the body of the doe lying where she stands.

50|$|As concert {{performance}} of liturgical works outside a liturgical setting increased, {{for some of}} the composers the brevis/solemnis distinction is about the breves, which not always needed professional performers, being intended for actual liturgical use, while a Missa solemnis was <b>rather</b> <b>seen</b> as a concert piece for professional performers, that could be performed outside an actual Mass celebration, similar to how an oratorio would be staged.|$|R

25|$|The changes {{brought about}} by these {{developments}} have led many scholars to view this period {{as the end of}} the Middle Ages and beginning of modern history and early modern Europe. However, the division is somewhat artificial, since ancient learning was never entirely absent from European society. As a result there was developmental continuity between the ancient age (via classical antiquity) and the modern age. Some historians, particularly in Italy, prefer not to speak of the Late Middle Ages at all, but <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> the high period of the Middle Ages transitioning to the Renaissance and the modern era.|$|E
25|$|Prodi's {{government}} faced {{a crisis}} over policies in early 2007, after just {{nine months of}} government. Three ministers in Prodi's Cabinet boycotted a vote in January to continue funding for Italian troop deployments in Afghanistan. Lawmakers approved {{the expansion of the}} US military base Caserma Ederle at the end of January, but the victory was so narrow that Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli criticised members of the coalition who had not supported the government. At around the same time, Justice Minister Clemente Mastella, of the coalition member UDEUR Populars, said he would <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> the government fall than support its unwed couples legislation.|$|E

He also relates to the geometrical language of shapes of Piet Mondrian. When abstraction was supposed to lead Mondrian to the “nature of all things“, Bijl <b>rather</b> <b>sees</b> the actual social wish for structure and orderliness in it.|$|R
50|$|Saure Kutteln is a Swabian {{specialty}} food, {{popular in}} the Swabian part of Baden-Württemberg {{as well as in}} the Province of Hohenzollern and Baden. It's often eaten with bread or with home fries. It was known as an extremely economical dish, since tripes were sold at a lower price than other meat.

Eliot {{found more}} to admire, saying {{of the moment}} of Pericles' reunion with his daughter: [...] "To my mind the finest of all the 'recognition scenes' is Act V,i of that very great play Pericles.

25|$|Within the Liberal Democrats, the {{two main}} ideological strands are social liberals and the {{classical}} liberals, the latter supporting economic liberalism. The principal {{difference between the two}} is that the classical liberals tend to support greater choice and competition and aim to increase social mobility through economic deregulation and creation of opportunity, whereas the social liberals were more commonly associated with directly aiming to increase equality of outcome through state intervention. Correspondingly, classical liberals tended to favour cutting taxes for the poorest in order to increase opportunity, contrasting with social liberals, who would <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> higher spending on public services and the disadvantaged in order to reduce income inequality.|$|E
25|$|At 2pm a 12-pound cannon and {{a company}} of militia were sent up by a special train. By afternoon, the {{shooting}} from the hotel had ceased. The police leader, Superintendent Sadleir, decided to {{set fire to the}} hotel and received permission from the Chief Secretary, Robert Ramsay. At 2:50pm a final volley was fired into the hotel, and under cover of the fire, Senior-constable Charles Johnson, of Violet Town, placed a bundle of burning straw at the hotel's west side. As the fire took hold, the police began to close in on the building. Mrs Skillion and Kate Kelly appeared on the scene at this juncture. The former endeavoured to make way to her brothers, declaring she would <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> them burned than shot by the police. The police, however, ordered her to stop.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1940, Ribbentrop made a {{sustained}} but unsuccessful effort to have Spain enter the war on the Axis side. During his talks with the Spanish foreign minister, Ramón Serrano Súñer, Ribbentrop affronted Súñer with his tactless behaviour, especially his suggestion that Spain cede the Canary Islands to Germany. An angry Súñer replied that he would <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> the Canaries sink into the Atlantic then cede an inch of Spanish territory. An area in which Ribbentrop enjoyed more success arose in September 1940, {{when he had the}} Far Eastern agent of the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, Dr. Heinrich Georg Stahmer, start negotiations with the Japanese foreign minister, Yōsuke Matsuoka, for an anti-American alliance. The end result of these talks was the signing in Berlin on 27 September 1940 of the Tripartite Pact by Ribbentrop, Count Ciano, and Japanese Ambassador Saburo Kurusu.|$|E

25|$|Service members {{requiring}} observation or care {{beyond the}} unit level are evacuated to facilities {{in close proximity}} to, but separate from the medical or surgical patients at the BAS, surgical support company in a central location (Marines) or forward support/division support or area support medical companies (Army) nearest the service members' unit. It is best to send Service members who cannot continue their mission and require more extensive respite to a central facility other than a hospital, unless no other alternative is possible. The Service member must be encouraged to continue to {{think of himself as}} a war fighter, rather than a patient or a sick person. The chain of command remains directly involved in the Service member's recovery and return to duty. The CSC team coordinates with the unit's leaders to learn whether the over-stressed individual was a good performer prior to the combat stress reaction, or whether he was always a marginal or problem performer whom the team would <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> replaced than returned. Whenever possible, representatives of the unit, or messages from the unit, tell the casualty that he is needed and wanted back. The CSC team coordinates with the unit leaders, through unit medical personnel or chaplains, any special advice on how to assure quick reintegration when the Service member returns to his unit.|$|E

5000|$|In the 17th and 18th century, due to {{the large}} number of Serbs who lived in Bačka, this region was called »Raczorszag« (Hungarian name, which means [...] "the Serb country" [...] in English).

As a senior at Pine Bluff High School he was an all-state basketball player, which he said was his favorite sport. [...] "I'm like most ," [...] he said.
