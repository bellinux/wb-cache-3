5|$|Newton's {{monument}} (1731) {{can be seen}} in Westminster Abbey, at {{the north}} of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect William Kent. The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A <b>relief</b> <b>panel</b> depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism. The Latin inscription on the base translates as:Here is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners. Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race! He was born on 25 December 1642, and died on 20 March 1726/7.—Translation from G.L. Smyth, The Monuments and Genii of St. Paul's Cathedral, and of Westminster Abbey (1826), ii, 703–4.|$|E

25|$|To {{the right}} of the massacre, stands the image Jesus and the Four Evangelists. This carving {{introduces}} the next <b>relief</b> <b>panel</b> depicting the Crucifixion. In the center on the panel Jesus hangs upon the cross traditionally shown with his head falling to the side and modestly covered in a loin cloth. A new addition that Nicola made to the crucified Savior is the joining of Christ’s feet upon the cross with one nail. This had not been seen before the 13th century. Surrounding Jesus is a scene of onlookers and mourners. To the left of Christ stands the image of Mary physically grieving. Her stance and emotion is another motif of the 13th century as it became common to depict the Virgin as swooning. This panel is also a good example of Nicolas understanding of depth with the foreground figures being the largest.|$|E
50|$|The façade of the {{building}} has a blend of thin concrete mullions, bands of windows and <b>relief</b> <b>panels.</b> The pre-cast abstract geometric <b>relief</b> <b>panels</b> are similar in form to the works of Ben Nicholson. There are projecting sculptural concrete trough uplighters which highlight the <b>relief</b> <b>panels</b> at night. In the centre a glazed section bridges Hurst Street {{on a pair of}} ribbed splayed concrete piloti, {{the building}} was carried over Hurst Street to ensure the continuous sweep {{of the building}} along {{the south side of the}} road.|$|R

25|$|The next <b>relief</b> <b>panel</b> {{has barely}} survived. It is {{supposed}} that it showed Demeter. She {{is followed by}} Hera, entering the battle in a quadriga. Her four winged horses are identified as the personifications of the four winds, Notos, Boreas, Zephyrus and Eurus. Between Hera and his father Zeus, Heracles is fighting, identified only by a frieze fragment showing a paw of his lion pelt. Zeus is physically especially present and agile. He fights by hurling lightning bolts, sending rain and massed clouds not only against two young Giants but also against their leader, Porphyrion. The next pair of fighters also shows an especially important battle scene. Athena, the city goddess of Pergamon, breaks the Giant Alkyoneus’ contact to the earth, from which {{the mother of the}} Giants, Gaia, emerges. According to legend, Alkyoneus was immortal only as long as he touched the ground, where the power of his mother could flow through him. The eastern frieze concludes with Ares, the god of war, who goes into battle with a chariot and pair of horses. His horses rear {{up in front of a}} winged Giant.|$|E

500|$|The {{badly damaged}} <b>relief</b> <b>panel</b> is [...] wide and [...] high and set {{low on the}} wall. His body and arms are shown as wildly gyrating in the lalita mudra, a {{symbolism}} for occupying all of space, soaring energy and full bodied weightlessness. His face here resembles the Tatpurusha, or the manifested form of Shiva that preserves and sustains all of creation, all of creative activity. This is an eight armed depiction of Nataraja. The parts of the panel that have survived suggest that he is holding an axe, a coiled serpent is wrapped around its top. In another he holds a folded cloth, possibly symbolic veil of maya.|$|E

[...] "Subjects typical of Assyrian or Egyptian art were required."

2500|$|Alabaster {{religious}} {{images in}} English churches may {{have survived the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s, but most did not survive the reign of King Edward VI following the Putting away of Books and Images Act 1549 ordering the destruction of all images. Indeed, eight months after this act, in January 1550 the English Ambassador to France reported the arrival of three English ships laden with alabaster images to be sold at Paris, Rouen and elsewhere. [...] Whether these were new images, or ones removed from English churches, is not entirely clear. From {{the middle of the}} sixteenth century, workshops focused instead on sculpting alabaster tombs or church monuments, which were not affected by Protestant aniconism. [...] Indeed, these were becoming larger and more elaborate, and were now taken up by the richer merchant classes as well as the nobility and gentry. [...] Vertical monuments placed against walls generally replaced the older recumbent effigies. [...] There is an elaborate <b>relief</b> <b>panel</b> of Apollo and the Muses, of about 1580, which is probably English, in the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E
