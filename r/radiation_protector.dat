40|$|The {{possible}} role of {{free radicals}} in {{the mechanism of}} neocarzinostatin (NCS) action was studied. While mercaptene markedly stimulate the ability of NCS to degrade DNA, they also rapidly inactivate the antibiotic in a preincubation and at higher concentration inhibit the degradation reaction. The <b>radiation</b> <b>protector</b> S, 2 -aminoethylisothiuronium bromide-HBr is the most potent compound tested. Scavengers of diffusible OH radicals, O 2 - or H 2 O 2 do not result in significant inhibition of the oxygen-dependent cleavage of DNA by NCS; in fact, alcohols and other organic solvents stimulate the reaction several-fold. By contrast, the potent peroxyl free radical scavenger, alpha-tocopherol, blocks the reaction 50 % at 50 micron...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} goal of {{this work}} {{was to determine the}} capacity of selected aminothiols to modulate radiation induced cytotoxicity, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis in a human mammary epithelial cell line. The conclusions from this work are that WR- 1065 is the "gold standard" for protection against radiation induced cytotoxicity, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. While a potent <b>radiation</b> <b>protector,</b> WR- 1065 is cytotoxic in vitro and in vivo. Our rationale for a study of the thiazolidine pro-drugs was that these compounds are neither toxic in vitro or in vivo. The results obtained during this funding period indicate that the thiazolidine pro-drugs are as potent as WR- 1065 as protectors against radiation induced mutation induction, and thus presumably against radiation induced carcinogenesis. Our results indicate that the thiazolidine prodrugs are excellent candidates to test as non-toxic anticarcinogens for protecting astronauts from cancer induction during space travel...|$|E

Applications of antioxidant therapies {{for the management}} of ionizing irradiation injury fall into three categories: (1) radiation counter measures against total or partial body irradiation; (2) normal tissue protection against acute organ specific ionizing irradiation injury; and (3) prevention of chronic/late radiation tissue and organ injury.

As a potent <b>radiation</b> <b>protector</b> administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight (20 mg/kg) prior to total body irradiation (TBI) by intra-peritoneal (ip) in-jection, it completely protected mice from hematopoietic syndrome and partially from gastrointestinal syn-drome. In the present study, radiation mitigation effects from vanadate were investigated by ip injection of vanadate after TBI in mice. Results showed that a single administration of vanadate at a dose of 20 mg/kg markedly improved the 30 -day survival rate and the peripheral blood hemogram, relieved bone marrow aplasia and decreased occurrence of the bone marrow micronucleated erythrocytes in the surviving animals. The dose reduction factor was 1. 2 when a single dose of 20 mg/kg was administered 15 min after TBI in mice using the 30 -day survival test as the endpoint.

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the present status of kidney {{protection}} during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) using radiolabelled somatostatin analogues. This treatment modality for somatostatin receptor-positive tumours is limited by renal reabsorption and retention of radiolabelled peptides resulting in dose-limiting high kidney radiation doses. Radiation nephropathy has been described in several patients. Studies on the mechanism and localization demonstrate that renal uptake of radiolabelled somatostatin analogues largely depends on the megalin/cubulin system in the proximal tubule cells. Thus methods are needed that interfere with this reabsorption pathway to achieve kidney protection. Such methods include coadministration of basic amino acids, the bovine gelatin-containing solution Gelofusine or albumin fragments. Amino acids are already commonly used in the clinical setting during PRRT. Other compounds that interfere with renal reabsorption capacity (maleic acid and colchicine) are not suitable for clinical use because of potential toxicity. The safe limit for the renal radiation dose during PRRT is not exactly known. Dosimetry studies applying {{the principle of the}} biological equivalent dose (correcting for the effect of dose fractionation) suggest that a dose of about 37 Gy is the threshold for development of kidney toxicity. This threshold is lower when risk factors for development of renal damage exist: age over 60 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and previous chemotherapy. A still experimental pathway for kidney protection is mitigation of radiation effects, possibly achievable by cotreatment with amifostine (Ethylol), a <b>radiation</b> <b>protector,</b> or with blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Future perspectives on improving kidney protection during PRRT include combinations of agents to reduce renal retention of radiolabelled peptides, eventually together with mitigating medicines. Moreover, new somatostatin analogues with lower renal retention may be developed. Furthermore, knowledge on kidney protection from radiolabelled somatostatin analogues may be expanded to other peptides...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{review and}} {{evaluate}} the development of effective <b>radiation</b> <b>protectors.</b> OUTLINE: Sulphydryl radioprotectors are the best radioprotectors known today. Their use encounters two great difficulties: their toxicity and the short period during which they are active. The biological response modifiers (BRM), developed mainly in the 1990 s, demonstrated some protective effects. They can also modulate radiation injury when given after irradiation. In parallel {{with the use of}} single radioprotectors, observations have been made in mice using combined treatments with BRM and other radioprotectors. Low-to-moderate doses of several radioprotective agents acting via different mechanisms markedly improved the degree of protection in rodents while maintaining toxicity within acceptable limits, but applications in man remain doubtful. CONCLUSIONS: No radioprotective drug available today has all the requisite qualities to be an ideal radioprotector. Although combinations of radioprotective drugs acting via different mechanisms markedly improve the degree of protection and keep toxicity to acceptable levels in small rodents, attempts to use such treatments in large mammals have been less successful. It is thus questionable whether chemical protection has any prospects for the future...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSince {{exposure}} to irradiation in radiotherapy or unwanted radiation, induces side effects to health, {{it is important}} to makear effort to protect humans against side effects induced by irradiation. In these cases, radioprotective drugs could be used to reduce or delay the side effects and the mortality induced by irradiation. Although, thiol compounds were early compounds in these categories, administration of these agents have induced serious side effects and is limited to use clinically. The search for less-toxic <b>radiation</b> <b>protectors</b> has spurred interest in the development of natural products. Natural products have mainly antioxidant and immunostimulant activity. Cytokines and androsetendiol have immunomudulatory effects in the prevention of mortality induced by gamma irradiation in animal model.

The use of dimeric oxetanes as additives for reactions involving organometallic agents—namely, organolithium, organozirconium, and organomagnesium reagents was studied. A dimeric bisoxetanyl ether showed promise for solvating organolithium aggregates, but dimeric oxetanyl ethers were not useful additives in hydrozirconation reactions. A bisoxetanyl sulfide is being investigated further as an additive for Grignard reactions. A bisoxetanyl sulfoxide (MMS 350) was developed as a dimethylsulfoxide substitute that showed utility for enhancing the aqueous solubility of small organic molecules. In the second chapter, efforts toward the development of agents for protection and mitigation of ionizing radiation damage are outlined. It was discovered that administration of MMS 350 prolonged survival in irradiated mice. Moreover, mice given MMS 350 in their drinking water had lower incidences of pulmonary fibrosis. Additional analogs of MMS 350 were synthesized for further investigation of the molecular and structural requirements for successful sulfoxide-containing <b>radiation</b> <b>protectors.</b> In the third chapter, the design and proof-of-concept study of using an oxazoline linker for functionalization and pH-dependent release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers from silica nanoparticles is discussed. pH-Dependent hydrolysis of model oxazolines was achieved by modulating the substitution on the oxazoline moiety. Moreover, functionalized silica nanoparticles were successfully endocytosed by macrophages.

40|$|Abstract Background Fullerene {{compounds}} {{are known}} to possess antioxidant properties, a common property of chemical radioprotectors. DF- 1 is a dendrofullerene nanoparticle with antioxidant properties previously found to be radioprotective in a zebrafish model. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the radioprotective effects of DF- 1 in a murine model of lethal total body irradiation and to assess for selective radioprotection of normal cells versus tumor cells. Methods In vitro radioresponse was evaluated with clonogenic assays with human tumor cells and fibroblast lines in the presence of varying concentrations of DF- 1 or vehicle. DNA double strand break induction and repair was evaluated with immunocytochemistry for γH 2 AX. Lethal total body irradiation was delivered with 137 Cs after intraperitoneal delivery of DF- 1 or vehicle control. Bone marrow hypoxia was evaluated with piminidazole uptake assessed by flow cytometry. Results DF- 1 provided modest radioprotection of human cancer cell lines and fibroblast cell lines when delivered prior to irradiation (dose modifying factor or 1. 1). There was no evidence of selective protection of fibroblasts versus tumor cells. Cells treated with DF- 1 at radioprotective doses were found to have fewer γH 2 AX foci at 1 and 6 hours after irradiation compared to vehicle treated controls. The LD 50 / 30 for C 57 Bl 6 /Ncr mice treated with a single 300 mg/kg dose of DF- 1 pre-irradiation was 10. 09 Gy (95 % CI 9. 58 - 10. 26) versus 8. 29 Gy (95 % CI, 8. 21 - 8. 32) for control mice. No protective effects were seen with a single 200 mg/kg dose. No increase in pimonidazole uptake was appreciated in bone marrow of mice treated with DF- 1 compared to vehicle controls. Conclusions DF- 1 has modest activity as a <b>radiation</b> <b>protector</b> in vivo. There was no evidence of selective protection from irradiation of normal versus tumor cells with DF- 1. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} {{mechanism by which}} thiol compounds can modify cellular radiation response. The differential radiation response between aerobic and hypoxic conditions is well established for the experimental endpoints of cell and DNA damage and {{is commonly known as}} the Oxygen Effect or the oxygen Enhancement Ratio (OER). intracellular non-protein thiol compounds had been presumed responsible for enhanced cell survival or reduced DNA damage after irradiation in hypoxic conditions. The use of a fluorescent thiol binding agent to quantify the dominant non-protein thiol compound glutathione (GSH) against the background of protein thiols in individual cells with flow cytometry has been done. It was found that cell line specific variability interfered with uniform GSH quantitation by flow cytometry unless a membrane permeabilization technique was employed. Measurement of GSH content of cells dissociated from 9 L rodent tumors invalidated the clinical utility of this assay due to irreversible thiol depletion during the disaggregation process. The DNA damage work presented herein utilizes three different DNA damage assays: alkaline elution, neutral elution and Pulsed Field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), to demonstrate an important role for nuclear protein thiols. Isolated nuclei were prepared by two different methods wherein non-protein thiols were virtually eliminated, yet a measurable OER was still evident. Under these circumstances, it was possible to conclude that nuclear protein thiols play a much more important role in the production of the OER than had been suspected. Further work to identify the principle proteins involved in this process is planned. Regarding cell survival after irradiation, this dissertation utilizes a novel technique of cell suspension culture wherein human colon tumor (HCT- 116 line) cells were irradiated at 37 °C with continuous monitoring of oxygen tension and very accurate intracellular thiol measurements combined with traditional survival techniques to reveal an unexpectedly significant role for cysteine as a cellular <b>radiation</b> <b>protector.</b> This work strongly supports the clinical significance of high cysteine content in rodent tumors by this laboratory. ...|$|E
40|$|Amifostine {{has been}} shown in {{randomized}} trials to protect normal tissues from radiation. It is a thiophosphate prodrug that is dephosphorylated to the active free thiol metabolite, WR- 1065, by plasma membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase. Selectivity of amifostine may be due to differences between the microenvironment of normal tissues and tumor (e. g., pH and enzymatic activity) and different uptake processes. We proposed to optimize the use of amifostine as a <b>radiation</b> <b>protector</b> of normal liver, which will permit the safe delivery of higher doses of radiation for patients with both focal and diffuse disease. We carried out nonclinical studies to optimize amifostine selectivity (i. e., the concentration of WR- 1065 in liver to tumor) in a rat xenograft model with different dosing routes of drug (systemic vs regional and IV vs SC). The pharmacokinetics of amifostine and WR- 1065 were evaluated in a phase I trial of dose-escalating radiation therapy with systemic amifostine for liver cancer patients. Following intravenous dosing of amifostine, the concentrations of WR- 1065 in liver and blood were highest at the earliest sampling time and higher doses, while tumor levels were relatively constant with respect to time. Based on our response surface regression model, no significant difference was observed between systemic and regional administrations of amifostine. After subcutaneous dosing of amifostine, optimal selectivity was sustained for a period of 5 - 20 min. While the liver and tumor concentrations of WR- 1065 were initially low and increased steadily over time, blood levels were relatively constant over time. These findings recommend that the highest intravenous dose of amifostine tolerated be administered, and that radiotherapy begin shortly after dosing for liver cancer patients. A subcutaneous dose, which is an easier administration route, may be a reasonable substitute when dosed 5 - 20 min before radiotherapy. Clinical pharmacokinetic results indicated that amifostine has a short half-life, a small volume of distribution and a large clearance. WR- 1065 has a much longer half-life, and larger volume of distribution and clearance as compared to amifostine. In conclusion, amifostine was converted to WR- 1065 rapidly and confined to extracellular fluid in the body. WR- 1065 was extensively bound in tissues and converted quickly to disulfides...|$|E

40|$|Hypoxia {{inducible}} factor 1 α (Hif 1 α) is {{a stress}} responsive transcription factor, which regulates {{the expression of}} genes required for adaption to hypoxia. Hif 1 α is normally hydroxylated by an oxygen-dependent prolylhydroxylase, leading to degradation and clearance of Hif 1 α from the cell. Under hypoxic conditions, {{the activity of the}} prolylhydroxylase is reduced and Hif 1 α accumulates. Hif 1 α is also constitutively expressed in tumor cells, where it is associated with resistance to ionizing radiation. Activation of the Hif 1 α transcriptional regulatory pathway may therefore function to protect normal cells from DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. Here, we utilized the prolylhydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) to elevate Hif 1 α levels in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to determine if DMOG could function as a radioprotector. The results demonstrate that DMOG increased Hif 1 α protein levels and decreased the sensitivity of MEFs to ionizing radiation. Further, the ability of DMOG to function as a radioprotector required Hif 1 α, indicating a key role for Hif 1 α's transcriptional activity. DMOG also induced the Hif 1 α -dependent accumulation of several DNA damage response proteins, including CHD 4 and MTA 3 (sub-units of the NuRD deacetylase complex) and the Suv 39 h 1 histone H 3 methyltransferase. Depletion of Suv 39 h 1, but not CHD 4 or MTA 3, reduced the ability of DMOG to protect cells from radiation damage, implicating increased histone H 3 methylation in the radioprotection of cells. Finally, treatment of mice with DMOG prior to total body irradiation resulted in significant radioprotection of the mice, demonstrating the utility of DMOG and related prolylhydroxylase inhibitors to protect whole organisms from ionizing radiation. Activation of Hif 1 α through prolylhydroxylase inhibition therefore identifies a new pathway for the development of novel <b>radiation</b> <b>protectors...</b>|$|R

While bone-marrow transplantation might mitigate hematopoietic syndrome, currently there are no approved medical countermeasures to alleviate radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome (RIGS), resulting from direct cytocidal effects on intestinal stem cells (ISC) and crypt stromal cells. We examined whether bone marrow-derived adherent stromal cell transplantation (BMSCT) could restitute irradiated intestinal stem cells niche and mitigate radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome. Autologous bone marrow was cultured in mesenchymal basal medium and adherent cells were harvested for transplantation to C 57 Bl 6 mice, 24 and 72 hours after lethal whole body irradiation (10. 4 Gy) or abdominal irradiation (16 - 20 Gy) in a single fraction. Mesenchymal, endothelial and myeloid population were characterized by flow cytometry. Intestinal crypt regeneration and absorptive function was assessed by histopathology and xylose absorption assay, respectively. In contrast to 100 % mortality in irradiated controls, BMSCT mitigated RIGS and rescued mice from radiation lethality after 18 Gy of abdominal irradiation or 10. 4 Gy whole body irradiation with 100 % survival (p< 0. 0007 and p< 0. 0009 respectively) beyond 25 days. Transplantation of enriched myeloid and non-myeloid fractions failed to improve survival. BMASCT induced ISC regeneration, restitution of the ISC niche and xylose absorption. Serum levels of intestinal radioprotective factors, such as, R-Spondin 1, KGF, PDGF and FGF 2, and anti-inflammatory cytokines were elevated, while inflammatory cytokines were down regulated. Mitigation of lethal intestinal injury, following high doses of irradiation, {{can be achieved by}} intravenous transplantation of marrow-derived stromal cells, including mesenchymal, endothelial and macrophage cell population. BMASCT increases blood levels of intestinal growth factors and induces regeneration of the irradiated host ISC niche, thus providing a platform to discover potential <b>radiation</b> mitigators and <b>protectors</b> for acute <b>radiation</b> syndromes and chemo-radiation therapy of abdominal malignancies...|$|R
40|$|Lymphatic vessels play {{a crucial}} role in both the {{pathophysiology}} of tumors and in the spread cancer cells to lymph nodes. The effects of radiation on these vessels, however, are largely unknown. Here, we seek to describe the effects of ionizing radiation on normal and tumor-associated lymphatic vessels in vitro and in vivo. Clonogenic assays were employed to study the radiation dose response of lymphatic endothelial cells. Putative lymphatic endothelial cell mitogens and antiproliferative agents, including vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), VEGF-C and AZD 2171, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the VEGF receptors, were tested as <b>radiation</b> sensitizers and <b>protectors.</b> Our results indicate that VEGF-A and VEGF-C are radiosensitizers while AZD 2171 did not modulate the radioresponse. In vivo, normal lymphatics were studied with the experimental group receiving a single fraction of 8 Gy and the control group receiving no radiation. We observed no difference in the average lymphatic vessel diameter between these two groups over the course of 6 months. VEGF-C overexpressing tumor-associated lymphatic vessels were studied in vivo with four treatment groups: control animals (no irradiation), 8 Gy two weeks prior to implantation, 8 Gy at the time of implantation and 16 Gy given in two fractions before implantation (two weeks prior to and at the time of implantation). The average lymphatic vessel diameter and frequency of lymph node metastasis in these four groups indicates that the ability of radiation to prevent VEGF-C driven lymph node metastases is time-dependent; radiation must be delivered in close proximity to VEGF-C overexpressing tumor cell implantation to impact nodal metastases. This suggests that VEGF-C may be a functional lymphatic vessel radiosensitizer in vivo. (cont.) However, reductions in lymphatic hyperplasia, as measured by lymphatic vessel diameter, did not explain the observed differential effects of radiation timing on lymph node metastasis rate. by Jennifer D.

40|$|In {{radiation}} treatment, {{a sufficiently}} high radiation dose must {{be delivered to}} the tissue volumes containing the tumor cells while the lowest possible dose should be deposited in surrounding healthy tissue. We developed an original approach that is fast and easy to implement for the early assessment of the efficiency of <b>radiation</b> sensitizers and <b>protectors.</b> In addition, we characterized a new femtosecond laser pulse irradiation technique. We are able to deposit a considerable dose with a very high dose rate inside a well-controlled macroscopic volume without deposition of energy in front or behind the target volume. The radioprotective efficiency was measured by irradiation of the Fricke solution incorporating a compound under study and measuring the corresponding production of ferric ions G (Fe 3 +). The production of ferric ions is most sensitive to the radical species produced in the radiolysis of water. We studied experimentally and simulated with a full Monte-Carlo computer code the radiation-induced chemistry of Fricke/cystamine solutions. Results clearly indicate that the protective effect of cystamine originates from its radical-capturing ability, which allows this compound {{to compete with the}} ferrous ions for the various fre radicals - especially · OH radicals and H· atoms - formed during irradiation of the surrounding water. The sensitizing capacity of radiation sensitizers was measured by irradiation of a polyacrylamide gel (PAG) dosimeter incorporating a compound under study and measuring the corresponding increase in the gradient between spin-spin relaxation rate (R 2) and absorbed dose. We measured an irradiation energy-dependent increase in R 2 -dose sensitivity for halogenated compounds or a decrease for radioprotectors. Finally, we studied a novel laser irradiation method called "filamentation". We showed that this phenomenon results in an unprecedented deposition of energy and the dose rate thus achieved exceeds by orders of magnitude values previously reported for the most intense clinical radiotherapy systems. Moreover, the length of the dose-fre entrance region was adjusted by selecting the duration of femtosecond laser pulses. In addition, we provided evidence that the biological damage caused by this irradiation was similar to other ionizing radiation sources. [symboles non conformes...|$|R
