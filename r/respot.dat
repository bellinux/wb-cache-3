In the second round he fell 7-1 down to Dominic Dale and could never recover as he was beaten 13-4. Despite this run, Wasley could not quite reach the top 64 in the rankings as he was placed number 72, which would have seen him relegated from the tour.

50|$|Yu {{lost in the}} quarter-finals of the Yixing Open for {{the second}} year in a row, this time 4-1 to Ryan Day. He {{qualified}} for the Wuxi Classic but was beaten 5-4 by Yan Bingtao in the wildcard round, and lost 6-1 to Shaun Murphy in the opening round of the International Championship. Yu recorded his first win of the year at a ranking event by knocking out Oliver Lines 6-2 in the UK Championship and, though he led 3-0, he would be beaten 6-4 by Stephen Maguire in the second round. He received a bye through to the second round of the Welsh Open and was thrashed 4-0 by Joe Perry. In Yu's deciding frame of his first round match at the Indian Open he led Ben Woollaston 67-0, before the Englishman made a 67 break and won the <b>respotted</b> black. Yu closed out the season with a 5-3 loss to John Higgins in the first round of the China Open and reached the final round of World Championship qualifying where he was defeated 10-7 by Graeme Dott.|$|R
50|$|At the Welsh Open, Woollaston {{eliminated}} Thanawat Thirapongpaiboon, Mark Davis, Mark Allen and Ali Carter.

Woollaston led 5-3 and missed multiple chances {{to wrap up}} the match {{in the next two}} frames allowing Williams to send it into a decider. He made a match winning 60 break to play John Higgins, Woollaston's favourite player growing up, in his first ranking event final. Higgins fluked a green that helped him edge the first session 5-3 which seemed to sway the whole match as he took all four frames played upon the resumption of play to win 9-3. Afterwards, Woollaston stated that he had never felt he belonged with the top players in the televised stages of ranking events until this week. Woollaston came back from 67-0 down in the deciding frame of his first round Indian Open match to beat Yu Delu on a <b>respotted</b> black and then lost 4-1 to Kyren Wilson in the second round. His best season to date ended with a 10-6 loss to Robin Hull in World Championship qualifying. Woollaston's ranking of 32 in the world after the event was at that point the highest he had ever finished a season.|$|R
50|$|Due to non-entries {{among the}} top 16 players, Higginson was {{automatically}} seeded into the venue stages of first two major ranking events of the 2012/2013 season, Wuxi Classic and Australian Open, only to be beaten on both occasions by Robert Milkins and Ryan Day respectively. He was then whitewashed by Steve Davis in the qualifying for Shanghai Masters, making it three consecutive first round defeats for him. Higginson broke the streak by beating David Gilbert to reach the main draw of the International Championship, but was beaten 0-6 by Shaun Murphy {{in the first round}} at the venue in Chengdu, China. He suffered yet another whitewash in UK Championship qualifying, losing 0-6 to Liang Wenbo, and as a result fell to No. 29 in the world rankings. Higginson enjoyed more success in the minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events, reaching the semi-finals in Event One and European Tour Event Five; in the latter tournament he lost 3-4 to Anthony McGill on a <b>respotted</b> black, despite having been 3-1 ahead at one point and his opponent having needed two snookers in the decider. Higginson went on to finish 13th on the PTC Order of Merit to qualify for the Grand Final for the third year in a row.|$|R

McGill {{had a very good}} season in the Players Tour Championship events by reaching his first ever ranking final in the European Tour Event 5, played in his homeland of Scotland. He saw off the likes of Mark Davis and Robert Milkins to make it through to the quarter-finals where he was 0-3 and 51 points down against Thanawat Thirapongpaiboon to triumph 4-3. He was also 1-3 down in the semis to Andrew Higginson, but recovered to win on a <b>respotted</b> black. McGill played Ding Junhui in the final and came up short of winning the title as he lost 2-4. The run helped him to 16th on the PTC Order of Merit to qualify for the Finals, where he beat Milkins 4-2 before once again losing to Ding, this time by a 3-4 scoreline. In the third round of World Championship Qualifying McGill fought back from 3-8 down against Rod Lawler to force a decider which Lawler won. McGill ended the season at number 48 in the world rankings, at that point his highest position.|$|R

He reached his first ranking semi-final {{in his first}} season, and his first final in his second season, but his career peaked in the mid-1990s. In the 1994 World Championships, Bond pulled {{off one of the}} biggest comebacks in the event's history, rallying from 9-2 to defeat Cliff Thorburn 10-9 in what would be Thorburn's final appearance at the Crucible. A year later, Bond reached the final after beating Stephen Lee, Alan McManus, Gary Wilkinson and Andy Hicks, but lost to Stephen Hendry 18-9. This was his only semi-final run of the season. As a consequence of reaching the final, he climbed to number 5 in the world rankings for 1996/97, and in that same season he acquired his only ranking tournament victory (after three previous losing finals), the British Open, beating John Higgins 9-8 after needing a snooker in the final frame, winning the World Snooker Association Performance of the Year award for this achievement, although he has failed to maintain this level of performance.He reached at least the quarter finals at the Crucible Theatre every year from 1993 to 1996, losing to Stephen Hendry every time, which added extra spice to their first round match in 2006. After leading comfortably throughout the match Bond was pegged back to 7-7, and the match went to a final frame. With only the black remaining, and 7 points up, Bond clipped it into the left corner pocket, only for the cue ball to go [...] in the right middle pocket, resulting in a <b>respotted</b> black (the first one ever to decide the final frame of a World Championship match), which Bond potted to take frame and match. Final score 10-9, Bond's first win at the Crucible since 1999, and his only last-16 run of that season.|$|R

To better search for the Americans, the Japanese split their aircraft into two groups and Lexingtons radar acquired one of these at 16:25. At this time, the ship was rotating its CAP aircraft and the newly launched aircraft barely had time to reach the altitude of the Japanese before they arrived. Lexington had 15 fully fueled Wildcats and Dauntlesses on her forward flight deck that had been moved forward to allow the CAP fighters to land. They represented a serious fire hazard, but they could not be launched until all aircraft on the flight deck were moved aft. Cognizant of the danger, the deck crews succeeded in <b>respotting</b> the aircraft and the fueled aircraft were able to take off before the Japanese attacked. Per Commander Herbert Duckworth, [...] "It was as if some great hand moved all the planes aft simultaneously." [...] Only four of the nine G4Ms in the first wave survived to reach Lexington, but all of their bombs missed and they were all shot down afterward, including one by a Dauntless. The honors were not all one-sided as they shot down two of the defending Wildcats. The second wave of eight bombers was spotted at 16:56, while all but two of the Wildcats were dealing with the first wave. Lieutenant Edward O'Hare and his wingman, Lieutenant (junior grade) Marion Dufilho, were able to intercept the bombers a few miles short of Lexington, but Dufilho's guns jammed before he could fire a shot. O'Hare was able to shoot down three G4Ms and damage two others before the bombers were able to drop their bombs, none of which struck the wildly maneuvering carrier. Only three of the G4Ms reached base as those Wildcats and Dauntlesses with enough fuel pursued and shot down several others.|$|R
