2500|$|Miguel Concepcion from GameSpot {{praised the}} Drivatar {{system and the}} Driving Mods, as he thought that they have added more variety to races. He praised the system that rewards players using {{challenging}} settings with a corresponding number of credits and applauded the multiplayer modes featured in the game, which he thought suit the style of all kind of players, both new and old, but criticized the pre- and post-race visuals and replays for running at fewer than 60 frames per second. He also lauded the artificial intelligence for being [...] "unpredictable". However, Matthew Kato from Game Informer felt that the weather system was exaggerated, and added that they may take away the fun of some races, and the overhauled career mode, which he described as [...] "somewhere between those in Forza 5 and Forza 4" [...] is not engaging enough for most players. However, he praised the number of cars and tracks featured, {{as well as its}} high replay value. Justin Towell from GamesRadar criticized the game's slow-paced career mode, as he felt that it has failed to deliver an intense experience. He also felt the handling was [...] "odd" [...] and the Drivatar system was [...] "inconsistent". However, he praised the <b>rich</b> <b>content</b> featured, and added that by comparison, Forza 6 makes Forza 5 to look like a game demo instead of a full game.|$|E

However, he criticized the slow animation for the rogue career, {{as well as the}} tactical view, which could be confusing when encountering multiple enemies. He stated that such small yet noticeable flaws made Inquisition imperfect. Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot gave the game a 9/10. He praised the wonderful cast of interesting and relatable characters, overarching narrative, diverse environments, as well as the fantastic balance between exploration, combat, story, and customization. Yet, he criticized the combat system, which required relatively less strategy. Vince Ingenito from IGN gave the game a 8.8/10. He praised the substantial replay value from the multiplayer, as well as surprisingly huge, dense and detailed world. However, he criticized the weak and less compelling story, as well as numerous technical issues encountered. He described the game as [...] "not only one of the most expansive RPGs I've ever played, but one of the few that successfully fills its gorgeous, massive world with meaningful things to do and see.

60|$|After that interlude, {{when the}} streets of the Advanced Vaudeville, which we know as New York, begin again and {{continue}} till the Chasers come in late May, there will be many other sorts of weather, but none so characteristic of her. There will be the sort of weather toward the end of January, when really it seems as if nothing else could console him for the intolerable freezing and thawing, the snow upon snow, the rain upon rain, the winds that soak him and the winds that shrivel him, and the suns that mock him from a subtropic sky through subarctic air. We foresee him then settling into his arm-chair, while the wind whistles as naturally as the wind in the theatre around the angles of his lofty flat, and drives the snow of the shredded paper through the air or beats it in soft clots against the pane. He turns our page, and as he catches our vague drift, before yielding himself wholly to its allure, he questions, as readers like to do, whether the writer is altogether right in his contention that the mid-autumnal moment is the most characteristic moment of the New York year. Is not the mid-winter moment yet more characteristic? He conjures up, in the <b>rich</b> <b>content</b> of his indoor remoteness, the vision of the vile street below his flat, banked high with the garnered heaps of filthy snow, which alternately freeze and thaw, which the rain does not wash nor the wind blow away, and which the shredded-paper flakes are now drifting higher. He sees the foot-passers struggling under their umbrellas toward the avenues where the reluctant trolleys pause jarringly for them, and the elevated trains roar along the trestle overhead; where the saloon winks a wicked eye on every corner; where the signs of the whiskeys and actresses flare through the thickened night; and the cab tilts and rocks across the trolley rails, and the crowds of hotel-sojourners seek the shelter of the theatres, and all is bleak and wet and squalid. In more respectful vision he beholds the darkened mansions of the richest and best, who have already fled the scene of their brief winter revel and are forcing the spring in their Floridas, their Egypts, their Rivieras. He himself remains midway between the last fall and the next spring; and perhaps he decides against the writer, as the perverse reader sometimes will, and holds that this hour of suspense and misgiving is the supreme, the duodecimal hour of the metropolitan dial. He may be right; who knows? New York's hours are all characteristic; and the hour whose mystical quality we have been trying to intimate is already past, and we must wait another year before we can put it to the test again; wait till the trees once more stand perfectly still: yellow, yellowish-green, crimson, russet, and the wind comes up and blows them bare, and yet another summer is dead, and the mourners, the ghosts, the revenants have once more returned to town.|$|E
6000|$|By this, friend Charles, you may full plainly see Why I {{have never}} penn'd {{a line to}} thee: Because my {{thoughts}} were never free, and clear, And little fit to please a classic ear; Because my wine was of too poor a savour For one whose palate gladdens in the flavour Of sparkling Helicon:--small good it were To take him to a desert rude, and bare. Who had on Baiae's shore reclin'd at ease, While Tasso's page was floating in a breeze That gave soft music from Armida's bowers, Mingled with fragrance from her rarest flowers: Small good to one who had by Mulla's stream Fondled the maidens with the breasts of cream; Who had beheld Belphoebe in a brook, And lovely Una in a leafy nook, And Archimago leaning o'er his book: Who had of all that's sweet tasted, and seen, From silv'ry ripple, up to beauty's queen; From the sequester'd haunts of gay Titania, To the blue dwelling of divine Urania: One, who, of late, had ta'en sweet forest walks With him who elegantly chats, and talks-- The wrong'd Libert as,--who has told you stories Of laurel chaplets, and Apollo's glories; Of troops chivalrous prancing; through a city, And tearful ladies made for love, and pity: With many else which I have never known. Thus have I thought; and days on days have flown Slowly, or rapidly--unwilling still For you to try my dull, unlearned quill. Nor should I now, but that I've known you long; That you first taught me all the sweets of song: The grand, the sweet, the terse, the free, the fine; What swell'd with pathos, and what right divine: Spenserian vowels that elope with ease, And float along like birds o'er summer seas; Miltonian storms, and more, Miltonian tenderness; Michael in arms, and more, meek Eve's fair slenderness. Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly Up to its climax and then dying proudly? Who found for me {{the grandeur of the}} ode, Growing, like Atlas, stronger from its load? Who let me taste that more than cordial dram, The sharp, the rapier-pointed epigram? Shew'd me that epic was of all the king, Round, vast, and spanning all like Saturn's ring? You too upheld the veil from Clio's beauty, And pointed out the patriot's stern duty; The might of Alfred, and the shaft of Tell; The hand of Brutus, that so grandly fell Upon a tyrant's head. Ah! had I never seen, Or known your kindness, what might I have been? What my enjoyments in my youthful years, Bereft of all that now my life endears? And can I e'er these benefits forget? And can I e'er repay the friendly debt? No, doubly no;--yet should these rhymings please, I shall roll on the grass with two-fold ease: For I have long time been my fancy feeding With hopes that you would one day think the reading Of my rough verses not an hour misspent; Should it e'er be so, what a <b>rich</b> <b>content!</b> Some weeks have pass'd since last I saw the spires In lucent Thames reflected:--warm desires To see the sun o'er peep the eastern dimness, And morning shadows streaking into slimness Across the lawny fields, and pebbly water; To mark the time as they grow broad, and shorter; To feel the air that plays about the hills, And sips its freshness from the little rills; To see high, golden corn wave in the light When Cynthia smiles upon a summer's night, And peers among the cloudlet's jet and white, As though she were reclining in a bed Of bean blossoms, in heaven freshly shed. No sooner had I stepp'd into these pleasures Than I began to think of rhymes and measures: The air that floated by me seem'd to say [...] "Write! thou wilt never have a better day." [...] And so I did. When many lines I'd written, Though with their grace I was not oversmitten, Yet, as my hand was warm, I thought I'd better Trust to my feelings, and write you a letter. Such an attempt required an inspiration Of a peculiar sort,--a consummation;-- Which, had I felt, these scribblings might have been Verses from which the soul would never wean: But many days have past since last my heart Was warm'd luxuriously by divine Mozart; By Arne delighted, or by Handel madden'd; Or by the song of Erin pierc'd and sadden'd: What time you were before the music sitting, And the rich notes to each sensation fitting. Since I have walk'd with you through shady lanes That freshly terminate in open plains, And revel'd in a chat that ceased not When at night-fall among your books we got: No, nor when supper came, nor after that,-- Nor when reluctantly I took my hat; No, nor till cordially you shook my hand Mid-way between our homes:--your accents bland Still sounded in my ears, when I no more Could hear your footsteps touch the grav'ly floor. Sometimes I lost them, and then found again; You chang'd the footpath for the grassy plain. In those still moments I have wish'd you joys That well you know to honour:--"Life's very toys With him," [...] said I, [...] "will take a pleasant charm; It cannot be that ought will work him harm." [...] These thoughts now come o'er me with all their might:-- Again I shake your hand,--friend Charles, good night.|$|E

40|$|It is {{paramount}} to provide seamless and ubiquitous access to <b>rich</b> <b>contents</b> available online to interested users via {{a wide range}} of devices with varied characteristics. However, mobile devices accessing these <b>rich</b> <b>contents</b> are constrained by different capabilities e. g., display size, thus resulting poor browsing experiences e. g., unorganized layout. Recently, a service-oriented content adaptation (SOCA) scheme has emerged to address this content-device mismatch problem. In this scheme, content adaptation functions are provided as services by multiple providers. This elevates service discovery as an important problem. A QoS-based service discovery approach has been proposed and widely used to matchmaking the client QoS preference with the service advertised QoS. Most of these solutions assume that the client’s QoS is known apriori. However, these approaches suffer from unknown or partially specified client QoS. In this paper, we propose an approximation approach to deal with QoS uncertainty. Our solution considers the statistical approach to discover the suitable content adaptation services. The performance analysis verifies that our approach performs reasonably wel...|$|R
