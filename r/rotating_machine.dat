In this respect, cheap, user-friendly and precise assessment techniques and tools need to be developed. This paper researches the feasibility of unbalance defect detection in <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> based on sound analysis. It is well known that sound carries important information about the condition of rotating parts in <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> Two <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> were analyzed to find the differences in sound pattern between a fully functional machine and a machine with unbalance defect.

40|$|On-line partial {{discharge}} (PD) measurement is a recognized tool {{to assess the}} condition of stator winding insulation of <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> under normal machine operation. 80 pF high voltage capacitors {{have been widely used}} as a sensor for PD measurement in <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> for more than ten years. However, its detection sensitivity with respect to various types of <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> has not been fully investigated. As we know, PD activity in lower-voltage (e. g. 3. 3 kV- 6. 9 kV) <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> is usually lower than that in higher-voltage <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> Therefore, PD sensors with a higher sensitivity are required to detect relatively small PD pulses in lower-voltage <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> This paper presents theoretical analysis, laboratory tests and field test experience to compare the sensitivity of 80 pF capacitors and 500 pF capacitors for on-line PD measurement in lower-voltage <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> The PD detection sensitivity is studied by characterizing the frequency bandwidth of various capacitors and the frequency spectrum of a PD pulse. The relationship between the frequency characteristics of the various capacitors and the PD pulse indicates that the capacitor with a higher capacitance can detect more energy of the PD pulse, hence increasing PD detection sensitivity. The field test on a 6. 9 kV operating motor verifies that the 500 pF capacitor can detect the PD activity which the 80 pF capacitor was not able to. A comparison of statistics analysis of a number of motors installed with 500 pF capacitors and 80 pF capacitors shows that 500 pF capacitors detect more PD activity than 80 pF capacitors. This investigation concludes that 500 pF capacitors have higher sensitivity in PD measurement in <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> than 80 pF capacitors. 500 pF capacitors have been installed on more than forty <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> in utilities and petrochemical industries...|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} faults of <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> can be modelled {{by means of}} proper sets of equivalent excitations having a suitable harmonic content. Therefore, mathematical models of <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> {{can be used by}} fault identification techniques that compare the experimental vibration data to the corresponding theoretical response of the rotor-system caused by a specific set of excitations. Unfortunately, several different faults can cause similar symptoms in the vibration of large <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> and, in the common case of flexible rotors, only a well-tuned model is able to provide reliable fault identifications. This paper shows the results of a study in which the cause of the abnormal vibration of the generator of a power unit has been investigated considering different types of fault. A thermal bow of the generator rotor has shown to be able to fit the simulation of the experimental transient vibrations. The diagnostic strategy used to investigate this case study can be applied to identify many other types of faults in <b>rotating</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} {{technique}} for detecting faults is the time-frequency analysis technique. For a <b>rotating</b> <b>machine,</b> the rotational {{speed of the}} machine (often known as the RPM), is not a constant, especially not during the start-up and shutdown stages of the machine. Even if the machine is running in the steady state, the rotational speed will vary around a steady-state mean value, and this variation depends on load and other factors. Since sound and vibration signals obtained from a <b>rotating</b> <b>machine</b> which are strongly related to its rotational speed, {{it can be said}} that they are time-variant signals in nature. These time-variant features carry the machine fault signatures. Consequently, how these features are extracted and interpreted is important to research and industrial applications.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- There {{are many}} {{statistics}} dealing with failure causes of high voltage <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> While these statistics prove {{the relevance of}} the insulation as failure cause, they give little information on the real failure mechanism. This paper gives results of a research project which was launched to investigate degradation and final breakdown of the mica insulation in <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> The project was performed by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich in collaboration with several industrial partners and electric power companies. Final failure of the insulation is usually caused by electric breakdown through a tree channel. Formation and propagation of trees in the mica insulation therefore reflect the ageing process of the insulation. Dominating ageing factors of the mica insulation are thermal and mechanical stress. Manufacturing defects of the mica insulation- such as delaminations, cracks, voids and wrinkled or damaged mica layers- accelerate the formation and propagation of trees. We conclude that good workmanship and proper application of the insulation materials are important factors for the lifetime of high voltage <b>rotating</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R
