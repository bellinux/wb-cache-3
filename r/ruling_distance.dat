The wear {{analysis}} of chisel-edge ruling tool for diffraction gratings is very complex because of following two reasons {{that one is}} the wear distribution on edge after grating ruling is too minute so that hard to find and measured by conventional equipment like microscope, {{and the other is}} the effect of wear on the groove depth, pitch, ridge, blaze angle, non-blaze angle, groove bottom angle and diffraction efficiency of gratings. In order to determine what extent of wear is can be ignored, this paper had go on brief approximate test study on wear {{analysis of}} chisel-edge ruling tool for diffraction gratings which ruling echelle gratings groove density of 79 gr/mm, and analyzed the variation of groove depth, pitch, ridge, blaze angle, non-blaze angle, groove bottom angle and diffraction efficiency along with <b>ruling</b> <b>distance,</b> and found the microscale tool wear on chisel-edge ruling tool, finally determined this extent of tool wear cannot effect ruling echelle gratings groove density of 79 gr/mm...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{transition}} from the incoherent to the coherent regime for thermal radiation between bodies trough a transparent medium is discussed. The canonical case of two parallel semi-infinite planar media {{is used as a}} basis to provide an insight into the physics and quantities <b>ruling</b> the <b>distance</b> at which coherent effects {{have an impact on the}} propagative component of the net heat flux exchanged. A practical criterion is proposed to define the distance below which radiation intensity framework should not be used, but instead fluctuational electrodynamics...|$|R
50|$|The {{records of}} 19th-century British India reveal that health and hygiene {{of the troops}} {{was one of the}} major areas of concern which the rulers of the day had to contend with. This {{consideration}} coupled with the desire of an alien <b>ruling</b> elite to <b>distance</b> itself from the native population {{led to the development of}} an insulated type of character in all these cantonments which continues today.|$|R
25|$|The {{president}} changed Argentina's {{position on}} {{conflicts in the}} Middle East. During Macri's first week in office he voided the memorandum of understanding between Argentina and Iran which would have established a joint investigation of the 1994 AMIA bombing, a terrorist attack on a Jewish organization for which Argentina has blamed Hezbollah and Iran. The memorandum had been ruled unconstitutional by the judiciary, a ruling which was appealed during Kirchner's presidency. Macri withdrew the appeal, upholding the original <b>ruling.</b> He <b>distanced</b> himself from Iran and encouraged continued investigations of the AMIA bombing {{and the death of}} Alberto Nisman, a prosecutor investigating the case. Those cases and Nisman's probe of Kirchner have special importance for Argentina–Israel relations, and ambassador Carlos Faustino García and Israeli diplomat Modi Efraim praised Macri for encouraging the investigations. In July 2016, it was announced that Argentina would grant asylum to 3,000 refugees of the Syrian Civil War.|$|R
50|$|This scandal {{represented}} a serious crisis for the ruling coalition, because the implication {{was that the}} Congress party, which had been away from power for nearly a decade, had indulged in international corruption to replenish its coffers and fight elections. Natwar Singh's closeness to Sonia Gandhi was well-known, and it was generally surmised that he had acted as a front for that family and the party. A need was felt for the party (and <b>ruling</b> family) to <b>distance</b> itself from Natwar Singh, and also to find a scapegoat to whom the blame could be transferred, so that party and family alike could proclaim themselves clean. A convenient occasion was supplied by Anil Mathrani, then Indian Ambassador to Croatia and formerly a close aide to Natwar Singh, who alleged that Natwar Singh had used an official visit to Iraq to procure oil coupons for Jagat Singh from Saddam's regime.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{observations}} {{suggested that}} Ceres has active, but possibly sporadic, water outgassing {{as well as}} possibly varying spectral characteristics over a timescale of months. We used all available data of Ceres collected {{in the past three}} decades from the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as the newly acquired images by the Dawn[*] Framing Camera, to search for spectral and albedo variability on Ceres, on both a global scale and in local regions, particularly the bright spots inside the Occator crater, over timescales of a few months to decades. Our analysis has placed an upper limit on the possible temporal albedo variation on Ceres. Sporadic water vapor venting, or any possibly ongoing activity on Ceres, is not significant enough to change the albedo or the area of the bright features in the Occator crater by > 15 %, or the global albedo by > 3 % over the various timescales that we searched. Recently reported spectral slope variations can be explained by changing Sun–Ceres–Earth geometry. The active area on Ceres is less than 1 km[superscript 2], too small to cause global albedo and spectral variations detectable in our data. Impact ejecta due to impacting projectiles of tens of meters in size like those known to cause observable changes to the surface albedo on Asteroid Scheila cannot cause detectable albedo change on Ceres due to its relatively large size and strong gravity. The water vapor activity on Ceres is independent of Ceres' heliocentric <b>distance,</b> <b>ruling</b> out the possibility of the comet-like sublimation process as a possible mechanism driving the activity...|$|R
40|$|In 2012, California {{banned the}} sale of force-fed foie gras¾the “fatty liver” of ducks and geese. Just three years later, a federal {{district}} court overturned that ban in Association des Éleveurs de Canards et d’Oies du Québec v. Harris (Canards). Animal rights activists decried the decision as a step backwards in ethical eating. Industry groups retorted that the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) required the <b>ruling.</b> From a <b>distance,</b> several commentators inquired: was foie gras worth the fuss? This Note responds affirmatively. Section 467 (e) of the PPIA prohibits states from imposing “ingredient requirements” that are “in addition to, or different than” those made under the PPIA. The Canards court construed that provision as expressly preempting California’s foie gras ban, which¾unlike the PPIA¾mandated that foie gras products come from non-forced-fed ducks and geese. This reasoning is problematic. By literally imposing section 467 (e), the Canards court failed to rigorously analyze whether California’s ban created an ingredient requirement {{within the meaning of}} the PPIA. A proper preemption analysis requires that contextual construction. Further, the PPIA’s purpose and legislative history suggest that section 467 (e) should not be read as preempting California’s ban. The Canards court’s reasoning might have dramatic implications. Because the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Egg Products Inspection Act contain virtually identical preemption provisions, other courts could apply the Canards court’s logic to displace state laws providing from the humane treatment of cows, pigs, and egg-laying hens. In other words, Canards could broadly eviscerate states’ ability to regulate animal cruelty. As a consequence, the foie gras fight extends far beyond ducks and geese. It may affect the food we all eat...|$|R
5|$|Æthelwulf {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 825, when Egbert won the crucial Battle of Ellandun against King Beornwulf of Mercia, ending the long Mercian ascendancy over southern England. Egbert followed {{it up by}} sending Æthelwulf with Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Wulfheard, Ealdorman of Hampshire, with a large army into Kent to expel sub-king Baldred. Æthelwulf was descended from kings of Kent, and he was sub-king of Kent, and of Surrey, Sussex and Essex, which were then included in the sub-kingdom, until he inherited the throne of Wessex in 839. His sub-kingship is recorded in charters, in some of which King Egbert acted with his son's permission, such as a grant in 838 to Bishop Beornmod of Rochester, and Æthelwulf himself issued a charter as King of Kent in the same year. Unlike their Mercian predecessors, who alienated the Kentish people by <b>ruling</b> from a <b>distance,</b> Æthelwulf and his father successfully cultivated local support by governing through Kentish ealdormen and promoting their interests. In Abels' view, Egbert and Æthelwulf rewarded their friends and purged Mercian supporters. Historians take differing views on {{the attitude of the}} new regime to the Kentish church. At Canterbury in 828 Egbert granted privileges to the bishopric of Rochester, and according to the historian of Anglo-Saxon England Simon Keynes, Egbert and Æthelwulf took steps to secure the support of Archbishop Wulfred. However, the medievalist Nicholas Brooks argues that Wulfred's Mercian origin and connections proved a liability. Æthelwulf seized an estate in East Malling from the Canterbury church on the ground that it had only been granted by Baldred when he was in flight from the West Saxon forces; the issue of archiepiscopal coinage was suspended for several years; and the only estate Wulfred was granted after 825 he received from King Wiglaf of Mercia.|$|R
40|$|Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) serves {{not only}} as a high energy carbon {{compound}} in glycolysis, but it acts also as precursor for plastidial anabolic sequences like the shikimate pathway, which produces aromatic amino acids (AAA) and subsequently secondary plant products. After conversion to pyruvate, PEP can also enter de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids, and the non-mevalonate way of isoprenoid production. As PEP cannot be generated by glycolysis in chloroplasts and a variety of non-green plastids, it has to be imported from the cytosol by a phosphate translocator (PT) specific for PEP (PPT). A loss of function of PPT 1 in Arabidopsis thaliana results in the chlorophyll a/b binding protein underexpressed 1 (cue 1) mutant, which is characterised by reticulate leaves and stunted roots. Here we dissect the shoot- and root phenotypes, and also address the question whether or not long distance signalling by metabolites is involved in the perturbed mesophyll development of cue 1. Reverse grafting experiments showed that the shoot- and root phenotypes develop independently from each other, <b>ruling</b> out long <b>distance</b> metabolite signalling. The leaf phenotype could be transiently modified even in mature leaves, e. g. by an inducible PPT 1 RNAi approach or by feeding aromatic amino acids (AAA), the cytokinin trans-zeatin (tZ), or the putative signalling molecule dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol glucoside (DCG). Hormones, such as auxins, abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, ethylene, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid did not rescue the cue 1 leaf phenotype. The low cell density 1 (lcd 1) mutant shares the reticulate leaf-, but not the stunted root phenotype with cue 1. It could neither be rescued by AAA nor by tZ. In contrast, tZ and AAA further inhibited root growth both in cue 1 and wild-type plants. Based on our results, we propose a model that PPT 1 acts as a net importer of PEP into chloroplast, but as an overflow valve and hence exporter in root plastids...|$|R
