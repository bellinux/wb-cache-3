5|$|Developed {{version of}} the B.1. Larger, thinner wing than the B.1 (Phase 2C wing) and fitted with Olympus 201-202 engines of 17,000 lbf (76 kN) each, or Olympus 301 engines of 20,000 lbf (89 kN) each. Uprated {{electrics}} with Auxiliary Airborne Power Plant (AAPP) (Auxiliary power unit) and <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Turbine</b> (RAT). ECM similar to B.1A. Terrain-Following Radar (TFR) in nose thimble radome fitted to most aircraft in mid-60s. New Radar warning receiver aerials on tail fin giving it a square top from the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
25|$|The main {{generating}} plant {{was inside the}} hull and consisted of two fuel-burning generators. Two small <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbines</b> attached to the main gondola on swinging arms supplemented electrical power for the radio room, internal lighting, the galley, and acted as a reserve. Batteries stored the electrical energy so that radio operation was independent of airspeed. The gondola also had a gasoline generator for emergency power.|$|R
50|$|Small inlets on {{the roots}} of the stub wings holding the engines allow air into the missile body for two tasks. Two <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbines</b> driving turbopumps {{generate}} hydraulic power for the wing control system, and a fuel pump that feeds the engines. Smaller inlet tubes provide <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> to pressurize the fuel tanks. Kerosene fuel is held in two large rubber bag tanks in bays either side of the wing bay where the wings are attached. Electrical power was provided by a molten salt battery ignited at launch.|$|R
500|$|The [...] "Phase 2A" [...] {{proposal}} {{was accepted by}} the Air Staff as the [...] Victor B.2, with Conway RCo.11 engines providing [...] The new Conway engines required redesigned enlarged intakes to provide the greater airflow required. The wingtips were extended, increasing the wingspan to 120ft (36.6m). The B.2 featured distinctive retractable [...] "elephant ear" [...] intakes not found on the B.1, located on the rear fuselage forward of the tail fin. These scoops fed <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> to <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Turbines</b> (RAT) which could provide electrical power during emergency situations, such as engine failure, during flight.|$|R
5|$|The P.1127 lacked any in-built armaments, {{the ethos}} of {{tactical}} flexibility meant a reliance upon underwing hard point-mounted munitions and equipment, which included multiple 2-inch rocket batteries, 30-mm ADEN cannon gun pods, and 1,000 lb bombs, napalm, and range-extending drop tanks. The prototypes were furnished with long nose-mounted instrumentation booms, these were replaced on the Kestrel with a much smaller counterpart on the vertical stabilizer to enable the nose to accommodate a tactical camera instead. An unusual feature of the P.1127 was the installation of a <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> upon the rear fuselage just forward of the vertical stabilizer to provide power for ancillary services {{in the event of}} engine failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|E
5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, the aircraft's <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E
5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbines</b> (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to trouble}} getting the <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> option {{approved}} for emissions reasons, Ford offered an 'exterior decor' option in 1973 {{that consisted of}} the two-tone hood treatment, but without the actual functional components of the <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> system. Actual engine options available with <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> in 1973 were limited to the 351 2V, even though the 351 4V 'Cobra Jet' (without <b>Ram</b> <b>Air)</b> remained optional on every model.|$|R
5000|$|To {{increase}} <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> recovery, {{nearly all}} jetliners use modulating vanes on the <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> exhaust. A [...] "ram air fan" [...] within the ram system provides <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> flow across the heat exchangers when the aircraft {{is on the}} ground. Nearly all modern fixed-wing aircraft use a fan on a common shaft with the ACM, powered by the ACM turbine.|$|R
25|$|The P-1 is {{equipped}} with many newly developed technology and features, particularly {{in terms of its}} avionics and missions systems. One such key feature is the use of a fly-by-light flight control system. This has the effect of decreasing electro-magnetic disturbances to the sensors in comparison to more common fly-by-wire control systems. The P-1 is the first production aircraft in the world to be equipped with such a flight control system. Various onboard systems are provided by Honeywell, who is the largest non-Japanese supplier to the project, such as the auxiliary power unit, environmental and pressurization control systems, <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine,</b> sonobuoy dispensers and elements of the avionics.|$|E
25|$|The Hawk was {{designed}} to be manoeuvrable and can reach Mach0.88 in level flight and Mach1.15 in a dive, thus allowing trainees to experience transonic flight before advancing to a supersonic trainer. The airframe is very durable and strong, stressed for +9g, the normal limit in RAF service is +7.5/-4g. A dual hydraulic system supplies power to operate systems such as the aircraft's flaps, airbrakes and landing gear, together with the flight controls. A <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> is fitted in front of the single tail fin to provide backup hydraulic power for the flight controls {{in the event of an}} engine failure, additionally a gas turbine auxiliary power unit is housed directly above the engine.|$|E
25|$|The AJ, SF, SH and SK 37 {{models of}} the Viggen had {{the first version of}} the RM8A engine with uprated {{internal}} components from the JT8D that it was based on. Thrust was 65.6kN dry and 115.6kN with afterburner. For the JA 37, the RM8A was developed into the RM8B, achieved by adding a third low-pressure compressor stage over the preceding model, increasing the turbine inlet temperature and fuel diffusion within the combustion chamber. Thrust is 72.1kN dry and 125.0kN with afterburner. Due to the increased length and weight of the RM8B engine over its predecessor, the airframe of the JA 37 was stretched in order to accommodate it. Onboard electrical power was provided by a 60 kVA generator. In the event of an in-flight engine failure, emergency power was provided by an automatically deploying <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> (RAT), capable of generating 6 kVA.|$|E
50|$|RAPS or <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> Progression System is a {{parachuting}} {{training system}} designed to take a student from beginner to the FAI A License (or Category 8) using square <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> canopies.|$|R
2500|$|By this time, {{the gross}} power ratings of both <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> engines were highly suspect, bearing less {{relationship}} to developed power {{and more to}} an internal GM policy limiting all cars except the Corvette {{to no more than}} one advertised horsepower per [...] of curb weight. The higher-revving <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> IV's advertised power peak was actually listed at 5,000rpm—100rpm lower than the less-powerful <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> III.|$|R
25|$|The {{base engine}} was {{unchanged}} for 1970, but the low-compression economy engine was deleted and the <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> III and <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> IV remained available, although {{the latter was}} now a special-order option.|$|R
500|$|High-pressure {{hydraulic}} system using 28 MPa (4,000lbf/in²) for lighter hydraulic components, tripled independent systems ("Blue", [...] "Green", and [...] "Yellow") for redundancy, with an emergency <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> (RAT) {{stored in the}} port-inner elevon jack fairing supplying [...] "Green" [...] and [...] "Yellow" [...] as backup.|$|E
500|$|An early 767 {{incident}} was survived by all on board. On July 23, 1983, Air Canada Flight 143, a 767-200, {{ran out of}} fuel in-flight and had to glide with both engines out for almost [...] to an emergency landing at Gimli, Manitoba. The pilots used the aircraft's <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> to power the hydraulic systems for aerodynamic control. There were no fatalities and only minor injuries. This aircraft was nicknamed [...] "Gimli Glider" [...] after its landing site. The aircraft, registered C-GAUN, continued flying for Air Canada until its retirement in January 2008.|$|E
500|$|For greater {{efficiency}} and higher reliability, the main {{system on the}} B.2 was changed to three-phase 200V AC at 400Hz supplied by four 40kVA engine-driven constant speed alternators. Engine starting was then by air-starters supplied from a Palouste compressor on the ground. Standby supplies {{in the event of}} a main AC failure were provided by a <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> (RAT) driving a 17kVA alternator that could operate from high altitudes down to , and an airborne auxiliary power plant (AAPP), a Rover gas turbine driving a 40kVA alternator, which could be started once the aircraft was below an altitude of [...] Secondary electrical supplies were by transformer-rectifier units (TRUs) for 28 V DC and rotary frequency converters for the 115V 1600Hz single phase supplies.|$|E

2500|$|The engine line-up was {{slightly}} revised for 1969. All models, except Torino GTs and Cobras, came standard {{with a new}} larger [...] I-6 engine. The larger displacement produced more power and torque than the [...] engine. Optional engines included the -2V (standard on GTs), the new for 1969 -2V Windsor, 351-4V Windsor, -4V, and the -4V Cobra Jet (standard on Cobras). The 428 CJ was available {{with or without the}} <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> Induction package, however, those with <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> still carried the same advertised power rating. The 428 CJ without <b>Ram</b> <b>Air,</b> came with the following items: 80-ampere heavy-duty battery, 3.25:1 open differential, heavy-duty cooling package, 55-ampere alternator, chrome valve covers and dual exhaust.

500|$|On 17 January 1977, Vulcan B.2 XM600 of No. 101 Squadron crashed near Spilsby, Lincolnshire. During a {{practice}} emergency descent, the bomb bay fire warning light flashed on followed by No.2 engine fire warning light. The captain shut the engine {{down and the}} AEO reported flames coming from the area of No.2 engine, just behind the deployed <b>Ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> (RAT). As the fire intensified, the captain ordered the aircraft to be abandoned. The three rear crew members escaped at around [...] After ordering the co-pilot to eject, the captain ejected at around , as control was lost. The cause was due to arcing on the RAT's electrical terminals, burning a hole in an adjacent fuel pipe and setting the fuel on fire.|$|E
500|$|Knowing the {{location}} at the seventh handshake, investigators then {{needed to determine}} an appropriate width of the search area from the seventh arc. The seventh handshake was a 'log-on request' initiated by the aircraft and {{is believed to be}} the result of the SDU starting after power failure, resulting from fuel exhaustion and following the deployment of the <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> and restart of the auxiliary power unit. The log-on request would have occurred 3 minutes and 40 seconds after fuel exhaustion—commonly known as flameout in aviation—of the second engine (flameout of both engines would not have occurred simultaneously), at which point the autopilot would have disengaged. The BFO value of this handshake indicates the aircraft may have been descending and the aircraft was travelling northeast to southwest. The ATSB has determined that an unresponsive crew/hypoxia event [...] "appeared to best fit the available evidence" [...] for the period of flight that Flight 370 tracked south over the Indian Ocean.|$|E
500|$|Since the {{aircraft}} {{did not respond}} to a ping at 09:15, it can be concluded that at some point between 08:19 and 09:15, {{the aircraft}} lost the ability to communicate with the ground station.

2500|$|The XF-84H was destabilized by the {{powerful}} torque from the propeller, as well as inherent problems with supersonic propeller blades. A number of exotic blade configurations were tested before settling on a final design. Various design features were intended to counteract the massive torque, including mounting the left leading edge intake [...] further forward than the right, and providing left and right flaps with differential operation. The two prototypes were equally plagued with engine-related problems affecting other aircraft fitted with T40 engines, such as the Douglas XA2D Skyshark and North American A2J Super Savage attack aircraft. A notable feature of the design was that the XF-84H was the first aircraft to carry a retractable/extendable <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbine.</b> In the event of engine failure, it would automatically swing out into the airstream to provide hydraulic and electrical power.
