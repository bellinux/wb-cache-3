40|$|The {{quality of}} a {{grinding}} operation depends on the behaviour of the grinding wheel in the grinding process. Understanding {{the performance of a}} grinding wheel is required for control of the grinding process. In this paper, the variation of grinding performance is analysed by taking the attritious wheel wear and bond fracture into account. The paper describes various physical effects in grinding and how these are mathematically modelled and simulated. Based on understanding the grinding behaviour in a wheel <b>redress</b> <b>life</b> cycle, a strategy has been developed to enable a stable optimal grinding performance to be achieved...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{simulating}} dressing and grinding {{was described in}} Parts I and II of this paper. In Part IV, the effects of wheel wear and wheel characteristics on grinding performance are simulated and compared with experimental results. The results show that grinding performance is strongly affected by dressing conditions immediately after dressing. As grinding continues, the grinding power, and also the surface roughness, tends to converge towards similar values for all dressing conditions when the same grinding conditions are employed. Results from the simulation show that the influence of wheel wear {{is affected by the}} wheel fracture characteristics. The convergence of the grinding behaviour shown in the simulation and experiments suggests that stable grinding performance in a wheel <b>redress</b> <b>life</b> cycle may be achieved by selecting dressing conditions, taking account of the grinding behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{grinding}} {{power is}} often used as a parameter for monitoring the grinding process. The power may {{also be used to}} monitor the effects of dressing. Empirical models are required to guide the selection of the dressing and grinding conditions. In this paper, the effects of dressing conditions and grinding conditions on grinding force and grinding power are reviewed. The effects of grinding conditions and dressing conditions on grinding force and grinding power are related to the shape of the idealized chip thickness. It is found that the grinding force and grinding power can be related to the dressing operation by considering the effective density of the cutting edges on the wheel surface. The semi-empirical model developed in this paper can be used to predict the variation of the grinding power during the wheel <b>redress</b> <b>life</b> cycle. Therefore the model can be used to guide the selection of dressing and grinding conditions. The potential use of the model for adaptive control of the grinding process is also described...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{emerging}} interest and a developing evidence base about {{the significance of}} dementia within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities 1 across Australia. Poor Indigenous health status remains a fundamental issue, particularly when compared to New Zealand and North America where in the past ten years health inequities have begun to be successfully <b>redressed.</b> As the <b>life</b> expectancy of Indigenous Australians has started to increase beyond 45 years, the issue of dementia is becoming a priority health issue to address. As there is currently, on average, a 17 year gap in life years between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, {{there is a need to}} better understand both dementia and ageing within the Indigenous context in order to provide meaningful services and care. Within a historical context, colonization has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on the health of Indigenous people. In 1997, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission released its report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families, more commonly known as the Bringing Them Home report (Australian Human Rights Commission, 1997). The report examined evidence from members of the ‘stolen generations’, a term which refers to those Indigenous children forcibly removed from their families and communities as part of past government policies. The legacies of past policies continue to impact upon Indigenous Australians, many of whom continue to experience multiple disadvantages including diminished mental and physical health as they age...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{delivered}} {{as part of}} a panel entitled “The Justness of Criminal Justice: How has the Charter Changed the Problems We Face?” Participants were asked to “reflect on the social justice issues raised {{in the criminal justice system}} and how those issues have remained, changed or been <b>redressed</b> over the <b>life</b> of the Charter”. The author’s the sis is: (1) the criminal justice system is overflowing with social justice issues; (2) the most significant insight about the criminal justice system in the past 30 years is that criminal law raises equality values; (3) the Charter has had something (but not much) to do with raising that claim; (4) it would be naive to assume that Charter rights could singlehandedly ameliorate the multi-dimensional nature of the social injustice perpetrated by the criminal justice system; and (5) the Charter’s most important role in improving the system is in its potential to “unearth, render visible and potentiate criminal justice responses to systemic inequality”. The paper examines two areas in which the Charter has had a significant impact on how criminal justice issues are conceptualized. The first is in the construction of blame and the move away from a simplistic subjectivism. The second is in the overt recognition of the equality dimensions of many criminal law problems such as, for example, sexual assault, intoxication and the affirmative defences. The author concludes by examining three recent cases in which equality values have played a significant role: R. v. Tran, Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford and R. v. Ipeelee, along with two recent sentencing decisions where equality arguments were unsuccessful (R. v. Nur and R. v. Johnson). While acknowledging that equality raises challenging questions which are complex and multifaceted, the author nevertheless insists that our professional commitments to democracy and social justice require that it be taken seriously...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The requirements placed on Olympic and professional athletes in contemporary world sport are such {{that they need to}} dedicate themselves more and more to achieving excellence. This immediately implies that most athletes' time is dedicated to developing their sporting career, with very little time left to develop other aspects of their lives outside their sport. The reality facing many elite athletes is that few are sufficiently financially rewarded to allow them to make a living out of their sport, and even fewer can rely on measures in place in their own country to assist with the financial and psychological impacts of their retirement from sport (Stambulova, Stephan, & Japhag,. 2007). This places even more importance on the need for the athlete to either have a 'dual career' or else to prepare for a post-athletic career while still participating in elite sport. However, though policy makers have begun to demonstrate an awareness of these needs, and programmes have been developed to assist in the educational and vocational development of athletes, little effort has been made to identify how athletes perceive the choices which face them and how they negotiate a way through the challenges of developing and maintaining a dual career. To <b>redress</b> this, a <b>life</b> story approach has been adopted during this research study to try to elicit student-athletes' own life experiences and to identify and evaluate the decision-making processes they go through, in order to combine an academic and elite sporting career successfully. The athletes selected for the development of life-stories are drawn from three countries, Finland, France and the UK which reflect different approaches to state intervention in sport/education (Amara, Aquilina, Henry, & Taylor, 2004). Crucial to an evaluation of these national systems is an understanding of what these policy systems are seeking to achieve. This may be expressed in terms of a balance between the roles; rights and responsibilities of the main stakeholders (including the athlete, the university, the Member State and the European Union) which are articulated within the study. This research study therefore seeks to develop an understanding of the perspectives on student-athletes' development in academic and sporting terms, identifying the principal challenges faced and how these may be overcome, and considers the implications of such insights for practitioners and policy makers...|$|R
