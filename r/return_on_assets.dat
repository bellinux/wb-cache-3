25|$|With the {{election}} of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 the water and sanitation sector initially remained public, but the government attempted to make the enterprises operate more along commercial lines.

2500|$|Instead of {{deploying}} their margin advantage as a defence of mutuality, around 1980 building societies began setting {{mortgage rates}} {{with reference to}} market clearing levels. In sum they began behaving more like banks, seeking to maximise profit instead {{of the advantages of}} a mutual organisation. Thus, according to the Bank of England's Boxall and Gallagher (1997), [...] "... there was virtually no difference between banks and building society 'listed' interest rates for home finance mortgage lending between 1984 and 1997. This behaviour resulted in a <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>assets</b> for building societies which was at least as high as Plc banks and, in the absence of distribution, led to rapid accumulation of reserves".

[...] To do this, the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks to the cash flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments. [...] Acquisition debt in an LBO is often non-recourse to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor. [...] Therefore, an LBO transaction's financial structure is particularly attractive to a fund's limited partners, allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage. [...] This kind of financing structure leverage benefits an LBO's financial sponsor in two ways: (1) the investor itself only needs to provide {{a fraction of the}} capital for the acquisition, and (2) the returns to the investor will be enhanced (as long as the <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>assets</b> exceeds the cost of the debt).|$|E
