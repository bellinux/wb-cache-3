25|$|On {{the evening}} of 10 August he was obliged to take refuge {{at the home of}} Armand-Gaston Camus, the Assembly's archivist. Several days later he moved to the Hotel Strasbourg, on the rue Neuve Saint Eustache. On 3 September 1792, hearing a commotion in the courtyard, he thought himself betrayed; but it was in fact the passage of a <b>rabble</b> brandishing the head of the Princesse de Lamballe on a pole.|$|E
25|$|Paparrigopoulos {{was born}} in Constantinople in 1815. His father, a native of Vytina, was killed by the <b>rabble</b> of Constantinople when the Greek War of Independence erupted in 1821. Paparrigopoulos not only saw this grisly spectacle, but he also {{attended}} the execution of his brother, Michael, and of his two uncles. His mother who survived the slaughters fled to Odessa, where Paparrigopoulos accomplished his studies as a bursar of the Tsar Alexander I.|$|E
25|$|Mutaguchi {{ordered the}} Japanese 31st Division, which had retreated from Kohima when {{threatened}} with starvation, {{to join the}} 15th Division in a renewed attack on Imphal from the north. Neither division obeyed the order, being in no condition to comply. When he realised that none of his formations were obeying his orders to attack, Mutaguchi finally ordered the offensive to be broken off on 3 July. The Japanese, reduced in many cases to a <b>rabble,</b> fell back to the Chindwin, abandoning their artillery, transport, and many soldiers too badly wounded or sick to walk.|$|E

50|$|The company {{installed}} a very complete electrical transmission plant and the ore was hoisted up an inclined tramway {{to the top}} of the hill by means of motors; the dust was sucked back from the chambers, a Roots blower was operated, the furnace was <b>rabbled,</b> and the ore conveyed.|$|R
60|$|The burly Swiss hesitated, brave man {{though he}} was. Alvaro de' Alvari and Gismondo Santi {{looked at each}} other in alarm, and the intrepid old statesman, in whose heart no pang of fear had been awakened by the <b>rabble's</b> {{threatening}} bay, changed colour as he heard that order given.|$|R
25|$|After being {{rejected}} {{by a number}} of local media companies, Christopher succeeded in having his Talisman story published by a small online magazine that specializes in publishing un- and under-reported news stories, rabble.ca. About a week later Christopher's article on <b>Rabble</b> was noticed by the Financial Times of London. After the Financial Times ran the Tailsman story, it was noticed by other news services and was circulated globally via the Associated Press, Canadian Press, and Reuters. The negative publicity caused by Christopher's article forced Talisman to suspend its operations in Sudan within about a year, but local media never carried the article.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{arose in}} Córdoba between Christians and conversos, where they formed two hostile parties. On March 14, 1473, during a {{dedication}} procession, a girl accidentally threw dirty {{water from the}} window of the house of one of the wealthiest conversos (the customary way to dispose of it.) The water splashed on an image of the Virgin being carried in procession in honor of a new society (from which conversos had been excluded by Bishop D. Pedro.) A local blacksmith started arousing a <b>rabble</b> against the Jews, who he blamed for the insult, which immediately joined in a fierce shout for revenge.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} of Herod Agrippa as a cruel, heartless king who persecuted the Jerusalem church, having James son of Zebedee killed and imprisoning Peter, stands {{in contrast with}} Josephus' account of a kindly man. According to Josephus, he was a milder ruler than his grandfather Herod the Great, and Josephus records him as talking with and then forgiving a law student accused of political <b>rabble</b> rousing, rather than punishing him as his grandfather and some other Herods would have done. Christian scholars argue that the biblical account makes sense given that Agrippa had been raised with a strong Jewish identity. Agrippa would resent a movement begun during his absence from Judæa that tried to declare a man as divine.|$|E

In this article low filled conductive composites were fabricated with expanded graphite (EG) and vinyl ester resin (VER).

The results can provide good reference for the following bipolar plate researches...|$|R
5000|$|In the 15th century, {{it would}} not be {{surprising}} for Florentine scholars, who were part of the elite, to view the uprising negatively. Leonardo Bruni regarded the uprising as a mob out of control, whose members viciously looted and murdered innocent people. [...] He viewed this event as a historical cautionary tale, which presented the horrendous consequence when <b>rabbles</b> managed to seize control from the ruling class.|$|R
25|$|The only field army {{remaining}} to the King was Goring's, {{and though}} Hopton, who sorrowfully accepted the command after Goring's departure, tried {{at the last}} moment to revive the memories and the local patriotism of 1643, it was of no use to fight against the New Model with the armed <b>rabble</b> that Goring turned over to him. Dartmouth surrendered on 18 January 1646, Hopton was defeated at the Battle of Torrington on 16 February, and surrendered the remnant of his worthless army on 14 March. Exeter fell on 13 April. Elsewhere, Hereford was taken on 17 December 1645, and the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold, the last pitched battle of the war, was fought and lost by Lord Astley on 21 March 1646.|$|E
25|$|Archduke John {{ordered his}} {{demoralized}} army into a retreat. Moreau pursued slowly until 8 December. Then, in 15 days, his forces advanced 300km and captured 20,000 Austrians. General of Division Claude Lecourbe's Right Wing brushed aside Riesch at Rosenheim on 9 December. At Salzburg on 14 December, the archduke held off Lecourbe in a successful rearguard action. However, {{in a series}} of actions at Neumarkt am Wallersee, Frankenmarkt, Schwanenstadt, Vöcklabruck, Lambach and Kremsmünster during the following week, the Austrian army lost cohesion. Richepanse greatly distinguished himself in the pursuit. On 17 December, when Archduke Charles relieved his brother John, the Austrian army was practically a <b>rabble.</b> With French forces 80km from Vienna, Charles requested an armistice, which Moreau granted on 25 December. The decisive French victory at Hohenlinden set Moreau up as a potential rival to Napoleon Bonaparte.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the <b>rabble.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Never had mortal man such opportunity, [...] Except Napoleon, or abused it more: [...] You {{might have}} freed fallen Europe from the unity [...] Of tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore: [...] And now--what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye? [...] Now--that the <b>rabble's</b> first vain shouts are o'er? [...] Go! {{hear it in}} your famish'd country's cries! [...] Behold the world! and curse your victories! ...|$|R
50|$|Operation of {{the works}} {{involved}} ore being fed in {{at the top of}} the hill and swept down through a reverberatory furnace to the bottom. It was swept along a hearth 3.2m wide for a length of over 100m by automatic <b>rabbles</b> and took about three hours to descend. The furnace was surmounted by a monumental chimney stack 54.7m high and 5.6m in diameter at the base on the outside. The stack was built of 120,000 bricks.|$|R
5000|$|In the 16th century, Niccolò Machiavelli {{shared a}} {{somewhat}} different view with Bruni, preceding him. [...] Although he echoed Bruni’s prejudice against the Ciompi, also referring to them as the mob, the <b>rabbles,</b> preoccupied by fear and hatred, he was more objective than Bruni in viewing the event as a whole. According to Machiavelli, the revolt was a social phenomenon between one group of people, who were determined to obtain freedom, while the other determined to abolish it.|$|R
500|$|McCrea's fiancé was {{reported}} to be bitter about the affair, and never married. [...] The story of her life and death entered American folklore, and was used by James Fenimore Cooper in The Last of the Mohicans and Kenneth Lewis Roberts in <b>Rabble</b> in Arms.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps most significantly, he {{restored}} {{the practice of}} democratic elections. Cassius Dio said that this act [...] "though delighting the <b>rabble,</b> grieved the sensible, who stopped to reflect, that if the offices should fall once more {{into the hands of}} the many... many disasters would result".|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} following {{the creation of the}} siege line, the size of the colonial forces grew, as militias from New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut arrived on the scene. General Gage wrote of his surprise of the number of rebels surrounding the city: [...] "The rebels are not the despicable <b>rabble</b> too many have supposed them to be....In all their wars against the French they never showed such conduct, attention, and perseverance as they do now." ...|$|E
50|$|Later on, {{the gang}} watch a news report and {{learn that the}} premiere of the new Blue Falcon movie will now {{be held at the}} {{baseball}} stadium. The gang heads back to the convention center, and Austin manages to acquire entry for them. With Jack <b>Rabble’s</b> help, Fred, Velma and Daphne find Mr. Hyde’s hideout and discover that Mr. Hyde has surveillance cameras of the whole convention center and the baseball stadium. From there, they see a giant Mr. Hyde rampaging in the stadium.|$|R
60|$|After the Revolution of 1688, and on some {{occasions}} when {{the spirit of}} the Presbyterians had been unusually animated against their opponents, the Episcopal clergymen, who were chiefly nonjurors, were exposed to be mobbed, as we should now say, or <b>rabbled,</b> as the phrase then went, to expiate their political heresies. But notwithstanding that the Presbyterians had the persecution in Charles II and his brother's time to exasperate them, there was little mischief done beyond the kind of petty violence mentioned in the text.|$|R
500|$|The {{murder was}} {{investigated}} {{by a committee}} of {{five members of the}} aristocracy, including the Earl of Rothes, chosen by the Privy Council a fortnight later. The Privy Council ordered Sir James Stewart to act on the committee's report it received on 15 February and start legal proceedings against five people plus anyone else who had been involved in Cornfoot's lynching; they were to be tried in Edinburgh. Charges were also to be levelled against the burgh magistrates for [...] "suffering such tumults and <b>rabbles</b> and other such outrages to be committed within their burgh".|$|R
500|$|The {{trial of}} the eight {{soldiers}} opened on November 27, 1770. Adams told the jury {{to look beyond the}} fact the soldiers were British. He argued that if the soldiers were endangered by the mob, which he called [...] "a motley <b>rabble</b> of saucy boys, negroes, and molattoes, Irish teagues and outlandish jack tarrs [...] ", they had the legal right to fight back, and so were innocent. If they were provoked but not endangered, he argued, they were at most guilty of manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|Not content solely {{with the}} {{leadership}} of the SA, Röhm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by the conservative General Werner von Blomberg. Although nicknamed the [...] "Rubber Lion" [...] by some of his critics in the army for his devotion to Hitler, Blomberg was not a Nazi, and therefore represented a bridge between the army and the party. Blomberg and many of his fellow officers were recruited from the Prussian nobility, and regarded the SA as a plebeian <b>rabble</b> that threatened the army's traditional high status in German society.|$|E
500|$|In 1570, daimyo Oda Nobunaga began a {{campaign}} against the Ikkō-ikki, besieging the Hongan-ji headquarters at Ishiyama Hongan-ji and attacking ikki strongholds throughout Japan. By 1573, forces led by Akechi Mitsuhide and Toyotomi Hideyoshi pushed through Echizen and into the southern portions of Kaga. A counter-attack by the Kaga ikki in 1574 halted this advance, causing Nobunaga to personally lead the assault into Kaga. In 1575, Nobunaga recaptured Echizen, and Mitsuhide and Hideyoshi again invaded Kaga, this time more rapidly, successively capturing the fortified temples of Daishōji, Hinoya, and Sakumi. By {{the end of the}} year, the southern half of Kaga was conquered, and in November of that year Nobunaga boasted to Date Terumune that he had [...] "wiped out several tens of thousands of the villainous <b>rabble</b> in Echizen and Kaga." ...|$|E
6000|$|In May-September 1662, Parliament {{ratified}} {{the change to}} Episcopacy. It {{seems to have been}} thought that few preachers except the Protesters would be recalcitrant, refuse collation from bishops, and leave their manses. In point of fact, though they were allowed to consult their consciences till February 1663, nearly 300 ministers preferred their consciences to their livings. They remained centres of the devotion of their flocks, and the [...] "curates," [...] hastily gathered, who took their places, were stigmatised as ignorant and profligate, while, as they were resisted, <b>rabbled,</b> and daily insulted, the country was full of disorder.|$|R
60|$|When then I see Nations, {{or indeed}} Herds of Nations set on Fire of Hell, and as I may say, enflam'd by the Devil; when I see Towns, Parties, Factions and <b>Rabbles</b> of People visibly possess'd; 'tis enough {{to me that}} the great Master of the Devils has said to him, GO; there's no need to enquire which Way he finds open, or at what postern Gate he gets in; as to his appearing, 'tis plain he often gets in without appearing, and {{therefore}} the Question about his appearing still remains a Doubt, and is not very easy to be resolv'd.|$|R
50|$|Duncan {{is thought}} to have been the son of William Duncan, the Minister of New Kilpatrick, in Dunbartonshire, and his wife, Janet Macarthur. He {{attended}} the University of Glasgow, graduating in 1675. In 1680 he became the minister of Kilbirnie in Ayrshire. At this period the structure of the Church of Scotland was Episcopalian. Along with many clergy with Episcopalian sympathies Duncan was <b>rabbled</b> from his parish in 1688, struck and abused, his furniture smashed, and he and his family thrust out of doors. The following year the Episcopalian structure of the Church was abolished by Act of the Scottish Parliament, disestablishing the Scottish Episcopalians.|$|R
