5|$|After scoring touchdowns, Payton {{declined}} to celebrate; instead, he would often hand {{the ball to}} his teammates or the official. He disapproved of the growing practice of touchdown celebrations; he preferred post-game antics such as <b>rushing</b> <b>into</b> {{the locker room and}} locking his teammates out in the cold while taking a long shower. Although Payton would have won the respect of his peers and coaches by his running alone, he retired as the career leader in receptions for a running back with 492 for over 4,500 yards, and still holds the career record for a running back with 8 touchdown passes.|$|E

Opposition groups denied responsibility while Haitham Maleh, a leading opposition figure, blamed the government.

500|$|Sitting on {{the bench}} as the game entered the final minute of play, Henderson [...] "had a feeling" [...] that he could score.

The first shot was stopped by Vladislav Tretiak, but Henderson recovered the rebound and slid it past the fallen goaltender to give Canada a 6–5 lead with only 34 seconds left to play.

The rapid inflow of water caused a lake in Staunton's Gypsy Hill Park to rise until its earthen dam failed around 10 p.m. local time, sending a large volume of water <b>rushing</b> <b>into</b> the town's business district. Along the way, the torrent swept away 25 homes, one of which was occupied by a family of four. Power was cut to the town after floodwaters inundated the electric plant, and multiple hotels, stores, and other businesses were extensively damaged. As waters rose, victims were forced to await rescue from their roofs. A local waterway known as Lewis Creek also overflowed its banks and contributed to the flooding. The Staunton flood took the lives of six people, and inflicted as much as $500,000 in property damage. In the countryside, about 40 horses and mules drowned.|$|E

500|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane made another landfall at Carrabelle on the Florida Panhandle. Winds {{in the region}} were estimated at , and tides ran at up to [...] above normal. In Tallahassee, the winds downed trees and power lines and scattered debris, rendering roads impassable. The Tallahassee Democrat reported that [...] "at {{the height of the}} wind several hundred Tallahasseeans were seen <b>rushing</b> <b>into</b> their yard to gather pecans which were knocked down by the swaying trees". The storm destroyed vehicles throughout the region; replacement automobiles were sparse, as assembly plants were producing cars for the Army. Despite a lack of electricity due to the winds, the Tallahassee Democrat managed to publish 6,000copies of a special storm edition. Initial fears of severe damage along the coast prompted rescue crews to push toward St. Marks; however, upon arrival a group of local residents convinced the crew that their assistance was unnecessary. Considerable crop and property damage was reported; total losses in the state were estimated at $675,000 USD ($ in today's terms). Seven injuries were reported, and five men drowned in the storm tide at a fishing net drying yard in Panacea, Florida. Initially, there were reports of 20 missing fishermen. 34 Cuban fishermen were also trapped off the coast near Carrabelle when 10 boats ran aground and were damaged after the storm surge subsided. The fishermen's supply of food was destroyed by salt water, but they were rescued by the Coast Guard cutter Nemesis without any injuries. After their rescue, they reported that five men had drowned in a small boat nearby.|$|E

500|$|The Orphanage was {{received}} very well by American critics on its original release. The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of critics {{had given the}} film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 168. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 74, based on 33 reviews. Critics praised the film for its lack of cheap scares. Film critic for the Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert approved of the film claiming it to be [...] "deliberately aimed at viewers with developed attention spans. It lingers to create atmosphere, a sense of place, a sympathy with the characters, instead of <b>rushing</b> <b>into</b> cheap thrills". Bill Goodykoontz of the Arizona Republic echoed this statement noting, [...] "Bayona never lets The Orphanage descend into cheap horror. The scares here are expertly done and, placed {{in the context of}} Laura's state of mind, well-earned, perhaps even explainable (or not)." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star wrote, [...] "The year's best horror picture {{is also one of the}} simplest. The Orphanage makes little if any use of digital tricks to present its numerous terrors." [...] The casting of Chaplin and Rueda was praised while the role of Carlos was called dull. Goodykoontz noted the role of Carlos, saying [...] "Cayo is rather pedestrian as Carlos, but he isn't given that much to do". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune shared this opinion saying, [...] "Rueda has a great pair of peepers for this assignment. When she looks one way and then the other, while skulking through the hallways of her childhood home, every nerve-wracking whatwasthat? registers, and how. Cayo is pretty dull by comparison, but Chaplin certainly is not." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail praised Rueda stating, [...] "The strongest appeal of the film is the brooding, intense performance by Spanish actress, Belen Rueda." ...|$|E
500|$|Approaching the Floridian coast as an intensifying hurricane, {{the storm}} {{initially}} {{turned away from}} the peninsula {{for a short period of}} time on August7, after nearly making landfall on West Palm Beach. Strong gusts of at least 30mph (50km/h) and squally weather impacted the city, but did not cause any damage. However, telecommunications in the city were temporarily disrupted due to the storm. In Jupiter, stronger gusts reaching 60mph (100km/h) were reported, but did not cause any damage as well. However, the hurricane's recurvature offshore was short lived, and the system eventually made its landfall near Fort Pierce, Florida early on August8. Offshore, the USAHS Algonquin, a cruise ship belonging to the Clyde-Mallory cruise line, was caught in the storm, but managed to reach its destination of New York, New York without any major problems. The Honduran freighter Lempira, which had also recorded the lowest barometric pressure associated with the hurricane, experienced considerable damage due to the strong seas. The ship lost all of its lifeboats, and as a result the United Fruit Company line was sent to accompany the damaged ship. Inland, damage was concentrated in an area extending from Jupiter to the border between Florida and Georgia. The hurricane's landfall on the peninsula was attended by torrential rainfall, which damaged crops, particularly citrus. Rainfall peaked at [...] in St. Cloud over a five-day period from August7–12. There, the nearby East Lake Tohopekaliga began to overflow, threatening property and crops. Losses to the citrus crop were estimated by the Florida Citrus Exchange to be equivalent to 1millionboxes of citrus. However, damage to citrus in the Kissimmee area was comparatively less, and was limited to unripe fruit. Lake Okeechobee's water level rose by [...] as a result of floodwater <b>rushing</b> <b>into</b> the lake. Damage along the lake's shores mostly occurred to the north. To the south, in Clewiston, minor damage was confined to trees and windows. Two deaths occurred in the vicinity of the Indian River; these were the only deaths associated with the hurricane in the state. Numerous highways were also washed out by the rains, especially on Florida's south-central east coast. Portions of State Road 4 were covered in debris strewn by strong winds. Damage to the state's road systems was estimated at $100,000 by the former Florida State Highway Commission. Bridges were also badly damaged, with some needing replacement.|$|E
