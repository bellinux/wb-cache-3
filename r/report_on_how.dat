5|$|Bob {{attempts}} to rehire his children the next day, {{explaining that he}} now realizes {{that he is a}} better parent than his distant, alcoholic father, only to discover that they have found other work. A customer of the farm delivery service later walks into the restaurant looking for Tina, leaving behind a box of blueberries. Bob and his wife Linda (John Roberts) discover marijuana hidden in the box and set off to find the children, with Mickey leading them to the farm's location. As they arrive and take back the children, a SWAT team– led by the aforementioned customer, who is actually an undercover DEA agent– shows up and arrests the hippies. The scene cuts to Wagstaff School, where Louise has narrated the episode's events to her class for her <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> she spent her summer vacation.|$|E

During Scalia's time at Chicago, Peter H. Russell hired him {{on behalf of the}} Canadian government to write a <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> the United States was able to limit the activities of its secret services for the McDonald Commission, which was investigating abuses by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The report – finished in 1979 – encouraged the commission to recommend that a balance be struck between civil liberties and the essentially unchecked activities of the RCMP. In 1981, he became the first faculty adviser for the University of Chicago's chapter of the newly founded Federalist Society.|$|E
5|$|In James Monroe's annual {{address to}} the {{legislature}} in December 1822, he called on Congress to <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> to best deal with the Seminoles that inhabited the recently acquired territory of Florida. As chair of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Metcalfe delivered the report on February 21, 1823. His committee found that, {{under the terms of}} the Adams-Onis Treaty that transferred control of Florida to the United States from Spain, the Seminoles were to be accorded the same privileges as U.S. citizens. Accordingly, the committee recommended that each Seminole family be given a land grant. They hoped that this would help break the tribal loyalties of the Seminoles and expedite their amalgamation into white society. The committee's report was largely ignored.|$|E

Personally securing UK funding for the project, he deemed it an issue of national and personal shame when he was unable to persuade the British government to supply additional funding for the relocation of the Abu Simbel temples. In October 1968, he took part in a UNESCO visit to Pakistan to assess the state of Mohenjo-daro, writing the project's <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> the archaeological site could best be preserved. His involvement with UNESCO continued {{for the rest of his}} life, and in March 1973 he was invited to the organisation's conference in Paris.|$|E

25|$|In 1827, Stephen Ballard {{became the}} new clerk of the company, and {{produced}} a <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> to complete the canal in 1829. In 1838, he proposed a new route for the final section, but the engineer James Walker advised against it, and so in May 1839, a new Act of Parliament was obtained, allowing the company {{to raise the money}} to complete the canal. Work started on 17 November. A feeder from the River Frome to the summit level was completed in August 1842, and the canal opened in stages as it was completed, with extensions to Canon Frome wharf in January 1843, Whithington wharf in February 1844, and finally to Hereford basin on 22 May 1845.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research {{published}} a meta-analysis examining whether milk consumption might protect against hip fracture in middle-aged and older adults. Studies {{could find no}} association between drinking milk and lower rates of fractures. In 2014, JAMA Pediatrics {{published a}} report after monitoring almost 100,000 men and women {{for more than two}} decades. Subjects were asked to <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> much milk they had consumed as teenagers, and were followed {{to see if there is}} any association with a reduced chance of hip fractures later in life, it found there was not any. A study published in The BMJ that followed more than 45,000 men and 61,000 women in Sweden age 39 and older had similar results. Milk consumption in adults was associated with no protection for men, and an increased risk of fractures in women. The risk of any bone fracture increased 16 percent in women who drank three or more glasses daily, and the risk of a broken hip increased 60 percent. It was also associated with an increased risk of death in both sexes.|$|E

[...] Duane Tananbaum wrote the hearings [...] "provided the amendment's supporters with a wider forum for their argument that a constitutional amendment was needed" [...] and gave opponents a chance to debate the issue.|$|E

500|$|Other reforms during Wilkinson's {{tenure as}} {{minister}} included free school milk, {{improvements in the}} school meals service, an increase in university scholarships, and an expansion {{in the provision of}} part-time adult education through county colleges. In October 1945 she went to Germany to <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> the destroyed German education system could best be reactivated. She was astonished by the speed with which, five months after its defeat, the country's schools and universities were reopening. Other trips included visits to Gibraltar, Malta and Czechoslovakia. In November 1945 she chaired an international conference in London that led to the establishment, a year later, of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). In one of her final speeches in parliament, on 22 November 1946, she emphasised that UNESCO stood for [...] "standards of value... putting aside the idea that only practical things matter". She prophesied that the organisation [...] "will do great things", and urged the government to give it its full backing.|$|E
500|$|As {{the cost}} of {{unemployment}} benefits mounted, Bondfield's attempts to control the fund's deficit provoked further hostility from the TUC and political attacks from the opposition parties. In February 1931 she proposed a scheme to cut benefit and restrict entitlement, but this {{was rejected by the}} cabinet as too harsh. Instead, seeking a cross-party solution, the government accepted a Liberal proposal for an independent committee, eventually set up under Sir George May, to <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> public expenditure might be reduced. With the collapse in May 1931 of Austria's leading private bank, Kreditanstalt, and the subsequent failure of several other European banks, the sense of crisis deepened. On 30 July the May committee recommended cuts in expenditure of £97 million, the majority (£67 million) to be found from reductions in unemployment costs. In the ensuing weeks, ministers struggled vainly to meet these demands. Bondfield was prepared to cut general unemployment benefit, provided the most needy recipients—those on so-called [...] "transitional benefit"—were protected. No formula could be found; by 23 August the cabinet was hopelessly split, and resigned the next day. To the outrage of the TUC and most of the Labour Party, MacDonald formed an emergency National Government with the Conservative and Liberal parties, while the bulk of the Labour Party went into opposition.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 April 1909, Whiting took Porpoise out {{for what}} his crew of six {{thought would be}} a routine run. After Porpoise leveled off in Manila Bay {{at a depth of}} 20 feet (6.1 meters), Whiting {{informed}} his crew that he was convinced that a man could escape from a submarine through a torpedo tube and that he intended to test the idea on himself. He squeezed into Porpoises 18-inch (460-mm) tube and clung to the crossbar which stiffened the outer torpedo tube door as the crew closed the inner door. When the crew opened the outer door and seawater rushed in, Whiting hung onto the crossbar, which drew his elbows out of the tubes mouth, and then muscled his way out using his hands and arms. After 77 seconds, he was free of the submarine and swam to the surface; Porpoise soon surfaced and recovered him. Reluctant to speak about the incident in public [...] in Porpoises log that day, Whiting simply commented, [...] "Whiting went through the torpedo tube, boat lying in water in normal condition, as an experiment..." [...] he nevertheless informed his flotilla commander, Lieutenant Guy W. S. Castle, who submitted a <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> the feat had been accomplished.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, {{arguing that}} revelation of his {{relationship}} with his bank was an invasion of his privacy, O'Brien successfully applied for an injunction against RTÉ preventing the state broadcaster from airing a <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> O'Brien was allegedly receiving, on foot of a claimed but disputed verbal agreement with a former CEO of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC)the former Anglo Irish Bank, and another senior executive, a rate of approximately 1.25% when IBRC [...] "could, and arguably should" [...] have been charging 7.5%. This alleged rate applied to [...] "outstanding sums of upwards of €500 million", or [...] "over €300 million" [...] according to the RTÉ producer's court affidavit. O'Brien then allegedly wrote to IBRC's special liquidator Kieran Wallace to demand that these same favourable terms that were granted him by way of verbal agreement be continued. The Irish government later appointed Kieran Wallace to conduct a review into various IBRC transactions, including the sale of Siteserv by IBRC to Denis O'Brien. Acting as IBRC special liquidator, and {{in order to protect the}} confidentiality of IBRC's relations with its customers and of any legal advice given to it, Wallace then joined with IBRC and Denis O'Brien to seek an injunction in Ireland's High Court to hide this information from the public. High court judge Mr Justice Donald Binchy granted O'Brien the injunction and told the court that certain elements of the judgement would have to be redacted. The Irish media therefore could not report on details of the injunction.|$|E
