40|$|<b>Tensile</b> <b>strength</b> is an {{important}} parameter in rock mechanics and is amongst other things used as a criterion for initiation and propagation of fractures in hydraulic fracture modeling. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> are determined for three sedimentary rock types using the standard test method for direct <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> from American Society of the international association for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> testing was done on Castlegate sandstone, Mancos shale and Mons chalk. For Castlegate sandstone and Mons chalk two different specimen sizes, 1. 5 inches and 2 inches in diameter, were used to study the size effect on the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> results. Both rock types showed a clear size effect, but as the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of Castlegate sandstone decreased for increasing specimen size, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of Mons chalk increased with increasing specimen size. Mancos shale specimens were tested with different inclination angles relative to the bedding plane to study the anisotropy effect. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> for shale varied greatly with the inclination angle and the largest <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> were seen for samples with a 45 ° inclination angle relative to the bedding. Resulting <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> for all rock types was compared to existing <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> calculated from the Brazilian <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> method. The comparison showed that the direct <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> test yields lower, and more correct, values than the Brazilian <b>strength</b> test.

Due to the high degree of difficulty during execution, direct <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> test is rather scarce. It is possible to convert these test results from one to another.

Ultra High Strength Steel-Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHS-SFRC) is {{characterized}} by very high compressive and <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> that is about 8 times of ordinary concrete, and high ductility owing to the addition of steel fibers.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the influencing mechanism of the microstructure of crystallites of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) -based carbon fibers on <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> The {{results show that the}} crystallinity, the degree of graphitization, the degree of crystallites structural disorder and the crystallite size have obvious effects on <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> The larger the crystallinity and the degree of graphitization,the larger the tensile strength; the smaller the degree of crystallites structural disorder, the larger the tensile strength; the larger the crystallite size, the smaller the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> Comparing T 300 with T 700, the increment of <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> which is caused by the increase of the crystallinity and the degree of graphitization, and the decrease of the degree of crystallites structural disorder, is larger than the decrement of <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> which is caused by the increase of the crystallite size. Therefore, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of T 700 is larger than that of T 300, and the same with that the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of T 800 is larger than that of T 700.

40|$|AbstractThe tensile {{behaviour}} of soil plays {{a significantly}} {{important role in}} various engineering applications. Compacted soils used in geotechnical constructions such as dams and clayey liners in waste containment facilities can suffer from cracking due to tensile failure. In order to increase soil <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> discrete fibre reinforcement technique was proposed. An innovative tensile apparatus was developed to determine the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> characteristics of fibre reinforced soil. The effects of fibre content, dry density and water content on the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> were studied. The {{results indicate that the}} developed test apparatus was applicable in determining <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of soils. Fibre inclusion can significantly increase soil <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and soil <b>tensile</b> failure ductility. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> basically increases with increasing fibre content. As the fibre content increases from 0 % to 0. 2 %, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> increases by 65. 7 %. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of fibre reinforced soil increases with increasing dry density and decreases with decreasing water content. For instance, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> at a dry density of 1. 7  Mg/m 3 is 2. 8 times higher than that at 1. 4  Mg/m 3. It decreases by 30 % as the water content increases from 14. 5 % to 20. 5 %.

30|$|Investigation of concrete’s {{mechanical}} properties can be presented reasonably through {{the analysis of}} <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> The brittleness and low <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of concrete make it abortive to struggle with the direct tension.

The splitting tests (sometimes referred to as split <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> tests) are well known indirect tests used for determining the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of concrete.

In applications where rocks are subjected to dynamic loads, the dynamic <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> is the controlling parameter. Similar {{to the study of}} static <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> there are various methods proposed to measure the dynamic <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of rocks. Here we examine dynamic <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> values of Laurentian granite (LG) measured from three methods: dynamic direct tension, dynamic Brazilian disc (BD) test, and dynamic semi-circular bending (SCB).

Because the dynamic direct tension measures the intrinsic rock <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> it is thus necessary to reconcile the differences in strength values between the direct tension and the other two methods. We attribute the difference between the dynamic BD results and the direct tension results to the overload and internal friction in BD tests.
