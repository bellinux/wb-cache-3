While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), <b>red-eyed</b> <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E
50|$|On {{appearance}} alone it {{may also}} be confused with the Eurasian collared dove, vinaceous dove, <b>red-eyed</b> <b>dove,</b> red turtle dove, mourning collared dove or the Barbary dove, a popular cage bird with isolated feral populations. The <b>red-eyed</b> <b>dove</b> is generally similar with an identical display flight. It however has dark wine red eyes, is larger and darker altogether, with a grey belly and grey tail tips. The mourning collared dove has more grey about the head, and pale yellow eyes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Red-eyed</b> <b>dove</b> {{is part of}} {{the pigeon}} family. It is a {{relative}} of the turtledove of North Africa and Europe. Females lay two white eggs at a time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Red-eyed</b> <b>doves</b> eat grass seeds, {{grains and}} other vegetation. They often forage on the ground.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary results {{compiled}} from visual observations and questionnaires {{indicated that a}} large variety of crops including soyabean, cowpea, groundnut, maize, rice, sorghum were attacked at planting and seedling stages of growth by the <b>red-eyed</b> turtle <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia semitorquata). The social conditions under which this bird is protected, by social taboos and also as an attractive and common household pet {{in many parts of}} Nigeria, limit the control options {{that could be used to}} stop its deleterious activities. In the meantime research efforts are being directed to the understanding of the population ecology and biology of the species as a prerequisite to determining appropriate control strategies...|$|R
50|$|When flying, {{it shows}} blackish flight {{feathers}} and extensive {{white in the}} tail, the latter being a distinction from the similar but larger <b>red-eyed</b> <b>dove.</b> The call is a fast krrrrrrrr, oo-OO, oo.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-eyed</b> <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia semitorquata) is {{a pigeon}} {{which is a}} {{widespread}} resident breeding bird in Africa south of the Sahara. It is a common, if not abundant, species in most habitats other than desert.|$|E
50|$|In South Africa, {{biological}} control {{is being used}} {{in an attempt to}} manage Solanum mauritianum - the flowerbud weevil Anthonomus santacruzi is being used as a control agent. S. mauritianum is a favoured food plant of the African olive pigeon (Columba arquatrix), the Cape bulbul, the Black-collared barbet, the <b>Red-eyed</b> <b>dove</b> and red-whiskered bulbul.|$|E
50|$|<b>Red-eyed</b> <b>dove</b> is a largish, stocky pigeon, {{typically}} 30 cm (12 inches) in length. Its back, {{wings and}} tail are pale brown. When flying, it shows blackish flight feathers. The head and underparts are dark vinous-pink, shading to pale grey on the face. There {{is a black}} hind neck patch edged with white. The legs and a patch of bare skin around the eye are red. The call is a loud doo-doo-du-du.|$|E
