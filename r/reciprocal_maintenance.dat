40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} dual function of gratitude for relationship maintenance in close relationships. In {{a longitudinal study}} among married couples, the authors tested the dyadic effects of gratitude over three time points for approximately 4 years following marriage. They found that feelings of gratitude toward a partner stem from the partner's relationship maintenance behaviors, partly because such behaviors create the perception of responsiveness to one's needs. In turn, gratitude motivates partners to engage in relationship maintenance. Hence, the present model emphasizes that gratitude between close partners (a) originates from partners' relationship maintenance behaviors {{and the perception of}} a partner's responsiveness and (b) promotes a partner's <b>reciprocal</b> <b>maintenance</b> behaviors. Thus, the authors' findings add credence to their model, in that gratitude contributes to a reciprocal process of relationship maintenance, whereby each partner's maintenance behaviors, perceptions of responsiveness, and feelings of gratitude feed back on and influence the other's behaviors, perceptions, and feelings. © 2011 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{cyanobacterium}} Trichodesmium {{is responsible}} for {{a significant proportion of}} the annual 'new' nitrogen introduced into the global ocean. Despite being arguably the best studied marine diazotroph, the factors controlling the distribution and growth of Trichodesmium remain a subject of debate, with sea surface temperature, the partial pressure of CO 2 and nutrients including iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P), all suggested to be important. Synthesising data from 7 cruises collectively spanning large temporal and spatial scales across the Atlantic Ocean, including 2 previously unreported studies crossing the largely under-sampled South Atlantic gyre, we assessed the relationship between proposed environmental drivers and both community N 2 fixation rates and the distribution of Trichodesmium. Simple linear regression analysis would suggest no relationship between any of the sampled environmental variables and N 2 fixation rates. However, considering the concentrations of iron and phosphorus together within a simplified resource-ratio framework, illustrated using an idealised numerical model, indicates the combined effects these nutrients have on Trichodesmium and broader diazotroph biogeography, alongside the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>maintenance</b> of different biogeographic provinces of the (sub) -tropical Atlantic in states of Fe or P oligotrophy by diazotrophy. The qualitative principles of the resource-ratio framework are argued to be consistent with both the previously described North–south Atlantic contrast in Trichodesmium abundance and the presence and consequence of a substantial non-Trichodesmium diazotrophic community in the western South Atlantic subtropical gyre. A comprehensive, observation-based explanation of the interactions between Trichodesmium and the wider diazotrophic community with iron and phosphorus in the Atlantic Ocean is thus revealed...|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{states have}} {{recognised}} {{the need for}} representation of an incapacitated person when a benevolent relative or friend cannot be found to act on his behalf, this is {{the function of the}} Office of the Official Solicitor. The Official Solicitor becomes formally involved when appointed by the Court, and he can act as his own solicitor, or instruct a private firm of solicitors to represent him. The Official Solicitor has two main functions. Firstly, in England and Wales, his main function is to represent minors who are incapable of representing themselves in the High Court and in the Court of Protection. He also acts as last resort personal representative for the estate of a deceased person, or trustee of a trust. Secondly, in the area of international child protection obligations to which the UK government is a signatory, the Official Solicitor deals with cases brought under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction through the International Child Abduction and Contact Unit (ICACU). In this capacity it deals with international child abduction and contact issues and handles maintenance enforcement in cases where one parent lives outside the UK through the <b>Reciprocal</b> Enforcement of <b>Maintenance</b> Orders Unit (REMO).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an integrated theoretical account of gentrification {{in a context}} which evokes significant socio-cultural meanings of rurality. With this purpose in mind, three key conceptual standpoints are established to frame the research. First, gentrification {{is viewed as a}} dynamic process of change involving distinct and differing phases of transformation. Second, representations of rurality are seen as socio-cultural constructions, which are specific to particular social groups and individuals. Finally, the creation of both rural geographies and geographies of gentrification are the product of interactions between structural conditions and the agency of consumers and producers; a <b>reciprocal</b> relationship of <b>maintenance</b> and/or reproduction in a constant flux in time and space. Following this conceptual framework, the thesis documents the processes of change which both the rural and urban environs of the Hebden Bridge district, West Yorkshire, have undergone since the late 1960 s. These processes are termed g[re]entrification (rural gentrification) and involve social, cultural, physical and economic parallels with inner city gentrification. More specifically, two stages of g[re]entrification have predominated. The first stage (DIY greentrification) was initiated by in-migrant households, drawn to the moor tops, moor edges and urban location by idyllic representations of Pennine rurality. Undertaking self-renovation activities, redefined landscapes were produced and consumed by the in-migrant households. As the scale of DIY greentrification gained momentum during the early 1970 s, commercial actors gained control of the production activities, renovating and developing ready-made "rural" and "rurban" commodities. As these were consumed by "client greentrifiers", property prices in the Hebden Bridge district escalated in the mid to late 1980 s. Subsequently, the local indigenous population have been increasingly marginalised, excluded and displaced from the local housing market. The outcome of the greentrification process has been the production and maintenance of a number of territories associated with a distinct range of greentrifier types, culminating in an internal geography of greentrification within the Hebden Bridge district. Without doubt, the diversity of the Hebden Bridge district offers different qualities to a range of households searching for differing types of location to fulfil specific cultural and economic criteria. It is the capacity of the Hebden Bridge district (i. e. the geography of geentrification) to meet these cultural and economic needs that is central to the dramatic physical, social, economic and culturaltransformations which it has experienced since the late 1960 s. The uniqueness of the Hebden Bridge district is tied up with the make-up of its internal geography and its many faces of greentrification. ...|$|R
