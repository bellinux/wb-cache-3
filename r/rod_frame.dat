50|$|In fact, the {{downward}} {{acceleration of the}} rod, which is simultaneous in the grate's frame of reference, is not simultaneous in the <b>rod's</b> <b>frame</b> of reference.

This results in a bending of the rod in the <b>rod's</b> <b>frame</b> of reference. It should be stressed that, since this bending occurs in the <b>rod's</b> rest <b>frame,</b> it is a true physical distortion of the rod which will cause stresses to occur in the rod.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{assessment}} of verticality {{by means of}} rod and <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> tests indicated that human subjects can be more (field dependent) or less (field independent) influenced by a frame placed around a tilted rod. In the present study we propose {{a new approach to}} these tests. The judgment of visual verticality (rod test) was evaluated in 50 young subjects (28 males, ranging in age from 20 to 27 years) by randomly projecting a luminous rod tilted between - 18 and + 18 ° (negative values indicating left tilts) onto a tangent screen. In the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> test the <b>rod</b> was displayed within a luminous fixed frame tilted at + 18 or - 18 °. Subjects were instructed to verbally indicate the rod&# 8217;s inclination direction (forced choice). Visual dependency was estimated by means of a Visual Index calculated from rod and <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> test values. Based on this index, volunteers were classified as field dependent, intermediate and field independent. A fourth category was created within the field-independent subjects for whom the amount of correct guesses in the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> test exceeded that of the rod test, thus indicating improved performance when a surrounding frame was present. In conclusion, the combined use of subjective visual vertical and the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> test provides a specific and reliable form of evaluation of verticality in healthy subjects and might be of use to probe changes in brain function after central or peripheral lesions...|$|R

In this study, a polypropylene- (PP-) coated spinneret and a metal spinneret were utilized to carry out the single-fluid electrospinning processes. A metal <b>rod</b> <b>frame</b> was utilized as the collector to steer the nanofibers. Using polyvinylpyrrolidone K 90 (PVP K 90) as a filament-forming polymeric model at a concentration of 9 % (w/v) in ethanol, the experimental observations and results demonstrated the following results: (1) the utilization efficiency of electrical energy could be improved through the PP-coated spinneret; (2) the texture of collector had a significant influence on the collection of aligned PVP K 90 nanofibers; and (3) the combination of a PP-coated spinneret with the metal frame could ensure the electrostatic repulsion forces to play their roles effectively in generating PVP K 90 nanofibers with thinner diameters and in collecting uniaxial {{alignment of}} them. The mechanisms about the orientation effects of the present method are discussed. This job opens a facile way for producing aligned polymeric nanofibers based on the reasonable manipulation of the interactions between the electrostatic field and the working fluids...|$|E
50|$|The {{frame of}} {{reference}} with respect to studies of the visual system refers to perceived reference axes. In the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> illusion, {{there are a number}} of things that can influence one's {{frame of reference}}. Past research has found that one reason people experience the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> illusion is due to visual-vestibular interactions. For instance, when a participant is viewing the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> task while physically tilted, the participant acts as though they are tilted opposite of the orientation of the frame. This suggests that the illusion, in part, is due to the person compensating for their perceived vertical in the direction that is opposite of the frame. Other evidence proposed by researchers that is consistent with this is that, when participants are put on their sides to view the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> task, they rely on their vision when their vestibular and proprioceptive senses are incongruent with those of their visual senses. These findings suggest that the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> illusion is processed in a type of hierarchy, where visual input is at the top, then vestibular cues, and finally proprioceptive cues. In 2010, Lipshits found that, along with this hierarchy of processing, proprioceptive information, as opposed to gravity, is used by the body to determine which way is vertical. Lipshits says that, when we are not able to use vision to determine which way is vertical, we use other cues based on the axis of our head and body.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{homemade}} {{procedure for}} manufacturing of mechanical replacement parts was developed. The approach {{was applied to}} a guide ruler installed in machinery to produce steel <b>rod</b> <b>frames.</b> The guide ruler part, which is produced by the original manufacturer of the equipment, acts as an alignment guide of the steel wires. It ensures that the steel wires can be welded in the correct position so that the steel <b>rod</b> <b>frames</b> can be properly constructed. The guide ruler was selected due to its paramount importance for the proper functions of the equipment, the intensity of service loads, its high costs and poor availability. The methodology adopted for the homemade procedure was based on obtaining comparable chemical composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of the imported part. The main goal was to reduce the costs and delivery time for the acquisition of each spare part. The homemade procedure here used, however, is considered complete only after {{a comparison of the}} parts service performance and after an evaluation of the cost/benefit ratio.

50|$|<b>Rod</b> and <b>frame</b> {{illusion}} {{occurs because}} {{of the effect of}} the orientation of the <b>frame</b> on the <b>rod.</b> In the simplest example of the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> illusion, the illusion will cause the participant to perceive the rod to be oriented congruent with the orientation of the frame. When the participant is viewing the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> that are both positioned at 0 degrees (or vertical), he or she perceives the rod as vertical with perfect accuracy. However, when the frame is tilted away from vertical, the participant's perception of vertical is affected. The participant tends to perceive the rod to be tilted {{in the same direction as}} the frame is oriented (e.g., if the frame is tilted in the counterclockwise direction, the rod will also be perceived as being tilted counterclockwise). As the tilt of the frame increases, the participants' perceived vertical increasingly deviates from true vertical.|$|R

The present study involved distraction in a simple reaction time paradigm using 10 field dependent and 10 field independent subjects.

Average realised cylinder orientations confirmed that when the frame orientation deviated from the vertical, a reproduction error occurred in the direction opposite to the direction of the frame tilt. In contrast, the perceived orientation of the stimulus rod was exaggerated relative to the vertical, i. e. reproduction errors were in the direction of the rod tilt. Furthermore, linear regression analyses for every normalised time sample showed that the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> effects start simultaneously, but they reach their maximum effect at different points in time.

40|$|The <b>Rod</b> and <b>Frame</b> test {{measures}} an individual’s subjective {{assessment of}} visual {{vertical and horizontal}} {{in the presence of}} a surrounding tilted frame. Attention has focused upon the effects of the surrounding frame upon spatial accuracy (Spatial Frame Effect). We have investigated if the tilted frame also affects the time that subjects take to make the alignment (Temporal Frame Effect). Results: 125 subjects performed a computerised <b>Rod</b> and <b>Frame</b> test to investigate the effects of a tilted frame on subjective visual vertical and horizontal. In addition the program recorded the time taken to make each alignment. For most subjects the mean Spatial Frame Effect was small (vertical 1. 62, SD 0. 93; horizontal 1. 9, SD 1. 43). The mean time taken to make alignments {{in the presence of a}} tilted frame was longer than when the frame was not tilted (vertical, + 3. 4 s, SD 4. 4; horizontal, + 3. 2 s, SD 4. 5). Differences in the times taken when the <b>rod</b> and <b>frame</b> were presented congruently and incongruently could be fully accounted for by the differences in steps needed to move the rod to its final alignment. No relationship was found between the spatial accuracy and the time to make the alignment and there was no relationship between the Spatial and Temporal Frame Effects. Conclusions: This study suggests that the Spatial, and Temporal, Frame Effects provide information about different aspects of the process of resolving conflicting visual information when making judgments on alignment. In everyday functions such as the maintenance of balance or susceptibility to motion sickness, the increased time taken may be as important as spatial accuracy...|$|R

Also the analytical expressions relating the internal characteristics of the straight bars with boundary conditions at the nodes (the equation of state of the rod) have been made.

40|$|The <b>Rod</b> and <b>Frame</b> Test {{has been}} used to assess the degree to which {{subjects}} rely on the visual frame of reference to perceive vertical (visual field dependence-independence perceptual style). Early investigations found children exhibited a wide range of alignment errors, which reduced as they matured. These studies used a mechanical <b>Rod</b> and <b>Frame</b> system, and presented only mean values of grouped data. The current study also considered changes in individual performance. Changes in rod alignment accuracy in 419 school children were measured using a computer-based <b>Rod</b> and <b>Frame</b> test. Each child was tested at school Grade 2 and retested in Grades 4 and 6. The results confirmed that children displayed a wide range of alignment errors, which decreased with age but did not reach the expected adult values. Although most children showed a decrease in frame dependency over the 4 years of the study, almost 20 % had increased alignment errors suggesting that they were becoming more frame-dependent. Plots of individual variation (SD) against mean error allowed the sample to be divided into 4 groups; the majority with small errors and SDs; a group with small SDs, but alignments clustering around the frame angle of 18 °; a group showing large errors in the opposite direction to the frame tilt; and a small number with large SDs whose alignment appeared to be random. The errors in the last 3 groups could largely be explained by alignment of the rod to different aspects of the frame. At corresponding ages females exhibited larger alignment errors than males although this did not reach statistical significance. This study confirms that children rely more heavily on the visual frame of reference for processing spatial orientation cues. Most become less frame-dependent as they mature, but there are considerable individual differences...|$|R
