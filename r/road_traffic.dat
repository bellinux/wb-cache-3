5|$|Ashford {{has been}} a {{communications}} hub and has stood at the centre of five railway lines since the 19th century. The arrival of the railways became a source of employment {{and contributed to the}} town's growth. With the opening of the international passenger station it is now a European communications centre, with new lines running between London and the Channel Tunnel (via High Speed 1). The M20 motorway also links Ashford to those two destinations for <b>road</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Traffic</b> <b>roads</b> {{building}} {{is one of}} the most complex production processes in civil engineering. It is the most extensive one concerning the quantity of works executed and the most significant one concerning the scope of financial resources expended. The building of such and object inevitably requires the management of quality. The paper points out the significance, specific quality and application of the management of quality in the processes of <b>traffic</b> <b>road</b> building. Considerable outlays for the repairing of a low-quality <b>traffic</b> <b>road</b> represents a further motive for introducing the management of quality into the processes of <b>traffic</b> <b>roads</b> building. Beside these direct outlays, there are also indirect outlays caused by the delay of the <b>traffic</b> <b>road</b> building. As the outlays for the repairing of a low-quality <b>traffic</b> <b>road</b> noticeably exceed the outlays for the introduction of the management of quality systems, their introducing into the processes of <b>traffic</b> <b>roads</b> building becomes a necessity for planners, designers, subcontractors and contractors...|$|R

Under the <b>Road</b> <b>Traffic</b> Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents can claim money from the insurer of the driver at fault, even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can take out insurance in his own name, but make it enforceable by his wife and children despite the doctrine of privity.|$|E
5|$|Separating {{provision}} for cyclists from other <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> {{was not part}} of the remit of the 1960s town redevelopment, and in 1996 the perception of {{provision for}} cyclists was very poor. A Basingstoke Area Cycling Strategy was developed in 1999 and subsequently an extensive cycle network has been developed mainly utilising on-road routes or off-road routes that run parallel with and directly alongside roads. Basingstoke was linked to Reading on the National Cycle Network route 23 in May 2003 and the route was extended south to Alton and Alresford in April 2006.|$|E

Some road users have noted that a lack of clear road markings and signage may be a contributing factor towards the traffic collisions, whilst Sefton Council noted that they continue to review the operation of the road and associated junctions.
