40|$|The {{effects of}} enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} induced by food-grade exo- plus endo-proteases (i. e. Umamizyme and Flavourzyme) on the sensory characteristics and functional properties of <b>rice</b> <b>middlings</b> were investigated. Enzymatic hydrolysis {{was confirmed by}} sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), by monitoring the rate of hydrolysis with the Coefficient of Protein Degradation (CPD). The presence of medium-low size polypeptides at the end point of 24. h was detected, resulting from 24. 84 ± 1. 28 % and 67. 04 ± 0. 55 % hydrolysis for Flavourzyme and Umamyzyme, respectively. Sensory and functional properties, including emulsifying and foaming properties, were evaluated on hydrolysates obtained after 24. h incubation. The sensory analysis described the umami taste as the most intense attribute for all the products and good emulsifying and foaming properties were observed, mainly in Umamizyme hydrolysates. Then the hydrolysis procedure here described could be convenient to provide ingredients characterized by a good taste profile and by functional properties useful for industrial food processing, storage and consumption...|$|E
40|$|Four cereal {{by-products}} {{were examined}} for their total and phytate phosphorus contents. Feeding trial for bioavailability {{was conducted on}} 18 weeks old cockerels of White Leg Horn breed which were starved for 24 hours and were forced-fed 30 grams of finely ground single feedstuff and droppings were collected at pre-determined time intervals. The bioavailability of total phosphorus for wheat bran, <b>rice</b> polishing, wheat <b>middling</b> and gram kara was 37. 11, 15. 37, 61. 32 and 62. 64 %, respectively while phytate phosphorus contents were 0. 66, 1. 16, 0. 24 and 0. 17 %, respectively. The bioavailability of total phosphorus was negatively correlated with the phytate phosphorus contents of these feed stuffs (P< 0. 01) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Metabolizable energy (ME) {{values of}} some {{ingredients}} were determined using laying hens. Diets {{used in these}} studies were composed primarily of the test ingredient plus minerals and vitamins. Mature hens, housed in separate cages, were permitted to adjust to each test diet for about 2 weeks, followed by a 3 or 4 day collection during which total feed intake and excreta out-put were recorded for individual birds. ME values for <b>rice</b> bran, wheat <b>middlings,</b> brewers dried grains, and alfalfa meal {{were found to be}} 2. 54, 1. 90, 1. 84, and 1. 78 kcal/g, respectively. ME for rice bran was substantially higher and for brewers dried grains lower than the reported chick values. Autoclaving rice bran (15 psi, 30 min) resulted in no significant change in its ME value. The rice bran contained 8 % fat. 1979 Poultry Sci 58 : 441 - 44...|$|R
40|$|To more {{precisely}} formulate feed and predict animal performance, {{it is important}} to base both the recommendations and feed formulations on digestible rather than total amino acid contents. Most published data on the digestibility of amino acids in feed ingredients for poultry are based on excreta digestibility. Ileal digestibility is an alternative and preferred approach to estimate amino acid availability in feed ingredients. Both methodologies are described and assessed. In addition, the differences between apparent and standardised (in which corrections are made for basal endogenous losses) digestible amino acid systems are discussed. The concept of a standardised digestibility system as a mean of overcoming the limitations of apparent digestibility estimates is proposed. In this context, different methodologies for the determination of basal endogenous amino acid losses are discussed. Although each methodology suffers from some limitations and published data on endogenous losses at the ileal level in growing poultry are limited, averaged data from repeated experiments using the 2 ̆ 7 enzymatically hydrolysed casein 2 ̆ 7 method are considered as the best measure of basal losses. Standardised ileal amino acid digestibility values of 17 feed ingredients commonly used in broiler nutrition are presented including grains (barley, corn, sorghum, triticale, wheat), grain by-products (wheat <b>middlings,</b> <b>rice</b> pollard), plant protein sources (soybean meal, canola meal, corn gluten meal, cottonseed meal, lupins, peas/beans, sunflower meal), and animal by-products (feather meal, fish meal, meat and bone meal). This comprehensive set of the ileal amino acid digestibility of feed ingredients in broiler nutrition may serve as a basis for the establishment of the system in broiler feeding and for further research...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. (leaves 25 - 28). The availability of phosphorus in fish diets is an raphics. important consideration in aquaculture because phosphorus excretion by fish may influence eutrophication of the culture system or receiving water, as phosphorus is a primary nutrient stimulating phytoplankton growth. This study was conducted to determine the phosphorus (P) composition and availability from the following feedstuffs to channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) : devilled, solvent-extracted soybean meal, cottonseed meal, wheat, wheat <b>middlings,</b> <b>rice</b> bran, sorghum, corn, fish meal analog, meat-bone meal and menhaden fish meal. Test diets consisting of a 70 : 30 mixture of reference diet to test ingredient were utilized with chromic oxide as the non-digestible marker. The various test diets were fed to channel catfish weighing approximately 100 - 150 g and the feed samples were obtained by stripping approximately 12 h after feeding. Feed and fecal samples were analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SIRP), fractionations of phosphorus, total nitrogen (TN), ammonia [], nitrate [], and nitrite [] from which apparent digestibility coefficients were computed. Fecal samples contained relatively [] Concentrations but rather high [] concentrations. The TP concentrations in fecal material from fish fed the different diets ranged from feedstuffs. The major part of this decrease could be accounted for by uptake of calcium phosphate and organic phosphorus from the feed ingredients. Approximately 25 % of the TP in feedstuffs was readily labile but this fraction increased to 35 % in fecal material. Fecal material from fish fed diet ingredients of plant origin had lower concentrations than samples from fish fed ingredients of animal origin. Phosphorus availability from animal products was variable, with a low of 47 % for menhaden fish meal and a high of 92 % for fish meal analog. Plant products also had variable phosphorus availability values which generally ranged from 33 % to 83 %. The phosphorus availability values obtained for the various feedstuffs may allow formulation of diets that are better utilized by channel catfish and also reduce phosphorus excretion...|$|R
