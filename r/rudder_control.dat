5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E

50|$|The {{design was}} professionally {{engineered}} and incorporates a very clean cantilever wing {{that results in}} a 12:1 glide ratio. The control system is two-axis, using only elevator and <b>rudder</b> <b>controls,</b> roll being introduced by rudder via a generous dihedral angle. The elevator is stick-controlled, while the <b>rudder</b> is <b>controlled</b> via conventional aircraft pedals. The aircraft is stall and spin proof. Reported construction times are 450-600 hours.|$|R
25|$|Normal {{landings}} {{are done}} by touching all three wheels {{down at the}} same time in a three-point landing. This method does allow the shortest landing distance but can be difficult to carry out in crosswinds, as <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> may be reduced severely before the tailwheel can become effective.|$|E

25|$|Adam Air {{is being}} sued by Indonesian {{consumer}} and labour groups over the accident, {{for a total}} of one trillion rupiahs (US$100 million), to be paid {{to the families of the}} victims. According to a lawyer for the families, speaking in a press conference along with the secretary for the Adam Air KI-574 Passengers' Families Association (formed in the aftermath of the disaster), 30 of the victims' families intend to sue Boeing instead of Adam Air over the accident. However, this does not necessarily mean that all of the others will sue Adam Air, as they may not necessarily exercise their right to sue at all. Representatives of the families have explained that they believe the plane was brought down by a faulty <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> valve although there is no evidence that proves this, similarly to the accidents involving United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427, which went down in the early 1990s. They have explained that, as a result, they are suing Boeing and Parker Hannifin, the valve's manufacturer, although airlines using the 737 have been warned about problems with the <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> valves.|$|E
2500|$|The {{location}} of the accident {{and the fact that}} it took place two months and one day after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in Manhattan initially spawned fears of another terrorist attack. [...] Terrorism was officially ruled out as the cause by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which instead attributed the disaster to the first officer's overuse of <b>rudder</b> <b>controls</b> in response to wake turbulence, or jet wash, from a Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 that took off minutes before it. According to the NTSB, this aggressive use of the <b>rudder</b> <b>controls</b> by the co-pilot caused the vertical stabilizer to snap off the plane. The plane's two engines also separated from the aircraft before it hit the ground.|$|R

25|$|The NTSB {{found that}} there was a fatigue crack in the power control module, and that it was not {{possible}} to visually inspect that type of failure. The lower <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> module's cast metal housing had broken. The end portion of the control module housing which housed the yaw damper actuator had separated from the main portion of the housing. Deforge said in the Mayday episode that the NW85 failure was an unusual failure since most failures are of internal components rather than the housing itself.|$|E
25|$|During the {{investigation}} of Flight 427, the NTSB discovered that the PCU's dual servo valve could jam, as well, and deflect the rudder {{in the opposite direction}} of the pilots' input, due to thermal shock, caused when cold PCUs are injected with hot hydraulic fluid. As a result of this finding, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the servo valves to be replaced and new training protocol for pilots to handle unexpected movement of flight controls to be developed. The FAA ordered an upgrade of all Boeing 737 <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> systems by 12 November 2002.|$|E
25|$|VR-HEU began losing {{altitude}} and at 5,000ft, its <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> was shot off. Travelling at 350 miles per hour, Blown tried his utmost to evade incendiary bullets {{coming from the}} fighters by turning the Skymaster left and right. At 2,000 feet, the right aileron was shot off and the plane began turning right on its own initiative. The captain then countered the increasing turn by shutting down the engines 1 and 2 and applying full power on engine 3. Approximately 2 minutes after the initial attack, unable {{to carry on a}} controlled levelled flight, Blown decided ditch the Skymaster in rough open seas that included 15-foot waves and a 25-knot wind.|$|E

50|$|Pedals may be {{used for}} driving {{simulations}} or flight simulations. In the former case, an asymmetric set of pedals can simulate accelerator, brake, and clutch pedals in a real automobile. In the latter case, a symmetric set of pedals simulates <b>rudder</b> <b>controls</b> and toe brakes in an aircraft. As mentioned, most steering wheel controllers come with a set of pedals.|$|R
50|$|The next {{development}} of the SZD-48 involved a new forward fuselage with forward opening single piece canopy, which simplified production as well as improving access to the instrument panel and <b>rudder</b> <b>controls,</b> a <b>rudder</b> with increased area and revised water ballast system with individual vent/jettison valves for each wing tank and special funnel for filling. This version entered production as the SZD-48-3 Jantar Standard 3.|$|R
25|$|Any {{aircraft}} rudder {{is subject}} to considerable forces that determine its position via a force or torque balance equation. In extreme cases these forces can lead to loss of <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> or even destruction of the rudder, as on American Airlines Flight 587 (the same principles also apply to water vessels, of course, {{but it is more}} important for aircraft because they have lower engineering margins). Maximum rudder deflection is controlled by rudder travel limiter. The largest achievable angle of a rudder in flight is called its blowdown limit; it is achieved when the force from the air or blowdown equals the maximum available hydraulic pressure.|$|E

500|$|American Airlines Flight 1 was a domestic, {{scheduled}} passenger {{flight from}} New York International (Idlewild) Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport), to Los Angeles International Airport. On March 1, 1962, the plane [...] having just taken off two minutes earlier [...] {{rolled over and}} crashed into a swamp, killing all 87 passengers and eight crew members aboard. A Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigation determined that a manufacturing defect in the automatic pilot system led to an uncommanded <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> system input, causing the accident. A number of notable {{people died in the}} crash. It was the fifth fatal Boeing 707 accident and, at the time, the deadliest.|$|E
50|$|The outer {{sections}} of the rear wing were given a sharp downward angle or anhedral. Triangular outboard control surfaces were hinged on the diagonal to these sections and provided all the functions normally produced by separate elevator, aileron and <b>rudder</b> <b>controls.</b> When operated together they acted as elevators, while when operating differentially they acted as combined ailerons and rudders to bank the aircraft into a controlled turn.|$|R
50|$|In the Royal Navy, {{the term}} cockpit {{originally}} {{referred to the}} area where the coxswain was stationed. This led to the word being used to refer to the area towards the stern of a small decked vessel that houses the <b>rudder</b> <b>controls.</b> The midshipmen and master's mates were later berthed in the cockpit, and it served as the action station for the ship's surgeon and his mates during battle.|$|R
50|$|Steering {{is carried}} out by twin Becker flap <b>rudders,</b> <b>controlled</b> by Porsgrunn {{steering}} gear. These rudders can be moved independently in harbour to assist the 1,800 kW Lips thruster located in the stern. The ship is armed with a twin 50 cal and an anti-aircraft missile launcher following the legislation introduced in 2016. There are also three 1,800 kW thrusters in the bow and four Wärtsilä 8L20 engines driving l7l0kVA ABB alternators for electricity supply.|$|R
500|$|Schnaufer {{claimed his}} first aerial victory on their thirteenth combat mission flown {{one day after}} the attack on Cologne on the night 1/2 June 1942. Nominally this was the RAF's second 1,000 bomber raid against Germany, {{although}} the attacking force actually numbered 956 aircraft. Schnaufer shot down a Handley Page Halifax south of Louvain in Belgium. The aircraft probably was a Halifax from No. 76 Squadron piloted by Sergeant Thomas Robert Augustus West, which was shot down at 01:55 on 2 June 1942 and crashed at Grez-Doiceau, [...] south of Louvain. West and another member of the crew were killed. This victory was achieved by ground-controlled interception through the Kammhuber Line. Once near to the target, Rumpelhardt had visually found the bomber and directed Schnaufer into attack position from below and astern. The Halifax caught on fire after two firing passes. During this mission the Himmelbett flight officer vectored them to a second bomber, a Bristol Blenheim. The attack had to be aborted after Hauptmann (Captain) Walter Ehle shot down the bomber from a more favourable attack position. Shortly before 03:00, they were then flying in the vicinity of Ghent, they spotted another target. Schnaufer made two unsuccessful attacks. During their third attack, which closed the distance to , they were hit by the defensive gunfire. Schnaufer was hit in his left calf, the port engine was burning, the <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> cables were severed, and an electrical short circuit caused the landing lights to be permanently on. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer considered bailing out but decided to make an attempt for their home airfield after they managed to put out the flames and restart the engine. While Rumpelhardt made radio contact with the Sint-Truiden airbase, Schnaufer landed the aircraft without <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> and on ailerons and engine-power alone. This was the only time that their aircraft sustained damage in combat or any member of the crew was wounded. Both Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer were awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class for their first aerial victory. Schnaufer had hoped that he could stay on active duty and that the bullet lodged in his calf would isolate itself. However, he had to be admitted to a hospital in Brussels from 8–25 June for surgery. Rumpelhardt was given home leave until 26 June while Schnaufer was in the hospital.|$|E
500|$|A new {{specification}} {{was issued}} as S.8/43 {{to cover the}} development of the Firebrand T.F. Mk III (B-45) with the [...] Bristol Centaurus VII radial engine. Two prototypes were converted from incomplete F Mk Is and 27 additional aircraft were delivered, completing the first batch of 50 aircraft. The first prototype flew on 21 December 1943, but construction of the new aircraft was very slow with the first flight not being made until November 1944. Most changes were related to the installation of the larger-diameter Centaurus engine, including air intakes for the carburetor and oil cooler in the wing-root extensions that formerly housed the engine's radiators. Spring-loaded trim tabs were also fitted to all control surfaces. Production aircraft after the first 10 were fitted with the improved Centaurus IX engine. The Mk III was found to be unsuitable for carrier operations for a variety of reasons. The new engine produced more torque than the Sabre, and <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> was insufficient on takeoff with the full flaps needed for carrier use. Visibility while landing was very poor, the tailhook attachment to the airframe was too weak, and the aircraft had a tendency to drop a wing at the stall while landing, so development continued to rectify these issues.|$|E
500|$|... 21 March 1992: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAB, on a {{scheduled}} flight from London to New York, also suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. While cruising at Mach 2, at approximately 53,000 feet above mean sea level, the crew heard a [...] "thump". No difficulties in handling were noticed, and no instruments gave any irregular indications. This crew also suspected {{there had been}} a minor engine surge. One hour later, during descent and decelerating below Mach 1.4, a sudden [...] "severe" [...] vibration began throughout the aircraft. The vibration worsened when power was added to the No 2 engine, and it was attenuated when that engine's power was reduced. The crew shut down the No 2 engine and made a successful landing in New York, noting only that increased <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> was needed to keep the aircraft on its intended approach course. Again, the skin had become separated from the structure of the rudder, which led to most of the upper rudder becoming separated in-flight. The (AAIB) concluded that repair materials had leaked into the structure of the rudder during a recent repair, weakening the bond between the skin and the structure of the rudder, leading to it breaking up in-flight. The large size of the repair had made it difficult to keep repair materials out of the structure, and prior to this accident, the severity of the effect of these repair materials on the structure and skin of the rudder was not appreciated.|$|E

50|$|While {{aircraft}} slipping and skidding {{are often}} undesired in a usual turn that maintains altitude, slipping {{of the aircraft}} {{can be used for}} practical purposes. Intentionally putting an aircraft into a slip is used as a forward slip and a sideslip. These slips are performed by applying opposite inputs of the aileron and <b>rudder</b> <b>controls.</b> A forward slip allows a pilot to quickly drop altitude without gaining unnecessary speed, while a sideslip is one method utilized to perform a crosswind landing.|$|R

Twelve tugboats were required to assist in freeing her. [...] Two dredgers had helped cut away at the sandbank, near the grounding.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{aircraft}} require {{increased pressure}} on the rudder pedals {{to achieve the same}} amount of <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> at a higher speed. The Airbus A300 and later Airbus A310 do not operate on a fly-by-wire flight control system, but instead use conventional mechanical flight controls. The NTSB determined that [...] "because of its high sensitivity, the A300-600 <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher speeds". The Allied Pilots Association, in its submission to the NTSB, argued that the unusual sensitivity of the rudder mechanism amounted to a design flaw which Airbus should have communicated to the airline. The main rationale for their position came from a 1997 report that referenced 10 incidents in which A300 tail fins had been stressed beyond their design limitation.|$|E
2500|$|In practice, both aileron and <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> input {{are used}} {{together}} to turn an aircraft, the ailerons imparting roll, the rudder imparting yaw, and also compensating for a phenomenon called adverse yaw. A rudder alone will turn a conventional fixed-wing aircraft, {{but much more}} slowly than if ailerons are also used in conjunction. [...] Use of rudder and ailerons together produces co-ordinated turns, in which the longitudinal axis of the aircraft {{is in line with}} the arc of the turn, neither slipping (under-ruddered), nor skidding (over-ruddered). Improperly ruddered turns at low speed can precipitate a spin which can be dangerous at low altitudes.|$|E
2500|$|After {{receipt of}} the Gwinn Aircar, Convair began {{development}} of the Model 111 Aircar in 1945, which closely resembled the Gwinn Aircar but had cantilever monoplane wings {{in place of the}} biplane layout of the Aircar and a pusher propeller driven by a mid-fuselage mounted [...] Continental A-65. Given the nickname [...] "Pregnant Guppy", ground and wind-tunnel testing revealed low <b>rudder</b> <b>control</b> authority and poor directional stability, as well as problems with engine cooling. Convair persevered with the Aircar until it was deemed uneconomic to continue supplying engines and driveshafts to replace those damaged in testing. Once testing was halted the Aircar slipped into obscurity and was unceremoniously scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} bolted together aluminium tube, braced with steel cables and covered with heat shrunk Dacron fabric. Its [...] span wing uses V-shaped interplane struts. Controls are conventional three axis, with the ailerons and elevator controlled by a center stick and <b>rudder</b> <b>controlled</b> by pedals. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel gear. The pilot sits on an open cockpit seat without a windshield and is secured with a four-point harness. The aircraft {{is designed to be}} car-top transportable and can be assembled by one person.|$|R
5000|$|The word cockpit was {{originally}} a sailing {{term for the}} coxswain's station in a Royal Navy ship, and later {{the location of the}} ship's <b>rudder</b> <b>controls.</b> Cockpit first appeared in the English language in the 1580s, [...] "a pit for fighting cocks", from [...] + [...] Used in nautical sense (1706) for midshipmen's compartment below decks; transferred to airplanes (1914) and to cars (1930s).
