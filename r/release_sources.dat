40|$|Introduction: Leakage from process {{equipment}} and the entrance of flammable fluids to surrounding atmosphere may cause flammable gas cloud. The coincidence of flammable gas cloud with ignition source could make flash fire or vapor cloud explosion that cause injury and fatality. The concept of reduction of confluence of flammable gas cloud and potential sources of ignition is known as hazardous area classification. Several standards have provided methods regarding hazardous area classification; however, of the disadvantages of them are lack of an accurate determination of hazardous areas due to potential leakage sources which is because of low flexibility in process condition variation and equipment layout and also not considering effect of weather conditions and cumulative effects of <b>release</b> <b>sources.</b>   Method: In this paper, risk-based hazardous area classification is optimized using parameters such {{as the number of}} influencing <b>release</b> <b>sources</b> and weather condition probabilities. In this method, the determining factor of hazardous area boundary is the probability of acceptable ignition for every specific location. This probability is calculated using quantitative risk assessment with PHAST RISK software version 6. 7 on the gas boosting unit of a gas refinery as a case study.   Result: The results of this method showed the full dependency of hazardous area boundary to cumulative effects of potential sources of release and the prevailing wind direction and it also demonstrated that the suggested optimized method can consider wind direction probabilities and cumulative effects of potential sources of release in risk-based hazardous area classification calculation.   Conclusion: Comparing the results of this method with the usual method determines that this method has some advantages such as considering all sources of release and cumulative sources of release and considering wind direction probabilities in determining boundary of zone 2 which makes the hazardous area classification very precise and flexible...|$|E

40|$|Following the Fukushima {{accident}} in March 2011, grass {{samples were collected}} from 42 sites around Great Britain during April 2011. Iodine- 131 was measurable in grass samples across the country with activity concentrations ranging from 10 to 55 Bq kg - 1 dry matter.

Of these, 131 I was only detectable in sheep's milk (c. 2 Bq kg- 1). Caesium- 134, which can be attributed to releases from the Fukushima reactors, was detectable in six of the grass samples (4 - 8 Bq kg- 1 dry matter); 137 Cs was detected in a larger number of grass samples although previous <b>release</b> <b>sources</b> (atmospheric weapons test and the 1986 Chernobyl and 1957 Windscale accidents) are likely to have contributed to this...|$|E

40|$|Stent {{modeling}} {{represents a}} challenging task {{from both the}} theoretical and numerical viewpoints, due to its multi-physics nature and to the complex geometrical configuration of these devices. In this light, dimensional model reduction enables a comprehensive geometrical and physical description of stenting at affordable computational costs. In this work, we aim at reviewing dimensional model reduction of stent mechanics and drug release. Firstly, we address model reduction techniques for the description of stent mechanics, aiming to illustrate how a three-dimensional stent model can {{be transformed into a}} collection of interconnected one-dimensional rods, called a "stent net". Secondly, we review available model reduction methods similarly applied to drug release, in which the "stent net" concept is adopted for modeling of drug elution. As a result, drug eluting stents are described as a distribution of concentrated drug <b>release</b> <b>sources</b> located on a graph that fully represents the stent geometry. Lastly, new results about the extension of these model reduction approaches to biodegradable stents are also discussed...|$|E

Although {{a significant portion of}} dangerous goods transportation is via railroads, prevailing studies on dangerous goods transport focus on highway shipments. We present an analytical framework that incorporates the differentiating features of trains in the assessment of risk. Each railcar is a potential source of release, and hence risk assessment of trains requires representation of multiple <b>release</b> <b>sources</b> in the model. We report {{on the use of the}} proposed approach for the risk assessment of the Ultra-train that passes through the city of Montreal everyday. The risk assessment methodology is then used to model the operations of freight trains in a network, wherein freight involves both hazardous and regular cargo. We present an optimization model distinct from the conventional ones, a Memetic Algorithm based solution technique, and a number of scenarios intended to gain numerical and managerial insights into the problem. In an effort to combine the economies of trains and efficiencies of trucks, we deal with rail-truck intermodalism for hazardous and non-hazardous cargo. Two special cases and a general case of rail-truck intermodal transportation models, driven by the element of ' time', are presented...|$|E
