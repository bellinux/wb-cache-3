5|$|The French {{zoologist}} Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire {{showed in}} 1818 in his theorie d'analogue ("theory of homologues") that structures were shared between fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. When Geoffroy went further and sought homologies between Georges Cuvier's embranchements, such as vertebrates and molluscs, his claims triggered the 1830 Cuvier-Geoffroy debate.

5|$|A partial cranial endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT scan data, {{the first}} ever for a Parasaurolophus of any ontogenetic stage. The endocast was reconstructed in two sections, one on {{the portion of the}} braincase {{articulated}} with the left half of the skull and the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase. Their <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids.

5|$|Mycale and Plataea {{have great}} {{significance}} in ancient {{history as the}} battles which decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging {{the balance of the}} Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks. The Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Mycale and Plataea which effectively ended that threat. However, neither of these battles are as well known as Thermopylae, Salamis or Marathon. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might however be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the Greeks in the face of overwhelming numbers; Marathon and Salamis perhaps because they were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> of Greek strength, and against lesser odds; perhaps the Greeks were even expecting to win and had certainly seen the opportunity to deal the final blow.|$|E
5|$|The <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> of eyes {{is highly}} {{variable}} within the species. For example, eye location ranges from being completely within the antennal scrobes to completely outside the scrobes. In {{some cases the}} eye itself is located outside the antennal scrobe, but the eye's fossa is well marked and confluent with the antennal scrobe. In most specimens, the antennal carina (ridge extending along the dorsal antennal region) bifurcates from the antennal scrobes and lies straight above the eyes. However, in specimens from Nicaragua, a strongly impressed antennal carina is present. In these specimens about 40% of the eye's area lies within the antennal scrobes. In the gyne, only ~1/6 of the eye lies within the antennal scrobes. A depression sometimes forms in the integument in {{the sides of the}} propodeum, below the propodeal spiracle and above the metapleural gland. The depth of this depression varies among specimens and tends to be deepest in larger specimens.|$|E
5|$|This led to Hanbury Brown's {{work on the}} Mark IVA, which {{differed}} from the Mk. IV primarily by having an additional display unit {{in front of the}} pilot. The radar operator had an additional control, the strobe, which could be adjusted to pick out returns at a particular range. Only those returns were sent to the pilot's display, resulting in much less clutter. Unlike the operator's display, the pilot's showed the target's location as a single dot in a bore-scope like fashion; if the dot was above and {{to the right of the}} centre of the display, the pilot had to turn to the right and climb to intercept. The result was what was known as a flying spot indicator, a single selected target showing a direct indication of the target's <b>relative</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

5|$|The astronomical {{phenomena}} {{of the solar}} eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> of the Moon to the Sun. The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78–139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that {{the brightness of the}} Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun. Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat. Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century. When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the Moon. Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun). He explained that when the Sun's light is slanting, the Moon appears full. He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical. He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} near-integer-ratio {{relationships}} between the orbital frequencies of the planets or major moons are sometimes pointed out (see list below). However, these have no dynamical significance {{because there is no}} appropriate precession of perihelion or other libration to make the resonance perfect (see the detailed discussion in the section above). Such near resonances are dynamically insignificant even if the mismatch is quite small because (unlike a true resonance), after each cycle the <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> of the bodies shifts. When averaged over astronomically short timescales, their <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> is random, just like bodies that are nowhere near resonance. For example, consider the orbits of Earth and Venus, which arrive at almost the same configuration after 8 Earth orbits and 13 Venus orbits. The actual ratio is 0.61518624, which is only 0.032% away from exactly 8:13. The mismatch after 8 years is only 1.5° of Venus' orbital movement. Still, this is enough that Venus and Earth find themselves in the opposite relative orientation to the original every 120 such cycles, which is 960 years. Therefore, on timescales of thousands of years or more (still tiny by astronomical standards), their <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> is effectively random.|$|E

40|$|Support {{system for}} safe driving heavily depends on global {{navigation}} satellite system. Pseudoranges between satellites and vehicles are measured to compute vehicles’ <b>positions</b> and their <b>relative</b> <b>positions.</b> In urban areas, however, multipath errors (MPEs) in pseudoranges, caused by obstruction and reflection of roadside buildings, greatly degrade {{the precision of}} <b>relative</b> <b>positions.</b> On the other hand, simply removing all reflected signals {{might lead to a}} shortage of satellites in fixing positions. In our previous work, we suggested solving this dilemma by cooperative <b>relative</b> <b>positioning</b> (CoRelPos) which exploits spatial correlation of MPEs. In this paper, we collected the trace data of pseudoranges by driving cars in urban areas, analyzed the properties of MPEs (specifically, their dependency on signal strength, elevation angles of satellites, and receivers’ speeds), and highlighted their spatial correlation. On this basis, the CoRelPos scheme is refined by considering the dynamics of MPEs. Evaluation results under practical vehicular scenarios confirm that properties of MPEs can be exploited to improve the precision of <b>relative</b> <b>positions...</b>|$|R
