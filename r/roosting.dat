5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the summer <b>roosting</b> {{locations}} of this species, as well as where maternal colonies are formed, which makes a proper species distribution estimate difficult to obtain. The first study into the summer <b>roosting</b> habits was only done in 2011 so information is scarce. This study performed by Johnson, Kiser and Peterson discovered that these bats most commonly use ground level rock roosts in talus slopes, rock fields and vertical cliff faces for their summer roosts. On average they change their roosts every 1.1 days, males travel about 41 meters between consecutive roosts and females around 67 meters. They also found that females <b>roosting</b> sites were closer to ephemeral water sources than maleâ€™s roosts. Females who have young require roost sites that receive a lot of sunlight in order to keep the pups warm while the mother is away from the nesting site. Summer <b>roosting</b> habitats are very difficult to find, and may be threatened by mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, sprawl highway construction, wind energy and other forms of agricultural, industrial and residential development. However, it is also likely that some of the above disturbances could also create <b>roosting</b> sites for the species.|$|E

New Zealand's long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) <b>roost</b> in exotic plantation forest, where sex-specific <b>roost</b> selection has not been investigated, and therefore such management is not possible. We investigated sex-specific <b>roost</b> selection by long-tailed bats for the first time. <b>Roosts</b> and paired nonroosts were characterized testing predictions that males and females select <b>roosts</b> that differ from non-roosts, and males and females select different <b>roosts.</b> Females and males chose Pinus radiata <b>roosts</b> that differed from non-roost trees. Results suggest each sex chose <b>roosts</b> that maximized energetic savings. Female bats used <b>roosts</b> closer to water sources, that warmed earlier in the day, which allowed maintenance of high temperatures. Males appeared to choose <b>roosts</b> that allowed torpor use {{for long periods of}} the day. Males may be less selective with their <b>roost</b> locations than females, as they <b>roosted</b> further from water sources. This could allow persistence of male bats in marginal habitat. As all female long-tailed bats chose <b>roosts</b> within 150 m of waterways, management to protect bats could be focused here. To protect bats least able to escape when <b>roosts</b> are harvested, harvest of forest stands selected by female bats as <b>roost</b> sites should be planned when bats are not heavily pregnant nor have non-volant dependents...|$|R
40|$|American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) have a {{long history}} of causing {{agricultural}} damage in North America. Shooting and bombing at crow night <b>roosts</b> have been employed to reduce such damage. Most <b>roosts</b> were located in rural locations, but in the latter half of the 1900 s crows began to <b>roost</b> in urban locations. Urban crow <b>roosts</b> are presently a nationwide problem in the United States. Thousands of crows at a <b>roost</b> create problems for businesses and residents. Improved control techniques are needed. Lasers have been used in Europe to scare and disperse birds but the technique has only recently received formal testing. We treated urban <b>roosts</b> with lasers to determine if crows react to laser light, can be dispersed from <b>roosts,</b> and whether lasers are effective for eliciting <b>roost</b> abandonment. We treated 63 <b>roosts</b> in Woodland, California and recorded the immediate and short-term reactions of crows. We counted crows at five <b>roosts</b> in Davis, California during an 8 -day pre-treatment period and then again during a 4 -day treatment period to evaluate crow response to laser treatment. Crows reacted to the laser beam. In Woodland 100 % of the crows flew immediately away from 49 % of the treated <b>roosts.</b> Between 50 % to 99 % of all crows flew immediately away at 44 % of the treated <b>roosts.</b> At 84 % of the <b>roosts</b> crows left without vocalizing and at 95 % of the <b>roosts</b> flew directly away without circling overhead. Crows returned to all <b>roosts</b> within 15 min. In Davis there was no difference in the number of crows using <b>roosts</b> during the pre-treatment versus treatment periods. Despite initial dispersal upon treatment, crows reoccupied all treated <b>roosts</b> the same night after treatment. No <b>roosts</b> were abandoned. Therefore, we do not recommend lasers as a stand-alone dispersal tool at urban crow <b>roosts...</b>|$|R
5|$|Some {{birds have}} also {{demonstrated}} {{the capacity to}} fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time.

40|$|High tides force {{shorebirds}} from intertidal feeding {{areas to}} sites known as <b>roosts.</b> We investigated the <b>roost</b> selection of great knots, Calidris tenuirostris, and red knots, Calidris canutus, on a tropical coastline in northwestern Australia, assessing several <b>roost</b> attributes and recording {{the frequency of}} use of each site through automatic radiotelemetry. To model <b>roost</b> choice we used two approaches: (1) conditional logistic regression models that assumed <b>roost</b> selection to be a trade-off based on a probabilistic assessment of several environmental characteristics; and (2) bounds-based models that assumed that birds selected the nearest <b>roost</b> site to their feeding grounds, provided that threshold values for certain environmental characteristics were met. Bounds-based models were more effective, and we suggest that they offer a closer approach to real <b>roost</b> choice mechanisms. By day, <b>roost</b> choice was affected by distance from the feeding area and microclimate; birds selected nearby <b>roosts</b> where they could stand on cool, wet substrates. Different <b>roost</b> selection criteria were used at night when birds chose safer, but more distant, <b>roosts.</b> Models that assumed that <b>roost</b> choice was influenced by recent experience of <b>roost</b> sites performed better than models that assumed constant assessment of <b>roost</b> quality. This effect was significant only at night, suggesting that memory was used more when information on <b>roost</b> quality was limited. Evidence that <b>roost</b> availability may influence selection of foraging areas is also presented. Our results suggest that shorebirds select <b>roosts</b> by using simple mechanisms, making <b>roost</b> choice models a potentially valuable tool in conservation planning.

40|$|The {{decision}} {{where to}} live has far-reaching fitness consequences for animals. In contrast to most other mammals or birds that use sheltered nest sites, female Bechstein's bats frequently switch day <b>roosts</b> during one breeding season, and therefore must often {{decide where to}} spend the day. Selecting the right <b>roost</b> is important, because <b>roost</b> quality, e. g. microclimatic condition, influences survival and reproduction in bats. Although thermal factors are {{very important for the}} quality of <b>roosts</b> occupied by bats, whether bats base their day <b>roost</b> selection directly on <b>roost</b> temperature has not been tested in the field. Over one summer, we examined and tested the <b>roost</b> choice of 21 individually marked female Myotis bechsteinii living in one maternity colony. In a field experiment, we allowed the bats to choose between relatively warm versus cold bat boxes, while controlling for site preferences. We expected females to exhibit a preference for warm <b>roosts</b> during pregnancy and lactation to accelerate gestation and shorten the period of growth of their young. <b>Roost</b> occupancy over 160 census days reflected significant temperature differences among 89 surveyed <b>roosts</b> (14 tree holes and 75 bat boxes), and preferences changed with the season. Females significantly preferred cold <b>roosts</b> before parturition, whereas post-partum, they significantly favoured warm <b>roosts.</b> Temperature preferences were independent of the <b>roost</b> site, and thus <b>roost</b> selection was based directly on temperature. Boxes with significantly different daytime temperatures did not differ significantly at night. Consequently, bats would have to spend at least 1 day in a new <b>roost</b> to test it. Information transfer among colony members might facilitate knowledge of <b>roost</b> availability. Access to many <b>roosts</b> providing different microclimates is likely to be important for successful reproduction in the endangered Bechstein's bat...|$|R
