Academic discipline was rigorous; students were allowed only one half-day each month for leisure. Pei enjoyed playing billiards and watching Hollywood movies, especially those of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. He also learned rudimentary English skills by <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> and novels by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|Elias Zoghby {{was born}} on January 9, 1912, in Cairo. His mother, Hanne Ishak Yared, was a Melkite Greek Catholic and his father, Abdallah Mikail Zoghby, was an Antiochian Orthodox convert and former Maronite Catholic. The couple had {{recently}} immigrated from Lebanon and settled in Cairo's Arb-el-Guenena neighborhood. The area had a Melkite church nearby which his parents attended. Elias and his siblings were baptized into the Melkite faith and raised in a devout household, attending liturgy daily, <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>bible</b> {{together as a family}} and praying the Office every afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{conflicting}} reports {{on whether he}} retired from the Army in 1947, 1949 or 1950, he left the army only shortly before the Buffalo Soldiers were disbanded as part of President Harry S. Truman's initiative to integrate the Army. His next job was at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda where he worked as a security guard. By the time he retired for a second time, in 1970, he had become the chief of the guards at the institution. He spent much of his spare time fishing, <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible,</b> and recounting tales of his extensive military experiences, which made him a popular and respected figure within the community. His wife of 57 years, Genevieve Hill Matthews, died in 1986 and one of his daughters, Shirley Ann, died two years later.|$|E

25|$|When {{questioned}} about Ridgway after his arrest, {{friends and family}} described him as friendly but strange. His first two marriages resulted in divorce because of infidelities by both partners. His second wife, Marcia Winslow, claimed that he had placed her in a chokehold. He had become religious during his second marriage, proselytizing door-to-door, <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> aloud at work and at home, and insisting that his wife follow the strict teachings of their pastor. Ridgway would also frequently cry after sermons or <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b> Ridgway continued to solicit the services of sex workers during this marriage. He also wanted his wife to participate in sex in public and inappropriate places, sometimes even in areas where his victims' bodies were later discovered.|$|E

25|$|Some 4% of the {{population}} are German-speaking Mennonite farmers and craftsmen. The vast majority are so-called Russian Mennonites of German descent who settled in the Russian Empire during the 18th and 19th centuries. Most Russian Mennonites live in Mennonite settlements like Spanish Lookout, Shipyard, Little Belize, and Blue Creek. These Mennonites speak Plautdietsch (a German dialect) in everyday life, but use mostly Standard German for <b>reading</b> (<b>the</b> <b>Bible)</b> and writing. The Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites came mostly from Mexico {{in the years after}} 1958. There are also some mainly Pennsylvania German-speaking Old Order Mennonites who came from the United States and Canada in the late 1960s. They live primarily in Upper Barton Creek and associated settlements. These Mennonites attracted people from different Anabaptist backgrounds who formed a new community. They look quite similar to Old Order Amish, but are different from them.|$|E
25|$|This {{distinction}} had {{implications for}} New Divinity preaching and evangelism that were departures from traditional Puritan beliefs. For the Puritans, conversion was a gradual process involving spiritual crises, humiliation, and sorrow for sin. Only after these struggles and utilizing {{the means of}} grace (prayer, seeking God, <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible,</b> and attending church) would the individual discern within himself faith and love for Christ and be encouraged to repent. New Divinity ministers, however, called all sinners to repent and believe the gospel immediately because everyone had the natural ability to do so. There was no reason, they said, to wait for any period of conviction and spiritual struggle. While immediate repentance was criticized by Old Calvinists, there was practically little {{difference between the two}} approaches. When asked how to repent, Old Calvinists and New Divinity ministers had the same advice: seek God through the means of grace and in time God might give the seeker new affections and inclinations to believe in Christ.|$|E

Clark denied this version of events and claimed that after finding out several students had left a Bible reading to read a different version of the Bible, he commented that if <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> caused this kind of confusion, {{that it would be better}} if it were not to be read in school.

He was a good student, and earned the title of First Citizen (Primer Ciudadano) of the school. After completing primary school, his mother wanted him to go to Córdoba to become a priest. He had spent a year <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> and often spent time as a child helping his uncle with church services, but Sarmiento soon became bored with religion and school, and got involved with a group of aggressive children. Sarmiento's father took him to the Loreto Seminary in 1821, but for reasons unknown, Sarmiento did not enter the seminary, returning instead to San Juan with his father. In 1823, the Minister of State, Bernardino Rivadavia, announced that the six top pupils of each state would be selected to receive higher education in Buenos Aires. Sarmiento {{was at the top of}} the list in San Juan, but it was then announced that only ten pupils would receive the scholarship. [...] The selection was made by lot, and Sarmiento was not one of the scholars whose name was drawn.|$|E
