40|$|Monetary policy {{measures}} {{taken by the}} Federal Reserve {{as a response to}} the 2007 - 09 financial crisis and subsequent economic conditions led to a large increase in the level of outstanding reserves. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a range of tools to control short-term market rates in this situation. We study several of these tools, namely, interest on excess reserves (IOER), <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> agreements (RRPs), and the term deposit facility (TDF). We find that overnight RRPs (ON RRPs) may provide a better floor on rates than term RRPs because they are available to absorb daily liquidity shocks. Whether the TDF or RRPs best support equilibrium rates depends on the intensity of interbank monitoring costs versus balance sheet costs, respectively, that banks face. In our model, using the RRP and TDF concurrently may most effectively stabilize short-term rates close to the IOER rate when such costs are rapidly increasing...|$|R

Making ON RRPs available to a broad set of investors, including nonbank institutions that are significant lenders in money markets, could complement the use of the interest on excess reserves (IOER) and help control short-term interest rates. We examine some potentially important secondary effects of an ON RRP facility, both positive and negative, including impacts on the structure of short-term funding markets and financial stability. We also investigate design features of an ON RRP facility that could mitigate secondary effects deemed undesirable. Finally, we discuss tradeoffs that policymakers may face in designing an ON RRP facility, as they seek to balance the objectives of setting an effective floor on money market rates during the normalization process and limiting any adverse secondary effects...|$|R
5000|$|A dollar roll {{is similar}} to a <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> {{agreement}} and provides a form of collateralized short-term financing with mortgage-backed securities comprising the collateral. [...] The investor sells a mortgage-backed security for settlement on one date and buys it back for settlement at a later date. The investor gives up the principal and interest payments during the roll period, but can invest the proceeds and usually is able to buy back the mortgage for a lower price than the sale price. The difference in the prices is called the drop. The value of the drop plus interest earned on the proceeds of the sale less the forgone interest and principal payments on the mortgage is considered the roll specialness or financing advantage. With repurchase agreements exactly the same security is returned to the investor, while with dollar rolls the investor buys a substantially similar—but not necessarily identical—security. This difference produces complex results under certain areas of the United States Internal Revenue Code.|$|R
50|$|Rehypothecation can be {{involved}} in repurchase agreements, commonly called repos. In a two-party repurchase agreement, one party sells to the other a security at a price with a commitment to buy the security back {{at a later date}} for another price. Overnight repurchase agreements, the most commonly used form of this arrangement, comprise a sale which takes place the first day and a <b>repurchase</b> that <b>reverses</b> the transaction the next day. Term repurchase agreements, less commonly used, extend for a fixed period of time that may be as long as three months. Open-ended term repurchase agreements are also possible. A so-called reverse repo is not actually any different to a repo; it merely describes {{the opposite side of the}} transaction. The seller of the security who later repurchases it is entering into a repurchase agreement; the purchaser who later re-sells the security enters into a <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> agreement. Notwithstanding its nominal form as a sale and subsequent repurchase of a security, the economic effect of a repurchase agreement is that of a secured loan.|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates {{whether the}} {{inclusion}} of the output gap in the central bank's estimated reaction function would improve the conduct of inflation targeting in the Philippines. A reduced-form vector autoregression model was constructed using exchange rate, output gap, inflation, and interest rate as the relevant variables. The authors use two measures for the short-term interest rate: the <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> rate and the T-bill rate. Results from counterfactual simulations show that the adoption of a Taylor-type rule, which involves the use of the output gap, minimizes the deviations of inflation from its target. Based on the empirical results of this study, {{the inclusion of}} the output gap is significant in terms of its contribution to maintaining inflation at a level that is nearer to the desired target. It is recommended that further studies consider the use of output gap estimates derived from other procedures, especially those that employ Markov-regime switching techniques, which could account for shocks in the economy. In addition, the use of alternative model-representations for the Philippine economy within which counterfactual simulations may be performed is recommended as an area for future research. inflation, inflation targeting, monetary policy...|$|R

The normal procedure used by the ECB for manipulating the money supply has been via the so-called refinancing facilities. In these facilities, bonds are not purchased but used in <b>reverse</b> transactions: <b>repurchase</b> agreements, or collateralised loans. These two transactions are similar, i.e. bonds are used as collaterals for loans, the difference being of legal nature.

Albeit a cost-effective response of the cash lender to a liquidity shock, liquidity hoarding may lead to the bankruptcy of its repo counterparties triggering contagion across asset classes.

The independent auditor, Ernst and Young, resigned in 2006. NetBank's mortgage operations suffered greatly. NetBank normally originated loans and resold the loans to other financial institutions on the open markets.

40|$|From {{standardized}} {{contracts for}} <b>loans,</b> <b>repurchase</b> agreements, and derivatives, to stock exchanges and alternative trading platforms, to benchmark interest and foreign exchange rates, private market structures play {{a number of}} important roles within modern financial markets. These market structures hold out a number of significant benefits. Specifically, by harnessing the powerful incentives of market participants, these market structures can help lower information, agency, coordination, and other transaction costs; enhance the process of price discovery, and promote greater market liquidity. Simultaneously, however, successful market structures are the source of significant and often overlooked market distortions. These distortions – or limits of private ordering – stem from positive network externalities, path dependency, and power imbalances between market participants at the core of these market structures and those at the periphery. Somewhat paradoxically, these limits can erect substantial barriers to entry, insulate incumbents from vigorous competition, and undermine the emergence of new and potentially more desirable substitutes: thus entrenching less efficient market structures. Using the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association determination committee (DC) mechanism as case studies, this paper seeks to better understand the limits of private ordering. It also explores how relatively modest changes to the public regulatory regimes governing these market structures could, in some cases, yield significant improvements...|$|R
