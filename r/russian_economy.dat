Ivan IV had introduced a new strategy whereby he relied on tens of thousands of native troops, Cossacks and Tatars instead of a few thousand skilled troops and mercenaries, as was the practice of his adversaries.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union a few years earlier, the <b>Russian</b> <b>economy</b> had been slowly {{collapsing}} and the budget for space exploration was reduced by around 80%. Before and after Phase One, a great deal of Russia's space finances came from flights of astronauts from Europe and other countries, with one Japanese TV station paying $9.5 million to have one of their reporters, Toyohiro Akiyama, flown aboard Mir. By the start of Phase One, cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to save money on launchers, the six-yearly flights of the Progress had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of Mir being sold for around $500 million.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of impulses summoned by shifts in <b>Russian</b> <b>economy's</b> money supply. We catch the shocks outgoing to primal elements of gross domestic product, i. e. consumption of goods and durables, capital investment, public expenditures and net export. Using VEC model we unravel long- and short-term relationship between money supply and the GDP components finding that in the short term the transmission effect is reversed. Monetary expansion creates critically high level of inflationary expectations, which, via Hicks income effect, hampers major macroeconomic aggregates and impedes the development of raw-based economies. The long-term relationship is consistent with the theory of monetarism, compelling monetary authorities to refrain from excessive regulatory functions. ...|$|R

25|$|During {{the crisis}} {{years of the}} <b>Russian</b> <b>economy,</b> the country's {{military}} industry survived mainly on exports.

While in 2002, the State Defense Order amounted to only RUB 62billion, by 2007 the sum had risen to RUB 302.7billion. When calculated in constant 2000 prices, this represents an increase by a factor of two.|$|E
25|$|Declining productivity, a high fixed {{exchange}} rate between the ruble and foreign currencies to avoid public turmoil, and a chronic fiscal deficit were the reasons {{that led to the}} crisis. The economic cost of the first war in Chechnya, estimated at $5.5billion (not including the rebuilding of the ruined Chechen economy), also contributed to the crisis. In the first half of 1997, the <b>Russian</b> <b>economy</b> showed some signs of improvement. However, soon after this, the problems began to gradually intensify.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Russian</b> <b>economy's</b> {{entry into}} a new stage of reform based on deep {{structural}} reorganization and oriented toward the formation of developed market relations presupposes {{the existence of a}} strong, dynamic production potential. The intensive transformation of the economy of the transition period into a system of market relations also affects the resource potential. Labor force, capital, and its other elements form under the influence of two basic (and contradictory) groups of factors: market factors and factors that predated the reforms. Market factors determine the real demand and social demand for resources, which presupposes structuring or selection. Factors characteristic of the pre-reform period are manifested in the striving for quantitative growth and in the realization on this basis of predominantly extensive principles of economic development, and are of a cumulative nature. ...|$|R

Dmitry Medvedev, elected as President in 2008, made economic modernisation his prime presidential agenda. Medvedev's statements regarding this issue went much further than other statements by the Russian leadership. In 2009, Medvedev founded the Presidential Commission on Innovation.

25|$|Russia {{had lost}} {{two of its}} three fleets. Only its Black Sea Fleet remained, {{and this was the}} result of an earlier treaty that had {{prevented}} the fleet from leaving the Black Sea. Japan became the sixth-most powerful naval force by combined tonnage, while the Russian Navy declined to one barely stronger than that of Austria–Hungary. The actual costs of the war were large enough to affect the <b>Russian</b> <b>economy</b> and, despite grain exports, the nation developed an external balance of payments deficit. The cost of military re-equipment and re-expansion after 1905 pushed the economy further into deficit, although the size of the deficit was obscured.|$|E
25|$|The Russian {{labour force}} is {{undergoing}} tremendous changes. Although well-educated and skilled, {{it is largely}} mismatched to the rapidly changing needs of the <b>Russian</b> <b>economy.</b> The unemployment rate in Russia was 5.3% as of 2013. Unemployment is highest among women and young people. Following {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union and the economic dislocation it engendered, the standard of living fell dramatically. However, since recovering from the 1998 economic crisis, the standard of living has been on the rise. As of 2010 about 13.1% of the population was living below the poverty line, compared to 40% in 1999. The average yearly salary in Russia was $14,302 (about $23,501 PPP) as of October 2013, up from $455 per year in August 1999.|$|E

As a result, Russia could restore its positions in the world economy on a new, more modern basis as a large industrial country with an average level of economic development and a satisfactory living standard. The very scale of the requisite capital expenditures attests to the need for an inflow of resources from the outside. ...|$|R
