5|$|More {{than half}} a century after the capture of Jerusalem, in 691, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik {{commissioned}} the construction of the Dome of the <b>Rock</b> <b>over</b> a large outcropping of bedrock on the Temple Mount. The 10th-century historian al-Muqaddasi wrote that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to compete in grandeur with the city's Christian churches. Whatever the intention, the impressive splendor and scale of the shrine is seen as having helped significantly in solidifying the attachment of Jerusalem to the early Muslim faith.|$|E
5|$|When the North American Plate on its slow journey westwards {{encountered}} the Pacific Plate approximately 250 {{million years ago}} during the Paleozoic, the latter began to subduct under the North American continent. Intense pressure underground caused some of the Pacific Plate to melt, and the resulting upwelling magma pushed up and hardened into the granite batholith that makes up much of the Sierra Nevada. Extensive layers of marine sedimentary rock that originally made up the ancient Pacific seabed were also pushed up by the rising granite, and the ancestral Merced River formed on this layer of <b>rock.</b> <b>Over</b> millions of years, the Merced cut a deep canyon through the softer sedimentary rock, eventually hitting the hard granite beneath. The encounter with this resilient rock layer caused the Merced River to mostly stop its downcutting, although tributary streams continued to widen the ancient canyon.|$|E
5|$|Kekal (sometimes stylized as KEKAL) is a {{heavy metal}} and {{electronic}} music band formed in 1995 in Jakarta, Indonesia. According to AllMusic, Kekal {{was one of the}} first heavy metal bands from Indonesia to make international inroads, and according to sociologist of heavy metal, Keith Kahn-Harris, was one of the few extreme metal bands from Southeast Asia to ever make more than a minimal impression on the global scene. Founded by two musicians known simply Yeris and Newbabe, the band underwent some shifts in lineup in its early years, but emerged with a consistent lineup of three key-members, guitarist/vocalist Jeff Arwadi, bassist Azhar Levi Sianturi, and guitarist Leo Setiawan. Frequently labeled as black metal, progressive metal, and avant-garde metal, Kekal plays a very diverse range of music styles within the frame of metal and rock, incorporating many other music genres such as ambient, electronic, jazz fusion, and progressive <b>rock.</b> <b>Over</b> the course of its career, Kekal has transitioned from a heavy metal-based style to a more experimental and electronic sound.|$|E

5|$|At Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock {{entered the}} Royal Rumble match {{and was one}} of the final two remaining, along with Big Show; Show {{seemingly}} intended to throw The <b>Rock</b> <b>over</b> the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, but Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. However, The Rock's feet hit the floor first, although those watching the event on TV did not see that, until Big Show proved this with additional video footage, and claimed to be the rightful winner. Despite this proof, the original decision could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship was held at No Way Out, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered and hit The Rock in the head with a steel chair as he attempted to execute a People's Elbow. The Rock defeated Big Show on March 13 episode of Raw Is War to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley. Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife, Stephanie, Foley had Linda, The Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane. Triple H retained the title after Vince betrayed The Rock by hitting him with a chair.|$|E

25|$|In {{continental}} arcs, {{such as the}} Andes, magma often {{pools in}} the shallow crust creating magma chambers. Magmas in these reservoirs become evolved in composition (dacitic to rhyolitic) through both the process of fractional crystallization and partial melting of the surrounding country <b>rock.</b> <b>Over</b> time as crystallization continues and the system loses heat, these reservoirs cool. In order to remain active, magma chambers must have continued recharge of hot basaltic melt into the system. When this basaltic material mixes with the evolved rhyolitic magma, the composition is returned to andesite, its intermediate phase.|$|E

[...] Ballou considers the band's previous three albums (Jane Doe, You Fail Me and No Heroes) to be a trilogy in regards to their sound, and hoped to push their musical boundaries on Axe to Fall. The tracks on the album have been noted to range from [...] "drone-and-pummel" [...] to atmospheric. Jacob Bannon believes this album is [...] "not about being as loud and vicious as possible." [...] Feeling that 40–50 minutes of metallic hardcore can be difficult to listen to for some, Converge used softer tracks, or [...] "slow jams," [...] such as [...] "Damages" [...] and [...] "Wretched World" [...] to take the listener [...] "to some other places." ...|$|E
500|$|Ned meets up {{with the}} church council to suggest {{promotion}} of creationism. The next day, he and Reverend Lovejoy blackmail Principal Skinner into introducing creationism in the school. Lisa is perturbed by this, and at a town meeting asks everyone {{to make a choice}} between creationism and Darwinism, as there is only one truth. The townspeople vote for creationism, much to her chagrin, and the act of teaching or learning Darwinism and evolution is made illegal. Lisa therefore decides to start holding secret classes for people interested in evolution. However, just as the first lesson is about to begin, she is arrested by Chief Wiggum. She asks why she's being arrested when there are far worse crimes out there, and embarrassed he tells her they only have enough manpower to enforce the last three laws passed, even stating that it's the worst law system there is. Lisa is brought to trial, which is dubbed Lisa Simpson v. God. Representing her is Clarice Drummond, a despised American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyer, while on God’s (i.e., Ned's) side is Wallace Brady, a beloved, overweight, southern lawyer. The trial does not go smoothly for Lisa, as Professor Frink (called by Clarice) gives ambiguous answers regarding God's existence, while a creationist scientist says that evolution cannot be real, as there is no proof of a [...] "missing link" [...] (depicted in a picture as a savage hominid, holding a <b>rock</b> <b>over</b> his head).|$|E
500|$|According to Mark Redfern of Under the Radar, Blur eschewed Britpop {{in favour}} of American indie rock. NME {{magazine}} similarly argued that it favoured lo-fi and alternative <b>rock</b> <b>over</b> Britpop. By contrast, Margaret Moser of The Austin Chronicle characterised its music as [...] "a punchy brand of muscular Brit-pop", while AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it [...] "may superficially {{appear to be a}} break from tradition" [...] but is a [...] "logical progression" [...] from Britpop rather than an abandonment of it. Album opener [...] "Beetlebum" [...] {{has been described as a}} [...] "Beatles tribute" [...] by several publications; Erlewine wrote that the song [...] " [...] through the White Album in the space of five minutes." [...] Q magazine's Andrew Collins compared the song to The Auteurs as well as a [...] "slightly menacing Free as a Bird", due to [...] "a slight drone undulating in the foreground" [...] and a [...] "sweet, elongated coda busied by what sounds like an invasion of turkeys." [...] Albarn admitted that [...] "Beetlebum" [...] was about heroin and the drug experiences he had with his then-girlfriend, Justine Frischmann of Elastica. Albarn also stated that the song describes a complicated emotion, sort of [...] "sleepy" [...] and sort of [...] "sexy". The song's title is a reference to the phrase [...] "Chasing the beetle" [...] which refers to inhaling the smoke from heated heroin, morphine, or opium that has been placed on a piece of tin-foil. [...] "Song 2" [...] is notable for its hook which features Albarn yelling [...] "woo-hoo!" [...] The song's intro has been called Coxon's [...] "finest moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carbon {{sequestration}} by reacting {{naturally occurring}} Mg and Ca containing minerals with [...] to form carbonates has many unique advantages.

Secondly, the raw materials such as magnesium based minerals are abundant. Finally, the produced carbonates are unarguably stable and thus re-release of [...] into the atmosphere is not an issue. However, conventional carbonation pathways are slow under ambient temperatures and pressures. The significant challenge being addressed by this effort is to identify an industrially and environmentally viable carbonation route that will allow mineral sequestration to be implemented with acceptable economics.|$|E
