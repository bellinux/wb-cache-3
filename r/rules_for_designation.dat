They chose Osprey as their postal address, since federal regulations required the use of only one word for the new address. A separate town eventually grew around that postal address. Although there is no similar documentation regarding the name of Sarasota, that federal one-word <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> postal <b>designations</b> may be the reason that Zara Zota or Sara Sota became Sarasota.|$|R
50|$|Silicon-nitrogen {{compounds}} with alternating silicon- ("sila") {{and nitrogen}} atoms ("aza") are designated as silazanes. Simple examples of silazanes are disilazane H3Si-NH-SiH3 and hexamethyldisilazane (H3C) 3Si-NH-Si(CH3)3. If only one silicon atom {{is bound to}} the nitrogen atom, the materials are known as silylamines or aminosilanes (for example triethylsilylamine (H5C2)3Si-NH2). If three silicon atoms are bound to each nitrogen atom, the materials are called silsesquiazanes. Small ring-shaped molecules with a basic network of Si-N are named cyclosilazanes (for example cyclotrisilazane H2Si-NH 3). In contrast to this, polysilazanes are silazane polymers consisting of both large chains and rings showing a range of molecular masses. A polymer with the general formula (CH3)3Si-NH-(CH3)2Si-NH n-Si(CH3)3 is designated as poly(dimethylsilazane). According to the IUPAC <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> the <b>designation</b> of linear organic polymers, the compound would actually be named polyaza(dimethylsilylene), {{and according to the}} preliminary <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> inorganic macromolecules catena-poly(dimethylsilicon)-m-aza. The labels normally used to describe the structure of silicones (M, D, T, and Q) are rarely employed for polysilazanes.|$|R

Thesis concerns both national and union institutes and also presents the legal status after the recodification of the civil law. Chapter One deals with intellectual property in general, which is defined by its conceptual characteristics.

Subchapter One provides an outline of the historical development of the respective inalienable possessions from the oldest historical period up to the present day. In {{view of the fact that}} rights to designation are regulated by large amounts of legal sources of law (as current legislation, international treaties, internal regulations, general terms and conditions), which come from national, union and international legal <b>rules,</b> <b>for</b> clear arrangement was necessary to write down the most significant sources.

40|$|There are {{currently}} 2160 buildings in Sweden that {{are protected by}} law with the designation as a cultural heritage building, which is the strongest protection that can be obtained for a building of cultural historic significance. The purpose of this thesis is to research how strong and sustainable the protection of such a designation is {{and how you can}} motivate a revocation. Furthermore, this thesis aims to give an overall insight into all cases where there has been a revocation. To achieve the protection of a designation as a cultural heritage building, the object has to be of outstanding interest on account of its cultural historic value. In the first part, this thesis gives a short historic background of the cultural heritage law and its terms, like outstanding interest and cultural historic value. The County Administrative Board's documents about revocation are the main source for this research. There have been 24 cases of revocation and the frequency of such cases has increased in the past ten years. This possibly indicates a change of the general attitude towards revocation of a designation of cultural heritage buildings. In the geographic distribution of the cases the County of Skåne is overrepresented. The research also indicates that in many cases a building was a former publicly owned listed building. The fact that a buildings cultural historic value has been reduced is a frequent motive for a revocation. A reduced cultural historic value is often the consequence of modern additions to the building. The bases of this problem {{can be found in the}} formulation of the protective regulations, which often are too general. The Heritage Conservation Act, where the <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> the <b>designation</b> of a cultural heritage building can be found, is considered to be a strong legislation. However, this is not always reflected in the application by the County Administrative Board...|$|R
