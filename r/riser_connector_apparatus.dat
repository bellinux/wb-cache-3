40|$|Results of an {{investigation}} of the behavior of a bolted, flange type marine <b>riser</b> <b>connector</b> is reported. The method used to account for the nonlinear effect of connector separation due to bolt preload and axial tension load is described. The automated multilevel substructing capability of COSMIC/NASTRAN was employed at considerable savings in computer run time. Simplified formulas for computer resources, i. e., computer run times for modules SDCOMP, FBS, and MPYAD, as well as disk storage space, are presented. Actual run time data on a VAX- 11 / 780 is compared with the formulas presented...|$|R
40|$|Drilling <b>riser</b> <b>connectors</b> {{designed}} by IFPEN undergo cyclic in-phase biaxial tension in their critical area. This type of loading was reproduced on steel tubular specimens loaded in cyclic tension and internal pressure. The fatigue lives were substantially reduced when the load biaxiality was increased from 0 to 0. 4 and then further to 1, {{which was not}} captured by existing fatigue criteria. A deeper investigation is thus in progress. Emphasis is laid on the separate evaluation of mean stress and biaxiality effects, often treated {{in the same way}} in existing criteria. The influence of load biaxiality on the resistance of the steel to fatigue-corrosion in seawater will also be investigated...|$|R

30|$|Loss of {{position}} of the dynamically positioned rig without safe disconnection could result in critical damage to the well barrier, {{as well as to}} exposed subsea equipment. The ultimate consequence could be a blowout and/or severe damage to subsea production systems like production templates, resulting in risk to personnel, environmental damage, financial loss and harm to the reputation of the company (Paula and Fonseca 2013). Currently, all dynamically positioned rigs are equipped with an emergency disconnect button which initiates a pre-programmed sequence of functions designed to secure the well in a minimal amount of time prior to disconnecting the LMRP <b>riser</b> <b>connector</b> (Sattler and Lewis 2004). An emergency disconnect sequence (EDS) is a sequence of actions, events and interlocks that are automatically initiated once the EDS button is pressed on any BOP panel in the rig. These actions will activate the mechanism or equipment responsible for disconnecting the rig from the well (Paula and Fonseca 2013).|$|R

40|$|Apparatus for gauging {{the amount}} of liquid in a {{container}} of liquid and gas under flow or zero gravity net conditions includes an accumulator and appropriate <b>connector</b> <b>apparatus</b> for communicating gas between the accumulator and the container. In one form of the invention, gas {{is removed from the}} container and compressed into the accumulator. The pressure and temperature of the fluid in the container is measured before and after removal of the gas; the pressure and temperature of gas in the accumulator is measured before and after compression of the gas into the accumulator from the container. These pressure and temperature measurements are used in determining the volume of gas in the container, whereby the volume of liquid in the container can be determined from the difference between the known volume of the container and the volume of gas in the container. Gas from the accumulator may be communicated into the container in a similar process as a verification of the gauging of the liquid volume, or as an independent process for determining the volume of liquid in the container...|$|R

40|$|International audienceStress-controlled {{fatigue tests}} were run at {{different}} R ratios (¼ r min =r max) up to at most 3 million cycles on a 2. 5 %Cr– 1 %Mo steel (ASTM A 182 F 22) used in <b>riser</b> tubes <b>connectors</b> for offshore oil drilling. The fatigue lives, {{as well as}} the slope of the S–N curves were found to decrease with increasing R and the endurance limit to follow Gerber's parabola. Surface crack initiation without any defect involved, was most often observed for R = À 1, À 0. 5 and 0, while an R ratio of 0. 25 triggered crack initiation from either surface or internal pores or chemically inhomogeneous areas, leading, in the latter case, to fish-eye patterns for relatively low numbers of cycles. A further increase in R ratio to 0. 5 promoted only defect-initiated surface cracks, while no fatigue fracture was observed within 10 million cycles above R ¼ 0 : 6. These transitions in crack initiation mode are discussed based on X-ray diffraction analyses of residual stresses, elastic–plastic F.

40|$|For {{the last}} few decades, Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion (CFBC) {{technology}} {{is being used to}} burn biomass waste while meeting stringent emission requirements for con trol of SO 2 and NO x emission. However, complex flow patterns are encountered when heat, mass and momentum heat transfer are interlinked which in turn controls the SO 2 and NO x emissions. 2 D simulations were done using FLUENT Ver. 6. 1, a CFD pack age by Fluent Inc. Sand particle sand air were used as fluidizing materials. The results discuss the turbulent flow behaviour using k-e turbulence model. The simulations show that velocity profiles along the riser height are influenced by the exit geom etry. The riser exits clearly showed the regions of flow separation and reattachment. The increased turbulence was also reported in <b>riser</b> exits and <b>connector,</b> which in turn yields lower SO 2 and NO x emissions...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} to airflow {{of the components}} of breathing systems have been examined pre-viously. Tracheal tubes and their connectors have been studied by a number of authors [1, 2] and expiratory valves by others [3, 4]. Smith [5] examined the resistance of the Magill system for both separate and assembled components. Shandro [6] studied the Ayre's T-piece, Bain and several circle systems. Several new breathing systems have been developed in recent years, and changes have been introduced, into both the design of their compo-nents and the materials used. These changes may have affected the {{resistance to}} gas flow. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the resistance to airflow in some of the commonly used anaesthetic breathing systems under stand-ardized conditions. METHODS The apparatus used to measure resistance to airflow was described by Gaensler and colleagues [7] and is shown in figure 1. Air was supplied from a cylinder through a variable pressure regulator (Murex Saffire BS 5741). The airflow rate was controlled by a needle valve and measured by a flowmeter (Platon Gap Meter type GTLK laboratory flow meter). The air was passed into a 10 -litre glass bottle, which was used to avoid any Venturi effect [8]. The outlet of this bottle was fitted with a standard 22 -mm male <b>connector,</b> to which <b>apparatus</b> under investigation was connected either directly or vi...|$|R
40|$|A {{straightforward}} {{measurement technique}} provides for correction of thermal-electromotive-force (thermal-EMF) errors introduced by temperature gradients along the pins of non-thermocouple-alloy hermetic feedthrough connectors for thermocouple extension wires that must pass through bulkheads. This technique {{is an alternative}} to the traditional technique in which the thermal-EMF errors are eliminated by use of custom-made multipin hermetic feedthrough connectors that contain pins made of the same alloys as those of the thermocouple extension wires. One disadvantage of the traditional technique is that it is expensive and time-consuming to fabricate multipin custom thermocouple connectors. In addition, the thermocouple-alloy pins in these connectors tend to corrode easily and/or tend to be less rugged compared to the non-thermocouple-alloy pins of ordinary connectors. As the number of thermocouples (and thus pins) is increased in a given setup, the magnitude of these disadvantages increases accordingly. The present technique is implemented by means of a little additional hardware and software, the cost of which is more than offset by the savings incurred through the use of ordinary instead of thermocouple connectors. The figure schematically depicts a typical measurement setup to which the technique is applied. The additional hardware includes an isothermal block (made of copper) instrumented with a reference thermocouple and a compensation thermocouple. The reference thermocouple is connected to an external data-acquisition system (DAS) through a two-pin thermocouple-alloy hermetic feedthrough connector, but this is the only such <b>connector</b> in the <b>apparatus.</b> The compensation thermocouple is connected to the DAS through two pins of the same ordinary multipin connector that connects the measurement thermocouples to the DAS...|$|R
