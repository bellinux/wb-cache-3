At the start of their tenure, the title was changed to Secret Agent Corrigan.|$|E

2500|$|However {{important}} all {{of these}} aesthetic movements were as antecedents, current ideas about literary criticism derive almost entirely from the new direction taken {{in the early twentieth}} century. Early in the century the school of criticism known as Russian Formalism, and slightly later the New Criticism in Britain and in the United States, came to dominate the study and discussion of literature, in the English-speaking world. Both schools emphasized the close reading of texts, elevating it far above generalizing discussion and speculation about either authorial intention (to say nothing of the author's psychology or biography, which became almost taboo subjects) or <b>reader</b> <b>response.</b> This emphasis on form and precise attention to [...] "the words themselves" [...] has persisted, after the decline of these critical doctrines themselves.|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Self-help manuals are a much {{maligned}} genre: representations {{in popular}} culture and the media emphasise self-help authors’ commercial motivations and readers’ passivity while the academic literature from both the social and health sciences is also uniformly condemnatory. Feminist readings in particular construct popular psychology self-help manuals directed to heterosexual women as “dangerous” to women’s wellbeing {{because of the way}} that the manuals allegedly ignore social context and present problems as residing solely in the individual. This thesis reconsiders such assumptions about self-help manuals and their readers by analysing actual <b>reader</b> <b>responses</b> to a selection of contemporary dating and marriage manuals. It finds important differences between these responses and the preferred reading positions of the manuals: responses varying from resistance to compliance that complicate current critical constructions of these texts’ impact upon heterosexual women readers. The source of <b>reader</b> <b>responses</b> is Amazon. com customer reviews of the selected manuals, which are an underused resource of “lay” or non-professional <b>reader</b> <b>responses.</b> An adapted form of Judith Fetterley’s concept of the “resisting reader” is employed, along with a notion of resistance derived from Michel de Certeau’s theory of reading as everyday practice, to argue for a diversity of <b>reader</b> <b>responses</b> and uses of dating and marriage manuals. While the majority of readers construct readings that correspond to the manuals’ preferred reading positions, some readers construct critical or resistant readings in a manner that resembles the critical or resisting reader of canonical literature described by Fetterley. Furthermore, a small proportion of readers adopt Certeau-like “tactical” reading positions. A modified version of Kenneth J. Gergen’s theory of adapting to a postmodern sense of self, incorporating a poststructuralist understanding of textuality and subjectivity, helps explain how readers adopt different and sometimes simultaneous reading positions of a manual. It is suggested that the active reader approach, which minimises the conflating of actual and textual readers, tempers paternalistic concern about the malevolent effect of dating and marriage manuals directed to heterosexual women while also recognising the need for continued critique of such texts...|$|R

40|$|Gender double {{standards}} continue to affect women's participation in sports. This major research paper investigates the online newspaper {{coverage of the}} Canadian Olympic Women's hockey team on ice celebration that took place after the players {{won a gold medal}} during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics Winter Games. I consider two significant online articles published in the Ottawa Citizenand the online <b>reader</b> <b>responses</b> that appeared as a reply to those articles. Readers expressed concern over these hockey players drinking alcohol, smoking cigars and celebrating on a public ice surface. The readers' unease appears to be indicative of an underlying historically and culturally entrenched opposition to the disruption of white, middle-class norms of feminity. The sentiments expressed by the online <b>reader</b> <b>responses</b> concerning failed role models, public disgrace and classlessness are linked to historical assumptions of female frailty, reproduction, and lesbianism in the context of women's sporting activities today.

2500|$|The art of {{narrative}} is, by definition, an aesthetic enterprise, {{and there are}} a number of artistic elements that typically interact in well-developed stories. Such elements include the essential idea {{of narrative}} structure with identifiable beginnings, middles, and endings, or exposition-development-climax-resolution-denouement, normally constructed into coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality, which includes retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on characters and characterization which is [...] "arguably the most important single component of the novel"; a given heterogloss of different voices dialogically at play [...] "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers"; possesses a narrator or narrator-like voice, which by definition [...] "addresses" [...] and [...] "interacts with" [...] reading audiences (see <b>Reader</b> <b>Response</b> theory); communicates with a Wayne Booth-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, conditioning a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, [...] "arguing" [...] for and against various positions; relies substantially on now-standard aesthetic figuration, particularly including the use of metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony (see Hayden White, [...] for expansion of this idea); is often enmeshed in intertextuality, with copious connections, references, allusions, similarities, parallels, etc. to other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward bildungsroman, a description of identity development with an effort to evince becoming in character and community.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a selection}} of Shelley's major poems m order to delineate the way they invite and resist interpretation. I argue that Shelley's reluctance to supply simplistic meanings is bound up with his search for truth and symptomatic of intellectual honesty. Shelley's texts call upon the <b>reader's</b> <b>responses</b> {{in order to bring}} their meanings into focus. These meanings are dynamically provisional. This method of calling upon the <b>reader's</b> <b>responses</b> is specific to Shelley and is termed 'indeterminacy'. The term is not used primarily in a deconstructive sense 'Indeterminacy' incorporates the indeterminacy in a text, and the indeterminacy of the <b>reader's</b> <b>response</b> that is triggered by the text. The thesis has six chapters. Chapter One addresses Alastor, relating the indeterminacy with which the Poet is presented to the poem's problematic narrative methods. Chapter Two examines the enigma of the Maniac in Julian and Maddalo. The Maniac's soliloquy remains poised between illumination and opacity This ambivalence is linked to Julian's function and the inconclusive ending. Chapter Three examines The Cenci in the light of Shelley's tendency to let the reader assume the protagonist's viewpoint. I argue that, in evaluating Beatrice, we must also evaluate ourselves. Chapter Four examines self- consciousness and bereavement in Adonais. Chapter Five concerns the lyrics to Jane Williams, concentrating on the changing psychological currents of Shelley’s relationship with Jane. The relationship is examined in terms of the tension between poetic symbols and complex human personalities. Chapter Six concerns Rousseau’s ambiguity in The Triumph of Life; this is related to the enigma of human endeavours and the articulation of moral dilemmas that are left unresolved. Throughout I illustrate Shelley's sense of poetry as surrogate-like in that he is continually striving to recreate the absent forms and sensations of experience and often anxious to stress the reductiveness of this attempt...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>reader</b> <b>responses</b> to Catalan identity {{through the}} reception of two Catalan novels in translation: Stone in a Landslide by Maria Barbal and For a Sack of Bones by Lluís- Anton Baulenas. Drawing on theories from Descriptive Translation Studies and cultural and sociological approaches to translation, it examines how representations of Catalan culture and identity are subject to influence from different agents at each stage of the translation and reception process. The thesis explores three areas: the role of translation within Catalan culture in the promotion of Catalan identity; {{the way in which}} this role is relevant to the translation process itself within the target culture; and finally whether the objectives of this role are achieved within the target market. This study offers a new approach {{to the study of the}} reader within Translation Studies, using blogs, online reviews and reading groups in order to gain access to real <b>reader</b> <b>responses</b> to translated literature and offers a methodology by which the study of the representation of culture through translation may be explored.
