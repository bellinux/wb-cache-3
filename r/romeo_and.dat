5|$|Nevertheless, in October 2014, Lois Leveen speculated in The Atlantic {{that the}} {{original}} Shakespeare play did not contain a balcony. The word, balcone, {{did not exist in}} the English language until two years after Shakespeare's death. The balcony was certainly used in Thomas Otway's 1679 play, The History and Fall of Caius Marius, which had borrowed much of its story from <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet and placed the two lovers in a balcony reciting a speech similar to that between <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet. Leveen suggested that during the 18th century, David Garrick chose to use a balcony in his adaptation and revival of <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet and modern adaptations have continued this tradition.|$|E

5|$|Romeo & Juliet: Sealed with a Kiss is a 2006 American {{animated}} romantic fantasy film loosely {{following the}} play <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet by William Shakespeare. The film {{is about two}} star-crossed seals, <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet (voiced by Daniel and Patricia Trippet respectively), who fall in love against the wishes of their warring families. It was released in Europe in mid-2006 and on October 27 in the United States.|$|E
5|$|<b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet {{has been}} adapted {{numerous}} times for stage, film, musical, and opera venues. During the English Restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant. David Garrick's 18th-century version also modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and Georg Benda's Romeo und Julie omitted {{much of the}} action and added a happy ending. Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman's, restored the original text and focused on greater realism. John Gielgud's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama. In the 20th and into the 21st century, the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor's 1935 film <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet is {{sometimes}} {{considered to have}} no unifying theme, save that of young love. <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love. Since it is such an obvious subject of the play, several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance of the play.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{generally}} compare Romeo's short-lived love of Rosaline {{with his}} later love of Juliet. The poetry Shakespeare writes for Rosaline is much weaker {{than that for}} Juliet. Scholars believe Romeo's early experience with Rosaline prepares him for his relationship with Juliet. Later performances of <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet have painted different pictures of <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Rosaline's relationship, as filmmakers have experimented with making Rosaline a more visible character.|$|E
5|$|The {{play has}} been widely adapted for TV and film. In 1960, Peter Ustinov's cold-war stage parody, Romanoff and Juliet was filmed. The 1961 film of West Side Story—set among New York gangs–featured the Jets as white youths, {{equivalent}} to Shakespeare's Montagues while the Sharks, equivalent to the Capulets, are Puerto Rican. The 1994 film The Punk uses both the rough plot outline of <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet and names many {{of the characters in}} ways that reflect the characters in the play. In 2006, Disney's High School Musical made use of <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet plot, placing the two young lovers in different high school cliques instead of feuding families. Film-makers have frequently featured characters performing scenes from <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet. The conceit of dramatising Shakespeare writing <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet has been used several times, including John Madden's 1998 Shakespeare in Love, in which Shakespeare writes the play against the backdrop of his own doomed love affair. An anime series produced by Gonzo and SKY Perfect Well Think, called Romeo x Juliet, was made in 2007 and the 2013 version is the latest English-language film based on the play. In 2013, Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed the Bollywood film Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, a contemporary version of the play which starred Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in leading roles. The film was a commercial and critical success. In February 2014, BroadwayHD released a filmed version of the 2013 Broadway Revival of <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet. The production starred Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad. The film was released internationally in April 2014.|$|E

5|$|However, Shakespeare {{soon began}} to adapt the {{traditional}} styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III {{has its roots in}} the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.|$|E

5|$|<b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet {{may be the}} most-filmed play of all time. The {{most notable}} {{theatrical}} releases were George Cukor's multi-Oscar-nominated 1936 production, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet. The latter two were both, in their time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare film ever. <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet was first filmed in the silent era, by Georges Méliès, although his film is now lost. The play was first heard on film in The Hollywood Revue of 1929, in which John Gilbert recited the balcony scene opposite Norma Shearer.|$|E

5|$|The play is {{sometimes}} given a historical setting, enabling audiences {{to reflect on}} the underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations have been set {{in the midst of the}} Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in the apartheid era in South Africa, and in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt. Similarly, Peter Ustinov's 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, is set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War. A mock-Victorian revisionist version of <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio, and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris's love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Shakespeare's R, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening. A recent comedic musical adaptation was The Second City's The Second City's <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed <b>Romeo</b> <b>and</b> Juliet, set in modern times.|$|E
