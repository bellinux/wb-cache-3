5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> <b>asteroids</b> within {{the orbit of}} Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>asteroid</b> taxonomic types at {{distances between}} 2. 1 and 5. 3 AU is discussed. There are four major, overlapping but compositionally distinct <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> <b>asteroids</b> present within this range of heliocentric distance. The rings, within which 80 % {{of each of}} 4 major taxonomic types (S, C, P, and D) fall, are centered at 2. 6 (0. 7), 2. 9 (0. 8), 3. 4 (0. 7), and 4. 6 (1. 5) AU respectively, where the numbers in parentheses are the ring widths in AU. The overall physical resemblence between the asteroid rings and planetary rings is poor; physically the asteroid belt more closely resembles a debris strewn satellite system. Once the mineralogy of these taxonomic types is established, and complications arising from postaccretionary metamorphism are dealt with, they {{may be used as}} probes of physical conditions in the early solar system. The identification of primordial planetesimals can be used in studying the siblings of the planetesimals responsible for the final stage of planetary accretion...|$|R

40|$|We numerically {{work out}} {{the impact of the}} general {{relativistic}} Lense-Thirring effect on the Earth-Mercury range caused by the gravitomagnetic field of the rotating Sun. The peak-to peak nominal amplitude of the resulting time-varying signal amounts to 1. 75 10 ^ 1 m over a temporal interval 2 yr. Future interplanetary laser ranging facilities should reach a cm-level in ranging to Mercury over comparable timescales; for example, the BepiColombo mission, to be launched in 2014, should reach a 4. 5 - 10 cm level over 1 - 8 yr. We looked also at other Newtonian (solar quadrupole mass moment, <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> the minor <b>asteroids,</b> Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, Trans-Neptunian Objects) and post-Newtonian (gravitoelectric Schwarzschild solar field) dynamical effects on the Earth-Mercury range. They act as sources of systematic errors for the Lense-Thirring signal which, in turn, if not properly modeled, may bias the recovery of some key parameters of such other dynamical features of motion. Their nominal peak-to-peak amplitudes are as large as 4 10 ^ 5 m (Schwarzschild), 3 10 ^ 2 m (Sun's quadrupole), 8 10 ^ 1 m (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta), 4 m (<b>ring</b> <b>of</b> minor <b>asteroids),</b> 8 10 ^- 1 m (Trans-Neptunian Objects). Their temporal patterns are different with respect to that of the gravitomagnetic signal. Comment: LaTex 2 e, 19 pages, 2 tables, 6 figures.

40|$|Abstract—We {{used more}} than 250 000 high-precision American and Russian radar {{observations}} of the inner planets and spacecraft obtained in the period 1961 – 2003 to test the relativistic parameters and to estimate the solar oblateness. Our analysis of the observations {{was based on the}} EPM ephemerides of the Institute of Applied Astronomy, Russian Academy of Sciences, constructed by the simultaneous numerical integration of the equations of motion for the nine major planets, the Sun, and the Moon in the post-Newtonian approximation. The gravitational noise introduced by asteroids into the orbits of the inner planets was reduced significantly by including 301 large asteroids and the perturbations from the massive <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> small <b>asteroids</b> in the simultaneous integration of the equations of motion. Since the post-Newtonian parameters and the solar oblateness produce various secular and periodic effects in the orbital elements of all planets, these were estimated from the simultaneous solution: the post-Newtonian parameters are β = 1. 0000 ± 0. 0001 and γ = 0. 9999 ± 0. 0002, the gravitational quadrupole moment of the Sun is J 2 = (1. 9 ± 0. 3) × 10 − 7, and the variation of the gravitational constant is Ġ/G = (− 2 ± 5) × 10 − 14 yr− 1. The results obtained show a remarkable correspondence of the planetary motions and the propagation of light to General Relativity and narrow significantly the range of possible values for alternative theories of gravitation. c © 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the thermal-infrared spectra region for investigations <b>of</b> <b>asteroids</b> lies traditionally in the dependence of the thermal emission <b>of</b> an <b>asteroid</b> on its visual albedo and size.

40|$|The {{infrared}} excess {{around the}} white dwarf G 29 - 38 {{can be explained by}} emission from an opaque flat <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> dust with an inner radius 0. 14 of the radius of the Sun and an outer radius approximately equal to the Sun's.
