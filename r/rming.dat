40|$|Abstract: Transgender {{people have}} a gender {{identity}} diff erent from their birth- assigned sex. Transgender people may seek gender- affi <b>rming</b> surgeries to align their body with their identifi ed gender. With increasing visibility of transgender identities, and recognition {{of the importance of}} gender- affi <b>rming</b> care, has come a policy shift toward mandated coverage or provision of blanket exclusions of these procedures by insurance companies and Medicaid. Th e World Professional Association for Transgender Health provides guidance to mental health professionals evaluating patients for gender- affi <b>rming</b> surgeries, including making a diagnosis and assessing for capacity to consent. However the expansion of covered gender-affi <b>rming</b> surgeries to safety- net populations has highlighted the need for an expanded presurgical process which includes a psychosocial assessment and care navigation. Th e proposed framework expands the preoperative assessment to include these components, and can be used to guide both health systems and insurance providers in the development of transgender medicine programs.

Xylem sap zeatin riboside concentration and shoot auxin levels in <b>rms</b> 5 plants have also been compared with <b>rms</b> 1 and wild type (WT). <b>Rms</b> 1 and <b>Rms</b> 5 appear to act closely at the biochemical or cellular level to control branching, because branching was inhibited in reciprocal epicotyl grafts between <b>rms</b> 5 or <b>rms</b> 1 and WT plants, but not inhibited in reciprocal grafts between <b>rms</b> 5 and <b>rms</b> 1 seedlings. The weakly transgressive or slightly additive phenotype of the <b>rms</b> 1 <b>rms</b> 5 double mutant provides further evidence for this interaction. Like <b>rms</b> 1, <b>rms</b> 5 rootstocks have reduced xylem sap cytokinin concentrations, and <b>rms</b> 5 shoots do not appear deficient in indole- 3 -acetic acid or 4 -chloroindole- 3 -acetic acid. <b>Rms</b> 1 and <b>Rms</b> 5 are similar in their interaction with other <b>Rms</b> genes.

40|$|We analyze {{an economy}} where banks are {{uncertain}} about 8 ̆ 5 rms in-vestment opportunities and, as a result, credit tightness due to banks pessimistic beliefs {{can result in}} excessive risk-taking.

In this study, a fingerprint database of 27 rice varieties including commercially important traditional Basmati (TB), cross-bred (evolved) Basmati and some non-Basmati indica rice varieties has been prepared using 50 microsatellite markers. A total of 271 electromorphs (alleles) were detected at 50 SSR (simple sequence repeat) loci, 92 of which were observed only in 2 – 10 of the 16 Basmati rice varieties.
