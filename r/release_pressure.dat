25|$|White fuming {{nitric acid}}, pure nitric acid or WFNA, {{is very close}} to {{anhydrous}} nitric acid. It is available as 99.9% nitric acid by assay. One specification for white fuming nitric acid is that it has a maximum of 2% water and a maximum of 0.5% dissolved NO2. Anhydrous nitric acid has a density of 1.513g/cm3 and has the approximate concentration of 24 molar. Anhydrous nitric acid is a colorless mobile liquid with a density of 1.512g/cm3, which solidifies at −42°C to form white crystals. As it decomposes to NO2 and water, it obtains a yellow tint. It boils at 83°C. It is usually stored in a glass shatterproof amber bottle with twice the volume of head space to allow for pressure build up, but even with those precautions the bottle must be vented monthly to <b>release</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E

25|$|During operation, the boiler's {{water level}} is {{constantly}} monitored, normally via a transparent tube {{referred to as}} a sight glass, or with a gauge. Maintaining a proper water level is central to the efficient and safe operation of the boiler. If the water level is too high, steam production is decreased, efficiency is lost and in extreme cases, water will be carried out with the steam into the cylinders, possibly causing mechanical damage. More seriously, if the water level gets too low, the crown (top) and/or side sheets of the firebox may become exposed. Without sufficient water to absorb the heat of combustion, the firebox sheets may soften and melt, with the possible result of high-pressure steam being ejected with tremendous force through the firebox and into the locomotive's cab. The development of the fusible plug, a device to <b>release</b> <b>pressure</b> in conditions of excessively high temperature and low water levels was intended to protect against this occurrence.|$|E

50|$|The {{technology}} of protection can {{range in price}} dramatically but where the type of device is rational to use, would typically be from least to most expensive solutions: explosion doors and vents (dependent on quantities and common denominators, either may end up the wise price choice); inerting: explosion suppression; isolation - or combinations of same. To focus on the most cost effective, doors typically have lower <b>release</b> <b>pressure</b> capabilities; are not susceptible to fatigue failures or subject to changing release pressures with changes in temperature, as “rupture membrane” type are; capable of leak tight service; service temperatures of up to 2,000°F; and can be more cost effective in small quantities. Rupture membrane type vents can provide a leak tight seal more readily in most cases; have a relatively broad tolerance on their <b>release</b> <b>pressure</b> and are more readily incorporated into systems with discharge ducts.|$|E
