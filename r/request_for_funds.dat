25|$|The civil-rights {{movement}} on campus also picked up momentum and visibility. In spring 1969, shortly before Morgan's retirement, Mexican-American and African-American student organizations presented {{a list of}} demands to university officials primarily urging increased recruitment of minority students and employees. The demonstrators' occupation of the Administration Building continued to the front lawn of Morgan's home. Students and university representatives took their concerns to state officials, but Colorado legislators rejected a subsequent university <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>funds</b> to support minority recruitment.|$|E

500|$|Due {{to colonial}} {{efforts to keep}} the {{existence}} of this potential war asset secret from the British, the colonial records concerning the Turtle are often short and cryptic. Most of the records that do exist concern Bushnell’s <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>funds.</b> Bushnell met with Jonathan Trumbull, the governor of Connecticut, during 1771 seeking financial support. Trumbull also sent requests to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson, who was an inventor himself, was intrigued by the possibilities while Washington remained skeptical of devoting funds from the Continental Army, whose funding was already being stretched. Ultimately, Washington was able to provide some funds possibly due to Trumbull’s influence.|$|E
2500|$|Copeau's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>funds</b> and {{the plays}} failed to garner the needed {{financial}} support {{and he continued}} his lectures both in France and Belgium. At this point both actors and apprentices were given their freedom to leave and, given his reduced financial status, he devised a new approach. After the departure {{of some of the}} student actors and teachers, Copeau began work with his reduced troupe on the [...] "New Comedy", an attempt to reproduce the Italian commedia dell'arte with masks and an acting style [...] based on improvisation. He composed a text, Le Veuf ("The Widower"), that the actors began to rehearse on a simple platform in the main hall at Morteuil. The residents of the surrounding villages, now accustomed to the fanciful lives of the actors, their costumes and their parading through their towns, baptized them les Copiaus.|$|E

5000|$|The {{government}} {{is responsible for}} the economic and financial policy of the French Republic, must authorise all expenditures made by each ministry, and also manage all revenue.

Each minister must prepare a list of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>funds</b> annually, and submit it to the Budget Ministry. This ministry decides whether to grant or deny <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding</b> by ministers. The ministry also calculates the state budget for the coming year.

2500|$|Limited {{automotive}} {{production was}} consolidated at the company's last remaining production facility in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, which {{had always been}} profitable and where Studebaker produced cars until March 1966 {{under the leadership of}} Gordon Grundy. It was projected that the Canadian operation could break even on production of about 20,000 cars a year, and Studebaker's announced goal was 30,000–40,000 1965 models. While 1965 production was just shy of the 20,000 figure, the company's directors felt that the small profits were not enough to justify continued investment. Rejecting Grundy's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>funds</b> to tool up for 1967 models, Studebaker left the automobile business on March 17, 1966 after an announcement on March 4. A turquoise and white Cruiser sedan was the last of fewer than 9,000 1966 models manufactured. In reality, the move to Canada had been a tactic by which production could be slowly wound down and remaining dealer franchise obligations honored. [...] 1965 and 1966 Studebaker cars used [...] "McKinnon" [...] engines sourced from General Motors Canada Limited, which were based on Chevrolet's 230-cubic-inch six-cylinder and 283-cubic-inch V8 engines when Studebaker-built engines were no longer available.|$|E
60|$|The Sheik named a sum {{that was}} rather less exorbitant than the Hon. Morison had anticipated. The latter {{nodded his head}} in token of his entire {{willingness}} to pay. He would have promised a sum far beyond his resources just as readily, for {{he had no intention}} of paying anything--his one reason for seeming to comply with The Sheik's demands was that the wait for the coming of the ransom money would give him the time and the opportunity to free Meriem if he found that she wished to be freed. The Arab's statement that he was her father naturally raised the question in the Hon. Morison's mind as to precisely what the girl's attitude toward escape might be. It seemed, of course, preposterous that this fair and beautiful young woman should prefer to remain in the filthy douar of an illiterate old Arab rather than return to the comforts, luxuries, and congenial associations of the hospitable African bungalow from which the Hon. Morison had tricked her. The man flushed at the thought of his duplicity which these recollections aroused--thoughts which were interrupted by The Sheik, who instructed the Hon. Morison to write a letter to the British consul at Algiers, dictating the exact phraseology of it with a fluency that indicated to his captive that this was not the first time the old rascal had had occasion to negotiate with English relatives for the ransom of a kinsman. Baynes demurred when he saw that the letter was addressed to the consul at Algiers, saying that it would require the better part of a year to get the money back to him; but The Sheik would not listen to Baynes' plan to send a messenger directly to the nearest coast town, and from there communicate with the nearest cable station, sending the Hon. Morison's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>funds</b> straight to his own solicitors. No, The Sheik was cautious and wary. He knew his own plan had worked well in the past. In the other were too many untried elements. He was in no hurry for the money--he could wait a year, or two years if necessary; but it should not require over six months. He turned to one of the Arabs who had been standing behind him and gave the fellow instructions in relation to the prisoner.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Pharmacovigilance {{programmes}} {{can monitor}} and help ensure the safe use of medicines {{that are critical}} to the success of global public health programmes. The widespread deployment of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) by national malaria control programmes as part of the overall Global Malaria Action Plan for malaria control to elimination and eradication makes ACT an excellent candidate for pharmacovigilance activities. In 2008, The Roll Back Malaria partnership issued guidelines for inclusion of pharmacovigilance in Global Fund and other related proposals. In light of this recommendation and the rapid scale-up of ACT worldwide, an analysis of Global Fund Round 8 proposals and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) 2009 Malaria Operational Plans was conducted to assess if and how pharmacovigilance has been incorporated into countries' national malaria plans and donor budget requests. Methods The Global Fund - Malaria Round 8 proposals for the 26 countries and the PMI Malaria Operational Plans (MOPs) for fiscal year 2009 for the 15 countries that were approved and received funding from either the Global Fund - Malaria Round 8 or PMI were accessed through the programme websites. The analysis consisted of conducting word counts and key word in context analyses of each proposal and plan. Results Twelve out of 26 (46 %) of the Global Fund proposals mentioned that established pharmacovigilance systems were present in their countries. Four of the fifteen PMI MOPs (27 %) mentioned that established pharmacovigilance systems were present in their countries. Only seven of the 26 (27 %) Global Fund proposals included a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> new or current pharmacovigilance activities. Seven of 15 (47 %) MOPs included a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> pharmacovigilance activities. Conclusions There were relatively few <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> pharmacovigilance activities, demonstrating a lack of emphasis placed on pharmacovigilance systems in recipient countries. The findings stress the need for more active direction to strengthen active surveillance and passive adverse event reporting systems to augment the issuance of guidance documents. </p...|$|R
