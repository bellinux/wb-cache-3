5|$|In 1936, Chandler urged {{implementation}} of the state's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal <b>Rural</b> <b>Electrification</b> Act. He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment and in 1938, proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state's assistance rolls. He increased funding to the state's hospitals and asylums, and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937. Following the flood, Chandler convinced the legislature to construct a new reformatory at La Grange.|$|E

40|$|Summary. [...] This paper {{describes}} regulatory {{approaches to}} stimulating {{provision of electricity}} services among rural off-grid populations in developing countries using conventional and renewable energy sources. Six case studies draw upon the emerging experience from several countries and projects by the World Bank, UN Development Program, and Global Environment Facility. Cases describe concession and institutional arrangements, subsidies, and service standards and monitoring. The concession approach for <b>rural</b> off-grid <b>electrification</b> is relatively recent in rural development practice. Very few implementation lessons are yet available. Still, early experience {{can serve as a}} guide to regulators, firms, and development institutions seeking to promote <b>rural</b> off-grid <b>electrification...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Commission {{recommended}} {{that the federal government}} assume responsibility for financing social programs such as old-age pensions and unemployment insurance. It also argued that Ottawa should establish equity among provinces and that redistribution of federal tax revenues should be based on need, an idea that became central to Macdonald's thinking about federal-provincial relations. Among other things, the Commission called on the Macdonald government to continue paving roads; to undertake a program of <b>rural</b> <b>electrification</b> to keep young people on family farms; and, to establish a professional civil service that would defend Nova Scotia's interests against federal bureaucrats in Ottawa.|$|E

He supported expansion of agricultural research and reorganization of the Farm Security Administration. He endorsed conservation and wildlife programs and additional funding to federal parks. He supported civil rights legislation, including bans on lynching and poll taxes. He opposed the Taft-Hartley Act and voted to disband the House Un-American Activities Committee.

40|$|Abstract — Hybrid PV-wind {{generation}} shows higher availability {{as compared}} to PV or wind alone. For <b>rural</b> <b>electrifications,</b> researches are focused on hybrid power system which provides sustainable power. The variable voltage and frequency of the self excited induction generator (SEIG) is rectified through Vienna rectifier (three switches) to the required D. C voltage level and fed to common D. C bus. The variable output voltage of PV module is controlled by DC/DC converter using proposed fuzzy logic controller and fed to common D. C bus. The DC bus collects the total power from the wind and photovoltaic system and used {{to charge the battery}} as well as to supply the A. C loads through inverter. A dynamic mathematical model and MATLAB simulations for the entire scheme is presented. Results from the simulations and experimental tests bring out the suitability of the proposed hybrid scheme in remote areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{photovoltaic}} (PV) technology {{potential for}} Jordan is high, {{based on the}} fact that many remote and isolated sites are located far away from the national electric grid and cannot be connected to it in the near future. Therefore, a <b>rural</b> PV <b>electrification</b> program [...] driven by quality-of-life improvement for the users [...] was launched in Jordan in 2002. An important element of the program is the access of low-income, rural consumers to essential electricity. This paper discusses and analyses the first stage of this program that is the electrification of a remote and small Jordanian village. Nine PV solar home systems (SHS) were installed in this village in order to provide lighting and power for radio and television. Feed back from the users of the installed systems indicates that the PV based electricity has been providing very satisfactory service to the consumers, and that it is an appropriate technology suitable for dissemination in the rural Jordanian areas. <b>Rural</b> photovoltaic <b>electrification</b> Solar home system Jordan...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{operating}} principle of Photovoltaic device is {{the conversion of}} solar irradiation into electricity. There are several applications of this principle. In Nigeria, most solar PV projects are designed for street lighting, water pumping and general stand-alone/minigrid <b>rural</b> <b>electrifications.</b> However, several solar PV projects being installed {{in various parts of}} this country fail to meet the minimum life-span due to a number of limiting factors. These include poor or improper fundamental design, use of sub-standard components, adoption of poor installation procedure by inexperienced personnel, bad construction/civil works among other factors. This has become a problem in the country and many are beginning to feel disgusted with solar PV projects as the heavy investments in such projects {{do not seem to be}} commensurate with their performances and satisfactions derivable. This paper therefore presents an overview of the performances of solar PV projects and a concise procedural approach to the implementation of standard solar PV projects in the country. In-depth analysis of performances of existing systems was also considered and the limiting factors identified with specific recommendations for improvement. We believe that if power projects are designed and executed properly by experienced technical experts, using the appropriate components and best technical procedures, standard PV projects with maximum performance output could be achieved...|$|R
