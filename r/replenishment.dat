5|$|<b>Replenishment</b> ships, {{known as}} oilers in the United States and fleet tankers in Commonwealth countries, are ships {{that can provide}} oil {{products}} to naval vessels while on the move. This process, called underway <b>replenishment,</b> extends {{the length of time}} a naval vessel can stay at sea, as well as her effective range. Prior to underway <b>replenishment,</b> naval vessels had to enter a port or anchor to take on fuel. In addition to fuel, <b>replenishment</b> ships may also deliver water, ammunition, rations, stores and personnel.|$|E
5|$|Begun in 1939, {{plans were}} far enough along that tests were {{conducted}} with the main armament and against the underwater protection. Even though the ships were approved for construction under a 1942 fleet <b>replenishment</b> program, the prioritizing of aircraft carriers and smaller ships due to the war, followed by Japan's defeat, killed any chance of the B-65's construction.|$|E
5|$|Some sub-types of oil tankers {{have evolved}} to meet {{specific}} military and economic needs. These sub-types include naval <b>replenishment</b> ships, oil-bulk-ore combination carriers, floating storage and offloading units (FSOs) and floating production storage and offloading units (FPSOs).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a new decision rule for emergency <b>replenishments</b> in an inventory system. The decision rule is a generalization {{of a previous}} decision rule suggested and evaluated in Axsater (2003, 2007). An improvement step is added to this rule and this often means considerably better performance. The decisions are based on complete information about the system state. An advantage with our decision rule is its generality. It is possible to handle batch ordering, compound Poisson demand and emergency <b>replenishments</b> that take time. The decision rule has also a performance guarantee {{in the sense that}} emergency <b>replenishments</b> will always lead to lower expected costs. The rule can also be used in connection with lateral transshipments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|The CASG is not {{responsible}} for directly supplying deployed ADF units; this {{is the responsibility of}} the Joint Logistics Command and the single service logistic units. These units include the Navy's Strategic Command and <b>replenishment</b> ships, the Army's 17th Combat Service Support Brigade and Combat Service Support Battalions, and the Combat Support Group RAAF.|$|E
5|$|The I-351-class {{submarines}} {{were ordered}} under the 5th Fleet <b>Replenishment</b> Program of 1942 to support IJN flying boats {{in areas where}} there were no shore facilities and seaplane tenders could not operate. They were designed to support up to three flying boats with fuel, ammunition, water and even replacement aircrew.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{other reasons for}} the Syrian withdrawal. The 3rd Battalion from the Palmach's Yiftach Brigade had been sent by boat during the {{previous}} night across the sea to Ein Gev, planning to assault and capture Kafr Harib. It was, noticed and shelled by the Syrians, {{but one of the}} companies managed to climb up the Golan. It carried out a smaller raid at dawn, bombing water carriers and threatening the Syrian 1st Brigade's line of communications. The second reason was that they were running out of ammunition: Husni al-Za'im had been promised <b>replenishment,</b> and attacked Degania short of ammunition. Za'im ordered a withdrawal when his troops ran out of ammunition. The <b>replenishment</b> was instead sent to the 2nd Brigade further north. The Israelis were not aware of this, and attributed the Syrian withdrawal to surprise at the Israeli artillery fire.|$|E
50|$|During 1988, Caloosahatchee {{made her}} last {{deployment}} to the Mediterranean Sea, where she recorded 191 underway <b>replenishments.</b> In 1989, she participated in exercise UNITAS XXX {{and crossed the}} equator.|$|R
50|$|Throughout June 1996, Rainier {{participated in}} Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC-96) {{exercise}} where numerous FAS, Vertical <b>Replenishments</b> (VERTREP) and CONSOL's {{were conducted with}} US, Australian, Canadian and Japanese ships.|$|R

5|$|After {{completing}} its {{strikes on}} the Tokyo region, the Allied fleet conducted an at-sea <b>replenishment</b> from 21 to 23 July before attacking Kure and the Inland Sea from the 24th to the 28th of the month. On {{the night of}} 24/25 July, CruDiv17 patrolled the Kii Channel and bombarded the naval seaplane base at Kushimoto, a landing field near Cape Shionomisaki, and a radio station. This attack lasted for only four minutes and caused little damage.|$|E
5|$|From 3 January to 1 March 1945, Portland {{participated in}} the {{operations}} at Lingayen Gulf and Corregidor. Arriving off Lingayen Gulf on 5 January, and bombarding the vicinity of Cape Bolinao, she entered the Gulf the same day and commenced bombardment of the eastern shore but discontinued immediately when a large wave of Japanese kamikaze planes approached. Portland entered Manila Bay on 15 February, and bombarded the south shore of Corregidor in preparation for landings there. She returned to Leyte Gulf on 1 March for repairs and <b>replenishment,</b> having seen five months of continuous action.|$|E
5|$|Some {{specialized}} {{types of}} oil tankers have evolved. One {{of these is}} the naval <b>replenishment</b> oiler, a tanker which can fuel a moving vessel. Combination ore-bulk-oil carriers and permanently moored floating storage units are two other variations on the standard oil tanker design. Oil tankers have been involved in a number of damaging and high-profile oil spills. As a result, they are subject to stringent design and operational regulations.|$|E
50|$|By 4 February 1968, Niagara Falls {{completed}} her shakedown availability and continued preparations {{for her first}} deployment. She steamed for WestPac on 28 March, arrived at Subic Bay on 14 April, and there conducted {{the first of many}} <b>replenishments.</b>|$|R
50|$|In February 1967, Rainier resumed her annual {{deployments}} {{to provide}} underway logistic {{support to the}} 7th Fleet. By 16 September, the date of her last at-sea munitions transfer on that tour, she had transferred 13,000 tons during 204 underway <b>replenishments.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-echelon distribution inventory {{system with a}} central warehouse {{and a number of}} retailers. There is direct customer demand also at the warehouse. If this upstream demand requires a high service, it may be advantageous to give higher priority to customer orders compared to retailer <b>replenishments.</b> We suggest and evaluate techniques for handling this situation. One technique means that we have an extra separate stock point for the direct customer demand at the warehouse. Another technique means that we apply a so-called critical level policy at the warehouse, i. e., if the stock on hand at the warehouse is {{less than or equal to}} the critical level, retailer <b>replenishments</b> are backordered...|$|R
5|$|Wisconsin {{ultimately}} {{put into}} Leyte Gulf and dropped anchor there on 13 June for repairs and <b>replenishment.</b> Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft {{on the ground}} and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area. Wisconsin and the other ships made no attempt whatsoever to conceal the location of their armada, {{due in large part to}} a weak Japanese response to their presence.|$|E
5|$|After riding {{at anchor}} for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved {{out of the}} water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and <b>replenishment</b> were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Decisions {{made during}} the next two days had a {{dramatic}} impact on the experience of Air Group 18 at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. TG 38.1 was detached and sent to Ulithi for <b>replenishment</b> and rearmament after two weeks of continuous operations against Okinawa and the Ryukyus Islands. USS Bunker Hill and Hancock were also detached from TG 38.2 at this time, leaving Intrepid the sole Essex-class aircraft carrier in its group. When Admiral Takeo Kurita's Center Force was sighted entering the Sibuyan Sea on October 24, the only task group readily available to strike was the shorthanded TG 38.2.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{assesses the}} {{multilateral}} development financing {{system in the}} light of the <b>replenishments</b> of three key funds in 2013. It argues that the <b>replenishments</b> showed strong continuing support for each institution, but identifies challenges emerging from the reliance on traditional donors and the limited success in engaging major emerging economies. It underlines the significance of recent and prospective falls in the recipient client base, and notes the shifting balance between performance and need/fragility in determining multilateral aid allocations. The paper argues that both general and special purpose funds have their place, but that to sustain ownership in the more aid-dependent countries a 'think twice' policy remains appropriate before establishment of new special purpose funds...|$|R
5000|$|The first [...] "Buffalo" [...] Landing Vehicle Tracked {{could hold}} 24 men or 4,500 pounds (2,000 kg) of cargo. Originally {{intended}} to carry <b>replenishments</b> from ships ashore, they lacked armour protection and their tracks and suspension were unreliable when used on hard terrain.|$|R
50|$|At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Diniz was disqualified {{from the}} 50 km walk {{immediately}} {{after his arrival}} {{at the finish line}} in eighth position for taking a bottle of water at the 38th kilometer mark outside a zone provided for water <b>replenishments.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the House of Representatives {{debate on}} the report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, stated that he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons {{for the presence of}} water after each <b>replenishment,</b> and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended to require fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that his Department did not intend to amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one engine inoperative in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|Following the victory, Maryland {{patrolled the}} {{southern}} approaches to Surigao Strait until 29 October; she then steamed for the Admiralty Isles for brief <b>replenishment</b> and resumed patrol duty around Leyte on 16 November, protecting the landing forces from continued Japanese air attacks. On 29 November, during another Japanese air attack, a kamikaze aircraft surprised and struck Maryland. The aircraft crashed into Maryland between Turrets No. 1 and 2, piercing the forecastle, main, and armored decks and blowing {{a hole in}} the 4-inch steel, causing extensive damage and starting fires. In all, 31 men were killed and 30 wounded in the attack, and the medical department was destroyed but still functional.|$|E
5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of <b>replenishment</b> is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs {{benefit from}} feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in {{addition}} to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa {{as a source for}} <b>replenishment</b> of protein, amino acids, and fiber.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial <b>replenishment</b> with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{returned}} to the key task of direct support to troops at Kosong 7 June. On her first mission, she completely destroyed two gun positions, an observation post, and their supporting trenches, then stood by on call for further aid. She then sailed back to Wonsan for a day-long bombardment 24 June, aimed at guns placed in caves. The results were excellent, with eight direct hits on three caves, one cave demolished, and four others closed. Next day she {{returned to}} troop support at Kosong, her assignment until 10 July, aside from necessary withdrawal for <b>replenishment.</b>|$|E
