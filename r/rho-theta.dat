50|$|This {{situation}} was {{exacerbated by the}} workload problems of the Air Traffic Controllers Association (ATCA), under its executive director Francis McDermott, whose members were forced to use radar data on aircraft positions, relaying those positions by radio to the aircraft from their control locations. An example of the problem, cited by experts, was the collision of a Douglas DC8 and a Lockheed Constellation over Staten Island, New York, that—according to some experts—could have been avoided if the aircraft had been Decca-equipped and could not only have determined their positions more precisely but would not have suffered from the <b>rho-theta</b> position errors inherent in VOR/DME.|$|E

40|$|Investigations {{have been}} {{conducted}} regarding the techniques required for Loran-C navigation with application to the general-aviation pilot. The goal has been to produce prototype equipment for flight evaluation which will provide enroute navigation in both latitude-longitude and <b>rho-theta</b> coordinates and to evaluate the nonprecision approach capabilities of such equipment. In connection with the considered project, a prototype Loran-C receiver has been flight-tested {{using a variety of}} flight paths, with and without simultaneous ground radar position data collection. Attention is given to a receiver overview, an antenna preamplifier/coupler, the Loran-C receiver RF processor, the tracking loop hardware, tracking loop programming, video output, the laboratory and flight evaluation, and work currently in progress...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 29 -November 02, 1990 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaDatron Systems Inc. has {{developed}} a high efficiency autotrack feed series which uses a tracking mode coupler to generate track error signals. The mode coupler allows {{the use of a}} corrugated feed horn in doubly shaped or cassegrain geometries or a scaler ring feed in prime focus reflectors, to achieve extremely high overall antenna efficiencies. The low insertion loss of the mode coupler allows the incorporation of autotrack capability in an antenna system without degradation of the overall G/T or EIRP. Another feature of this feed is the excellent cross talk performance. The mode coupler is a <b>rho-theta</b> type tracker and as such is suitable for use in both single channel monopulse and equivalent full three channel monopulse autotrack applications. Datron has built, installed, and tested feeds of this type at S, C, and X band frequencies and is currently under contract to develop a dual K/Q band version. Datron has also integrated other components into the mode coupler feed assembly such as: amplifiers, filters, diplexers, couplers, downconverters, switches, noise sources, etc...|$|E
40|$|The LVLASO Flight Demonstration of ASTA {{concepts}} (FDAC) integrates NASA-Langley's electronic moving map {{display and}} Transport Systems Research Vehicle (TSRV) (a modified Boeing 737 aircraft); ARINC's VHF data link, GPS ground station, and automated controller workstation; and Norden's surface radar/airport movement safety system. Aircraft location is shown on the electronic map display in the cockpit. An approved taxi route {{as well as other}} aircraft and surface traffic are also displayed. An Ashtech Z 12 Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver on the TSRV estimates the aircraft's position. In Differential mode (DSPS), the Ashtech receiver accepts differential C/A code pseudorange corrections from a GPS ground station. The GPS ground station provides corrections up to ten satellites. The corrections are transmitted on a VHF data link at a 1 Hz. rate using the RTCM- 104 format. DGPS position estimates will be within 5 meters of actual aircraft position. DGPS position estimates are blended with position, velocity, acceleration, and heading data from the TSRV Air Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS). The ADIRS data is accurate in the short-term, but drifts over time. The DGPS data is used to keep the ADIRS position accurate. Ownship position, velocity, heading, and turn rate are sent at a 20 Hz. rate to the electronic map display. Airport traffic is detected by the airport surface radar system. Aircraft and vehicles such as fuel trucks and baggage carts are detected. The traffic's location, velocity, and heading are sent to the TSRV. To prevent traffic symbology from jumping each second when a location update arrives, velocity and heading are used to predict a new traffic location for each display update. Possible runway incursions and collisions can be shown on the electronic map. Integrating the different systems used in the FDAC requires attention to the underlying coordinate systems. The airport diagram displayed on the electronic map is obtained from published navigational charts. The charts reference the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27) or a local state-plane coordinate system. GPS uses the World Geodetic Standard of 1984 (WGS 84). Both NAD 27 and WGS 84 model the Earth as an ellipsoid, however, they use a different origin and different size ellipsoids. Latitudes and longitudes given in these systems can be converted to a Cartesian system with the origin at the Earth's center. The surface radar detects traffic in a locally-level, <b>rho-theta</b> coordiante system. The electronic airport diagram is stored using a flat XY coordinate system. The map origin is at the tower and is referenced as True North up. All ownship and other traffic positions must be converted to the electronic map's frame of reference for display...|$|E
