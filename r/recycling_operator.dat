40|$|Deploying item-level {{radio-frequency}} identification (RFID) to recycling operations will foster {{the implementation of}} innovative sorting and management methodologies at a recycling operator' s site and therefore decrease {{the environmental impacts of}} end-of-life processes. This paper focuses on end-of-life processes of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and demonstrates the technical feasibility of an increased recovery performance with a concomitant reduction of total energy consumption at a <b>recycling</b> <b>operator</b> 's site. Today, the handling and recycling of high volumes of WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) at recycling facilities is still very time-consuming and cost-intensive. In transmitting adequate information on the composition of appliances with an appropriate RFID system, first, the identification and sorting will be automated, and second, the dismantling processes will be assisted by information of how the device should be treated optimally. This paper discusses the technical feasibility of RFID technology in the context of WEEE recycling, based on preliminary results of a test installation at a pilot plant...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years {{corporations}} and governments {{have developed a}} growing appreciation {{of the need for}} "sustainability" and have worked the term into their goals, strategy and mission statements. Despite extensive efforts to define the term, there is still little clarity on how to move toward sustainability or measure improvements. Further advances toward sustainability will require system specific metrics to assess both current performance and the impact of operational, technological or regulatory changes on that performance. Not only are there currently few operational metrics by which to practically assess progress toward sustainability, there is also very little understanding of how to judge the effectiveness of such metrics. Electronics recycling is used in this thesis as a case problem in developing and evaluating system specific performance metrics for sustainability. Electronics recycling is a growing national and international concern due to the increasing volume of waste, the potential toxicity of the scrap, and reports of improper handling and disposal. Despite this concern, there is limited understanding about the electronics recycling system. There is a need for systematic ways to describe system functioning and quantitative methods to assess system performance. Existing evaluations of eco-efficiency or sustainability are either too aggregated to guide operational decisions or too complex and data intensive to be performed {{in the context of a}} low-margin system. A range of performance metrics were developed and assessed for several electronics <b>recycling</b> <b>operators.</b> These included measures of resource recovery and environmental performance. (cont.) These metrics were assessed for their ability to provide insights on resource efficiency comparable to more complex indicators, with minimal data required beyond that collected for normal business operations. The informative value of these metrics, their ability to capture system behavior, and the similarity between evaluations using different metrics were compared. Recovery effectiveness results for three US Electronic <b>recycling</b> <b>operators</b> are presented based on several quantitative indicators. Results show that current simple measures such as "mass percent to landfill" are not sufficient to fully assess system performance. Composite indicators of systems performance can provide valuable insights even using currently available data collected by operators for business purposes. y Jennifer Robinson Atlee. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In Australia, waste {{generated}} from construction and building demolition work constitutes about 44 % {{of the total}} amount each year. Consequently, it has created a serious waste management problem. The State Governments of Victoria and New South Wales have been pushing {{for the use of}} recycled materials; they have promulgated specifications for the use of recycled aggregate from construction and related waste. However, in Queensland, similar specifications are not available, which explains the lack of research conducted in this important area. This paper presents an evaluation of the prevailing waste recycling methods used in Queensland. Nine sites have been visited, including two construction sites, three demolition sites, three recycling plants and one landfill in Southeast Queensland. Difficulties encountered by the <b>recycling</b> <b>operators</b> and their associates from these site visits are investigated. One of the major barriers is that the local councils disallow the use of recycled materials in construction activities! To help improve the situations, state and local authorities should implement policies encourage the use of recycled construction waste. This can be done by: (i) developing specification for the use of recycled materials; and (ii) increasing landfill disposal charges for construction and building companies to discourage dumping.

40|$|From {{resource}} prospective, {{building and}} construction sector is responsible for more than third of global resource consumption, including 12 % of the fresh water use and its generation of solid waste {{is estimated to be}} 40 % of the total waste volume. At European level, construction and demolition waste is the largest waste stream representing one third of all waste produced in EU. Therefore the resource efficiency and management is crucial in building construction. A very significant part of the Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) is not recycled today. Also a very limited part is used as a recycled content in the construction and building products and materials. This lack is mainly due to heterogeneity and dispersion of waste flows decreasing efficiency and economic viability of recycling. To address this issue, VALDEM project (funded by Interreg FWVL European Fund) aims to overcome barriers to increase up-cycling applications. The project focuses its activities in North of France, Flanders and Walloon regions (Belgium), and stands out from usual approaches by its cross-border view of circular economy. VALDEM aims, on one hand, to optimize buildings end of life management by developing new deconstruction, sorting and recycling processes to produce uniform and accessible material flows. On the other hand, the project aims at increasing recycling and generating high quality secondary materials (concrete and other flows) to be used in future buildings within an up cycling prospective. And finally it aims at validating the solutions from technical, scientific, economic and environmental point of view. The Environmental assessment, based on LCA, consists of identifying hotspots and key aspects to prioritize the efforts of different economic actors. As a first step, an LCA meta-analysis is conducted to provide an environmental picture for different potential activities within the scope of the project. As a next step, a comparative LCA is conducted to assess the environmental benefits and impacts of different solutions proposed in the framework of the project in a decision making context, and to limit the impact transfer and to generate the maximum value for all the stakeholders. Finally, results will be transferred to main actors (<b>recycling</b> <b>operators,</b> buildings contractors, product manufacturers â€¦) in the three regions in order to consolidate future key aspects to eco-design a building in light of circular economy...|$|R
40|$|Waste {{generated}} from construction and building demolition work constitutes about 68 % of all solid waste generated {{each year in}} South East Queensland. Consequently, it has created a serious waste management problem. The State Governments of Victoria and New South Wales have been encouraging the use of recycled materials from construction and related waste; they have also promulgated specifications for their use. In Queensland, however, similar regulations are not anticipated in the near future, which explains the lack of funded research conducted in this important arena. This paper presents {{an evaluation of the}} prevailing waste recycling practices in Queensland. Nine sites were visited, including two construction sites, three demolition sites, three recycling plants and one landfill in South East Queensland. The difficulties encountered by the <b>recycling</b> programme <b>operators</b> and their associates at these sites are described and the benefits of recycling construction materials are presented. One of the major barriers is that the local councils disallow the use of recycled materials in new construction work. To help rectify these impediments to recycling, recommendations are given to increase the use of recycled construction waste in South East Queensland.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{is a key}} human, {{animal and}} plant {{nutrient}} and an important ingredient of many nonagricultural products. However, phosphorus is also a critical pollutant and is unequally used and distributed in the world. The Global Transdisciplinary Phosphorus Management (Global TraPs; 2010 - 2015) project organizes a multi-stakeholder discourse involving key actors at all stages of the supply-demand chain with differing viewpoints, knowledge and concerns to guide and optimize future P use. Focusing on the sustainability of future phosphorus use, Global TraPs will bring together 'practice' (producers, traders, users of phosphorus, sewage-plant <b>operators,</b> <b>recycling</b> companies, public agencies, NGOs etc.) along with those facilitating their efforts (such as policy makers and development organizations) and 'science' (researchers from various disciplines {{with an interest in}} phosphorus) to work towards a common aim, expressed in the guiding question of the project: What new know ledge, technologies and policy options are needed to ensure that future phosphorus use is sustainable, improves food security and environmental quality, and provides benefits for the poor...|$|R

In 1974 the firm was acquired by the American giant International Harvester, and in February 1983 it was purchased by the Spanish group ENASA which made it a subsidiary of Pegaso. In 1990 it {{became part of the}} international commercial vehicle concern Iveco who used the brand for various types of specialised vehicles in the United Kingdom. The range of models produced included EuroMover, Pacer and Strato, which are aimed at refuse collection, <b>recycling</b> and construction <b>operators.</b> Iveco announced its decision to manufacture Seddon Atkinsons in Spain in 2005, and shortly afterwards the brand name was incorporated into the mainstream Iveco catalogue. The Oldham manufacturing facilities were shut-down in 2004, and the offices were closed at the end of 2006.|$|R
