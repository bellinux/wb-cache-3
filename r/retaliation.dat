40|$|This paper takes a mechanism-design {{approach}} to characterize a politically optimal trade agreement {{under the assumption}} that governments have private information about the fluctuating political pressure they face from domestic interest groups to restrict trade. The optimal mechanism under these changing circumstances involves a remedy system for breach of trade agreements that specifies less-than-proportional <b>retaliations</b> against deviating parties. This result is in contrast to the conventional wisdom in the literature regarding the efficiency of the Reciprocity Principle as a rule of renegotiation in trade agreements. I also consider an institutional structure in which only commensurate <b>retaliations</b> are practical but governments can employ a public randomizing device to authorize <b>retaliations.</b> I show that it is optimal to authorize <b>retaliations</b> only randomly. This suggests a role for the WTO dispute settlement process as a public randomizing device.

5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is <b>retaliation.</b> When players engage in play {{that members of the}} opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue.

Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.|$|E
