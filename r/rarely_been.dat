5|$|As the two nearby Manchester {{clubs have}} <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> {{in the same}} {{division}} as Stockport, historically {{there has been little}} rivalry with either club. However, the rivalry between Stockport County and Manchester City took form between 1997 and 2002, when the two clubs spent three out of five seasons in the same division and during the 1998/99 season, Stockport were a division above City.|$|E
5|$|Nikolai Zarudny and Härms {{described}} a subspecies, rubripersonatus, from Baluchistan in 1902. This was {{described a}}s having a deeper reddish orange skin {{on the head and}} a yellow-tipped dark bill. This has <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> considered a valid subspecies but the intermediate pattern of bill colouration suggests intermixing of subspecies.|$|E

5|$|As {{the show}} progressed through tryouts, Hammerstein {{repeatedly}} revised it, obscuring Suzy's profession {{and the nature}} of Fauna's house. Pipe Dream met with poor reviews, and rapidly closed once it exhausted its advance sale. It had no national tour or London production, and has <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> presented since. No movie version of the show was made; the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization (which licenses their works) once hoped for a film version featuring the Muppets with Fauna played by Miss Piggy.|$|E
5|$|Bolton's main rivals {{historically}} {{have been with}} near neighbours Bury, though this has lessened since the Second World War as the two clubs have <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> in the same league. The club also has a rivalry with Blackburn Rovers, as {{the two sides are}} separated by just fifteen miles and are both founder members of the Football League. More recently, Bolton have developed an enmity with Wigan Athletic, whose fans generally regard Bolton as their main rivals. Bolton fans maintain a mutual dislike with the fans of Tranmere Rovers, Burnley, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E
50|$|Outside of parties, kapustniki are a {{tradition}} in Russian theatre. To have one, actors choose an evening when no performance is planned and show their own funny plays for each other. Although <b>rarely</b> <b>is</b> anyone from outside the theatre's staff invited, many fans {{try to get in}} anyway. Due to their questionable copyright, kapustniks can <b>rarely</b> <b>be</b> broadcast or recorded.|$|R

5|$|Countershading, like counter-illumination, has <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> {{applied in}} {{practice}} for military camouflage, though not because military authorities {{were unaware of}} it. Both Abbott Thayer in the First World War and Hugh Cott in the Second World War proposed countershading to their countries' armed forces. They each demonstrated the effectiveness of countershading, without succeeding in persuading their armed forces to adopt the technique, though they influenced military adoption of camouflage in general.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{conceived}} the initial script {{for the show}} between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with {{his job as a}} Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter. He had always been interested in carnivals and noted that this subject had <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> dramatized on film. Knauf's experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human strongly informed the story and its treatment of freaks.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, they consume other plants if {{presented}} with them, but their diet in nature consists {{almost entirely of}} grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos have (<b>rarely)</b> <b>been</b> filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E

5|$|Mating has <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel {{to each other}} while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E
5|$|Michel de Nostredame (depending on the source, 14 or 21 December 1503 – 2 July 1566), usually Latinised as Nostradamus, was a French {{physician}} and reputed seer who published collections of prophecies that have since become widely famous. He {{is best known}} for his book Les Propheties, the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Since the publication of this book, which has <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> out of print since his death, Nostradamus has attracted a following that, along with much of the popular press, credits him with predicting many major world events.|$|E
5|$|Radyr {{hawkweed}} is {{the common}} name of Hieracium radyrense, a very rare endemic member of the aster, daisy, or sunflower family. It is a microspecies, so far only identified at Radyr. It was first identified in 1907 at the quarry, {{was described as a}} variety in 1948 and then as a separate species in 1955. It has <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> seen and regular surveys between 1998 and 2004 indicate that today only a single population of about 25 plants survives in the wild.|$|E

Nevertheless, based on the colors of surviving textile fragments and the evidence of actual dyestuffs found in archaeological sites, reds, blues, and yellows from plant sources were in common use by the late Bronze Age and Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of Bartholdi's statue {{was to be}} laid inside Fort Wood, a disused army base on Bedloe's Island constructed between 1807 and 1811. Since 1823, it had <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> used, though during the Civil War, it {{had served as a}} recruiting station. The fortifications of the structure were in the shape of an eleven-point star. The statue's foundation and pedestal were aligned so that it would face southeast, greeting ships entering the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The meat, blubber, baleen, and oil of baleen whales have {{traditionally}} {{been used by the}} indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for these products, cetaceans are now protected by international law. However, the North Atlantic right whale is ranked critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, baleen whales also face threats from marine pollution and ocean acidification. It has been speculated that man-made sonar results in strandings. They have <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> kept in captivity, and this has only been attempted with juveniles or members of one of the smallest species.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the goldcrest's range, {{the main}} {{predator}} of small woodland birds is the Eurasian sparrowhawk, {{which has a}} diet consisting of up to 98% of birds. Merlins, tawny and long-eared owls also hunt goldcrests. The erratic movements and flights of small woodland birds, which are vulnerable to attack while away from cover, may help to confuse their predators. The goldcrest has only very <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> recorded as a host of the common cuckoo, a widespread European brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|Although Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown had a storyline rivalry that dated {{back to when}} Doink {{turned on}} Lawler by dumping {{a bucket of water}} on him after SummerSlam 1993, the feud had <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> {{mentioned}} since then. On the September 10, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick Dink. The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a midget named Queasy, who dressed like Lawler. Doink and Lawler then introduced many more midgets over the following weeks. An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest {{for two to three}} weeks after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E
