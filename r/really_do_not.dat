25|$|The {{foregoing}} examples {{present the}} Salticidae as textbook examples of active hunters; they would hardly {{seem likely to}} build webs other than those used in reproductive activities, and in fact, most species <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> build webs to catch prey. However, exceptions occur, though even those that do build capture webs generally also go hunting like other salticids. Some Portia species, for example, spin capture webs that are functional, though not as impressive as some orb webs of the Araneidae; Portia webs are of an unusual funnel shape and apparently adapted to the capture of other spiders. Spartaeus species, on the other hand, largely capture moths in their webs. In their review of the ethology of Salticidae, Richman and Jackson speculate on whether such web building is {{a relic of the}} evolution of this family from web-building ancestors.|$|E

500|$|The presidential {{election}} of 1832 was approaching, and Floyd was torn: He {{wanted to see}} Vice President Calhoun as the presidential candidate, but wondered if he should first be proposed as the vice presidential candidate for the second term. He felt Calhoun had {{a better chance to}} beat Jackson than Clay, and he wrote to Calhoun in April 1831 to know his opinion: [...] "Under all these views I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know which course to take; whether to announce you a candidate for the presidency and take the hazard of war, or wait the fate of Clay. We would be glad to know your opinion about these things." [...] Floyd, along with Tazewell and John Tyler, were considered the leaders of the Virginians that had become disaffected with Jackson and had turned to Calhoun. They felt that Jackson had repudiated [...] "virtue and ability as well as Old Republican tenets." [...] According to historian Stephen Oates, [...] "In Floyd's opinion, the federal government under [...] "King Andrew" [...] had usurped power left and right, thus allowing the majority to run roughshod over the minority." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't know what else to do.... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April 1801, Nelson began to advance into Copenhagen harbour. The battle began badly for the British, with , [...] and [...] running aground, {{and the rest of}} the fleet encountering heavier fire from the Danish shore {{batteries}} than had been anticipated. Parker sent the signal for Nelson to withdraw, reasoning:I will make the signal for recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in a condition to continue the action he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be attached to him. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: [...] "I told you to look out on the Danish commodore and let me know when he surrendered. Keep your eyes fixed on him." [...] He then turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said [...] "You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I have a right to be blind sometimes." [...] He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> see the signal." [...] The battle lasted three hours, leaving both Danish and British fleets heavily damaged. At length Nelson dispatched a letter to the Danish commander, Crown Prince Frederick, calling for a truce, which the Prince accepted. Parker approved of Nelson's actions in retrospect, and Nelson was given the honour of going into Copenhagen the next day to open formal negotiations. At a banquet that evening, he told Prince Frederick that the battle had been the most severe he had ever been in. The outcome of the battle and several weeks of ensuing negotiations was a 14-week armistice, and on Parker's recall in May, Nelson became commander-in-chief in the Baltic Sea. As a reward for the victory, he was created Viscount Nelson of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, on 19 May 1801. In addition, on 4 August 1801, he was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk, this time with a special remainder to his father and sisters. Nelson had sailed to the Russian naval base at Reval (now Tallinn) in May, and there learned that the pact of armed neutrality was to be disbanded. Satisfied with the outcome of the expedition, he returned to England, arriving on 1 July.|$|E

2500|$|Enthusiasts of {{swarming}} sometimes {{apply it}} to situations that have superficial similarities, but <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> qualify as swarms. While swarms do converge on a target, not every military action, where multiple units attacked from all sides of a target, constitute swarming. [...] Other conflicts, especially historical ones, fit a swarming paradigm, but the commanders involved {{did not use the}} concept. Nevertheless, historical examples help illustrate what modern analysts do and do not consider swarming.|$|E
2500|$|The plot is {{not based}} on the storyline in the {{original}} book by Gaston Leroux. Lloyd Webber stated: [...] "I don't regard this as a sequel—it's a stand-alone piece." [...] He later clarified: [...] "Clearly, it is a sequel, but I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe {{that you have to have}} seen Phantom of the Opera to understand Love Never Dies." [...] The musical is set in 1907, which Lloyd Webber states is [...] "ten years roughly after the end of the original Phantom", although the events of the original actually took place in 1881.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Jim Falk [...] explores {{connections}} between technological concerns and political concerns.

Baruch Fischhoff, a social science professor said that many people <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> trust the nuclear industry. Wade Allison, a physics professor actually says [...] "radiation is safe & all nations should embrace nuclear technology" ...|$|E
2500|$|Nelson {{ordered that}} the signal be acknowledged, but not repeated. He {{turned to his}} flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said [...] "You know, Foley, I only have one eye — I {{have the right to}} be blind sometimes," [...] and then, holding his {{telescope}} to his blind eye, said [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> see the signal!" [...] Rear Admiral Graves repeated the signal, but in a place invisible to most other ships while keeping Nelson's 'close action' signal at his masthead. Of Nelson's captains, only Riou, who could not see Nelson's flagship , followed Parker's signal. Riou withdrew his force, which was then attacking the Tre Kroner fortress, exposing himself to heavy fire that killed him.|$|E

In addition Amenta had not returned family footage [...] "entrusted to him in good faith" [...] for the documentary, according to Rita's niece.

2500|$|An {{accident}} {{occurred during}} the 2009 FIA WTCC Race of France in Pau, France. A succession of first-lap accidents caused the safety car {{to be placed on}} standby, with yellow flags waving on the start-finish section of the track. The safety car driver then proceeded to drive onto the track at slow speed, without official approval, moving across the pit exit line immediately after exiting the pits, instead of confining to the inside of it until the line ended. Race leader Franz Engstler came through the kink on the start-finish straight and was unable to avoid hitting the side of the pace car. Engstler commented [...] "I saw the safety car coming out from the right and realized that I had no chance to brake... I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> understand why he was going out of the pits".|$|E
2500|$|Phillimore and the Edgar {{went with}} Sir Hyde Parker's fleet for his {{expedition}} to the Baltic in 1801.

He served as the Londons acting-signal lieutenant during the battle, sending Parker's famous signal for Nelson to withdraw. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: 'I told you to look out on the Danish commodore and let me know when he surrendered.
