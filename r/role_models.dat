5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be <b>role</b> <b>models</b> because there's some jealousy involved.

And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E

40|$|A <b>role</b> <b>model,</b> {{whether an}} {{individual}} or a project, can inspire similar performance in others. This research examines such a phenomenon during the design process for more sustainable physical infrastructure. In this empirical study, engineering professionals (n = 54) were randomly assigned either {{a modified version of}} the Envision rating system for sustainable infrastructure, which was changed to include details from an exemplary <b>role</b> <b>model</b> project, or the current version of Envision, with no <b>role</b> <b>model.</b> Professionals given the <b>role</b> <b>model</b> version of Envision achieved on average 34 % more points (SD = 27) than the control group (p = 0. 001). A positive <b>role</b> <b>model</b> project appears to lead engineering professionals to higher goals for sustainability performance in their design decisions. This finding, and the corresponding line of interdisciplinary research, can be used in decision-structuring interventions, which are a relatively low-cost approach to support greater sustainability in physical infrastructure development...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} whether a 'teach-the-trainer' course leads to improvements in, firstly, the knowledge and attitude of clinical trainers and their trainees, and, secondly, the <b>role</b> <b>model</b> behaviour of the clinical trainers. A controlled intervention study was performed with GP trainers and GP trainees from four training institutes in the Netherlands. Clinical trainers in the two intervention institutes received two 3 -h training sessions on weight management, focusing on knowledge and attitudes towards obesity, and on conveying the correct professional competency as a positive <b>role</b> <b>model</b> for trainees. This was measured using questionnaires on knowledge, attitude, and <b>role</b> <b>model</b> behaviour (the <b>role</b> <b>model</b> apperception tool; RoMAT). GP trainers showed an increase in knowledge and several characteristics could be identified as being related to positive <b>role</b> <b>model</b> behaviour. A small correlation was found between the trainer's score on the RoMAT and the attitude of the trainee. A teach-the-trainer course in which knowledge, attitudes, and <b>role</b> <b>modelling</b> are integrated proved to be a first step toward improving the knowledge of clinical trainers, but did not result in a measurably better professional outcome for the trainee, maybe due to a more objective level of assessmen...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between pre-service elementary teachers' attitudes toward <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> and the health behaviors they practice. Using a 26 -item questionnaire modified from several instruments, a convenience sample of 166 pre-service elementary teachers enrolled in health education course at Ball State University, voluntarily completed the questionnaire in Spring semester 2004. A panel of expert jurors reviewed the instrument for face validity. A pilot test was conducted to confirm instrument reliability. Data were analyzed using both unviariate and bivariate analysis. Bivariate correlations indicated a statistically significant association between pre-service elementary teachers' attitudes toward <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> and their attitudes toward <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> healthy behaviors. Additionally, a statistically significant association was indicated between pre-service elementary teachers' attitudes toward <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> healthy behaviors and the actual health behaviors they practice.

Quality of <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> relationships and STEM self-efficacy significantly predicted career aspirations.

Due to a high turnover rate, many had little knowledge of either official policies or unofficial rules and traditions. The warder's role, previously unwritten, only became clearly defined in 1902.
