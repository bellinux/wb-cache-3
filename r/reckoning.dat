50|$|Years were <b>reckoned</b> {{according}} to reigns and cycles. The Reign of Incarnation was all time {{up to the}} American Revolutionary War. The First Reign of our Incarnation was the period between the Revolution {{and the establishment of}} the original Klan, which was <b>reckoned</b> to May 6, 1866 in this scheme. The Reign of our Second Incarnation was <b>reckoned</b> between 1866 and Grand Wizard Nathan Bedford Forrest's dissolution of the Klan, which is <b>reckoned</b> to 1872. The Reign of our Third Incarnation began in 1915. The Klan year, Anno Klan, began in May of each year, and the cycle was <b>reckoned</b> from December of each calendar year.|$|R

5|$|Baldur's Gate II {{is set in}} {{the year}} 1369 DR (Dale <b>Reckoning),</b> and thus takes place not long after the Time of Troubles (1358 DR), when the Tablets of Fate, {{powerful}} magic items which maintain a balance between good and evil, were stolen. Lord Ao, the Overdeity, forced the gods to become mortal until the Tablets were found; some gods died while in this mortal state.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus gives a {{detailed}} description of the Persian fleet that assembled at Doriskos in spring 480 BC (see table). However, after the fleet was struck the storm off the coast of Magnesia, approximately one third of the fleet was lost. Thus, by Herodotus's <b>reckoning,</b> the Persian fleet would have had approximately 800 triremes at Artemisium.|$|E

5|$|In Falls the Shadow (1988) Penman {{chronicles the}} family {{relationships}} of King Henry III and his brother-in-law Simon de Montfort. Falls the Shadow is a bridge novel as Penman uses the Simon de Montfort rebellion to lead {{her to the}} conclusion of the trilogy in The <b>Reckoning.</b> As Penman explains: '“After I’d finished Here Be Dragons, I knew I wanted to continue the story… At first I’d planned to write one book in which Simon de Montfort would share top billing with Llewelyn Fawr’s grandson, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who later wed Simon’s daughter. I soon realized, though, that this was too much to tackle in one book, that Simon and Llewelyn each deserved his own novel. So I decided to devote Falls the Shadow to Simon and The <b>Reckoning</b> to Llewelyn".|$|E
5|$|<b>Reckoning</b> is {{the second}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band R.E.M., released on April 9, 1984 by I.R.S. Records. Produced by Mitch Easter and Don Dixon, the album was recorded at Reflection Sound Studio in Charlotte, North Carolina, over 16 days in December 1983 and January 1984. Dixon and Easter intended to capture the sound of R.E.M.'s live performances, and used binaural recording on several tracks. Singer Michael Stipe dealt with darker subject matter in his lyrics, and water imagery is a recurring theme on the record. Released to critical acclaim, <b>Reckoning</b> reached number 27 in the United States—where it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1991—and peaked at number 91 in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The Persian fleet {{was still}} {{large enough to}} both bottle up the Allied navy in the straits of Salamis, and send ships to land troops in the Peloponnese. However, in the final <b>reckoning,</b> both sides were {{prepared}} to stake everything on a naval battle, {{in the hope of}} decisively altering the course of the war.|$|E

25|$|For those airmen and airwomen whose service {{commenced}} before 3 September 1939, {{the time}} served was <b>reckoned</b> as time-and-a-half. Service on flying duties with the Royal Air Force {{or any other}} Commonwealth Air Force during the Second World War between 3 September 1939 and 2 September 1945 was <b>reckoned</b> as treble time. Service on other than flying duties was normally <b>reckoned</b> as single time, but while embodied within the Royal Air Force or any Commonwealth Air Force during the Second World War, such service was <b>reckoned</b> as double time.|$|R

5|$|According to Herodotus, only 43,000 Persians {{survived the}} battle. The number who died, of course, {{depends on how}} many there were in the first place; there would be 257,000 dead by Herodotus' <b>reckoning.</b> Herodotus claims that the Greeks as a whole lost only 159 men. Furthermore, he claims that only Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians died, since {{they were the only}} ones who fought. Plutarch, who had access to other sources, gives 1,360 Greek {{casualties}}, while both Ephorus and Diodorus Siculus tally the Greek casualties to over 10,000.|$|E
5|$|As Chapter 66 of his On the <b>Reckoning</b> of Time, in 725 Bede {{wrote the}} Greater Chronicle (chronica maiora), which {{sometimes}} circulated {{as a separate}} work. For recent events the Chronicle, like his Ecclesiastical History, relied upon Gildas, upon {{a version of the}} Liber pontificalis current at least to the papacy of Pope Sergius I (687–701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on Eusebius's Chronikoi Kanones. The dating of events in the Chronicle is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the anno mundi.|$|E
5|$|De temporibus, or On Time, {{written in}} about 703, {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the principles of Easter computus. This was based on parts of Isidore of Seville's Etymologies, and Bede also included a chronology of the world which was derived from Eusebius, with some revisions based on Jerome's translation of the bible. In about 723, Bede wrote a longer work on the same subject, On the <b>Reckoning</b> of Time, which was influential throughout the Middle Ages. He also wrote several shorter letters and essays discussing specific aspects of computus.|$|E

5|$|Dead <b>reckoning,</b> {{in animals}} usually known as path integration, means the putting {{together}} of cues from different sensory sources within the body, {{without reference to}} visual or other external landmarks, to estimate position relative to a known starting point continuously while travelling on a path {{that is not necessarily}} straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the task is to compute the vector to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.|$|E
5|$|His friend George Gray, {{himself a}} {{champion}} shooter, {{told him that}} he had reduced sniping casualties from five a week per battalion to forty-four in three months in sixty battalions; by his <b>reckoning,</b> this meant that Hesketh-Prichard had saved over 3,500 lives. He was promoted to major in November 1916. By this time in the war, his contributions to sniping had been such that the former German superiority in the practice had now been reversed.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the attack began to go seriously wrong. Strong winds blowing off the land swept the smoke screen {{into the face of}} the {{advancing}} cruisers, blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead <b>reckoning.</b> The same wind disclosed the Inshore Squadron to the German defenders who immediately opened up a withering fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the poor visibility and continued groping through the narrow channels inshore, searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} {{the southern tip}} of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead <b>reckoning</b> proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.|$|E
5|$|One {{aspect of}} the Carolinian method of {{estimating}} longitude on inter-island sailings is to visualize the target island relative to a second reference island's alignment with a succession of selected stars, points of the star compass. It is a refined system of dead <b>reckoning</b> whereby the navigator constantly synthesizes his position relative to the reference island's location in his mental model. The most remarkable {{thing is that the}} reference island (lu pongank) may be over the horizon, unseen, even imaginary.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Reckoning</b> (1991) {{chronicles the}} reign of England's King Henry III in Penman's final volume of the series that began with Here Be Dragons. The {{conflict}} between the Welsh prince Llewelyn ap Gruffydd who is the grandson of Llewelyn the Great of Here Be Dragons, and England's King Henry III is one subplot. Additionally, Penman chronicles the life and character of Ellen, daughter of Simon de Montfort and niece to Henry III; her betrothal to Llewellyn (negotiated prior to de Montfort's death); and the conflict between Ellen and her cousin Edward, soon to become King Edward, who opposes the betrothal.|$|E
