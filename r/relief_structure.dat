40|$|<b>Relief</b> <b>structures</b> {{are created}} {{on the surface}} of fibres to {{generate}} new effects in these fibres. More specifically, photo-embossing is used to generate the <b>relief</b> <b>structures</b> and to generate a non-contact process without etching procedures which could eventually be applied in high-speed and continuous spinning lines. Typically, a photopolymer mixture consisting of a polymeric binder, a monomer and a photo-initiator is directly spun into a monofilament fibre. The rheological properties of the photopolymer mixture are measured, and it is shown that the photopolymer mixture is visco-elastic at elevated temperatures. Fibres are prepared from the photopolymer mixture, and surface <b>relief</b> <b>structures</b> are generated perpendicular to the fibre axis by photo-embossing using a mask exposure. Optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are employed to study the surface morphology of the fibres. It is shown that the height of the surface <b>relief</b> <b>structures</b> is strongly dependent on the pitch of the line mask and on the diameter of the fibres. At optimized conditions, patterned fibres are produced with well-defined surface <b>relief</b> <b>structures.</b> The fibres are rather brittle which is related to the crosslinked chemical network in the fibres...|$|R
40|$|Photoembossing is a {{cost-effective}} technique {{for the production}} of complex surface <b>relief</b> <b>structures</b> in a photopolymer film, achieved via contact-mask exposure to UV-light. Here, photoembossing is explored using interference holography with a CW laser and a nanosecond pulsed laser. It is shown that identical surface <b>relief</b> <b>structures</b> are produced if the photopolymer film is kept in a fixed position. In the case of a moving substrate, <b>relief</b> <b>structures</b> are only obtained with the pulsed laser and the heights of the <b>relief</b> <b>structures</b> and their shape are the same as in the static experiments. This illustrates that photoembossing in combination with pulsed laser interference holography is potentially useful in the production of large area structured films using roll-to-roll processes.

Long range, extremely low sidebands and multiple channels are found when the RBF with surface <b>relief</b> <b>structure</b> is illuminated with Transverse Magnetic incident polarization light near the Brewster angle calculated with the effective media theory of sub wavelength grating. Moreover, the wavelengths of RBF with surface <b>relief</b> <b>structure</b> can be easily shifted by changing the depth of homogeneous layer while its optical properties such as low sideband reflection and narrow band are not spoiled when the depth is changed. Furthermore, the variation of the grating thickness does not effectively change the resonant wavelength of RBF, but have a remarkable effect on its line width, which is very useful for designing such filters with different line widths at desired wavelength.

40|$|AbstractCan humans recover metric {{structure}} from motion sequences or, as {{has been}} claimed by Todd and Bressan [(1990) Perception & Psychophysics, 48, 419 – 4301, are they limited to recovering only <b>relief</b> <b>structure?</b> Two experiments were carried out to investigate this question. In a metric-structure task, the angular thresholds for discriminating two rotating bi-planar structures were ≈ 91 deg. By contrast, in a relief-structure task, the angular thresholds for discriminating a planar from a non-planar structure, both undergoing simple rotational motion, were only ≈ 11 deg. A computational model is proposed to examine the image motion sensitivity required to perform discriminations of both three-dimensional metric and <b>relief</b> <b>structure</b> from motion. When the experimental data were re-plotted {{in terms of this}} two-dimensional sensitivity, the thresholds were found to be the same for both tasks. This finding is related to the model's revelation that recovering metric structure from motion is inherently more noise-sensitive than is recovering <b>relief</b> <b>structure</b> from motion. The conclusion is that the differences in angular thresholds reflect the differing nature of the two tasks. There {{is no evidence that the}} visual processes themselves are preferentially sensitive to non-metric over metric structure from motion...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for the rapid design, screening, and optimization of coating systems with surface <b>relief</b> <b>structures,</b> {{using a combination}} of statistical experimental design, high-throughput experimentation, data mining, and graphical and mathematical optimization routines was developed.

A library of 72 films was prepared by dispensing a given amount of sample onto a chemically patterned substrate consisting of hydrophilic areas separated by fluorinated hydrophobic barriers. Film composition and film processing conditions were determined using statistical experimental design. The surface topology of the films was characterized by automated AFM. Subsequently, models explaining the dependence of surface topologies on sample composition and processing parameters were developed and used for screening a virtual 4000 -membered in silico library of photopolymer lacquers. Simple graphical optimization or Pareto algorithms were subsequently used to find an ensemble of formulations, which were optimal with respect to a predefined set of properties, such as aspect ratio and shape of the <b>relief</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

Because of this noncovalent bonding the polymer chains got involved in the photoinduced translation motion of azobenzene units resulting in very effective formation of surface relief gratings. For the first time some relaxation processes which counteract the light-induced formation of surface <b>relief</b> <b>structures</b> were suggested. Under consideration of these processes the influence of network formation and alternatively of glassy state on the efficiency of mass transport and the stability of induced structures was discussed.

40|$|Recent psychophysical {{experiments}} {{suggest that}} humans can recover only <b>relief</b> <b>structure</b> from motion (SFM); i. e., an object’s 3 D shape {{can only be}} determined up to a stretching transformation {{along the line of}} sight. Here we propose a physiologically plausible model for the computation of relief SFM, which is also applicable to the related problem of motion parallax. We assume that the perception of depth from motion is related to the firing of a subset of MT neurons tuned to both velocity and disparity. The model MT neurons are connected to each other laterally to form modulatory interactions. The overall connectivity is such that when a zero-disparity velocity pattern is fed into the system, the most responsive neurons are not those tuned to zero disparity, but instead are those having preferred disparities consistent with the <b>relief</b> <b>structure</b> of the velocity pattern. The model computes the correct <b>relief</b> <b>structure</b> under a wide range of parameters and can also reproduce the SFM illusions involving coaxial cylinders. It is consistent with the psychophysical observation that subjects with stereo impairment are also deficient in perceiving motion parallax, and with the physiological data that the responses of direction- and disparity-tuned MT cells covary with the perceived surface orde...|$|E
