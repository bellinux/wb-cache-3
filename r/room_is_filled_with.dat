5|$|The {{emergency}} <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> victims from a chain car accident, {{one of whom}} {{is admitted}} in the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they {{come to the conclusion that}} even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is admitted in plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.|$|E
25|$|The {{second and}} third rooms are {{dedicated}} to personal effects and mementos and to some of Rivera’s works respectively. The second <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> everyday items Frida used, letters, photographs and notes. On the walls are pre-Hispanic necklaces and folk dresses, especially the Tehuana-style ones that were Frida’s trademark. Paintings in the third room include Retrato de Carmen Portes Gil, 1921, Ofrenda del día de muertos, 1943, and Mujer con cuerpo de guitarra, 1916.|$|E
25|$|There is a Noh play by {{the name}} of Kurozuka that tells the story of two priests who stop by the hut of the Onibaba in Adachi. The Onibaba, in her human form, kindly lets them in and speaks to them about her {{loneliness}} while spinning thread. Later, she leaves to gather firewood, but tells the priests not to look into the inner room of the house. Curious, the servant disobeys and the priests find that the inner <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> the bones and rotting corpses of people. They realize that the woman is the goblin of Adachi. As they are about to run away, the Onibaba returned, outraged, and in her demon form. They were able to escape through the power of their Buddhist prayers.|$|E

5000|$|An entire <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> her memorabilia at the Second Avenue Deli in New York (now {{closed at}} that location).|$|R
60|$|She {{opened the}} drawing-room door softly, meaning {{to take him}} by surprise. The <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a sweet hot scent of {{flowering}} azaleas.|$|R
500|$|Yuiko Kurugaya is Riki's classmate {{who has a}} {{self-sufficient}} personality, and {{is sometimes}} seen carrying a replica of a katana called Muramasa. She {{is seen as an}} older sister to everyone despite being the same age of almost the entire cast, and is fond of things or people she considers to be cute.Translated quote: [...] "I like cute things." [...] Mio Nishizono is a calm girl who is very diligent. Due to having weak health, she is always seen with a parasol when outside. She enjoys reading, especially when the story contains boys love elements, and her <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> books. Sasami Sasasegawa is the captain of the girls' softball team and is Rin's rival; while Rin loves cats, Sasami is a devoted dog lover. Saya Tokido, who only appeared in Ecstasy, is a popular girl at Riki's school, though she is known to be [...] At night, she wanders around the school to protect a [...] "treasure" [...] from those she calls the , and even has to fight them for it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{entrance}} to the Hufflepuff dormitories and common room entrance is concealed {{in a pile of}} large barrels in an alcove in the corridor that holds the kitchen. To enter, one must tap the barrel two from the bottom {{in the middle of the}} second row in the rhythm of [...] "Helga Hufflepuff". Unlike any other house, the Hufflepuff common room has a repelling device that douses the illegal entrant in vinegar if the wrong lid is tapped or the rhythm is wrong. The Hufflepuff common <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> yellow hangings and fat armchairs and it has little underground tunnels leading to the dormitories, all of which have perfectly round doors, like barrel tops.|$|E
2500|$|The Doctor, still {{somewhat}} addled, roams {{the back}} streets for answers the next morning, questioning how his body chooses {{a new face}} during regeneration, feeling like he's seen his current face before, {{and is trying to}} tell himself something. Both Clara and the Doctor find a message reading [...] "The Impossible Girl" [...] in a newspaper, directing them to meet at a specific restaurant. [...] They reunite, but learn that neither planted the message for the other, as they had both assumed. They discover that the <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> humanoid robots that prevent them leaving. They are then descended into a lair where they see the man from the river surrounded by other idle humanoid robots. [...] Observing mismatched body parts, the Doctor surmises the man is a long-lived cyborg, but in an unusual sense. [...] It is a robot trying to make itself human by replacing its mechanical parts with biological ones taken from spontaneous combustion victims, including the dinosaur. [...] The robot's own 'face' is only half-covered with skin, exposing part of its skull's mechanisms.|$|E
5000|$|... 1939. Early in September, {{eight of}} the <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{specimens}} of butterflies, birds, mammals, etc., which were sent there for safe keeping by the British Museum.|$|R
50|$|Shortly before 1:00 a.m. on November 13, a {{mattress}} stored {{too close to}} a lighting circuit in a storage room, Room 610, caught fire. The <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> mattresses and paint cans, which fed the flames.|$|R
60|$|The <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{specimens}} {{of the strange}} beings that inhabit this underworld; a heterogeneous collection of hybrids--the offspring of the prisoners from the outside world; red and green Martians and the white race of therns.|$|R
60|$|It {{is again}} midnight. My fire burns cheerfully; the <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> my old friend's sober voice; and I am left to muse upon {{the story we}} have just now finished.|$|E
60|$|The <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{smoke of}} pipes, and is {{stifling}} with the reeking breath of its inmates. A single flaring gas jet dimly lights the scene, {{which is one}} Rembrandt or Moreland and Keisel {{would have loved to}} paint.|$|E
60|$|Are the {{supporters}} of the People's Champion crest-fallen, think you? Mr. Tooting is not leading them for the moment, but is pressing through the crowd outside the hall and flying up {{the street to the}} Pelican and the bridal suite, where he is first with the news. Note for an unabridged biography: the great man is discovered sitting quietly by the window, poring over a book on the modern science of road-building, some notes from which he is making for his first message. And instead of the reek of tobacco smoke, the <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> the scent of the floral tributes brought down by the Ladies' Auxiliary from Leith. In Mr. Crewe's right-hand pocket, neatly typewritten, is his speech of acceptance. He is never caught unprepared. Unkind, now, to remind him of that prediction made last night about the first ballot to the newspapers--and useless.|$|E
50|$|The {{penultimate}} scene {{took place}} in a contemporary American home. Rudolfs set was dominated by large horizontal windows. The <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> clocks, hourglasses and navigational equipment, in line with Dr. Arnold Mayers fascination with time travel.|$|R
5|$|The Raymonds {{modified}} {{the house to}} create a more open plan feel, separated by Japanese fusuma partitions and shōji screens. The <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> objects of art, including rugs designed by Noémi and crockery by the Mingei designer Minagawa Masu.|$|R
50|$|Deyrolle is {{also known}} for its entomological collections. The drawers of the entomological <b>room</b> <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{colourful}} butterflies, beetles, and other insects. It is possible to see the experts of the entomology team working on the mounting of insects.|$|R
6000|$|Often I am {{visited by}} the Topchi-Bashi, or {{master of the}} ordnance,--half a dozen {{honeycombed}} guns,--a wild fellow, Bashi Buzuk in the Hejaz and commandant of artillery at Zayla. He shaves my head on Fridays, and on other days tells me wild stories about his service in the Holy Land; how Kurdi Usman slew his son-in-law, Ibn Rumi, and how Turkcheh Bilmez would have murdered Mohammed Ali in his bed. [12] Sometimes the <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> Arabs, Sayyids, merchants, and others settled in the place: I saw nothing amongst them to justify the oft-quoted saw, [...] "Koraysh pride and Zayla's boastfulness." [...] More generally the assembly {{is one of the}} Somal, who talk in their own tongue, laugh, yell, stretch their legs, and lie like cattle upon the floor, smoking the common Hukkah, which stands in the centre, industriously cleaning their teeth with sticks, and eating snuff like Swedes. Meanwhile, I occupy the Kursi or couch, sometimes muttering from a book to excite respect, or reading aloud for general information, or telling fortunes by palmistry, or drawing out a horoscope.|$|E
60|$|It is {{four o'clock}} in the afternoon, and we may go to see our lottery drawn. The {{ceremony}} takes place every Saturday, in the Tribunale, or Court of Justice--this singular, earthy-smelling room, or gallery, as mouldy as an old cellar, and as damp as a dungeon. At the upper end is a platform, with a large horse-shoe table upon it; and a President and Council sitting round--all judges of the Law. The man on the little stool behind the President, is the Capo Lazzarone, a kind of tribune of the people, appointed on their behalf to see that all is fairly conducted: attended by a few personal friends. A ragged, swarthy fellow he is: with long matted hair hanging down all over his face: and covered, from head to foot, with most unquestionably genuine dirt. All {{the body of the}} <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> the commonest of the Neapolitan people: and between them and the platform, guarding the steps leading to the latter, is a small body of soldiers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{a solemn}} thing {{to begin a}} new year {{on the anniversary of}} our dear Mother's death. I often think whether she would approve of this or that opinion, action, &c. Wright's {{painting}} is pleasant to look upon. I stand in a corner of my room, at father's old mahogany desk. Her picture and his, the large framed photographs from Richmond's drawing, and a good photograph of the Bishop are just above. I wish you could see my room. I write now on December 3, a bright summer day, but my room with its deep verandah is cool and shady. It is true that I refuse carpet and curtains. They only hold dust and make the room fusty. But the whole <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> books, and those pictures, and the Lionardo da Vinci over the fireplace, and Mr. Boxall's photograph over it, and his drawing vis-a-vis to it {{at the other end of}} the room, and by my window a splendid gloxinia with fine full flowers out in a very pretty porcelain pot, both Mr. Codrington's gift. On another glass stand (also his present) a Mota flower imported here, a brilliant scarlet hibiscus, and blossoms of my creepers and bignonia, most beautiful. So fresh and pretty. The steps of the verandah are a mass of honeysuckle. The stephanotis, with the beautiful scented white flowers and glossy leaves, covers one of the posts. How pleasant it is. Everyone is kind, all are well, all are going on well just now. Such are missionary comforts. Where the hardships are I have not yet discovered. Your chain, dear Joan, is round my neck, and the locket (Mamma's) in which you, Fan, put the hair of you five, hangs on it.|$|E

50|$|Jay-Z {{sent two}} {{security}} guards to Punchestown {{in advance to}} examine {{the area in which}} he was to perform. He jetted into Dublin, asking that his dressing <b>room</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> red wine, a selection of spirits, tequila shots and cigars.|$|R
60|$|They {{rushed into}} the passageway, not an instant too soon, for a second later there came another crash and the {{printing}} <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> sparks and bits of burning timber. Then {{a cloud of smoke}} all but choked them.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> evergreens {{and members}} of the palm family.|$|E
50|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, features actor David Boreanaz as Dido's love interest. The video {{tells a story}} about a relationship that is over, but both still in love with each other, meeting everywhere that they go and trying to not see each other. At the end of the video, they return to their apartments and Dido's <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> David's photos and David's <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> Dido's photos.|$|E
50|$|Vitally {{important}} throughout history, navigational {{techniques and}} various {{pieces of equipment}} are explained in a small exhibit {{on the history of}} navigation at sea. The <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> charts, chronometers and meteorological equipment.|$|E
60|$|The {{assembled}} household now cheered {{loudly and}} long, {{and in the}} midst of the uproar the wooden Captain entered at the head of the pewter band, and the musicians blew upon their instruments so powerfully that the big throne <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> music.|$|R
60|$|Victor shivered {{with awe}} and exalted admiration, {{for the eyes}} seemed to look {{straight}} at him. The <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> that familiar unaccountable odor, and a cold wind blew as before from the celestial visitant, with suggestions of limitless space and cold, white light.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye-es, but Mason's <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> rats {{every day}} we were out. It took him a week to draw the inference," [...] said McTurk. [...] "He loathes rats. 'Minute he let us go back the rats stopped. Mason's a little shy of us now, {{but there was no}} evidence." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2005 {{the centre}} added a sensory room called Snoezelen muti-sensory room. The <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{colorful}} objects, images, pleasant sounds and smells. This room was built specifically {{for children who}} have sensory or learning disabilities.|$|E
50|$|The last <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{honey and}} Pooh eats his fill while saying {{how much he}} loves to eat it. There is a scent of honey in this room. The {{vehicles}} then pass a big, closed storybook of the adventure {{and then return to}} the unloading area.|$|E
50|$|Compared to Moser, Brandtner {{is shown}} to be more {{athletic}} and performs various physical stunts throughout the series, such as diving over car bonnets, engaging in fast-paced chases on foot and dives. His living <b>room</b> <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> boxing and fitness gear and he is portrayed as very attractive to women.|$|E
50|$|The Salle des Croisades in {{the north}} wing of the Palace of Versailles opened in 1843, {{commissioned}} by king Louis-Philippe, {{at a time when}} France was seized with enthusiasm with its historical past, and especially the period of the Crusades.

50|$|Garda Nolan was {{meanwhile}} {{engaged in}} trying to locate a woman said to be asleep in the basement. By the time he located her the <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> very dense smoke. He brought her to safety just as the roof above them collapsed in flames. All the occupants recovered from the ordeal.|$|R
60|$|The <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a lumbering {{double bed}} and a cheap pine bureau. She stored {{the bed in the}} attic; {{replaced}} it by a cot which, with a denim cover, made a couch by day; put in a dressing-table, a rocker transformed by a cretonne cover; had Miles Bjornstam build book-shelves.|$|R
