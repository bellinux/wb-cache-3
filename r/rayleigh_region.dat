40|$|This {{theoretical}} {{study examines}} {{the use of}} radar to continuously monitor "accumulation {{of blood in the}} head" (ACBH) non-invasively and from a distance, after the location of a hematoma or hemorrhage in the brain was initially identified with conventional medical imaging. Current clinical practice is to monitor ABCH with multiple, subsequent, conventional medical imaging. The radar technology introduced in this study could provide a lower cost and safe alternative to multiple conventional medical imaging monitoring for ACBH. The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the feasibility of using radar to monitor changes in blood volume in the brain through a numerical simulation of ACBH monitoring from remote, with a directional spiral slot antennae, in 3 -D models of the brain. The focus of this study is on evaluating the effect of frequencies on the antennae reading. To that end we performed the calculations for frequencies of 100 MHz, 500 MHz and 1 GHz. The analysis shows that the ACBH can be monitored with radar and the monitoring resolution improves with an increase in frequency, in the range studied. However, it also appears that when typical clinical dimensions of hematoma and hemorrhage are used, the variable ratio of blood volume radius and radar wavelength can bring the measurements into the Mie and <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>regions</b> of the radar cross section. In these regions there is an oscillatory change in signal with blood volume size. For some frequencies there is an increase in signal with an increase in volume while in others there is a decrease. While radar can be used to monitor ACBH non-invasively and from a distance, the observed Mie region dependent oscillatory relation between blood volume size and wavelength requires further investigation. Classifiers, multifrequency algorithms or ultra-wide band radar are possible solutions that should be explored in the future...|$|R

The TS {{which is used to}} convert acoustic backscatter to krill density was also presented.

The sexual dimorphism manifested as a swollen cephalothorax in female krill with body lengths exceeding 40  mm. The TS of female krill was higher than those of male krill at low frequencies, even when body lengths were the same.

40|$|Purpose - To {{study the}} {{magnetic}} shielding and the losses of non-linear, hysteretic multilayered shields by using fast to evaluate analytical expressions. Design/methodology/approach - In order {{to evaluate the}} shield in the frequency domain, the non-linear shield is divided into {{a sufficient number of}} piecewise linear sublayers. Each sublayer has a permeability that is constant (space independent) and complex (to model hysteresis). This expression for the permeability is found from the Preisach model by a Fourier transform. Once H is known in the entire shield, analytical expressions calculate the eddy current losses and hysteresis losses in the material. The validity of the analytical expressions is verified by numerical experiments. Findings - In the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>region,</b> the shielding factor of perfectly linear material is better than the one of non-linear metal sheets, but also the eddy Current losses are higher. The results of the optimization show that steel is only a useful shielding material at low frequencies. Research limitations/implications - The analytical method is valid for infinitely long shields and for weak imposed fields in the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>region.</b> Practical implications - As the analytical expressions can be evaluated very fast (in comparison with slow finite elements models), many magnetic shields can be compared in parametric studies.

The light propagation in highly scattering turbid media composed of the particles with different size distribution is studied using a Monte Carlo simulation model implemented in Standard C. Monte Carlo method has been widely utilized to study the propagation of light in turbid media with scattering particles because of its effectiveness and accuracy in approaching photon transport in turbid media.

40|$|Chemotherapy {{forms the}} {{mainstay}} of treatment for patients with liver tumours, which {{has a number of}} significant side effects. Treatment response is often assessed some time after commencement of treatment. A quantitative method to detect early liver tumour response to chemotherapy would be beneficial to facilitate termination of ineffective treatment and to minimise unnecessary side effects. This thesis investigated firstly whether fractal analysis of contrast enhanced computed tomography (ceCT) images of colorectal liver metastases could be used to detect early response to chemotherapy. Secondly, a technique based on Nakagami imaging of ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) signals was developed, initially using data from a xenograft mouse tumour model, as a potential early predictor of tumour response. This was subsequently tested using clinical ultrasound data collected from patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment for liver tumours. Mean fractal dimension (FD) obtained from fractal analysis of volumetric ceCT images of colorectal liver metastases was confirmed as a reliable quantitative parameter to detect tumour tissue changes. There was however {{no significant difference in the}} interval change of mean FD from baseline between responding and non-responding metastases. Based on the current study, fractal analysis is unable to detect early liver tumour response to chemotherapy. Development of an ultrasound-based tissue assessment technique was then performed, owing to the advantages of ultrasound imaging. A Nakagami imaging-based volumetric tissue assessment technique was developed using backscattered RF ultrasound data from xenograft mice tumour treated in an investigation of high intensity focused ultrasound mediated chemotherapy delivery. The percentage of pre- <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>regions</b> (%PRR) obtained from the new analysis technique demonstrated an indirect correlation with the tumour volume. Interval reduction in %PRR from baseline was also found to be significantly greater in tumours that responded to treatment. These observations confirmed the potential of Nakagami imaging-based techniques to detect early tumour response to treatment. The technique was subsequently used to analyse volumetric ultrasound datasets collected from patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment for liver tumours. The %PRR was found to indirectly correlate with the axial diameter of the liver tumour. Additionally, interval increase in the %PRR between follow-up and baseline study was found to be significantly higher in responding compared to non-responding tumours. These preliminary results demonstrated the potential of the Nakagami imaging-based volumetric tissue assessment technique to detect early response of liver tumour to chemotherapy.

Also introduced, for its geometrical similarities to eukaryotic cells, is a concentric sphere scattering model. BSC estimates from cell pellet biophantoms of known number density were performed with 20, 40 and 80 MHz focused transducers (overall bandwidth: 20 - 100 MHz). These biophantoms were histologically processed and then evaluated for cell viability. For low cell concentrations, cell pellet BSC estimates were {{in agreement with the}} concentric sphere model. Fitting the model to the BSC data yielded quantitative values for the outer sphere and inner sphere. The concentric sphere model thus appears suitable as a tool for providing quantitative information on cell structures and will tend to have a fundamental role in the classification of biological tissues. For high cell concentrations, the cells are close to each other so that the scattering becomes more complicated. The magnitude and shape of the BSC versus frequency curve, and consequently the parameter estimates from the concentric sphere model, are all affected by the high-concentration effect when the volume density reaches 30 %. At low frequencies (ka< 1), the effect tends to decrease BSC, as is also observed by other researchers. However, what is new in our findings is that the effect could either increase or decrease BSC at frequencies beyond the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>region.</b> The concentric sphere model least-squares estimates show a decrease in cell radius with number density (15. 8, 14. 6, 15. 1, 13. 6, 9. 6, 7. 1 μm for 1. 25, 4. 97, 19. 7, 72. 3, 224, 473 Mcells/mL CHO cell pellets respectively, and 11. 4, 9. 1 10. 7, 8. 4 μm for 1. 24, 4. 84, 17. 7, 52. 3 Mcell/mL new 3 T 3 cell pellets, respectively), which indicates that the concentric spheres model starts to break up at large cell concentrations.

40|$|Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, {{which can}} {{effectively}} remove colloidal/particulate matter (C/P), macromolecules, and pathogenic microorganisms, have gained increasing acceptance in {{the drinking water}} industry. However, organic fouling becomes a significant obstacle in achieving widespread adoption of this advanced treatment technology {{as it is a}} major contributor to operational and maintenance problems. Biofiltration without prior coagulation has been identified as a “green” and effective pre-treatment technique to mitigate organic fouling and increase the sustainability of ultrafiltration operation. To achieve the adoption and enhance the commercialization potential of biofiltration as a pre-treatment alternative, {{there is a need to}} identify and develop approaches to better characterize the natural organic matter (NOM) components that contribute to UF fouling and develop a fundamental understanding of the fouling mitigation mechanism of biofiltration as a new UF pre-treatment process. For the first phase of this research, a pilot-scale study of drinking water UF membrane fouling illustrated the utility of liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and fluorescence excitation emission matrices (FEEM) combined with principal component analysis (PCA) for the NOM-C/P characterization and fouling behaviour investigation. Biopolymers and protein-like substances were identified as the key contributors to both hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling. However, the lower molecular weight (MW) NOM fraction, humic-like substances, were shown to contribute little to UF fouling at low fouling rates. In addition, the capability of colloidal/particulate matter to alleviate the hydraulically irreversible fouling was highlighted. This study also illustrated the complementary nature of LC-OCD (size exclusion based) and FEEM (functional group composition based) with regard to NOM-C/P characterization. To further explore the physical significance of extracted principal components from FEEM-PCA, a model compound investigation using humic acid, bovine serum albumin, sodium alginate, and silica was conducted. It was found that both intrinsic fluorescence properties of a particular NOM/inorganic colloid component and their interactions with other components were included within the physical significance of each principal component (PC). Then, the differences in the principles and utility of PCA and other FEEM data analysis methods were compared. It is recommended that PCA should be used for the investigation of the possible effects of the NOM component of interest whereas PARAFAC and peak picking are more promising for investigation of the characteristics of NOM components. In addition, FEEM-PCA is capable of extracting information from <b>Rayleigh</b> scattering <b>regions</b> which could be related to colloidal/particulate matter and this unique utility was shown to not be affected by the photomultiplier tube voltage settings which can influence the saturation of the signal. Meanwhile, the compositional characteristics of biopolymers (defined by LC-OCD) was studied using a newly developed approach, LC-OCD based fractionation was combined with NOM characterization techniques. For three different biopolymer sources (biofilter media biofilm extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) extracts, a municipal wastewater, and a river water), the lower MW biopolymer sized fractions was found to have higher protein content per biopolymer carbon mass and the normalized organic nitrogen (ON) concentration was shown to be a reliable parameter to distinguish different sources. The behaviour and kinetics of NOM-C/P component removal during biofiltration was investigated at pilot-scale to understand the mitigation mechanisms of biofiltration as a pre-treatment alternative for UF. Biofiltration was demonstrated to be a promising process to remove protein-like materials and biopolymers which were identified as the key UF foulants. Comparatively, biofiltration had limited performance for the control of lower MW NOM fractions such as humic substances and building blocks. Either first or second order kinetics was shown to be appropriate to model the removal of biopolymers and protein-like materials during biofiltration. Also, because of the interaction between protein-like materials and colloidal/particulate matter, the 0. 45 μm pre-filtration with polymeric filter prior to FEEM measurements resulted in a reduction of protein-like fluorescence intensities, with less of an effect on humic-like substances. Additionally, the differences of the removal behavior and kinetics of NOM components between filtered and non-filtered samples were observed. In summary, biofiltration was demonstrated to be a reliable drinking water treatment process to remove key UF foulants and can therefore be recommended as a promising pre-treatment alternative for UF fouling control. LC-OCD and FEEM based techniques could be used in combination for NOM-C/P characterization and monitoring to better investigate the behavior of various NOM-C/P components. The selection of FEEM data analysis methods should be determined based on the purpose of investigation. FEEM measurements on both filtered and non-filtered samples are recommended to extract more information on colloidal/particulate NOM components. Further investigations should be conducted to explore the properties of other fluorescent NOM fractions using the newly developed fractionation approach and to achieve a more definitive interpretation on the removal kinetics of various NOM-C/P components during biofiltration...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} imaging the Earth’s {{subsurface}} using seismic waves require an identifiable, impulsive source of seismic energy, for example an earthquake or explosive source. Naturally occurring, ambient seismic waves form an ever-present {{source of energy}} that is conventionally regarded as unusable since it is not impulsive. As such it is generally removed from seismic data and subsequent analysis. A new method known as seismic interferometry {{can be used to}} extract useful information about the Earth’s subsurface from the ambient noise wavefield. Consequently, seismic interferometry is an important new tool for exploring areas which are otherwise seismically quiet, such as the British Isles in which there are relatively few strong earthquakes. One of the possible applications of seismic interferometry is the ambient noise tomography method (ANT). ANT is a way of using interferometry to image subsurface seismic velocity variations using seismic (surface) waves extracted from the background ambient vibrations of the Earth. To date, ANT has been used to successfully image the Earth’s crust and upper-mantle on regional and continental scales in many locations and has the power to resolve major geological features such as sedimentary basins and igneous and metamorphic cores. In this thesis I provide a review of seismic interferometry and ANT and apply these methods to image the subsurface of north-west Scotland and the British Isles. I show that the seismic interferometry method works well within the British Isles and illustrate the usefulness of the method in seismically quiet areas by presenting the first surface wave group velocity maps of the Scottish Highlands and across the British Isles using only ambient seismic noise. In the Scottish Highlands, these maps show low velocity anomalies in sedimentary basins such as the Moray Firth and high velocity anomalies in igneous and metamorphic centres such as the Lewisian complex. They also suggest that the Moho shallows from south to north across Scotland, which agrees with previous geophysical studies in the <b>region.</b> <b>Rayleigh</b> wave velocity maps from ambient seismic noise across the British Isles for the upper and mid-crust show low velocities in sedimentary basins such as the Midland Valley, the Irish Sea and the Wessex Basin. High velocity anomalies occur predominantly in areas of igneous and metamorphic rock such as the Scottish Highlands, the Southern Uplands, North-West Wales and Cornwall. In the lower crust/upper mantle, the Rayleigh wave maps show higher velocities in the west and lower velocities in the east, suggesting that the Moho shallows generally from east to west across Britain. The extent of the region of higher velocity correlates well with the locations of British earthquakes, agreeing with previous studies that suggest British seismicity might be influenced by a mantle upwelling beneath the west of the British Isles. Until the work described in Chapter 6 of this thesis was undertaken in 2009, seismic interferometry was concerned with cross-correlating recordings at two receivers due to a surrounding boundary of sources, then stacking the cross-correlations to construct the inter-receiver Green’s function. A key element of seismic wave propagation is that of source-receiver reciprocity i. e. the same wavefield will be recorded if its source and receiver locations and component orientations are reversed. By taking the reciprocal of its usual form, in this thesis I show that the impulsive-source form of interferometry can also be used in the opposite sense: to turn any energy source into a virtual sensor. This new method is demonstrated by turning earthquakes in Alaska and south-west USA into virtual seismometers located beneath the Earth’s surface.
