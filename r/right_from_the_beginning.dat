Muisca motives are represented as murals, in clothing and as objects found {{all over the}} former Muisca territories {{as well as in}} animated clips and video games. The art of the indigenous inhabitants of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense is well studied by many different researchers who published their work <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of colonial times.

5|$|Before the mid-1870s, the {{judicial}} system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and haphazard in character, particularly {{because most of the}} judges were legally unqualified. Most of {{the judicial}} procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called Landdrosts, whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. <b>Right</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling deeply ingrained political traditions that stood {{in the way of the}} modernisation of {{the judicial system}}, but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he had to win the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God-fearing beliefs. It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters.|$|E

25|$|The 2004 {{season was}} a disappointing {{year for the}} Blue Jays <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning.</b> They started the season 0–8 at SkyDome and never started a lengthy winning streak. Much of that was due to {{injuries}} to All-Stars Carlos Delgado, Vernon Wells and Roy Halladay among others. Although the additions of starting pitchers Ted Lilly and Miguel Batista and reliever Justin Speier were relatively successful, veteran Pat Hentgen faltered throughout the season and retired on July 24. Rookies and minor league callups David Bush, Jason Frasor, Josh Towers and others filled the void in the rotation and the bullpen; however, inconsistent performances were evident. With the team struggling in last place and mired in a five-game losing streak, manager Carlos Tosca was fired on August 8, 2004, {{and was replaced by}} first base coach John Gibbons. Long-time first baseman Carlos Delgado became a free agent in the off-season. Nevertheless, prospects Russ Adams, Gabe Gross, and Alex Ríos provided excitement for the fans. Rookie pitchers David Bush, Gustavo Chacín and Jason Frasor also showed promise for the club's future. The Blue Jays' lone MLB All-Star Game representative was Lilly.|$|E

It covers applications to the European Commission (abolished since Protocol!!) and to the European Court. It is important to emphasise that this work is not a review of the substantive Articles themselves, but of their applicability to non-governmental organisations and the value and relevance of the rights to non-governmental organisations. Mention has been made of applications of minor importance to illustrate range of applications. Applications brought by individuals are discussed only when they are of significant importance to understanding the context of a Convention Article or the context ofparticular arguments. The general aim is to assess the contribution made by NGO applications to Convention case law. I have sought to take account of Convention jurisprudence up to the end of 2006, although reference is made to a small number of decisions in 2007.

500|$|A {{combination}} of hieroglyphic texts from Tikal, Copán and Quiriguá, together with architectural styles and chemical {{tests of the}} bones of the founder of the Copán dynasty all suggest that Quiriguá and Copán were founded by elite colonists from the great city of Tikal as a part of its expansion into the southeastern border area of the Maya region. The recorded history of Quiriguá starts in 426, in the Early Classic (c.200 c.600); according to hieroglyphic inscriptions at other sites, on 5September of that year K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' was enthroned as king of Copán. Just three days later he installed [...] "Tok Casper", the first known king of Quiriguá, upon the throne. From this it is evident that <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of its recorded history Quiriguá was subservient to its southern neighbour, and was founded to bring the lucrative trade route of the Motagua River under the control of Copán and, indirectly, of Tikal. During the next few centuries, about which little is known, the ceremonial architecture at Quiriguá was limited to the hilltop Group A and a broad earthen platform on the valley floor. It is recorded that a stela, as yet undiscovered, was erected in 455 by Tutuum Yohl K'inich, the second king of Quiriguá. An early monument records the supervision of a ritual in 480 by the then overlord from Copán, demonstrating Quiriguá's continued status as a vassal of that city. A hieroglyphic text dating to 493 mentions two further kings of Quiriguá, but interruptions in the text make the reading and decipherment of their names particularly difficult.|$|E

When using an acoustic piano, Kramon would use compression so that it did not sound like a traditional piano. Live bass and percussion was also used, as Kramon did not like to program them. The main instrument used was guitar, but Kramon felt that piano was [...] "by far the most important instrument for working on TV shows, especially when you're doing everything yourself." [...] A week before choosing the sounds for the pilot, the crew had a [...] "spotting session", where they would discuss with Thomas and the producers which type of music was going to be featured. Kramon did not decide the songs to be featured, but composed and created the whole score. Since there was little orchestral music, and Kramon could play guitar, piano, bass and drums, he played the whole score without hiring a musician.|$|E
40|$|Rights of {{producers}} of audio and audiovisual recordings. The {{goal of this}} thesis {{is to examine the}} history and development of copyright and copyright legislation as it relates to manufacturers of music and film music, with an overview of present day legal recourse available to intellectual property owners in the Czech Republic and the European Union in general. Recorded music and motion pictures are phenomena of the 20 th and 21 st centuries. Today they constitute major industries, and as such must be protected by copyright. This thesis analyzes the legal issues surrounding the rights of audio and audiovisual recordings, which is a highly current topic. Due to the constant development of information and communication technologies and the seeming anonymity of the online environment, copyright violation is increasing at a tremendous rate. The introduction deals with the influence of copyright laws on manufacturers of audio and audiovisual recordings.
