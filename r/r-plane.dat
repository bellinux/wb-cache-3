5000|$|A Riesenflugzeug (plural Riesenflugzeuge, German for [...] "giant aircraft"), {{sometimes}} colloquially {{referred to}} in English as an <b>R-plane,</b> was a large World War I German bomber, possessing at least three aircraft engines, more usually being powered by four or more engines, sometimes {{of more than one}} make, model or power level. These were large multi-engine aircraft capable of flying several hours with larger bomb loads than the smaller Grossflugzeug bombers such as the Gotha G.V. Some of the earliest Riesenflugzeuge were given G-type designations before being redesignated, but a major distinction was that the requirements for the R-type specified that the engines had to be serviceable in flight. As a result, designs fell into two groups - those with the engines mounted centrally inside the fuselage using gearboxes and driveshafts to transfer the power to propellers mounted between the wings, and those with conventional powerplant installations mounted in large nacelles or the nose of the aircraft where engineers would be stationed for each group of engines. The transmission of power from the centrally mounted engines to the remote, most often wing-mounted propellers proved troublesome in practice and most operational examples of Riesenflugzeug-class aircraft were of the second type, as with the all-direct-drive Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI.|$|E

The <b>R-plane</b> (10 – 11) is one of the low-index crystallographic planes of crystal quartz.
