40|$|The term antibiosis, {{which is}} {{the title of this}} paper, may to many {{biologists}} be a rather new term that has been in frequent use only since the discovery of penicillin in 1929. But in reality it is a term used by botanists for a long time. It seems to have been coined by H. M. Ward (1) in an article on Symbiosis published in Annals of Botany in 1899. The more familiar term "symbiosis " has long denoted the partnership of two organisms, often of different type, for their mutual benefit. An example is the common <b>root</b> <b>tubercle</b> bacteria which live in the nodules on the roots of peas, clover, etc. Here the bacterial cells get a favorable place to live and in turn their work of storing up compounds of nitrogen, later enriches the habitats of their hosts. In the article referred to above Ward said, "Where one of two associated organisms is injuring the other [...] . this state of affairs has been termed antibiosis. " This harmful relationship was studied more thoroughly by the German writer...|$|E

5|$|The {{body of the}} long-toed {{salamander}} is dusky black with a dorsal stripe of tan, yellow, or olive-green. This stripe can also be broken up {{into a series of}} spots. The sides of the body can have fine white or pale blue flecks. The belly is dark-brown or sooty in color with white flecks. <b>Root</b> <b>tubercles</b> are present, but they are not quite as developed as other species, such as the tiger salamander.|$|R
50|$|Cyathea australis, {{also known}} as the Rough Tree Fern, is a species of tree fern native to southeastern Queensland, New South Wales and {{southern}} Victoria in Australia, as well as Tasmania and Norfolk Island. It grows in moist shady forest, both coastal and montane, at an altitude of up to 1280 m, often in the company of Dicksonia antarctica. The massive erect trunk is usually up to 12 m tall, although specimens reaching 20 m have been reported from Queensland, Australia. Fronds are bi- or tripinnate and may reach 4 m in length, occasionally even 6 m. These form a distinctive crown that is dark green above and lighter green below. The Tree Fern has quite adventitious <b>roots,</b> <b>tubercles</b> and hair-like follicles on its ‘trunk’.|$|R
50|$|The {{species of}} Apostasia produce an erect {{inflorescence}} {{with up to}} six lateral branches, arising from the main, elongated <b>root.</b> Their warty <b>tubercles</b> are swollen and stalked. They lack velamen.|$|R
40|$|In 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13 {{research}} {{was carried out}} on fababean in Portici (Naples), with the purpose to evaluate the effects of crop environment and method as well as transplanting time on Rhizobium dynamics, nutrient absorption, fresh pods yield and seeds quality. With this respect, two crop environments (open field and greenhouse), two crop methods (conventional and “organic”) and five transplanting times (27 September, 11 October, 25 October, 8 November, 22 November) were compared. The <b>root</b> active <b>tubercles</b> number was greater in open field compared to greenhouse and in the third transplanting time.

40|$|The {{structure}} of mature tubercles collected from a Eucalyptus pilularis forest in Queensland, Australia, is described. The smooth, pale yellow tubercles (5 ‐ 20 mm diam.) {{consisted of a}} rind (200 ‐ 250 μm thick) enclosing a dense coralloid mass of ectornycorrhizas (150 ‐ 300 μm diam.) and rhizomorphs (200 ‐ 300 μm diam.). The outer rind region was cemented together with an interhyphal matrix of carbohydrate containing embedded lipid deposits. Dolipores were common in the inner rind indicating the fungal component to be a basidiomycete. Mycorrhizas had thin mantles and well‐formed Hartig nets. Protein and lipid reserves were present in mantle hyphae. Rhizomorphs formed around non‐mycorrhizal <b>roots</b> inside the <b>tubercles.</b> The central zone of rhizomorph tissue contained thick‐walled hyphae which stained positively for lignin‐like material. The tubercles are similar to structures formed in associations between Rhizopogon and conifers in the northern hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the capacity of Rhizobium sp. strain PchAZM to reduce parasitism of chickpea by Orobanche foetida under greenhouse conditions, and assessed the relative impact of rhizobia on the expression of chickpea defense response against broomrape. Growth chamber experiments using Petri dishes revealed that rhizobia infection on chickpea roots reduced broomrape seed germination, and restricted the broomrape attachment to host <b>roots</b> while retarding <b>tubercle</b> formation and development by the parasite. In pot experiments, chickpea roots inoculated with rhizobia reduced {{the total number of}} broomrape by up to 90 %. Broomrape necrosis was observed both before and after parasite attachment to inoculated chickpea roots in Petri dishes and pot experiments. Reduction in infection was accompanied by enhanced levels of the defence-related enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase (POX). Increased levels of phenolics were recorded in the roots of rhizobia-inoculated plants grown in the presence of broomrape. The results suggest that rhizobia could be used for protection of chickpea against O. foetida. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn AccQ center dot Tag ultra {{performance}} liquid chromatographyphotodiode array-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (AccQ center dot Tag-UPLC-PDA-ESI-MS) {{method is}} presented {{here for the}} fast, robust, and sensitive quantification of N- 15 isotopologue enrichment of amino acids in biological samples, as for example in the special biotic interaction between the cultivated specie Brassica napus (rapeseed) and the parasitic weed Phelipanche ramosa (broomrape). This method was developed and validated using amino acid standard solutions containing N- 15 amino acid isotopologues and/or biological unlabeled extracts. Apparatus optimization, limits of detection and quantification, quantification reproducibility, and calculation method of N- 15 isotopologue enrichment are presented. Using this method, we could demonstrate that young parasite tubercles assimilate inorganic nitrogen as N- 15 -ammonium when supplied directly through batch incubation but not when supplied by translocation from host root phloem, contrary to N- 15 (2) -glutamine. N- 15 (2) -glutamine mobility from host <b>roots</b> to parasite <b>tubercles</b> followed by its low metabolism in tubercles suggests that the host-derived glutamine acts as an important nitrogen containing storage compound in the young tubercle of Phelipanche ramosa...|$|R
40|$|Food {{components}} {{can have}} biological activity and healthy properties. Some of them, produced by plants, are named phytochemicals. The diversity of phytochemicals is amazing and this term refers in fact {{to a wide}} variety of compounds. Some of them, biosynthesized from isoprene, are named terpenes, and an important group of biciclic monoterpenes, derived fromgeraniol, are named iridoids. Iridoids can have open structures (secoiridoids) or closed structures (really iridoids) and they appear usua lly as heteroside compounds, in particular as glycosides. They have beneficial effects on liver and bi -liary function. Moreover, they have also demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anti-carcinogenic and antiviral activity, and they can be used as antidote in mushroom intoxications, in particular, those caused byAmanita type. Iridoids are present in particular in plants such as olive, harpagophytum, the valerian plant, the gentian plant and the ash tree. All these plants have been reported to be used as traditional medicine inmany cultures. Nowadays, their leaves, <b>tubercles,</b> <b>roots,</b> seeds, and extracts are also considered important for pharmacology, and some of their active compounds have been identified. This review refers to the origin and biosynthetic pathways of iridoids. It describes the characteristics and properties of the plants mentioned above, and it also mentions the principal iridoids isolated from them...|$|R
40|$|Orobanche cumana (sunflower broomrape) is an {{obligatory}} and non photosynthetic root {{parasitic plant}} that specifically infects the sunflower. It {{is located in}} Europe and in Asia, where it can cause yield losses of over 80 %. More aggressive races have evolved, mainly around the Black Sea, and broomrape can rapidly spread to new areas. Breeding for resistance {{seems to be the}} most efficient and sustainable approach to control broomrape infestation. In our study, we used a population of 101 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), derived from a cross between the two lines HA 89 and LR 1 (a line derived from an interspecific cross with Helianthus debt/is). Rhizotrons, pots and field experiments were used to characterize all RILs for their resistance to 0, cumana race F parasitism at three post vascular connection life stages: (i) early attachment of the parasite to the sunflower <b>roots,</b> (ii) young <b>tubercle</b> and (iii) shoot emergence. In addition, RIL resistance to race G at young tubercle development stage was evaluated in pots. The entire population was genotyped, and QTLs were mapped. Different QTLs were identified for each race (F from Spain and G from Turkey) and for the three stages of broomrape development. The results indicate that there are several quantitative resistance mechanisms controlling the infection by 0, cumana {{that can be used in}} sunflower breeding...|$|R
40|$|Citation: Hildreth, W. R. Cowpeas for Kansas. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1902. Introduction: The {{great need}} of Kansas is more leguminous crops as cowpeas, soy beans, clover and alfalfa. The {{superior}} {{value of these}} crops lies principally in their ‘nitrogen gathering’ power. On their <b>roots</b> are found <b>tubercles.</b> These are caused by bacteria which possess the power to gather free nitrogen from the air and prepare it {{for the use of}} the plant. In this way great stores of the most valuable as well as the most deficient of plant foods are obtained. The <b>tubercles</b> on the <b>roots</b> of cowpeas are larger than on the roots of any other legume, besides they form in Kansas soils without inoculation which is not the case with the soy bean. Another value of legumes is their high protein content. This constituent is very deficient in most Kansas feeds, as corn, prairie hay and the like, so in order to supply the need the feeder must buy high priced nitrogenous foods or raise leguminous crops. The cowpea is equal to alfalfa in protein content. The power of legumes to enrich the soil by adding nitrogen also adds to their value. Even when the hay crop is removed about one half of the nitrogen content of the plant remains in the roots and wasted leaves. The cow pea is superior to the soy bean as a fertilizer, and has the advantage of clover and alfalfa in being produced in one year or as a second crop. Since legumes have an extensive and deep root system they act as nature’s subsoiler. This deep root system enables the plant to bring plant food to the surface from a great depth, to loosen and aerate the soil and to withstand drought...|$|R
