As a result, the previous lack of planning for western style car usage is now a problem for local governments. Due to this rise in car use and a shift in retail market demand, developers began constructing large shopping malls at a rapid pace, usually on the city’s outskirts, with the first mall opening in 1997. Malls pose another challenge for current urban planning, as people shop less often, but for longer periods and are less likely to walk to the shops, however are not re-locate closer to the shopping malls.|$|E

Many other aspects of their transport and urban form are also conducive to low levels of automobile dependence. However, urban China is changing rapidly with very high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation</b> {{and a number of}} policies and factors that are pushing their transport systems towards greater reliance on cars and motor cycles. Development of quality public transport systems appears not to be keeping pace with the emphasis on private transport. This paper briefly explores how Chinese cities compared on key transport and urban form factors to a large sample of other cities from around the world in 1995. It further examines a range of important policies and factors that are shaping Chinese urban transport systems and explores the potential of Chinese cities to embrace the ideal of "sustainable urban transport", as opposed to increasing automobile dependence...|$|R

Taking a broad view of automobility culture to include cars, infrastructure, legal systems, medical services, and populist views of motoring, it is argued that reducing the human cost <b>of</b> <b>motorisation</b> (and making motorised mobility more sustainable) cannot be achieved only by technical fixes to the car.

40|$|In recent decades, highly {{motorised}} countries, such as Australia, {{have witnessed}} {{significant improvements in}} population health through reductions in fatalities and injuries from road traffic crashes. In Australia, concerted efforts {{have been made to}} reduce the road trauma burden since road fatalities reached their highest level in in the early 1970 s. Since that time, many improvements have been made drawing on various disciplines to reduce the trauma burden (e. g., road and vehicle design, road user education, traffic law enforcement practices and enforcement technologies). While road fatalities have declined significantly since the mid- 1970 s, road trauma remains a serious public health concern in Australia. China has recently become the largest car market in the world (Ma, Li, Zhou, Duan, & Bishai, 2012). This rapid motorisation has been accompanied by substantial expansion of the road network as well as a large road trauma burden. Road traffic injuries are a major cause of death in China, reported as accounting for one third of all injury-deaths between 2002 and 2006 (Ma et al., 2012). In common with Australia, China has experienced a reported decline in fatalities since 2002 (see Hu, Wen & Baker, 2008). However, there remains a strong need for action in this area as <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation</b> continue to climb in China. In Australia, a wide range of organisations have contributed to the improvements in road safety including government agencies, professional organisations, advocacy groups and research centres. In particular, Australia has several highly regarded and multi-disciplinary, university-based research centres that work across a range of road safety fields, including engineering, intelligent transportation systems, the psychology of road user behaviour, and traffic law enforcement. Besides conducting high-quality research, these centres fulfil an important advocacy role in promoting safer road use and facilitating collaborations with government and other agencies, at both the national and international level. To illustrate the role of these centres, an overview will be provided of the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q), which was established in 1996 and has gone on to become a recognised world-leader in road safety and injury prevention research. The Centre’s research findings are used to provide evidence-based recommendations to government and have directly contributed to promoting safer road use in Australia. Since 2006, CARRS-Q has also developed strong collaborative links with various universities and organisations in China to assist in building understanding, connections and capacity to assist in reducing the road trauma burden.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the interdependence of transport strategy and the portion of urban land given over to traffic attains its full meaning only {{in the light of}} drastically different spatial/physical characteristics of world cities. Advocates of the pro-automobile transport strategy are persistent in their support of the hypothesis that along with the increase in the degree <b>of</b> <b>motorisation</b> <b>of</b> a population, the share of urban land needed for transport unavoidably increases. But it is exactly this spatial aspect that makes transport strategy of the large, proautomobile oriented US cities (that occupy few thousand square kilometres and have extremely low population densities), completely inadequate for the compact, densely populated cities of developing countries and countries in transition. Distinctive features of large cities of the developing world and countries in transition: monocentric, compact spatial structure and extremely high urban densities, are the main causes of extremely high volumes of motorized traffic per unit of urbanized area (in spite of their very low levels of motorization). Supply of urban roads per capita in these metropolises is not going to significantly improve, whatever length of new urban roads they (manage to) construct. That makes them completely unsuitable for pro-automobile transport strategy and, at the same time, very suitable for development of light rail and metro systems, and rigorous traffic limitation policy.

40|$|When {{observing the}} {{development}} and operation of modern cities, one can quickly {{come to the conclusion}} that in the recent years the chief factor of the spatial-structural transformation of cities in Poland (though not only there) and the spatial behaviour of their residents has been motorisation, and more precisely, the car. This is so because the car, while facilitating and intensifying mobility, makes it possible to draw places of residence apart from those of goal implementation. The ever-growing number of cars moving around a city leads to disturbances in street traffic, makes the service of residents worse, causes many road accidents, and brings about unfavourable qualitative changes in the environment. That is why in many recent conceptions of urban development there appear measures intended to restrict the use of cars, which is one of the ways leading to the construction of ‘a city for people’.

Traffic congestion on roadways, in ferryboat ports and at state borders during the summer months and year-round lines of cars going to or returning from work are a regular presence in traffic in most urban and tourism destinations in Croatia, {{as well as in the}} rest of Europe. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can be implemented in urban and tourism centres, which, for example, have no opportunity for increasing the capacity of their traffic networks by constructing new, or expanding existing, transportation infrastructure, and no opportunity for increasing parking capacities. The only solution would be to optimise traffic networking by introducing intelligent technologies. Intelligent transportation systems and services represent a coupling of information and telecommunication technologies with transportation means and infrastructure to ensure greater efficiency in the mobility of people and goods. ITS implementation helps to provide better information to motorists and travellers (tourists); improve traffic and tourist flows, cargo transportation, public passenger-transportation; facilitate the work of emergency services; enable electronic traffic-related payments; enhance the security of people in road traffic; and monitor weather conditions and the environment. To motorists the system provides guidance to roads on which traffic is less intense, guidance to available parking spaces, and guidance, for example, to a good restaurant or interesting tourist attraction. his paper focuses, in particular, on ITS application in city and tourism destinations in connection with parking problems.
