40|$|Abstract: The way rubbish {{is handled}} is often {{restricted}} {{by the development}} level of a country and the urban economy. Before the 1980 's, <b>rubbish</b> was mostly <b>dumped</b> and buried {{on the outskirts of}} cities in China. There was no sanitation control in the municipal <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumping</b> and burial site. Since there is neither capping {{on the top of the}} site nor means to prevent the leakage at the base of the dumping and burial site, the rubbish is in contact with the earth's surface and the leachate infiltrates through soil. At present, the Chinese government is constructing modern landfill in accordance with the international standards for sanitation landfill. Municipal <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumping</b> and burial sites will be closed and remediated. The geological environment problems of municipal <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumping</b> and burial must be studied in order to close and remediate them successfully. The <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumping</b> and burial sites and the combined relevant rubbish materials were investigated in China. The impact of leachate from <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumping</b> and burial sites on surface water, soil and rock, and groundwater water was analysed, together with gas movement and enrichment in the geological environmental. As a result, the geological environmental problems of municipal <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumping</b> and burial were understood. The study provides a basis for municipal <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumping</b> and burial site remediation in the cities of China.

40|$|Trabajo Fin de Máster: Master en investigación Básica y Aplicada en Recursos Cinegéticos. The {{circulation}} of Avian Influenza viruses (AIV) in wild birds has been intensively studied, {{due to their}} implication in the maintenance and spread of these viruses. Most of these {{studies have focused on}} natural aquatic environments, where birds aggregate and in which viral survival is enhanced. Nevertheless, other places such as <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumps</b> also lead to massive aggregation of wild birds, including some known AIV reservoirs. Particularly, during the winter months, Spanish <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumps</b> harbor a great number of wintering wild birds. This is the case in <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumps</b> in the province of Ciudad Real (community of Castilla-La Mancha, Spain), where these animals also visit the surrounding wetlands where AIV circulation had been detected in previous years. In this study we analyzed the prevalence of AIV genome excretion in sympatric species that use two <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumps</b> in Ciudad Real, during the wintering season 2014 - 2015 and determined temporal, spatial and species variation.

It was the centre of administrative power in Egypt, until it was ordered burnt in 1168 by its own vizier, Shawar, to keep its wealth {{out of the hands of}} the invading Crusaders. The remains of the city were eventually absorbed by nearby Cairo, which had been built to the north of Fustat in 969 when the Fatimids conquered the region and created a new city as a royal enclosure for the Caliph.

The centre of his capital city consisted of mostly farmland, with small settlements—mostly wooden, temporary and ad hoc—on either side. There was little evidence that Canberra was planned, and the lake and Parliamentary Triangle at the heart of Griffin's plan was but a paddock. Royal Canberra Golf Course, and Acton Racecourse and a sports ground were located on the pastoral land that was to become the West Lake, and people had to disperse the livestock before playing sport. A <b>rubbish</b> <b>dump</b> stood on the northern banks of the location of central basin, and no earth had been moved since Griffin's departure three decades earlier.|$|E

These buildings were the Headquarters of the depot and have survived in military/MoD use to this day. The depot had satellite sites within Cheadle Hulme, these being Site Number 5, general storage (beneath the Eden Park road housing development which, until the housing development began still maintained the internal road layout and building foundations) and site number 6 (motor transport storage area) which is now covered by part of the Hursthead housing estate. Three large (150ft × 250ft) steel built, vehicle storage sheds stood at the junction of Malmesbury Road and Lyncombe Close/Tintern Road. The last of these sheds survived well into the 1980s and was latterly used by the local council as a <b>rubbish</b> <b>dump.</b> This stood between Tollard Close and Tintern Road.

Most of the birds (77 %, [*]=[*] 171) were recorded foraging directly on an area where rubbish had been thrown, while a minor fraction (16 %) was seen on neighbouring recultivated grassy areas. Dumps were used as an additional food source probably in areas where natural foraging grounds are limited. The increased frequency of observations during the summer months probably resulted from the greater nutritional needs of large nestlings which force the adults to find alternative food sources or foraging habitat shift by non-breeding birds...|$|R

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century the English had established control and imposed the harsh Penal Laws on the Catholic majority of Ireland's population.

Under the Restoration, Ormonde, the then Lord Deputy of Ireland made the first step toward modernising Dublin by ordering that the houses along the river Liffey had to face the river and have high quality frontages.

Rob Holdway, director of environmental consultancy Giraffe Innovation, presented the programme and set the contestants regular challenges.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 1 st International White Stork Conference celebrado en Zielona Góra (Poland) del 4 al 6 de septiembre de 2014. The Spanish {{populations of}} the White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) {{suffered}} a marked decline in Spain until de 1980 s {{of the last century}} due to the alteration of their feeding areas. However, in the last decades those populations have recovered mainly due to new food resources: <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumps.</b> An unlimited supply of food all year round also means exposure to several human-generated pollutants. Individual storks feeding there must develop different mechanisms of adaptation to allow use of this resource without a detrimental health status. We sampled chicks from four colonies along a feeding gradient, i. e. individuals being fed completely natural food to those exclusively with food items from <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumps.</b> Blood samples allowed the evaluation of nutritional and general health status and oxidant/antioxidant balance. Regarding nutritional status, chicks fed with natural food showed lower concentrations of albumin, glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides, indicative of lower ingestion rates. The AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase, as indicators of hepatic alterations, and creatinine and creatine kinase, as indicators of renal function, showed no differences between populations, indicating no differences regarding health status. Deregulation of oxidant / antioxidant balance is a main mechanism of damage of many pollutants. We found significant differences in the oxidative damage indicative parameters, with lower values of LDH, plasmatic MDA and ROMs in individuals which fed in <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumps.</b> These results agree with higher values of two non-enzymatic endogenous antioxidants, i. e. glutathione and uric acid, in these individuals. The use of <b>rubbish</b> <b>dumps</b> as areas to obtain food have allowed White Storks to increase their population numbers. They show a better nutritional status due to the high presence of food, without alteration of their health status or their oxidant / antioxidant balance. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
