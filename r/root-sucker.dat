2500|$|The Romans, {{and more}} {{recently}} the Italians, used to plant elms in vineyards as supports for vines. Lopped at three metres, the elms' quick growth, twiggy lateral branches, light shade and <b>root-suckering</b> made them ideal trees for this purpose. The lopped branches were used for fodder and firewood. Ovid in his Amores characterizes the elm as [...] "loving the vine": ulmus amat vitem, vitis non deserit ulmum (:the elm loves the vine, the vine does not desert the elm), and the ancients spoke of the [...] "marriage" [...] between elm and vine.|$|R
50|$|No authoritatively {{identified}} {{examples are}} known, but a non-grafted field elm cultivar {{would be expected}} to survive through <b>root-suckering.</b> One tree was planted in 1893 as U. campestris monumentalis at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottowa, Canada. Three specimens supplied by Späth to the RBGE in 1902 as U. campestris monumentalis may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm); the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden per se does not list the plant. Its appearance in Kelsey's 1904 catalogue, New York, in a separate entry from Wheatley Elm, suggests that the tree was introduced to the United States.|$|R
50|$|Schleichera oleosa (Lour.) Oken- Kusum tree, Ceylon oak, lac tree, gum lac tree. It {{is a large}} {{deciduous}} (nearly evergreen) {{tree with}} a comparatively short fluted trunk and a shade spreading crown. It is frost and drought hardy and is subject to damage by grazing. It produces <b>root-suckers</b> freely, and it has good cropping power. The wood is very hard and reddish brown. This tree is noted for its growth of new leaves that are bright red. In India the growth of these bright red leaves happens around March. The leaves are pinnate, with each leaf having 2-4 leaflets. The tree is host to Kusumi Lac, which is native to India. Its seeds {{are the source of}} Kusum oil.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Klemmer' is a tall, {{fast growing}} tree, with a {{straight}} cylindrical stem and ascending branches, initially forming a narrow, conical or pyramidal head which later broadens, and producing numerous <b>root-suckers</b> and some epicormic shoots. The bark, smooth in young trees, is later fissured. The leaves are ovate, up to 7.5 cm (3 in) long (Krüssmann says up to 10 cm) and up to 5.0 cm (2 in) broad, shortly acuminate at the apex, the upper surface dark green, scabrous and glabrescent, the margins slightly crispate. The seed is situated close to the notch of the samara. The timber is reddish in hue, strong but liable to warping. Feneau noted (1902) that young trees were susceptible to frost damage.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Grazing is {{a complex}} process {{involving}} the simultaneous occurrence of both trampling and defoliation. Clonal plants are a common feature of heavily grazed ecosystems where large herbivores inflict the simultaneous pressures of trampling and defoliation on the vegetation. We test the hypothesis that physiological integration (resource sharing between interconnected ramets) may help plants {{to deal with the}} interactive effects of trampling and defoliation. Methods In a field study, small and large ramets of the <b>root-suckering</b> clonal tree Populus simonii were subjected to two levels of trampling and defoliation, while connected or disconnected to other ramets. Plant responses were quantified via survival, growth, morphological and stem mechanical traits. Key Results Disconnection and trampling increased mortality, especially in small ramets. Trampling increased stem length, basal diameter, fibrous root mass, stem stiffness and resistance to deflection in connected ramets, but decreased them in disconnected ones. Trampling decreased vertical height more in disconnected than in connected ramets, and reduced stem mass in disconnected ramets but not in connected ramets. Defoliation reduced basal diameter, leaf mass, stem mass and leaf area ratio, but did not interact with trampling or disconnection. Conclusions Although clonal integration did not influence defoliation response, it did alleviate the effects of trampling. We suggest that by facilitating resource transport between ramets, clonal integration compensates for trampling-induced damage to fine root...|$|R
2500|$|Elm {{propagation}} methods {{vary according}} to elm type and location, and the plantsman's needs. Native species may be propagated by seed. In their natural setting native species, such as wych elm and European White Elm in central and northern Europe and Field Elm in southern Europe, set viable seed in ‘favourable' seasons. Optimal conditions occur after a late warm spring. After pollination, seeds of spring-flowering elms ripen and fall {{at the start of}} summer (June); they remain viable for only a few days. They are planted in sandy potting-soil at a depth of one centimetre, and germinate in three weeks. Slow-germinating American Elm will remain dormant until the second season. Seeds from autumn-flowering elms ripen in the Fall and germinate in the spring. Since elms may hybridize within and between species, seed-propagation entails a hybridisation risk. In unfavourable seasons elm seeds are usually sterile. Elms outside their natural range, such as Ulmus procera in England, and elms unable to pollinate because pollen-sources are genetically identical, are sterile and are propagated by vegetative reproduction. Vegetative reproduction is also used to produce genetically identical elms (clones). Methods include the winter transplanting of root-suckers; taking hardwood cuttings from vigorous one-year-old shoots in late winter, taking root-cuttings in early spring; taking softwood cuttings in early summer; grafting; ground and air layering; and micropropagation. A bottom heat of 18 degrees and humid conditions are maintained for hard- and softwood cuttings. The transplanting of <b>root-suckers</b> remains the easiest and commonest propagation-method for European Field Elm and its hybrids. For 'specimen' urban elms, grafting to wych-elm root-stock may be used to eliminate suckering or to ensure stronger root-growth. The mutant-elm cultivars are usually grafted, the ‘weeping' elms 'Camperdown' and 'Horizontalis' at , the dwarf cultivars 'Nana' and 'Jacqueline Hillier' at ground level. Since the Siberian Elm is drought-tolerant, in dry countries new varieties of elm are often root-grafted on this species.|$|R
30|$|The {{functional}} {{types of}} IAPs namely trees, shrubs and climbers {{are considered to}} {{have a negative impact}} on forest integrity, as illustrated by several species established in coastal KwaZulu-Natal (Geldenhuys 2013). The tree IAP Litsea glutinosa (Lour.) C.B.Rob. establishes vigorously in humid areas of sub-tropical forests. This light-demanding plant takes advantage of small canopy gaps in the forest, and its vegetative reproduction by <b>root-suckering</b> makes it an aggressive invader that poses a threat to biodiversity loss under canopy (Jacq et al. 2005). Similarly, Melia azedarach L. invades urban open space, wasteland and riparian zones (Henderson 2001). When the species undergoes physiological damage, it can reproduce by vegetative means through stump and root sprouts for its persistence in the environment (Tourn et al. 1999). The shrub Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King is restricted to frost-free areas and displays great plasticity in terms of growth form and in terms of the vegetation types it invades (Zachariades et al. 2002). The shrub Lantana camara L. grows aggressively and causes ecological destruction through loss of species diversity and more so due to its ability to dominate the understorey (Totland et al. 2005). Another evergreen perennial branched shrub (Olckers 1999), which is aggressive, extremely resilient, invades riparian, forest, grass and agricultural land is Solanum mauritianum Scop. (Witkowski and Garner 2008; Peerbhay et al. 2016). The climber Cardiospermum grandiflorum Sw. grows vigorously in damp conditions preferably along forest margins and watercourses of the subtropics (Simelane et al. 2011), climbing to heights of 6 [*]m up to 10 [*]m (Henderson 2001; Krings and Braham 2005). Once the invader is well established, it forms a smothering curtain which outcompete indigenous species for sunlight (Simelane et al. 2011). Another climber, Ipomoea purpurea (L.) Roth, grows vigorously twining above the vegetation around them for light (Defelice 2001). Furthermore, the vine is adapted to low light intensities found in the forest understorey (Defelice 2001). The plastic physiological and morphological traits of some IAPs allow for the efficient use of available resources for fast growth such as soil moisture, nutrients and light; hence, they can outperform less plastic native species (Leishman et al. 2007; Funk 2008; Kraft et al. 2015). Some native pioneer species exhibit traits like those of exotic species such as light and water efficiency. These traits make them to adapt, grow and persist in altered forest conditions that result in either increased or decreased resources essential for growth due to natural and anthropogenic environmental disturbances (Everard et al. 1995; Schulten et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|The {{degree to}} which fire {{influences}} plant species composition and abundance (referred to in this thesis as floristic patterns) in Australian tropical savannas {{has been the subject}} of debate. Available information emphasises floristic patterns rather than the mechanisms that determine patterns. The assessment of critical events in a plant’s life cycle (referred to in this thesis as critical life events) is necessary to understand population dynamics and therefore the processes that determine floristic patterns. Fire may affect population size through its influence on one or more critical life events including seed dormancy release, seed bank dynamics, seedling emergence, seedling survival and the survival and growth of juvenile and mature plants. This thesis presents data on floristic patterns in response to fire regimes in savannas of north-eastern Australia, a region with limited quantitative information on fire response at a community level; and contributes to the broader understanding of savanna function, through an examination of life cycle processes. The aims of the research were to examine the effect of fire regime on: a) 	floristic patterns in eucalypt savannas in the vicinity of Townsville, north-eastern Australia; and b) 	critical life events, to investigate mechanisms determining floristic patterns. To achieve these objectives, laboratory and shadehouse experiments were carried out and surveys of seedling emergence and vegetative post-fire regeneration were undertaken at four sites in the Townsville region. At one of these sites, Cape Cleveland, floristic patterns and critical life events were studied in detail using a manipulative fire experiment which examined three fire regimes between 1997 and 2001 : 1. 	Control: savanna burnt in the mid dry season (July) 1997 only. 2. 	Early burnt: savanna burnt in the mid dry season 1997 and early dry season (May) 1999. 3. 	Late burnt: savanna burnt in the mid dry season 1997 and late dry season (Oct) 1999. Five annual surveys of permanent plots at Cape Cleveland demonstrated a high degree of stability in species composition, however the abundance of several species was affected by fire regime. A significant increase in the abundance of various subshrubs, ephemeral and twining perennial forbs, and grasses was detected in the first year after fire, particularly following late dry season burning. The abundance of these species declined towards pre-fire levels in the second year after fire. The dominant grass Heteropogon triticeus significantly declined in abundance, and tree density increased, with fire intervals of four years. Investigations of critical life events detected mechanisms that determine floristic patterns. A pulse of seedling emergence of subshrubs and herbaceous species occurred in the post-fire wet season, with greatest seedling density following late dry season fires. This pulse of seedling emergence explained the increase in plant abundance documented in the year following fire. It resulted from seed dormancy release, triggered by multiple fire-related agents, including the removal of herbaceous cover, which increased germination of a range of species; and the exposure to: heat-shock, which increased the germination of a range of forbs; smoke, which promoted the germination of upright perennial forbs and grasses; and nitrate, which interacted with heat shock to increase germination of at least two forbs. The germinable soil seed bank was dominated by grasses and forbs, and seed banks of trees and shrubs were scarce and short-lived. Seasonal fluctuations were evident in the seed bank, which increased through the dry season to a maximum density in the late dry season, and declined to a minimum by the mid wet season. The high intensity late dry season fires reduced seed production by the dominant tree Corymbia clarksoniana in the year following burning, however the effect of fire on soil seed bank dynamics was limited due to the annual wet season decline in seed reserves that occurred irrespective of fire. These data indicate that late dry season fires promoted the emergence of a greater density of herb seedlings, compared with early dry season fires, by stimulating seed dormancy release in a higher proportion of seeds, and because more soil seed reserves were available in the late dry season to be affected by fire. Seedling survival of herbaceous species was higher for those that emerged from recently burnt rather than unburnt savanna. High rates of seedling mortality of perennial species, and the short lifespan of ephemeral forbs, explained the decline in plant abundance documented in the second year following fire. A moderate proportion of seedlings of common sprouter species developed the capacity to survive fire within one year of germination. Only five percent of C. clarksoniana seedlings survived in unburnt, and fewer in burnt savanna, three years after germination. In savanna that remained unburnt for four years, growth of juvenile trees above 2 m in height accounted for the observed increase in tree density. The capacity of the majority of species to sprout after fire, and rapid seed production of non-sprouter species, explained the stability in species composition documented in the annual floristic surveys at Cape Cleveland. Fire-promoted stem reproduction via <b>root-suckering</b> explained the increase in abundance detected in the subshrub Breynia oblongifolia following burning. This thesis provides important information on the processes that drive tropical savanna function. It indicates that seedling recruitment is a process that limits population growth. Seedling recruitment of trees and shrubs is scarce and episodic, apparently linked to high rainfall years. The seedling recruitment of subshrubs and herbaceous species is driven by opportunities for seed dormancy release, which are primarily restricted to fire events, and limited by the low to moderate soil seed bank density and poor levels of seedling survival. Growth of juvenile trees beyond 2 m in height, and hence to reproductive maturity, requires fire-free intervals of at least four years and is therefore an event that is restricted by fire and limits population growth. The high proportion of sprouting species enables plant persistence, so that juvenile and mature plant survival are life events that provide population resilience. For ephemeral species, the soil seed bank provides a storage mechanism that provides population resilience. This thesis provides practical information to improve the management of this widespread and important ecosystem. Conservation management of these savannas will need to balance the role of regular fires in maintaining the diversity of herbaceous species with the requirement of fire intervals of at least four years for allowing recruitment, and therefore population maintenance, of trees. While late dry season fires may cause some tree mortality, the use of occasional late fires will promote dense seedling recruitment of herbaceous species, which may be necessary to maintain sustainable populations of many grasses and forbs...|$|R
