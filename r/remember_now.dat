[...] Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled [...] "Southern Storm", for the May 1935 issue of Esquire magazine. Erik Larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 1999 book, Isaac's Storm:I <b>remember</b> <b>now</b> that {{it seemed as if}} we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. [...] As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away. [...] I felt as if the sea was going to break {{over the edge of the}} bowl and come puring down upon us.|$|E
2500|$|Bryant and James [...] {{believed}} the 2012 team would win against the Dream Team, the 1992 Olympic team {{considered by some}} the greatest sports team ever assembled. Bryant said, [...] "hey were a lot older, at kind {{of the end of}} their careers. We have just a bunch of young racehorses, guys that are eager to compete". Dream Team member Charles Barkley said that he [...] "just started laughing" [...] upon hearing Bryant's comment and thought the 1992 team would win by double digits. Michael Jordan added: [...] "For [...] to compare those two teams {{is not one of the}} smarter things he ever could have done... <b>Remember</b> <b>now,</b> they learned from us. We didn't learn from them". Bird joked, [...] "They probably could. I haven't played in 20 years and we're all old now." [...] Bryant later clarified that he thought the 1992 team was better, but it was [...] "ludicrous" [...] to think his team could not beat the Dream Team in one game. [...] "You didn't ask me if we could beat them in a 7-game series", he said.|$|E
2500|$|Pisemsky {{spent the}} first ten {{years of his life}} in the small {{regional}} town of Vetluga where his father served as Mayor. Later he moved with his parents to the countryside. Pisemsky described the years he spent there in Chapter 2 of People of the Forties, an autobiographical novel in which he figured under the name of Pasha. Fond of hunting and horseback riding, the boy received scant education: his tutors were a local deacon, a defrocked drunkard, and a strange old man who was known to have toured the area for decades, giving lessons. Aleksey learned reading, writing, arithmetics, Russian and Latin from them. In his autobiography Pisemsky wrote: [...] "Nobody had ever forced me to learn, and I wasn't an avid learner, but I read a lot and that was my passion: by 14 I consumed, in translation, of course, most of Walter Scott's novels, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, Faublas, Le Diable boiteux, The Serapion Brethren, a Persian novel called Haggi Baba... As for children's books, I couldn't stand them and, as far as I <b>remember</b> <b>now,</b> considering them very silly." [...] Pisemsky wrote scornfully of his primary education and regretted failing to learn any languages besides Latin. He found in himself, however, a natural predisposition to mathematics, logic and aesthetics.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara {{interpreted}} the words [...] "knowing {{the mind of}} the most High" [...] in [...] to mean that Balaam knew how to tell the exact moment when God was angry. [...] The Gemara taught that this was related to what Micah meant (in [...] in the haftarah for the parashah) when he told the Israelites (quoting God): [...] "O My people, <b>remember</b> <b>now</b> what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; [...] [...] [...] that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord." [...] The Gemara taught that by the words [...] "that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord," [...] God meant to say to the Israelites, [...] "You should know how many acts of charity I performed for you, in that I did not become angry all that time, in the days of wicked Balaam; for had I become angry at that time, no Israelite would have remained alive or been spared." [...] And the Gemara indicated that this is why Balaam told Balak in [...] "How can I curse whom God has not cursed? or how shall I become angry, when the Lord has not become angry?" [...] For Balaam knew that God was not angry at the Israelites. [...] The Gemara thus concluded that for all of the time of the Balaam story, God had not been angry.|$|E
2500|$|Harras also commented, [...] "As soon as I saw {{the sketch}} by Walter [...] and heard Louise's take on him, I {{knew we had}} the {{character}} I wanted. Jackson [...] redrew the page, patching in the shadowy Apocalypse where the Owl had been. But the genesis was clearly Walt and Weezie's." [...] Guice admitted to difficulty recalling the details behind redrawing the last page of issue #5: [...] "The best I can <b>remember</b> <b>now</b> is putting his look together pretty much right on the pencil page—just adding bits of costuming business which hinted toward his true appearance when we'd eventually see him in full reveal. I don't believe {{there was even a}} character sketch done for him at that point—I planned on making sense of it all later on, but by then I was gone and others had that concern." [...] Apocalypse's silhouette in issue #5 does not match up with his full appearance in issue #6, suggesting the possibility that Guice was using Simonson's sketch as a reference for issue #6 but did not have access to it earlier, necessitating that he come up with his own design for issue #5. Walter Simonson himself has downplayed his role in the character's creation, saying that Guice was responsible for creating the design and that he, Simonson, merely modified it later: [...] "I did not co-create Apocalypse. However, I wish I had. Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice created him. He appeared in a few panels {{at the end of one}} of Jackson’s last X-FACTORs, so I am the first artist to use him extensively in stories. And I kind of juiced up his physique a bit." ...|$|E
