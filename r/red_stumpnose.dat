There are also old records from Madagascar and Mauritius, but the validity of these is doubtful. This demersal fish grows to a maximum length of 50 cm and a recorded mass of 4.2 kg. It is a slow-growing species showing late sexual maturity, and is closely related to the <b>Red</b> <b>Stumpnose.</b> It is found above rocky bottoms and reefs, in water up to 100 m in depth and is often caught from the beach by anglers. Juveniles mature in seaweed beds and feed on mollusks, crustaceans, worms and fish. Adults are benthic feeders, living on crustaceans, sea urchins and polychaete worms.|$|E
