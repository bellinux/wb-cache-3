5|$|Often {{encountered}} {{resting on}} the bottom during daytime, the <b>reticulate</b> whipray is a predator of bottom-dwelling invertebrates and bony fishes. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished at first by yolk and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). Females bear litters of up to five pups in summer, following a gestation period of a year. The <b>reticulate</b> whipray is fished in Southeast Asia {{and parts of the}} Indian Ocean for meat, skin, cartilage, and other purposes. It is highly susceptible to population depletion because of its large size, inshore habits, and low reproductive rate, and is additionally threatened by extensive habitat degradation. Consequently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} <b>reticulate</b> whipray as Vulnerable. Its large size, inshore habitat preferences, and slow {{reproductive}} rate render it susceptible to overfishing. Although specific data is lacking, significant declines in overall ray catches {{have been documented}} within its range, including in the Gulf of Thailand, the Arafura Sea, and off Pakistan. Habitat degradation also threatens this species: over 30% of the mangroves in Indonesia and Malaysia have been cleared since 1980, while pollution and destructive fishing practices may have also taken their toll. Australian waters offer the <b>reticulate</b> whipray a refuge from fishing pressure, as there it is not targeted commercially and the installation of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs) have reduced bycatch mortality. However, there are indications of increasing illegal fishing in Australian territory by Indonesian vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} Phallus species known with a pinkish-colored cap is P.rubicundus; its conical cap has a surface that is wrinkled, not <b>reticulate.</b> Other similar species include P.hadriani, {{which has a}} purple volva, P.macrosporus, which has a reddish volva, and P.formanosus, which has a pale pink stipe and volva.|$|E
5|$|The <b>reticulate</b> whipray {{is closely}} related to H. undulata and H. leoparda, which share much of its range. All three species are very similar in size, shape, and color pattern, {{resulting}} in a long history of taxonomic confusion that only recently is starting to be untangled. In 2004, Mabel Manjaji described the 'uarnak' species complex, containing H. fai, H. gerrardi, H. jenkinsii, H. leoparda, H. toshi, H. uarnak, and H. undulata, plus three more undescribed species. The <b>reticulate</b> whipray itself varies in appearance throughout its range, and further taxonomic comparisons are required to determine whether its spotted and reticulated color morphs in fact represent different species. Alternate common names for this ray include coachwhip ray, leopard stingray, longtail stingray, and marbled stingray; some of these names are shared by other, similar species.|$|E

5|$|The <b>reticulate</b> whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, {{including}} crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and bony fishes. In the western Indian Ocean, about two-thirds of its diet consists of fishes, in particular ponyfish and anchovies, with shrimps and other crustaceans making up most of the remainder. By contrast, rays in Australian waters are apparently not piscivorous, and are known to consume penaeid prawns. Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. multiparous, and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E
40|$|Increased <b>reticulated</b> {{platelets}} in dialysis patients. The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the percent <b>reticulated</b> platelets and platelet counts in patients on chronic hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and normal volunteers. The relationship between the percent <b>reticulated</b> platelets and the platelet count can then be used to determine the rate of platelet turnover. Platelet rich plasma was obtained, platelets were fixed and incubated with thiazole orange and analyzed for the percent <b>reticulated</b> platelets by flow cytometry. Normal controls had a mean of 2. 77 ± 0. 17 % <b>reticulated</b> platelets while peritoneal dialysis patients had a mean percent <b>reticulated</b> platelets of 6. 92 ± 0. 68 (P < 0. 00001). Chronic hemodialysis patients had a mean percent <b>reticulated</b> platelets of 8. 21 ± 0. 36 (P < 0. 00001 vs. normal controls and P = 0. 05 vs. peritoneal dialysis patients). Platelet counts did not differ significantly among the three groups. The identity of <b>reticulated</b> platelets was confirmed in experiments measuring platelet specific glycoproteins, experiments using RNase, and in mixing experiments with normal and uremic platelets and plasma. We conclude that dialysis patients have a marked increase in circulating <b>reticulated</b> platelets compared to normal controls, indicating accelerated platelet turnover. Increased platelet activation and turnover may contribute to the qualitative platelet dysfunction observed in dialysis patients...|$|R

Each of the 4 males and 1 females in our study (age range: 16 to 57 years; mean age: 34 years) had a single, 4 - 6 mm large, black macule with irregular, fingerlike extensions at the periphery. All lesions were situated on the upper back and surrounded by numerous sun-induced freckles. Dermatoscopic examination revealed irregularly formed 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 meshes 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 and confirmed the <b>reticulated</b> pattern seen clinically. <b>Reticulated</b> lentigo presented mostly in individuals with skin type 1, red to blond hair, and blue eyes.

5|$|There {{are several}} other red-pored, bluing boletes {{that could be}} {{confused}} with S.amygdalinus. The poisonous European species Rubroboletus satanas and its North American counterpart R.eastwoodiae have lighter colored caps and a <b>reticulate</b> pattern on the stipe. B.subvelutipes is a highly variable species from eastern North America that includes red in its range of cap colors, and has a fuzzy coating of hairs near the base of its stipe; it may represent a group of species. Another similar species is B.luridiformis, found in North America and Northern Europe under both broadleaf trees and conifers. Unlike S.amygdalinus, however, B.luridiformis has a dark brown to nearly blackish-brown cap, and a yellow stipe with a dense covering of red pruina (dots).|$|E
5|$|The overall {{colouration}} of Caloboletus calopus, {{with its}} pale cap, yellow pores and red stipe, is not shared {{with any other}} bolete.

Fruit bodies in poor condition could be confused with Xerocomellus chrysenteron but the stipes of this species are not reticulated. Edible species such as B.edulis lack a red stipe. It closely resembles the similarly inedible C.radicans, which lacks the redness on the stipe. Like C.calopus, the western North American species C.rubripes also has a bitter taste, similarly coloured cap, and yellowish pores that bruise blue, but it lacks reticulation on its reddish stipe.
