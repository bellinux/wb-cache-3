30|$|In {{order to}} check whether the linear or {{nonlinear}} {{relationship between the}} solar F 10.7 index and Sq amplitude depends on the latitude and longitude or not, we plotted {{the location of the}} 69 investigated geomagnetic stations on the world map with the blue and <b>red</b> <b>triangles</b> in Figure  1. Here, the blue and <b>red</b> <b>triangles</b> represent the geomagnetic stations that had linear or nonlinear relationships, respectively. In this case, because both blue and <b>red</b> <b>triangles</b> were very scattered on this map, there was no clear locality observed in the distribution of the investigated stations, thus indicating a nonlinear relationship.|$|R

5|$|Several {{species of}} Tapeigaster flies have been {{collected}} from the fruit bodies, including T.cinctipes, T.annulipes, and T.nigricornis; the latter species uses the fruit bodies as a host to rear its young. Fruit bodies in Springbrook National Park have been observed to attract nocturnal insects such as beetles, native cockroaches and crickets (white-kneed cricket (Papuastus spp.) and thorny cricket), as well as giant rainforest snails (Hedleyella falconeri) and <b>red</b> <b>triangle</b> slugs (Triboniophorus graeffei), which voraciously consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} prisoners were {{distinguishable}} by triangular pieces of cloth, called Winkel, sewn onto on their jackets below their prisoner number. Political prisoners had a <b>red</b> <b>triangle,</b> Jehovah's Witnesses had purple, criminals had green, and so on. The nationality of the inmate was indicated by a letter stitched onto the Winkel. Jews had a yellow triangle, overlaid {{by a second}} Winkel if they also fit into a second category. Uniquely at Auschwitz, prisoners were tattooed with their prisoner number, on the chest for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians.|$|E

As the war intensified, the Dalforce volunteers were given only three to four days of training {{and sent to the}} war front with elementary weapons. Lacking uniforms, the volunteers improvised by wearing a <b>red</b> <b>triangle</b> on their blue shirts to avoid being mistaken for Japanese by the Australians.|$|E
