These cover the whole spectrum of civil and military aviation, examples being the de Havilland Dragon <b>Rapide</b> airliner of the 1930s, and the World War II (WWII) Spitfire fighter.

These combined forces were tasked with the mission of capturing the Arab Yibna (May 31), although the attack never materialized because the battalion took off completely unprepared, lost its way, and returned to its starting position. Also on May 30, four light planes set out from Sde Dov Airport to bomb the area of Isdud, although only one <b>Rapide</b> pilot spotted his target. He could not tell if any of the bombs actually exploded.|$|E

The depot serviced a range of aircraft that included the Westland Wapiti, Bristol Bulldog, Hawker Demon, de Havilland Dragon <b>Rapide,</b> Avro Cadet, Avro Anson, and North American NA-16. The NA-16 was later augmented by {{the purchase of the}} more advanced North American NA-33, which was licensed and built in Australia by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation as the CAC Wirraway. To cope with the Government's decision to rapidly expand the RAAF, a Recruit Training Section, incorporating the nascent School of Armaments and Signals, was formed under the depot's auspices by Flight Lieutenant Charles Eaton on 1March 1935; it was reorganised as Recruit Training Squadron on 1September 1936.
