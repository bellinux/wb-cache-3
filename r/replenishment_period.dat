ABSTRACT: Planning and managing replenishment policies of items {{plays an important role}} in supply chain management. In this paper, a new mathematical model is developed to optimize replenishment policies of a two-echelon inventory system under demand uncertainty. The system consists of one factory warehouse at the upper echelon and three supermarkets at the lower echelon. A special case of this model is where sales price and scheduled inventory <b>replenishment</b> <b>periods</b> are uniformly fixed over all echelons. Demand at the supermarkets is stochastic and stationary. Adopting a Markov decision process approach, the states of a Markov chain represent possible states of demand for milk powder product. The objective is to determine in each echelon of the planning horizon an optimal replenishment policy so that the long run sales revenue is maximized for a given state of demand. Using weekly equal intervals, the decisions of when to replenish additional units are made using dynamic programming over a finite period planning horizon. A numerical example demonstrates the existence of an optimal state-dependent replenishment policy and sales revenue over the echelons...|$|R

30|$|The {{number of}} {{customers}} and products has been a topic of intense investigation for decades in the integrated supply chain. Although researchers have given a considerable attention on the synchronization of the single-vendor single-customer integrated inventory system, the single-vendor multi-customer integrated inventory case has gotten little attention in regard. Lu [23] developed a one-vendor multi-customer integrated inventory model, while Parija and Sarker [25] extended their published work on single-vendor, single-customer, integrated production-inventory problems with lumpy delivery systems under perfect and imperfect production cycle situations [27]. Lu [23] argued that all the previous studies assumed that the vendor must know the customer’s holding and ordering costs, which are quite difficult to estimate unless the customer is willing to reveal the true values. Therefore, he considered another circumstance, in which {{the objective is to}} minimize the vendor’s total cost per year, subject to the maximum cost that the customer may be prepared to incur. Parija and Sarker [25] introduced the problem of determining the production start time and proposed a method that determines the cycle length and raw material ordering frequency for a long-range planning horizon. The cycle length is restricted to be an integer-multiple of all shipment intervals to the customers as an ideal situation, the solution to which may be sub-optimal. Viswanathan and Piplani [32] proposed a model to study and analyze the benefit of coordinating supply chain inventories by means of common replenishment epochs or time periods. A one-vendor multi-customer supply chain is considered for a single product. Under their strategies, the vendor specifies common <b>replenishment</b> <b>periods</b> and requires all customers to replenish only at pre-determined time periods. However, the authors did not include any inventory cost of the vendor in the model. In most papers dealing with integrated inventory models, the transportation cost is considered only as a part of fixed setup or replenishment cost. Ertogral et al. [9] studied how the results of incorporating transportation cost into the model influence the decision-making process under equal size shipment policies. A fundamental advance in the two-side cost structure is in recognizing how delivery-transportation costs apply to both sides.|$|R

40|$|For {{the lost}} sales {{inventory}} system we distinguish two different replenishment strategies.

Next we demonstrate that it may be more efficient in a lost sales system to use a different replenishment strategy. This alternative replenishment strategy however is more complex.

40|$|The primary {{assumptions}} {{with many}} multi-period inventory lot-sizing models are fixed time horizon and uniform demand variation within each period.

The model generates optimal replenishment schedules, order quantity and costs using a general ramp-type demand pattern that allows three-phase variation in demand. Shortages are allowed with full backlogging of demand and all possible replenishment scenarios that can be encountered when shortages and demand pattern variation occur in multi-period inventory modeling are also considered. With the aid of numerical illustrations, the advantages of allowing for variation in demand pattern within replenishment periods, whenever they occur, are explored.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "A buildup of foreign debt throughout the 1970 s and 1980 s [...] combined with low growth, falling commodity prices, and other economic difficulties [...] left many poor countries with significantly more debt than they could repay. International efforts to provide debt relief to 41 such heavily indebted poor countries have been ongoing for over a decade, and these efforts culminated in the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which was announced in 2005. MDRI eliminates eligible debt that countries owe to four international financial institutions [...] the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the African Development Bank's African Development Fund (ADF), and the Inter-American Development Bank (IaDB). To receive MDRI debt relief, countries must first complete the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, which the World Bank and IMF created in 1996 to relieve the debt burden of poor countries. In response to concerns over the continuing vulnerability of these countries, the World Bank and IMF enhanced the initiative to provide additional debt relief in 1999. Recognizing that recipient countries needed further assistance, MDRI was created to help accelerate countries' progress toward achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Of the 41 eligible countries, 23 countries have received debt relief under both the MDRI and HIPC Initiatives, and another 10 countries are receiving debt relief under just the HIPC Initiative. Donor governments (including the U. S. government) have agreed to help fund multilateral debt relief. Donor governments and each institution agree {{to the amount of}} MDRI costs each donor is to fund. To fund MDRI, governments may (1) provide funding in addition to their regular contributions or replenishments to the institutions, (2) provide their regular contributions early and generate credits through an approach known as early encashment, or (3) do both. If a government uses these early encashment credits to fully fund its share of MDRI, it is not required to provide additional funding for MDRI. The U. S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is currently using early encashment to fund the U. S. MDRI commitment. If the U. S. government provides full funding for IDA and ADF, then the early encashment approach will generate sufficient funding to cover MDRI during the current <b>replenishment</b> <b>periods.</b> However, in past replenishments, the U. S. government has not fully funded its replenishment contributions to international financial institutions on time, resulting in arrears to IDA and ADF totaling more than $ 400 million as of the end of fiscal year 2007. We have previously reviewed the HIPC Initiative and other debt-related issues. In response to a Congressional request for this report, GAO (1) estimated the overall cost of MDRI for four international financial institutions (IDA, IMF, ADF, and IaDB), and (2) evaluated the United States' approach to funding its share of MDRI costs. ...|$|R
