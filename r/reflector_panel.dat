On July 23, the Arecibo Observatory and Goldstone Solar System Radar combined to locate SOHO with radar, {{and to determine}} its location and attitude. SOHO was close to its predicted position, oriented with its side versus the usual front Optical Surface <b>Reflector</b> <b>panel</b> pointing toward the Sun, and was rotating at one revolutions every 53 seconds. Once SOHO was located, plans for contacting SOHO were formed. On August 3 a carrier was detected from SOHO, the first signal since June 25. After days of charging the battery, a successful {{attempt was made to}} modulate the carrier and downlink telemetry on August 8. After instrument temperatures were downlinked on August 9, data analysis was performed, and planning for the SOHO recovery began in earnest.|$|E

Several such arms are pivotably connected to a central structure. The arm can move in starburst fashion from a packaged stage, where all arms are vertical, to a deployed stage, where all arms are horizontal. All of the movable <b>reflector</b> <b>panels</b> are maintained at a predetermined angle to an axis of the reflector structure when the arms are pivoted.

50|$|Mount Abantos {{takes its}} name from abanto, a name for various species of {{vultures}} such as the black vulture, the red buzzard, the griffon vulture or African vulture, which can sometimes be seen flying on the mountain. During the reign of King Philip II, the mountain was also known as Buen Monte del Oso (lit. Good Bear Mountain) because of the abundance of big game species. At the top of Abantos is a weather station and an yellow electromagnetic signal <b>reflector</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{facelift}} {{left only}} the doors, the roof, and the rear quarter panels {{on the estate}} {{the same as the}} original model. Even the extractor vents on the rear doors were replaced by a panel bearing the name Mondeo. The most notable change was the introduction of the grille and larger, wraparound lighting units. The saloon version featured some distinctive rear lights. These incorporated an additional <b>reflector</b> <b>panel</b> that extended around the top and the side of the rear wings. Unlike the iterations seen on the heavily facelifted Scorpio and Mk IV Fiesta during the previous year, this facelift was well received.|$|E

5000|$|In late 1992, the {{exterior}} {{was given a}} minor update with a new grille and slightly redesigned tail lamp lenses (distinguished by a [...] "checkerboard" [...] pattern) for 1993 models. As with the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis, the Town Car received a larger update for the 1995 model year in late 1994. This facelift is best distinguished by the deletion of the fixed quarter glass in the rear doors along with the redesign of the side mirrors (enlarged and changed to body-color). Although the bumper largely remained unchanged, the front fascia is updated as the headlamp clusters are changed to a clear-lens design and separated from the grille. The grille was redesigned, returning to the 1990-1992 design in a surround fitting closer to the body. The rear fascia saw the trim between the tail lamps redesigned, featuring additional running lights, while the reverse lamps were moved from the outer edges of the <b>reflector</b> <b>panel</b> to the center, beneath the lid lock cover (similar to the 1985 - 1987 models).|$|E

40|$|Sound {{reflections}} {{from most}} finite surfaces, such as overhead <b>reflector</b> <b>panels,</b> include a component known as edge diffraction. Edge diffraction is the scattered energy {{required to maintain}} a continuous sound field despite the discontinuity in acoustical impedance presented by the scatterer. Edge diffraction can interfere with primary scattered energy to produce comb filtering at receiver locations. Several decades ago, the effect of changing the edge profile of loudspeaker boxes was investigated {{with the goal of}} producing a smoother frequency response. By rounding the edges of loudspeaker boxes, the edge diffraction could be decreased noticeably [H. F. Olson, J. Aud. Eng. Soc. 17 (1), 22 - 29 (1969) ]. In the current study, boundary element methods are used to study the results of rounding the edges of suspended <b>reflector</b> <b>panels</b> with the same intent of diminishing the boundary wave to achieve a smoother response across the audience area.

The longitudinal axis of the receiver is tilted at an acute angle with respect to the optical axis such that the distribution of focussed solar energy over the interior surface of the solar engine is optimized for dynamic solar energy conversion. Each <b>reflector</b> <b>panel</b> section comprises a flat, hexagonally shaped truss support framework and a plurality of beam members interconnecting diametrically opposed corners of the hexagonal framework recessed within which a plurality of (spherically) contoured reflector facets is disposed. The depth of the framework and the beam members is greater than the thickness of a reflector facet such that a reflector facet may be tilted (for controlling the effective focus of its reflected light through the receiver aperture) without protruding from the panel section...|$|E

Cost and technical factors were used in making the final choices for the panel conceptual design, which was a stiffened steel skin substrate with a bonded, acrylic overcoated, aluminized polyester film reflective surface. Computer simulations were run for the concentrator optics using the selected panel design, and experimentally determined specularity and reflectivity values. Intercept factor curves and energy to the aperture curves were produced. These curves indicate that surface errors of 2 mrad (milliradians) or less {{would be required to}} capture the desired energy for a Brayton cycle 816 C case.

Additionally, it is shown that a formed steel sheet substrate {{is a good choice}} for concentrator panels. The panel has good optical properties, acceptable forming tolerances, environmentally resistant substrate and stiffeners, and adaptability to low to mass production rates. Computer simulations of the concentrator optics were run using the selected <b>reflector</b> <b>panel</b> design.
