50|$|A typical {{recipe for}} tapioca jelly {{can be made}} by washing 2 tablespoonfuls of tapioca, pouring a pint of water over it, and soaking for three hours. The mixture is placed over low <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>simmered</b> until quite clear. If too thick, a little boiling water can be added.

50|$|In the Spanish Talgo-RD system, a {{constant}} spray {{of water is}} used to lubricate the metal surfaces, to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> wear. A Talgo-RD gauge changer is 20 metres long and 6 metres wide.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} fast growth, twining habit, {{attractive}} flowers, and tolerance for poor, dry soils, some morning glories are excellent vines for creating summer shade on building walls when trellised, thus keeping the building cooler <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> cooling costs.|$|R

30|$|The paper {{analyzed}} double diffusive convection {{induced by}} a horizontal wavy surface {{embedded in a}} porous medium taking the cross diffusion effect into account. The governing parabolic partial differential equations have been solved using the Keller box method. The convergence rate depends on the parametric values chosen. Computations show that the Lewis number enhances mass transfer while <b>reducing</b> <b>heat</b> transfer. The buoyancy ratio enhances both the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer rates. The surface geometry also {{plays a crucial role}} in controlling <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer rates. The effect of the Dufour number is to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>and</b> enhance mass transfer. The effect of the Soret number is the exact opposite of the Dufour effect. We observe <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer in the presence of cross diffusion terms.|$|R

50|$|Each of the All-in-Wonder Radeon cards {{is based}} on a Radeon chipset with extra {{features}} incorporated onto the board. AIW cards run at lower clock speeds (two exceptions are the AIW 9600XT/AIW X800XT faster/same speed) than their conventional counterparts to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> power consumption. In June 2008, AMD revived the product line with an HD model.|$|R
50|$|AMD PowerNow! is AMD's dynamic {{frequency}} scaling and power saving technology for laptop processors. The CPU's clock speed and VCore are automatically decreased when {{the computer is}} under low load or idle, to save battery power, <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> noise. The lifetime of the CPU is also extended because of reduced electromigration, which varies exponentially with temperature.|$|R
5000|$|The {{schoolmaster}} {{and family}} {{lived on the}} second floor above the classroom and the kitchen was located in a separate building to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> threat of fire.

50|$|Usually {{the reasons}} that might lie behind the desire to {{separate}} the user interface of a computer from the actual computer itself would be: securing computers away from users for corporate or government security, to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> noise in rooms with many computer operators, or to facilitate computer maintenance by placing all computers in very close proximity to one another.|$|R
50|$|For 2008, HRC {{planned to}} use {{pneumatic}} valve springs and an all-new chassis. The mass centralization of the 2007 model was thought to have gone too far, and instead the 2008 model is more open, <b>reducing</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> improving balance.

50|$|Direct {{coupling}} or {{earth sheltering}} {{occurs when a}} building uses earth as a buffer for the walls. The earth acts as a <b>heat</b> sink <b>and</b> can effectively mitigate temperature extremes. Earth sheltering improves the performance of building envelopes by <b>reducing</b> <b>heat</b> losses <b>and</b> also <b>reduces</b> <b>heat</b> gains by limiting infiltration.|$|R
50|$|It {{would be}} {{feasible}} {{to double the}} local store to 512 KiB per SPU leaving the total die area devoted to the SPU processors roughly unchanged. In this scenario, the SPU area devoted to the local store would increase to 60% while other areas shrink by half. Going this route would <b>reduce</b> <b>heat,</b> <b>and</b> increase performance on memory intensive workloads, but without yielding IBM much if any reduction in cost of manufacture.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} {{designed}} to face the sun with its triple-pane windows (U = 0.5) during the heating {{months of the year}} and turn its highly insulated back (U = 0.12) to the sun during the warmer months when heating isn't necessary.

5000|$|For {{building}} products, {{thermal emittance}} measurements are taken for wavelengths in the infrared. Determining the thermal emittance and solar reflectance of building materials, especially roofing materials, {{can be very}} useful for <b>reducing</b> <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> cooling energy costs in buildings. Combined index Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) {{is often used to}} determine the overall ability to reflect solar <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> release thermal <b>heat.</b> A roofing surface with high solar reflectance and high thermal emittance will reflect solar <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> release absorbed <b>heat</b> readily. High thermal emittance material radiates thermal heat back into the atmosphere more-readily than one with a low thermal emittance.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the inverse problem of in-line holography, applied to minimally destructive imaging of cold atom clouds. Absorption imaging near resonance provides a simple, but destructive measurement of atom column density. Imaging off resonance greatly <b>reduces</b> <b>heating,</b> <b>and</b> sequential images may be taken.

A minimally destructive, quantitative and high-resolution image of the atom cloud column density is then retrieved from a single diffraction pattern...|$|R
50|$|The {{episode was}} adapted {{in the third}} Year Two Space: 1999 novel The Space-Jackers by Michael Butterworth {{published}} in 1977. Butterworth would integrate ideas seen in earlier-draft scripts into this adaptation. Before the energy transfer, Kalthon was passively draining power from Alpha, causing <b>reduced</b> <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> equipment malfunctions. The scene where Maya and company observe her crystal sample transforming was retained, and a new epilogue showing she and Verdeschi being rescued from the disintegrating asteroid was added.|$|R
