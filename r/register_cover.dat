50|$|A third {{test method}} to {{determine}} if ductwork is leaking to the outside {{is to use a}} pressure pan, which is a <b>register</b> <b>cover</b> with a pressure tap for a hose connection. With the house pressurized (or depressurized) to 50 Pa (-50 Pa) using a blower door, a pressure gauge is attached to the pressure pan by means of a hose. If the pressure difference is near zero, this indicates that the ductwork associated with that particular register is not connected to the outside. A pressure 5 Pa or above indicates that the duct work is connected to or leaking to the outside. A smaller pressure difference indicates greater leakage. This method does not quantify duct leakage, but serves to identify locations of ductwork runs that are leaking to the outside. It is more of a qualitative measure, used for fault isolation.|$|E

50|$|In their cover business, Pfandbrief banks grant {{property}} finance, public sector, {{ship and}} aircraft loans. Pfandbriefe {{have an average}} maturity of about five to seven years. While Pfandbriefe tend {{to be associated with}} asset-backed securities they are fundamentally different. Pfandbrief cover-assets remain on the bank's balance sheet. By contrast, asset-backed securities are typically off-balance-sheet transactions. Another difference: Pfandbrief cover pools are dynamic. Their composition can and usually does change over time, depending on the maturities and on the newly <b>registered</b> <b>cover</b> assets. Due to the stringent legal provisions that govern their issuance Pfandbriefe are deemed particularly safe. An independent cover pool trustee appointed by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) records cover assets and cover asset replacements in the <b>cover</b> <b>register.</b> In the event of the Pfandbrief issuer's insolvency, Pfandbrief investors have a preferential claim on the cover assets in the <b>cover</b> <b>register</b> because <b>cover</b> pool assets are not included in insolvency proceedings. There has not been a Pfandbrief default since 1901. Property financings may be included in the cover pool only up to 60% of the prudently calculated mortgage lending value. The same holds true for ship and aircraft financings. Public sector loans are 100% eligible for cover.|$|R

In the Register's discourse of politics, Niles used what he called [...] "magnanimous disputation", trying to present the arguments of both sides fairly and objectively, a policy which has made the paper an important source for the history of the period.|$|R

He resisted successfully certain claims of Archbishop Bourchier over the abbey, which were decided in the abbot's favour upon appeal to Rome. In 1480 Wallingford was appointed, by the general chapter of Benedictines at Northampton, Visitor of all Benedictine monasteries in the Diocese of Lincoln, but he commissioned William Hardwyk and John Maynard to conduct the visitation in his place.|$|R

30|$|The {{second source}} of data is the {{employment}} statistics register of the German Federal Office of Labour (Beschäftigtenstatistik), which covers all workers or trainees registered by the social insurance system. The <b>register</b> <b>covers</b> about   80 % of workers in Western Germany and about   85 % in Eastern Germany. However, almost all workers {{in the private sector}} are covered by the social insurance system, so the data we use covers nearly 100 % of workers. Information on workers includes basic demographics, start and end dates of employment spells, occupation and industry, earnings, qualifications (school and post-school), and a plant identification number. A detailed description of the employment data can be found in Bender et  al. (2000).|$|R

The first three <b>registers</b> <b>cover</b> the years 1475 - 1505. They coincide with the time when Fribourg entered the Swiss Confederation. Apart from various short introductory notes, the registers contain the following types of documents: (1) reports establishing the citation and subsequent failure to enter appearance of suspects of homicides (only reports related to the citation of defaulters have been included) (2) "assurances" (Urfecht, asseurance) and (3) reports of interrogations of suspects (i. e. the processus) including a note concerning the execution of the judgment. All documents concern crimes punished by corporal punishment (e. g. theft, sexual offences, homicide, heresy). ...|$|R
5000|$|Carey {{built up}} warm {{relations}} with overseas philatelists {{who it was}} her responsibility to supply with the popular stamps of the Falkland Islands. First day covers of the 1937 coronation stamps proved a particular challenge {{for her and her}} small staff with at least 16,000 <b>registered</b> <b>covers</b> required to be prepared and dispatched within a short period of time. In correspondence with the philatelist Captain Bernhard Grant, Carey complained that first day covers were [...] "an infernal nuisance and ought to be burned", saying that she had [...] "such a lot of worry - the doctor almost made a fuss & ordered me not to work. However, I pegged on with my usual driving spirit and managed it fairly well." [...] She continues, however, by promising to obtain more philatelic material for Grant.|$|R
30|$|In Europe, for {{comparison}} purposes, a European Cancer Observatory (ECO, [URL] {{has recently been}} set up, combining all the information currently available in Europe on cancer incidence, mortality, survival and prevalence. ECO is a project developed at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) {{in partnership with the}} European Network of Cancer Registries (ENCR). As of 2010, there were more than 200 cancer registers operating in Europe 9; coverage, methods of data collection and data availability can however differ substantially among them (for an overview, see Siesling et al. 2015). In the specific case of childhood cancer, present <b>registers</b> <b>cover</b> 83 % of the childhood population in the European Union and could increase to around 98 % if the recently established registers start producing results and others improve their quality and dissemination plans (Steliarova-Foucher et al. 2015).|$|R
