40|$|One of {{the first}} strains of yellow fever virus, whose {{experimental}} trans-mission to a <b>receptive</b> <b>animal</b> opened {{the way to the}} important advances made {{in the study of the}} disease, was isolated at the Institut Pasteur at Dakar by Mathis, Sellards & Laigret ^ during the yellow fever epidemic which broke out in Senegal in 1927. This virus had been transmitted to Macacus rhesus monkeys by the bites of Aëdes aegypli fed 24 and 31 days earlier on a patient suffering from yellow fever. Early in 1928 the virulent organs from one of the monkeys infected in this way were transported in a frozen state to Europe and America, where they were placed at the disposal of various laboratories under the name of " French strain ". Theiler, 9 studying the properties of this strain, showed in 1930 that the white mouse was susceptible to intracerebral inoculation, which induced a yellow fever encephalitis capable of being transmitted in series. After a certain number of passages in this animal, the properties of the yellow fever virus became modified so that when inoculated subcutaneously it n...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2016. Experience shapes our {{perception}} {{of the world on}} a moment-to-moment basis. This robust perceptual effect of experience parallels a change in the neural representation of stimulus features, though the nature of this representation and its plasticity are not well-understood. Spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) mapping describes the neural response to acoustic features, and has been used to study contextual effects on auditory <b>receptive</b> fields in <b>animal</b> models. We performed a STRF plasticity analysis on electrophysiological data from recordings obtained directly from the human auditory cortex. Here, we report rapid, automatic plasticity of the spectrotemporal response of recorded neural ensembles, driven by previous experience with acoustic and linguistic information, and with a neurophysiological effect in the sub-second range. This plasticity reflects increased sensitivity to spectrotemporal features, enhancing the extraction of more speech-like features from a degraded stimulus and providing the physiological basis for the observed 'perceptual enhancement' in understanding speech...|$|R
40|$|After {{reviewing}} 73 publications describing {{all manner}} of stimuli {{to a wide variety}} of human and <b>animal</b> <b>receptive</b> sites, Goetzl, Burrill and Ivy (1943) de-cided that electrical stimulation of teeth was most likely to provide objective algesimetric information. They, as many before them, preferred electrical stimu-lation for its precision of regulation, measurement, reproduction and application. Since pain is the only sensation that can be perceived from the excited tooth pulp and since the pulp is enclosed in an enamel vault which protects it from extraneous influences, they considered the tooth to be an ideal stimulus site. Goetzl and his associates built and used a simple device which induced an elliptical envelope of 60 cycle alternating current. In practice they determined the voltage necessary to cause a barely painful sensation in the tooth. To evalu-ate the analgesic effectiveness of a compound, the difference observed between pre-medication and post-medication thresholds was compared with similar data obtained from the same subjects on another occasion when placebos were used. Their procedure and results have been received with interest but without con-viction because information on the reliability and validity of their method is no...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{maturation}} {{of visual}} cortex is linked with dynamic changes in synaptic expression of GABAergic mechanisms. These include setting the excitation-inhibition balance required for experience-dependent plasticity, as well as, intracortical inhibition underlying development and aging of <b>receptive</b> field properties. <b>Animal</b> {{studies have shown}} developmental regulation of GABAergic mechanisms in visual cortex. In this study, we show {{for the first time}} how these mechanisms develop in the human visual cortex across the lifespan. We used Western blot analysis of postmortem tissue from human primary visual cortex (n= 30, range: 20 days to 80 years) to quantify expression of 8 pre- and post-synaptic GABAergic markers. We quantified the inhibitory modulating cannabinoid receptor (CB 1), GABA vesicular transporter (VGAT), GABA synthesizing enzymes (GAD 65 /GAD 67), GABA A receptor anchoring protein (Gephyrin), and GABA A receptor subunits (GABA A ∝ 1, GABA A ∝ 2, GABA A ∝ 3). We found a complex pattern of changes, many of which were prolonged and continued well into into the teen, young adult, and even older adult years. These included a monotonic increase or decrease (GABA A ∝ 1, GABA A ∝ 2), a biphasic increase then decrease (GAD 65, Gephyrin), or multiple increases and decreases (VGAT, CB 1) across the lifespan. Comparing the balances between the pre- and post-synaptic markers we found 3 main transitions (early childhood, early teen years, aging) when there were rapid switches in the composition of the GABAergic signaling system, indicating that functioning of the GABAergic system must change as the visual cortex develops and ages. Furthermore, these results provide key information for translating therapies developed in animal models into effective treatments for amblyopia in humans...|$|R
40|$|We {{collected}} {{behavioural data}} and skin samples for molecular sex determination from 327 right whales (Eubalaena australis) {{in the coastal}} waters of South Africa between July and October, 1995 and 1996, {{as well as from}} 147 cows with calves-of-the-year between August and October 1996, September and November 1997. Data on group size, composition and behaviour were also available for 85 sightings of right whales south of 40 degreesS. Although right whales are considered to be relatively non-social, only 23. 3 % of animals (apart from cow-calf pairs) encountered in South African waters were alone (N = 649), compared to 84. 6 % of animals seen south of 40 degreesS in summer (N = 94). Of the pairs other than cows with calves encountered off South Africa, 31. 0 % (N = 58) were believed to be composed of cows with last-year's calves (=yearlings) : 93. 3 % (N = 15) of these yearlings were female, suggesting a possible mechanism for female philopatry. The incidence of these mother-yearling pairs dropped sharply after early August, indicating the abrupt weaning of some calves at an age of approximately one year. Most other animals were observed either in surface-active groups (SAGs) that indulged in apparent courtship behaviour, or in non-surface-active groups (non-SAGs). SAGs tended to be larger on average than non-SAGs (4. 45 animals, N = 33, range 2 - 10, versus 2. 57 animals, N = 108, range 2 - 5, respectively), and males predominated, while females predominated in non-SAGs. The number of animals participating per SAG increased through the season, whereas the size of non-SAGs remained constant. Given that most conceptions in southern right whales are estimated to occur in a 118 -day period around mid-July, the observed increase in group size through late August and September may be due to declining availability of <b>receptive</b> females. Focal <b>animals</b> in SAGs proved to be predominantly female (83. 3 %, N = 24) and non-focal animals predominantly male (85. 2 %, N = 61) : a few groups observed late in the winter season had a male rather than female focal animal. Sighting histories of the focal females revealed that none was seen with a calf in the 17 years that preceded the surveys, but four had been seen as calves, 2 - 5 (average 3. 75) years previously. Six females were photographed with calves from 2 to 5 years after being the focal animal in a SAG, which is consistent with the observation that most focal females in SAGs were young, pre-pubertal animals, and therefore being the focal animal did not normally result in conception. It is still unclear where (and when) conceptions occur in southern right whales, but it is hypothesised that the focal females are practising a mating strategy in which the chances of conceiving with a larger male will be maximised. As neonatal survival is partly related to size, the female will in this way protect her substantial investment in time and energy represented by the calf...|$|R
40|$|Vision is the {{dominant}} human sensory modality. Due to the relative ease with which both visual input and visual brain areas can be studied and manipulated, vision has become an important window for enlarging {{our understanding of the}} biological sensory processing. Whether artificial or biological, visual processing systems must quickly and efficiently make sense of a large volume of noisy, high-dimensional input. To do this they construct statistical models of the input and utilise these models to efficiently encode visual scenes, detect features and construct a model of the world. In this thesis, we combine the study of natural scene statistics with mathematical models, experimental analysis and visual psychophysics to glean {{a deeper understanding of the}} development and function of the mammalian primary visual cortex. We start by considering functional models of receptive field development. We find, in agreement with previous work, that unsupervised learning models trained on natural scenes consistently learn that oriented "edges 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 (Gabor-like filters) are the basic features of natural scenes. The similarity between these filters and primary visual cortex receptive fields is strong evidence that primary visual cortex receptive fields are optimal encoders of visual input. We then significantly extend this work by comparing the prediction of unsupervised learning models with the <b>receptive</b> fields of <b>animals</b> reared in unusual visual environments. We find good agreement, which is evidence that aspects of receptive fields are learned during development, rather than innate. We also show that applying such unsupervised learning models to binocular visual input is not a simple extension of monocular visual input. Inter-ocular correlations change the optimal encoding strategy of binocular input so that it depends on edge orientation. Such functional models intriguingly predict an over-representation of vertically oriented receptive fields. After establishing that oriented edges are the basic feature of natural scenes and the unit of primary visual cortex receptive fields, we consider the statistics of edge arrangements in natural scenes. Sigman 2001 showed that edges in natural scenes over short distances tend to be tangent to a common circle, or co-circular. Edge arrangements which contain a dependence between edge position and orientation may be said to have "reduced symmetry 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 as they lack a symmetry in that the edge position and orientation cannot be rotated independently without modifying the statistics of the arrangement. Co-circularity is one specific type of reduced symmetry. We extend previous work on natural scene co-circularity using a noise-resistant measure of co-circularity we develop and show that natural scenes contain significant co-circularity over extremely large angular distances (> 14). We also discuss preliminary work into variations in co-circularity statistics by scene type. After establishing that co-circularity is found pervasively in natural scenes, even over large distances, we then return to the structure of the primary visual cortex, but this time at the network level. Previous work has shown that, like edges in natural scenes, V 1 orientation preferences maps also have reduced symmetry. However, the details of this dependence between orientation and position have not been examined in detail. We examine cat orientation preference maps from normal, stripe and blind-reared animals and find that, although orientation preference maps do contain reduced symmetry, it is not co-circularity. Moreover, the statistics of reduced symmetry in the maps are not affected by changes to visual input during development. Continuing our examination of V 1 network structure, we consider the statistics of lateral connectivity in tree shrew V 1. Previous work demonstrated that long-range V 1 lateral connections are more common between regions with similar orientation preferences Bosking 1997. We re-examine this connectivity data using our noise-resistance measure of co-circularity. We find evidence that lateral connections between cells in the primary visual cortex may use two opposite wiring strategies which simultaneously facilitate quick processing of co-circular visual input while increasing the salience of the less expected deviations from co-circularity. Finally, we use the psychophysics of binocular rivalry to test whether co-circularity statistics can affect the functional processing of visual input in humans. We show, using binocular rivalry dominance as an objective measure of salience, that randomly arranged edges are more salient than edge arrangements which contain co-circularity. This is evidence that early visual processing may be functionally utilising edge arrangement statistics. In concurrence with our findings about lateral connections, this may indicate a general strategy of increasing the salience of unexpected visual input. Overall, we demonstrate that early visual coding uses natural scene statistics extensively. We show that oriented edges are a key currency in early visual processing. We find that the arrangement of edges in natural scenes contain rich statistical structure which influences wiring in the primary visual cortex during development and produces measurable changes in the salience of visual stimuli...|$|R
