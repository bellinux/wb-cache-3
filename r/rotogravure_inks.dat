40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of rotation speed and milling time on the pigment dispersion quality. The information can be used to obtain a standard laboratory condition at which a wide range of pigments may be dispersed to formulate water-based <b>rotogravure</b> <b>inks.</b> The influence of pigment concentration and shear forces on the pigment dispersion were also studied. The procedure consisted of dispersing the pigment using a laboratory Dispermat® SL bead mill at various milling times with two different rotation speeds and measuring the particle size and particle size distribution of the milled samples. The pigment was then dispersed at standard laboratory condition with different pigment concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Toluol, the {{principal}} solvent in <b>rotogravure</b> <b>inks,</b> is the comn {{name for the}} aromatic hydrocarbon methy Benzene (CSH 5 CH 3). ToZuoZ is a photochemically reactive organic compound which reacts with o&dizing chemicals in the atmosphere mder the influence of sunlight to form what is comonly called ttsmg. lt Progres-si~e management stipulated thut the net 3 Meredith/Burda rotogravure printing plant {{to be built in}} Lynchburg, Virginia, should be as pollution-free as modem tech-nology could provide. A fully automatic solvent recovery system captures toluol vapors at their sowces on the printing presses and recovers liquid toluol, which is reused in making p a w ink at the nearby ink plant. This paper illustrates the basic components of the solvent recovery system and describes their operation. Design objectives and operating performance of the system are presented...|$|E
40|$|It {{was found}} that {{particle}} sizes of ink pigments change after several hours of printing in such a way, that it affects printability properties. This was demonstrated on several gravure and flexo printing trials lasting for several hours. Both rotogravure toluene-based process inks and flexo water-based inks exhibited changes in pigment particle size. Decrease of <b>rotogravure</b> <b>inks</b> particle size was most obvious in black (from 482 nm to 231 nm), while the decrease of particle size in all other colors was rather similar: from 257 to 173 (yellow), from 270 to 193 nm (magenta) and from 282 to 207 nm (cyan). Differences in color, print density, and specular gloss measured on printed substrates {{at the beginning of}} trial and after seven hours of printing were found. Color changes were calculated from L*a*b * color coordinates as ∆E values. ∆E was higher than 3. 0 for each process color rotogravure ink. Such color difference can be observed by human eye. Further measurements indicate that specular gloss increases with the decrease of the particle size. On the other hand, density mottle decreased with diminished particle size. There was no dot gain change observed. Particle size of Pantone Brown flexo water based spot color decreased from 250 nm to 178 nm after 270 minutes of printing, producing a change in ∆E value of 3. 2...|$|E
