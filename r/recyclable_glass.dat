50|$|Milk can {{be shipped}} in many forms. One of the {{traditional}} forms was reusable returnable glass milk bottles, often home delivered by a milkman. While some of this continues, other options have recently been more common: one-way gable-top paperboard cartons, one-way aseptic cartons, one-way <b>recyclable</b> <b>glass</b> bottles, one-way milk bags, and others. Each system claims some advantages and also has possible disadvantages. From the zero waste standpoint, the reuse of bottles is beneficial because the material usage per trip can be less than other systems. The primary input (or resource) is silica-sand, which is formed into glass and then into a bottle. The bottle is filled with milk and distributed to the consumer. A reverse logistics system returns the bottles for cleaning, inspection, sanitization, and reuse. Eventually the heavy duty bottle would not be suited for further use and would be recycled. Waste and landfill usage would be minimized. The material waste is primarily the wash water, detergent, transportation, heat, bottle caps, etc. While true zero waste is never achieved, a life cycle assessment {{can be used to}} calculate the waste at each phase of each cycle.|$|E
40|$|Issue: Some {{curbside}} recycling collection programs use compaction {{vehicles to}} collect designated recyclables. While this will yield greater amounts of material on a collection route than collecting materials loose and {{placing them in}} non-compaction vehicles, {{there is a greater}} possibility of introducing contaminants to the PET recycling process. Best Practice: Collecting recyclables in compaction vehicles [...] like the trucks used to collect household trash [...] is {{the most efficient way to}} collect and transport recyclables. However, many curbside collection programs request their residents to commingle <b>recyclable</b> <b>glass,</b> metal and plastic containers together. When commingled containers are compacted, there is a greater tendency for glass breakage. When this happens, small pieces of glass can get trapped inside PET bottles and containers. This trapped glass can cause serious damage to processing equipment throughout the PET recycling process. Therefore, the best practice for curbside collection of PET plastics is to collect PET plastic containers commingled with other recyclable containers except glass in compaction vehicles. Glass containers can be collected in the same vehicles as PET plastics and other commingled recyclables as long as they are placed in a different collection compartment when collectio...|$|E

30|$|As {{the waste}} audit indicated, {{a large part}} of {{household}} waste in Accra is potentially recyclable as organic waste accounts for about 60 %, while paper and other inorganic <b>recyclables</b> (<b>glass,</b> tin) are fairly represented. Yet, this opportunity remains poorly unexplored. Indeed, within the city, a compost plant built in 1976 at Teshie (another suburb of Accra), with a processing capacity of 200 tonnes a day was decommissioned in 2002 due to operational difficulties (see Oteng-Ababio et al. 2013). In particular, lack of source separation of waste greatly affected its operations. Thus, the NGO’s activities demonstrate a bold attempt to both tap into the untapped potential embedded in waste and help advance that scholarship in the area of environmental sustainability.|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{quantitative}} information on waste {{is a prerequisite}} {{to the practice of}} sound waste management. This point is clearly illustrated when the objective of reducing waste to landfill was promulgated. No reliable information on the amount of waste then disposed to landfill was available (Department of Commerce and Trade and Western Australian Municipal Association 1993). In the case of the domestic waste stream, much effort has been directed at recovering the <b>recyclables</b> (<b>glass,</b> metals, newspaper and plastics) with the hope of significantly reducing the amount having to be landfilled. As more information on landfilled domestic waste composition becomes available, it becomes clear that the organic components (food waste, garden waste and paper products) form the major part of domestic waste. These components are also those that create potential problems when landfilled, attracting pests and disease vectors, producing leachate, smouldering fires and greenhouse gases. Attention to recycling the organic components would overcome the problems and achieve the target of reducing waste to landfill by half (Ho et al., 1993) ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: John Sauer, Gleenglass principal, {{asked for}} {{research}} into innovative uses for a reclaimed glass slurry, {{also referred to}} as swarf. Through our research we were to determine a product and a market that could be manufactured using this fully recycled glass swarf. Background: Mr. Sauer receives the swarf from major glass manufacturers as a fine powder glass suspended in an organic dispersant and water. The swarf is produced through an industrial glass cutting process that results in the glass powder dispersed in water and <b>recyclable</b> <b>glass</b> disks; both are used in the project. Mr. Sauer's swarf studio testing has yet to produce any product with a value great enough to justify processing the swarf. Many of these limitations were believed to be due to the unknown composition and characteristics of the swarf as well as the limited lab testing ability of Mr. Sauer in his studio space. Deliverables: 1. The valuable characteristics of the swarf. 2. Products that can be produced with the swarf. 3. Market for developed products. 4. Capital investment needed to create developed product. 5. Any other applications of the swarf that were outside the scope of residential and commercial building material for use in future DOE grant proposals to the glass manufacturing facilities. 6.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the study of eleven {{environmental}} impact categories produced by several municipal solid waste management systems (scenarios) operating on a provincial scale in Southern Italy. In particular, the analysis takes into account 12 management scenarios with 16 management phases for each one. The only difference among ten of the scenarios (separated kerbside collection of all <b>recyclables,</b> <b>glass</b> excepted, composting of putrescibles, RDF pressed bales production and incineration, final landfilling) is the percentage of separated collection varying in the range of 35 – 80 %, while the other two scenarios, for 80 % of separate collection, consider different alternatives in the disposal of treatment residues (dry residue sorting and final landfilling or direct disposal in landfill). The potential impacts induced on the environmental components were analysed using the life cycle assessment (LCA) procedure called ‘‘WISARD” (Waste Integrated System Assessment for Recovery and Disposal). Paper recycling was the phase with the greatest influence on avoided impacts, while the collection logistics of dry residue was the phase with the greatest influence on produced impacts. For six impact categories (renewable and total energy use, water, suspended solids and oxydable matters index, eutrophication and hazardous waste production), for high percentages of separate collection a management system based on recovery and recycling but without incineration would be preferable...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirements}} of the EU landfill directive, which prohibits the disposal of waste to landfill without prior treatment, various types of waste management processes have been proposed. This paper describes the detailed investigation and analysis of a plant employing a process known as mechanical heat treatment. The plant was built, operated for a pilot period and monitored as part of Defra’s new technologies demonstrator programme. The plant treated 20 500 t of household residual waste, through a combination of heat treatment and mechanical separation technology, to produce solid recovered fuels and <b>recyclables</b> (<b>glass,</b> plastics, ferrous and non-ferrous metals). It is shown that mechanical heat treatment can be an effective and efficient way of processing mixed municipal solid wastes, but the details of the plant and process are crucially important. Modifications to the plant were made as a result of experience gained during the initial phase of operation, including the redesign of some of the equipment to avoid fouling by textiles and plastic film, and the introduction of an additional shredder. Comparison of mass and energy balances for the plant {{at the beginning and end}} of the operational period, after improvements had been made, demonstrates an increase in the rate of throughput of waste, significant improvements in the recovery of recyclable materials and fuel products, a reduction in the amount of residual material being sent to landfill and a reduction in the process energy use...|$|R

The structural and optical properties of ZnO-SLS:xEu 3 + (x= 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 wt. %) glasses were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared reflectance (FTIR), UV-visible (Uv-Vis) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Structural investigation using XRD measurement had broadened the halo peak with the doping of dopants. FTIR spectra showed the glass system consists of –OH and SiO 4 bands. Meanwhile, the optical measurement using UV-Vis absorption has been induced a blue shift of the electronic absorption edge.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the evaluation of the construction and operation of the Ševětín photovoltaic power plant and with the conditions for such power plant?s operation within the area of the Czech Republic in general. The Ševětín photovoltaic power plant is a part of a project of the company ČEZ Obnovitelné zdroje, s. r. o. (CEZ Renewable Resources, Ltd.) with total power reaching up to 30 MWh and with planned lifespan of 20 years. The research showed that the photovoltaic panels contain <b>recyclable</b> materials (<b>glass,</b> aluminium, plastic and copper) which could be sold for recycling in scrapyards at a price exceeding CZK 20 million (in current prices of recyclable materials that are believed to be constantly rising) in case of its dismantlement. The calculations showed that the energy return regarding the particular type of photovoltaic panels totals 2, 3 years. If the Ševětín photovoltaic power plant was not built, the gross financial profit on a regular cultivation of the particular land used for its construction would be less than 150 times lower than on the operation of the power plant. Most of the land will be suitable for farming after the termination of the power plant?s operation and dismantling of its recyclable parts...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the typical}} {{practice}} of curbside collection of <b>recyclables</b> in Wisconsin, <b>glass</b> with different colors (clear, brown, and green) tends to be mixed together during collection. Much of this glass is color-sorted at processing facilities, but a residual amount typically remains mixed together. As shown in Figure 1, most of the glass recovered in the United States is used by container manufacturers to make new glass bottles and jars. However, in order for this post-consumer glass to be accepted it must be free of most “color contamination, ” thus limiting the amounts communities and private recyclers can sell to such plants. Communities are therefore left {{with the need to}} find a use for the crushed/unsortable glass or mixed broken glass (MBG). There are several other reasons communities may want to consider non-container uses for glass. Some communities find that container manufacturers are too distant, making transportation costs too high to be economically practical.

40|$|Many UK local authorities, {{looking to}} meet their {{regulatory}} recycling targets, have opted for voluntary kerbside collection schemes for source segregated recyclables from households. The success of a recycling service is highly dependant {{on the number of}} people who participate in the service and the frequency of its use. High participation rates are therefore an essential component of any effective kerbside collection scheme. It is commonly accepted that recycling behaviour is strongly influenced and motivated by personal opinions as well as external issues such as access and convenience. This paper characterises the recycling attitudes within West Oxfordshire, UK, and compares them with the results from a previous study conducted during 2003 in Brixworth, in Daventry, UK. From 1 st April 2004, West Oxfordshire District Council, expanded its kerbside collection scheme for dry recyclables, adding cardboard, batteries, aerosols and mixed plastics to the already collected <b>recyclables</b> (paper, <b>glass,</b> textiles and metals) and increasing the frequency from fortnightly to weekly In this study, the recycling attitudes and behaviour of a cross-sectional socio-economic sample from households from West Oxfordshire, is investigated. It is observed that the propensity to recycle varies between individuals and socio-economic areas, and that recycling is influenced by concern for future generations, the need to bury less waste in landfills, and the fact that recycling saves resources and protects the environment. The results from this study can be used to help inform local authorities who are considering the development of their recycling schemes and associated promotional campaigns based on an understanding of their socio-demographic profile.

Factors to consider here are the chemicals and fresh water used in the washing, and the fact that a single-use container can be made much lighter, using less than half the glass (and therefore energy content) of a multiuse container. Also, a significant factor in the developed world's consideration of reuse are producer concerns over the risk and consequential product liability of using a component (the reused container) of unknown and unqualified safety.How glass containers compare to other packaging types (plastic, cardboard, aluminium) is hard to say; conclusive lifecycle studies are yet to be produced.|$|R

To help obtain this {{data on a}} regional basis, selected households in each region were recruited to obtain data on rate of waste generation, physical composition of waste, sorting and separation efficiency and per capita of waste. Results show that rate of waste generation in Ghana was 0. 47 kg/person/day, which translates into about 12, 710 tons of waste per day per the current population of 27, 043, 093. Nationally, biodegradable waste (organics and papers) was 0. 318 kg/person/day and non-biodegradable or <b>recyclables</b> (metals, <b>glass,</b> textiles, leather and rubbers) was 0. 096 kg/person/day. Inert and miscellaneous waste was 0. 055 kg/person/day. The average household waste generation rate among the metropolitan cities, except Tamale, was high, 0. 72 kg/person/day. Metropolises generated higher waste (average 0. 63 kg/person/day) than the municipalities (0. 40 kg/person/day) and the least in the districts (0. 28 kg/person/day) which are less developed. The waste generation rate also varied across geographical locations, the coastal and forest zones generated higher waste than the northern savanna zone. Waste composition was 61 % organics, 14 % plastics, 6 % inert, 5 % miscellaneous, 5 % paper, 3 % metals, 3 % glass, 1 % leather and rubber, and 1 % textiles. However, organics and plastics, the two major fractions of the household waste varied considerably across the geographical areas. In the coastal zone, the organic waste fraction was highest but decreased through the forest zone towards the northern savanna. However, through the same zones towards the north, plastic waste rather increased in percentage fraction. Households did separate their waste effectively averaging 80 %. However, in terms of separating into the bin marked biodegradables, 84 % effectiveness was obtained whiles 76 % effectiveness for sorting into the bin labeled other waste was achieved...|$|R

50|$|In Thailand {{the roles}} in solid waste {{management}} (MSW) and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government, which is then divided among the central government, regional governments, and local governments. Each government is responsible for different tasks. The central government is responsible to stimulate regulation, policies, and standards. The regional governments are responsible for coordinating central and local governments. Local governments are responsible for waste management in their governed area. Local governments themselves do not dispose of waste, but instead hire private companies that have been granted that right by the PCD. A major problem is lack of funding for waste management—the average Thai household pays less than one dollar a month to dispose of their solid waste. The main companies are Bangpoo Industrial Waste Management Center; General Environmental Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO); SGS Thailand; Waste Management Siam Ltd (WMS); and Better World Green Public Company Limited (BWG).
