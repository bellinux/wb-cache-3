40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} to model a double clutch system is presented with the aim of obtaining a model suitable for <b>real-time</b> <b>simulations.</b> The proposed model is obtained with a proper coordinate transformation of the system equations: the transformed system is described by two new state variables that correspond to the weighted relative speeds of the clutch plates. In this way one unique model can be used to describe all the conditions of the clutch: free, slipping and lockup. Using this approach, very efficient numerical simulations can be performed without switching among different models and using variables which are not affected by chattering.

This paper presents details of the <b>real-time</b> hybrid <b>simulation</b> system developed at Lehigh University, including the hydraulic actuators, the IT control architecture, an integration algorithm and actuator delay compensation. An explicit integration algorithm provides a robust and accurate solution to the equations of motion while an adaptive inverse compensation method ensures the accurate application of the command displacements to experimental substructure(s) by servo-hydraulic actuators. Experiments of a steel moment resisting frame with magneto-rheological fluid dampers in passive-on mode were conducted using the <b>real-time</b> hybrid <b>simulation</b> system to evaluate the ability for the simulation method to evaluate the nonlinear seismic response of steel frame systems with dampers that are intended to enhance {{the response of the}} structure. The comparison with numerical simulation results demonstrates that the <b>real-time</b> hybrid <b>simulation</b> system produces accurate and reliable experimental results and therefore shows great potential for structural performance evaluation in earthquake engineering research. Highlights? The large-scale <b>real-time</b> hybrid <b>simulation</b> system at Lehigh University is presented. ?

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to conduct a {{reliability}} analysis of <b>real-time</b> hybrid <b>simulation</b> results through a probabilistic approach. The first part of this research project will analyze and compare actuator delay compensation methods for <b>real-time</b> hybrid <b>simulation.</b> These methods include the N^-order polynomial, the linear acceleration prediction method, the Newmark explicit prediction method and a newly developed dual explicit prediction method. The discrete z transfer function method and sinusoidal excitation method will be used to compare the amplitude magnification and phase shift introduced by the compensation methods. The time delays can cause significant errors in <b>real-time</b> hybrid <b>simulation</b> results and different compensation methods have been developed for minimizing the effects of time delays. The second part of this research will implement the compensation methods on the <b>real-time</b> hybrid <b>simulation</b> system in the structural lab to experimentally evaluate the accuracy of the compensation methods.
