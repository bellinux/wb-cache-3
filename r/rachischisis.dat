It is incompatible with life; affected pregnancies often end in miscarriage or stillbirth. Infants born alive with craniorachischisis die soon after birth.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rachischisis</b> (Greek: [...] "rhachis - ῥάχις" [...] - spine, and [...] "schisis - σχίσις" [...] - split) is a {{developmental}} birth defect involving the neural tube. This anomaly occurs in utero, when the posterior neuropore of the neural tube fails to {{close by the}} 27th intrauterine day. As a consequence the vertebrae overlying the open portion of the spinal cord do not fully form and remain unfused and open, leaving the spinal cord exposed. Patients with <b>rachischisis</b> have motor and sensory deficits, chronic infections, and disturbances in bladder function. This defect often occurs with anencephaly.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{pathogenesis}} of iniencephaly {{is still}} unknown {{though there are}} proposed theories, most of which view the neural tube malformation from the primary neural anomaly standpoint.Marin-Padilla and MarinPadilla have proposed that the cause for the abnormalities {{has to do with}} a deficiency in the primary mesoderm. P. Erdinçler, et al. suggests from their findings that the cause of the anomaly is actually a defect in the occipital bone and <b>rachischisis</b> of the posterior vertebral arches leading to herniation of neural tissue through the opening in the bone during gestation.|$|E
50|$|The folding of {{the neural}} tube {{to form an}} actual tube does not occur all at once. Instead, it begins {{approximately}} {{at the level of}} the fourth somite at Carnegie stage 9 (around Embryonic day 20 in humans). The lateral edges of the neural plate touch in the midline and join together. This continues both cranially (toward the head) and caudally (toward the tail). The openings that are formed at the cranial and caudal regions are termed the cranial and caudal neuropores. In human embryos, the cranial neuropore closes approximately on day 24 and the caudal neuropore on day 28. Failure of the cranial (anterior) and caudal (posterior) neuropore closure results in conditions called anencephaly and spina bifida, respectively. Additionally, failure of the neural tube to close throughout the length of the body results in a condition called <b>rachischisis.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Museum Vrolik {{collection}} of the Department of Anatomy and Embryology of the University of Amsterdam, founded by Gerardus Vrolik (1775 - 1859) and his son Willem Vrolik (1801 - 1863), consists of more than 5, 000 specimens of human and animal anatomy, embryology, pathology, and congenital anomalies. Recently, the {{collection of}} congenital anomalies, comprising 360 specimens, was recatalogued and redescribed according to contemporary morphogenetic opinions. The original descriptions, as far as preserved, were compared with the clinical and additional findings. Based on the classification by closure site, proposed by Van Allen et al. [1993], the following closure defects of the neural tube were diagnosed in 107 specimens: craniorachischisis, holoacranium with partial <b>rachischisis,</b> faciocranioschisis, holoacranium, meroacranium, occipital cranioschisis, frontal encephalocele, parietal encephalocele, occipital encephalocele, occipital encephalocele with <b>rachischisis,</b> occipito-cervical encephalocele, thoracolumbar spina bifida, lumbosacral spina bifida, occult sacral dysraphism, and sacrococcygeal dysgenesis. Furthermore, we diagnosed three conditions that did {{not appear in the}} aforementioned classification; we named these conditions craniorachischisis totalis, occipital craniorachischisis, and thoracolumbosacral spina bifida. The results of our study are in line with the assumption that particularly occipito-cervical neural tube defects are associated with concomitant anomalies and are more common in females.

40|$|In earlier {{parts of}} this survey we have {{attempted}} to describe in broad outline the clinical progress {{of a series of}} rather more than 300 consecutive cases of spina bifida cystica first seen between 1949 and 1958 (Doran and Guthkelch, 1961), to indicate some considerations that seem important in deciding when to repair the spinal defect (Guthkelch, 1962 a), and to demonstrate a previously undescribed seasonal variation in births of infants with spina bifida (Guthkelch, 1962 b). The present communication is concerned with a more detailed examination of the neurological findings in these cases, for this is one aspect of the study of spina bifida cystica which seems to have received less attention than perhaps it deserves, most writers confining themselves to general statements, such as that there is always 'definite paralysis ' in <b>rachischisis</b> (myelocoele) and so on; Warkany (1960), indeed, complained that nowhere in the literature was it definitely stated whether or not neural conduction ever occurs through such a lesion. MacNab (1957) has said that 93 % of cases of 'myelomeningocoele ' show 'clinical evidence of paralysis', presumably implying that in 7 % there is no neurological deficit, but his classification of spina bifida cystica excludes all cases of <b>rachischisis</b> {{in which there is no}} true sacculation, and although he notes that there are some cases in which the neural element 'forms part of the sac wall at its fundus, giving rise to the clinical appearance of ulceration [...] . (and others in which) [...] . true skin is separated from the lesion by a large fibro-fatty mass of tissue' he does not distinguish between the neurological findings in the two varieties. Consequently MacNab's work does not explicitly answer the point raised by Warkany, for it could have happened that those of MacNab's cases which were neurologically intact were the ones in which the cord was not exposed on the surface of the body and which to Warkany would not be cases of myelocoele. Laurence (1960 a and b) analysed a series of 407 cases of spina bifida with respect to neurological deficit. He does no...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{present the}} {{prenatal}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) findings of concomitant craniorachischisis and omphalocele, review the literature, and discuss the pathogenesis. Case ReportA 20 -year-old, gravida 2, para 0, woman was referred to genetic counseling at 17 weeks of gestation because of multiple congenital malformations in the fetus. Level II ultrasound revealed acrania, a ventricular septal defect, an upward-turned face, and omphalocele containing the intestines. MRI revealed normal extremities, exencephaly, hyperextension of the fetal head, significant shortening of the spinal column, marked lordosis and hyperextension of the malformed spine, an upward-turned face, and absence of a neck. A diagnosis of iniencephaly associated with anencephaly, <b>rachischisis</b> and omphalocele was made. Amniocentesis revealed a karyotype of 46,XY. Postnatal X-ray showed anencephaly with total spina bifida of the cervical and thoracic spine. ConclusionPrenatal MRI is able to provide a clear whole-body image of the fetus and {{its relationship with the}} placenta.

40|$|Iniencephaly is {{characterized}} by a variable deficit of the occipital bones, resulting in an enlarged foramen magnum; partial or total absence of cervical and thoracic vertebrae with an irregular fusion of those present, accompanied by incomplete closure of the vertebral arches and/or bodies; significant shortening of the spinal column due to marked lordosis and hyperextension of the malformed cervicothoracic spine; and an upward-turned face and mandibular skin directly continuous with that of the chest {{due to the lack of}} neck. This article provides a comprehensive review of the reported cases of prenatally detected iniencephaly, including prenatal diagnosis, associated malformations, associated chromosomal abnormalities, and differential diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis of a neural tube defect involving a body defect in the occiput and <b>rachischisis</b> of the cervical and thoracic spine with retroflexion of the head should raise the suspicion of iniencephaly.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONWe {{report an}} {{extremely}} rare and challenging combination of congenital anomalies. Only five similar {{cases have been}} described in the English language medical literature to date. PRESENTATION OF CASEA male infant was born at 30 + 5 weeks gestation by emergency caesarian section. Cervical spine <b>rachischisis,</b> shortened oesophagus, intrathoracic stomach, atretic duodenum and absent spleen were noted, in addition to respiratory insufficiency. Gastrointestinal re-anastomosis, particularly oesophageal lengthening, was not feasible at the initial thoracotomy. Surgical stabilization of the cervical spine was unlikely to be successful until two years of age. Asplenia predisposed the infant to sepsis from encapsulated organisms, and recurrent respiratory infections occurred. DISCUSSIONA close relationship exists between the upper gastrointestinal tract and cervical spine during embryonic development. An embryonic aberration at this level could account for all the deformities present in this infant. Tethering of the embryonic cervical oesophagus to the somites in the first trimester, preventing foregut elongation, and producing ischaemia at the coeliac axis, is suggested as the aetiology. CONCLUSIONThis case presented {{a challenge to the}} multi-disciplinary team involved in his management and prompted extensive consultation with international experts. After considerable counseling of the parents, care was directed towards palliation...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} find out how {{frequent}} is brain tissue aspiration and if brain tissue heterotopia could be found in the lung of human neural tube defect cases.

There were 15 (68. 2 %) females and 7 (31. 8 %) males. Age ranged from 18 to 40 weeks of gestation (mean= 31. 8). Ten (45. 5 %) were stillborn, the same newborn, and 2 (9. 1 %) were abortuses.

40|$|The {{results of}} gross and histopathological {{study of a}} near-term male hamster exencephalic lateral cephalothoracopagus are presented. There was minimal {{duplication}} of the internal organs {{to the point of}} division at the abdomen. The appendicular skeleton was relatively unaffected by the severe malformations of the axial skeleton. The studies suggested that the lateral relationship of the skull to the spinal columns was a consequence of the presence of two embryonic neural tubes; the chordomesodermal systems of the right and left twins apparently contributed the tissues for the right and left cephalic neural folds, respectively. Anomalies of the vertebral bodies and neural arches were not related to failure of closure of the neural tube as there was no evidence for <b>rachischisis</b> in either body half. Rather, the anomalous axial skeletal elements were apparently the result of competing fields of development by two chordomesodermal systems. The twins were recovered from a dam maintained on a diet consisting of 80 % cassava, a cyanide-containing staple consumed by humans in tropical countries. Because the numbers of resorbed implantation sites and malformed litermates were low and the failure to produce conjoined twins in other litters recovered from dams given cassava diets, it appears unlikely that the malformation was related to the composition of the diet...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is {{the most}} common {{forebrain}} defect in humans. It results from incomplete midline cleavage of the prosencephalon. METHODS: A large European series of 645 HPE probands (and 699 relatives), consisting of 51 % fetuses and 49 % liveborn children, is reported. RESULTS: Mutations in the four main genes involved in HPE (SHH, ZIC 2, SIX 3, TGIF) were identified in 25 % of cases. The SHH, SIX 3, and TGIF mutations were inherited in more than 70 % of these cases, whereas 70 % of the mutations in ZIC 2 occurred de novo. Moreover, rearrangements were detected in 22 % of the 260 patients screened by array comparative genomic hybridisation. 15 probands had two mutations providing additional support for the 'multiple-hit process' in HPE. There was a positive correlation between the severity of the brain malformation and facial features for SHH, SIX 3, and TGIF, but no such correlation was found for ZIC 2 mutations. The most severe HPE types were associated with SIX 3 and ZIC 2 mutations, whereas microforms were associated with SHH mutations. The study focused on the associated brain malformations, including neuronal migration defects, which predominated in individuals with ZIC 2 mutations, and neural tube defects, which were frequently associated with ZIC 2 (<b>rachischisis)</b> and TGIF mutations. Extracraniofacial features were observed in 27 % of the individuals in this series (up to 40 % of those with ZIC 2 mutations) and a significant correlation was found between renal/urinary defects and mutations of SHH and ZIC 2. CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm is proposed based on these new phenotype-genotype correlations, to facilitate molecular analysis and genetic counselling for HPE...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{morphogenetic}} {{mechanisms that}} are responsible for the transposition of the great arteries are still largely unknown, mainly because this malformation is very difficult to experimentally reproduce. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the effect of BMS- 189453, a retinoic acid antagonist, on murine heart morphogenesis. Methods: We administered this drug at 5 mg/kg body weight (twice, at a 12 -h interval) to pregnant mice on 6. 25 / 6. 75 days postcoitum (dpc) (Group A), 6. 75 / 7. 25 dpc (Group B), 7. 25 / 7. 75 dpc (Group C), 7. 75 / 8. 25 dpc (Group D), or 8. 25 / 8. 75 dpc (Group E). At birth, the anatomical features of fetuses were evaluated by stereomicroscopic examination. Results: In Group A (18 fetuses), cardiovascular anatomy was normal in 10 (56 %) cases, and 8 (44 %) fetuses presented with transposition of the great arteries. In Group B, no fetuses were obtained. In Group C (78 fetuses), cardiovascular anatomy was normal in 19 (24 %) cases, while 59 (76 %) mice presented with various types of cardiac defects, including 48 transpositions of the great arteries (61 %). In Group D (80 fetuses), cardiac defects were seen in 22 (27 %) mice: 14 of these (17 %) were transpositions of the great arteries. In Group E (72 fetuses), cardiovascular anatomy was normal in all cases. Of 248 fetuses analyzed, 87 % presented with thymic aplasia or hypoplasia, and 20 % presented with meroanencephalia and/or <b>rachischisis.</b> Conclusions: Transposition of the great arteries can be consistently reproduced in mice by administration of a retinoic acid competitive antagonist on 7. 5 dpc.

40|$|To compare {{two-dimensional}} ultrasonography (2 DUS) {{and magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing brain and spine parameters in fetuses with spina bifida. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 15 fetuses with spina bifida (one with encephalocele, four with <b>rachischisis</b> and 10 with myelomeningocele). {{the size of the}} atrium of the lateral ventricle, percentage shortening of the cerebellum, degree of compromising of the first vertebra and total number of vertebras affected by herniation were assessed. the MRI examination was performed not more than 7 days after the 2 DUS. To compare and correlate the parameters from the two techniques, the paired Student's t test and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used. To assess the correlations of atrium measurements from 2 DUS and MRI with other parameters, Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used. No significant difference was observed in any of the means of the parameters assessed using the two techniques (p > 0. 05). Both 2 DUS and MRI seemed to present satisfactory reliability in measurements {{on the size of the}} atrium of the lateral ventricle and the first vertebra affected (ICC = 0. 88 and 0. 75, respectively). Measurements on the atrium of the lateral ventricle from 2 DUS correlated better with the other parameters than did measurements from MRI. In fetuses with spina bifida, 2 DUS and MRI present similar results, but measurements on the atrium of the lateral ventricle from 2 DUS correlated better with the other parameters.
