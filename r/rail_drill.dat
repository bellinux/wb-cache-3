50|$|Eugene B. Clark, an Illinois Steel {{employee}} at the time, {{determined that the}} metallurgy of Rich Manufacturing's principal product, a railroad <b>rail</b> <b>drill</b> named the Celfor Drill, was faulty, and also found fault with both the management and basic operations, which he ultimately corrected after the condition of him becoming an equal partner was established.|$|E
50|$|Specialist track {{components}} such as turntables, switches (points), point levers, mine transfer cars, temporary turnouts, easy turnouts, rerailing ramps, {{could all}} {{be found in the}} catalogues. And the tools required to build and maintain the track, including gauges, rail benders, <b>rail</b> cutters, <b>rail</b> <b>drills,</b> <b>rail</b> spike hammers, spike removal levers, spanners for various track bolts. A huge array of parts with a vast range of applications.|$|R
40|$|The power {{analysis}} technique of sectional drills with replaceable many-sided plates at railway <b>rails</b> <b>drilling</b> has been offered. It allowed increasing tool working capacity. The technique {{is based on}} summation of specific cutting force component by the length of working areas of plates cutting rims. The increase of working capacity is achieved due to decreasing cutting force radial components {{of each of the}} plat...|$|R
50|$|Beside {{the flat}} surface {{products}} tread plates and sheets are produced with diamond pattern {{by means of}} special rollers. Such product is used for floors of bus, trucks, <b>rail</b> cars, <b>drill</b> towers.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} standard prism mounting {{rail system}} requires {{to have the}} scope <b>rail</b> <b>drilled</b> from the side for fixture screws. The more recent propriety systems mainly offer aesthetic advantages {{for people who have}} problems with redundant drill holes in sight in case the riflescope is used on different guns. To avoid <b>drilling</b> the scope <b>rail,</b> the propriety rail mounting systems have special shape connections machined in the inside of the rail. These shape connections prevent ever showing any exterior damage from mounting work on the rifle scope. The propriety rail systems use matching slide-in mount fasteners to connect the riflescope to the gun. Some propriety rails also offer the possibility to tilt the scope up to 1Â° to the left or right.|$|R
50|$|The ERICO Company {{manufactures}} hand-held <b>rail</b> grinders and <b>drills</b> for {{the railway}} industry as maintenance of way tools. ERICO uses Honda four-stroke engines to power their railway <b>drill</b> and <b>rail</b> grinder. Rail grinders {{are used for}} rail preparation prior to the attachment of bonds, {{and serve as a}} multipurpose tool capable of rail prep, maintenance and repair.|$|R
50|$|A drifter drill or drifter is a {{hydraulic}} or pneumatic rock or ground drill used to make horizontal holes in tunnel construction and mining. It is mounted on a feed, which is like a <b>rail</b> that the <b>drill</b> travels on or drifts. This kind of drilling procedure is also called drifting. The feed is usually attached with a flexible boom (like an arm) to a stationary or mobile unit that contains the powerpack (engine and hydraulic pump or compressor). Drifters are used in mining, construction, exploration, and natural science.|$|R
