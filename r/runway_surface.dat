5|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a ' touch-and-go landing' on Runway 34, it came around for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E
25|$|On 5 November 1997, after {{numerous}} attempts to shake free the jammed {{main landing gear}} of an Airbus A340-300 (G-VSKY) failed, the aircraft en route from Los Angeles to Heathrow, made an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport. The aircraft sustained major damage to the undersides of engines one, two and four, which made contact with the <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> during landing. The <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> was also damaged and several runway lights were broken as the right main landing gear wheels broke up during the deceleration. The aircraft was evacuated safely. Two crew members and five passengers sustained minor injuries during the evacuation. The damaged aircraft was repaired after the incident and was retired from the Virgin Atlantic fleet in 2003.|$|E
25|$|On 27 November 1984, a Beechcraft Baron 58, {{registration}} VH-ETV, {{operating a}} charter {{flight to the}} airport, suffered a left landing gear failure and was substantially damaged. The aircraft departed the <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> and {{came to rest on}} the grass. None of the occupants were seriously injured.|$|E

25|$|Ta' Qali {{originally}} had an unpaved airstrip before {{the outbreak of}} hostilities in 1939. The original airfield was built on a dried lake bed {{in the interior of}} the island on reasonably featureless plain situated between Rabat and Valletta. Before the war it was used by civil aircraft, but its <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> became unusable in heavy rain and so it was improved somewhat by the RAF.|$|E
25|$|Two P2V-2 {{modified}} for polar exploration under Project Ski Jump. Armament removed, with ski {{landing gear}} and provision for JATO rockets. Fitted with early MAD gear for magnetic survey purposes. Used for Operation Deep Freeze Antarctic exploration. The specially modified P2Vs had 16-foot long aluminum skis that {{were attached to}} the main landing gear units that when retracted, tucked into fairing just below the engines. This way the modified P2vs could still land on a regular <b>runway</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
25|$|A new asphalt <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> {{was laid}} between November 2006 and March 2007, {{at a cost}} of £17 million. Within this period, on 29 December and 3 January there were four {{incidents}} of reduced braking action in wet conditions on the temporary surface, including two in which aircraft left the runway. From 5 January ten airlines, led by EasyJet, cancelled or diverted their Bristol flights. The airport closed the runway on 7 January to cut grooves into the surface to improve water runoff, and flights resumed the next day.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} {{caused the}} cancellation or diversion {{of hundreds of}} flights, with ripple effects throughout the North American air traffic system. By that night, {{four of the five}} <b>runway</b> <b>surfaces</b> at Pearson were back in service, but the flight and passenger backlog continued through the next day.|$|R
50|$|The 319th Special Operations Squadron {{mission is}} to provide intra-theater support for special {{operations}} forces and it is currently equipped with the U-28A, {{a modified version of}} the Pilatus PC-12. The U-28A was selected for its versatile performance and ability to operate from short and unimproved <b>runway</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between 2007 and 2009, airport {{improvement}} projects {{replaced the}} <b>runway</b> <b>surfaces,</b> rebuilt the apron to better handle aircraft and repaved and added markings to the runway.

25|$|The {{approach}} is continued beyond the OM, the commander takes over {{operation of the}} Power Levers. Descent is continued below the DH. A significant reduction in power and significant roll to the left follows, just below 100ft, a third go-around is called by the commander which the co-pilot acknowledges. Coincident with the application of go-around power by the commander, control of the aircraft was lost. The aircraft rolls rapidly to the right beyond the vertical which brought the right wingtip {{into contact with the}} <b>runway</b> <b>surface.</b> The aircraft continued to roll and impacted the runway inverted. The stall warning sounded continuously during the final seven seconds of the CVR recording.|$|E
500|$|To {{distribute}} the aircraft's {{weight on the}} ground, the 757 has a retractable tricycle landing gear with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear. The landing gear was purposely designed to be taller than the company's previous narrow-body aircraft {{in order to provide}} ground clearance for stretched models. In 1982, the [...] became the first subsonic jetliner to offer carbon brakes as a factory option, supplied by Dunlop. The stretched [...] features a retractable tailskid on its aft fuselage to prevent damage if the tail section contacts the <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> during takeoff.|$|E
500|$|To {{distribute}} the aircraft's {{weight on the}} ground, the 767 has a retractable tricycle landing gear with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear. The original wing and gear design accommodated the stretched 767-300 without major changes. The 767-400ER features a larger, more widely spaced main gear with 777 wheels, tires, and brakes. To prevent damage if the tail section contacts the <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> during takeoff, 767-300 and 767-400ER models are fitted with a retractable tailskid. [...] The 767 has left-side exit doors near {{the front and rear}} of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|On August 11, 2008, a Bombardier DHC-8 Q400 {{aircraft}} {{operating as}} Airphil Express Flight PR29 with 75 passengers and 3 crew, had safely landed on runway 04 at Catarman Airport when the airplane's nosewheel struck {{a soft spot}} in the <b>runway's</b> <b>surface</b> during taxi, the airline reported. No injuries were reported.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} the aircraft landing loads and traction facility to study the braking and cornering characteristics, including the drag-force and cornering-force friction coefficients, of 30 by 11. 5 - 14. 5, type VIII aircraft tires with five different tread patterns. Test data were obtained on dry, damp, and flooded <b>runway</b> <b>surfaces</b> over a range of yaw angles from 0 deg to 12 deg at ground speeds from 5 knots to 100 knots. The results of this investigation indicate that a tread pattern consisting of transverse cuts across the entire width of the tread slightly improved the tire traction performance on wet surfaces. The braking and cornering capability of the tires was degraded by thin-film lubrication and tire hydroplaning effects on the wet <b>runway</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The braking capability of the tires decreased when the yaw angle was increased...|$|R
50|$|It {{offers one}} asphalt runway (16/34) {{equipped}} with night landing lights. The two other <b>runway</b> <b>surfaces</b> (04/22 & 10/28) are in rough condition. There are several hangars at the aerodrome and {{room for more}} development. It is host to many activities year-round, including a glider club, the Innisfail Flying Club and a skydiving training facility.|$|R
500|$|In March 2015, {{additional}} {{details of the}} improvement package were published in Aviation Week & Space Technology. [...] The 777-300ER is to shed 1,800lb. [...] Boeing will replace the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels, {{similar to those used}} on the 787. New flight control software is to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> regardless {{of the extent to which}} pilots command the elevators. [...] Boeing is also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip is to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a"poor man's airfoil" [...] by Boeing; this originally developed for the McDonnell Douglas MD-12 project. [...] Another change involves elevator trim bias. [...] These changes are to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%.|$|E
2500|$|Pocklington Airfield {{has three}} {{concrete}} and tarmac runways of , sufficient in length to take RAF bombers during the Second World War, but in September 1946 the airfield was closed. Although the site remains in use with gliders - and occasionally hot air balloonists - {{a lot of}} the concrete <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> has gone, and the control tower is not in operation. It is therefore classified as [...] "limited flying". The airfield is now wholly owned by the Wolds Gliding Club.|$|E
2500|$|Runway 10 {{is thought}} to be the only airport runway in the United States with marked gravestones in it. [...] Federal law {{generally}} prohibits the moving of a grave without the permission of the next of kin. In this case, two graves of the Dotson Family, the earliest grave dating backed to 1857, were encountered during the construction of the runway. Since the next of kin could not be located, the graves were left undisturbed. Two additional graves are located off the <b>runway</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

50|$|On 1 October 2005, the {{squadron}} was again activated {{as part of}} an overall expansion of the Air Force Special Operations Command. It was equipped with the U-28A, {{a modified version of the}} Pilatus PC-12, able to operate from short and unimproved <b>runway</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The 319th provides airlift support to United States Army Special Forces, and provides intratheater support for special operations.|$|R
2500|$|The runway is {{designated}} runway 15, or 33, {{depending on}} the direction of use. The <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> consists of an extremely high-friction concrete strip designed to maximize the braking ability of the Space Shuttle at its high landing speed, with a paving thickness of [...] at the center. It uses a grooved design to provide drainage and further increase the coefficient of friction. [...] The original groove design was found to actually provide too much friction for the rubber used in the Shuttle's tires, causing failures during several landings. This issue was resolved by grinding down the pavement, reducing {{the depth of the}} grooves significantly.|$|E
2500|$|V1 is the {{critical}} engine failure recognition speed or takeoff decision speed. It is the speed above which the takeoff will continue even if an engine fails or another problem occurs, such as a blown tire. The speed will vary among aircraft types and varies according to factors such as aircraft weight, runway length, wing flap setting, engine thrust used and <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> contamination, thus it must {{be determined by the}} pilot before takeoff. Aborting a takeoff after V1 is strongly discouraged because the aircraft will by definition not be able to stop {{before the end of the}} runway, thus suffering a [...] "runway overrun".|$|E
2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 Glanville was put in charge of the research and experiments department of the Ministry of Home Security as chief scientific adviser at the Princes Risborough station. The station was situated here to avoid German air raids, when these failed to materialise he returned to the RRL and acted as an advisor to the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Aircraft Production on the construction of concrete runways and specialised airfields. The latter included [...] "Prefabricated Bituminised Surfacing" [...] (PBS) made from bitumen-impregnated hessian which could act as a <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> over swampy or otherwise difficult ground. These PBS airstrips had a service life of around four months and were easily transportable, {{in the course of the}} war 60 million square yards of PBS were manufactured in the UK, US and India. The soil section of the BRS, assisted by Glanville, was also responsible for the assessment and categorisation of European beaches prior to the Normandy Landings.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study the effect of grooved runway configurations on aircraft tire braking traction on flooded <b>runway</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The investigation was performed, utilizing size 49 x 17, type VII, aircraft tires with an inflation pressure of 170 lb per square inch at ground speeds up to approximately 120 knots. The results of this investigation indicate that when the runway is flooded, grooved surfaces provide better braking traction than an ungrooved surface and, in general, the level of braking traction was found to improve as the tire bearing pressure was increased because {{of an increase in}} the groove area of either the surface or the tire tread. Rounding the groove edges tended to degrade the tire braking capability from that developed on the same groove configuration with sharp edges. Results also indicate that braking friction coefficients for the test tires and <b>runway</b> <b>surfaces</b> decreased as ground speed was increased because of the hydroplaning effects...|$|R

2500|$|Hamburg ATC then offered Neubrandenburg Airport, {{which was}} {{rejected}} by the crew of Flight 850 on receiving the weather information. Werneuchen Airfield was then offered, which was [...] away and offered a runway [...] long. Werneuchen was accepted by the crew. ATC managed to contact the chairman of the flying club based at Werneuchen. He stated that the <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> was [...] long, but an earth bank stretched across the runway leaving [...] available. Landing on Runway 08 meant that {{the first part of the}} runway fell before the earth bank. Almost an hour after aborting the approach to Fuhlsbüttel, Flight 850 began its approach to Werneuchen. The crew reported that they were visual with the runway and were advised by Werneuchen ATC that they needed to land on the eastern part of Runway 08. When Flight 850 turned onto its final approach, the captain remarked that the runway was [...] "longer than Berne", and told the first officer to land wherever he wanted. Although the closed off part of the runway had been marked as such, the markings had weathered severely over the years, meaning that the original markings were easier to see than those that actually applied. Fading light and a lack of runway lighting contributed to the inability of the crew to see the earth bank.|$|E

There were plans to make the east-west runway into a certified drag racing strip but costs and the (then) isolated area saw enthusiasts move elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} correctness of <b>runway</b> pavement <b>surfaces</b> is {{a crucial}} element ensuring safety during flight operations. Foreign and national normative documents specify the required values of coefficients of friction both for designed (new) and utilized <b>runway</b> pavement <b>surfaces</b> and/or those subject to planned renovation works.
