40|$|This {{study used}} whole-farm management, {{nutrient}} budgeting/greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and feed formulation computer tools {{to determine the}} production, environmental and financial implications of intensifying the beef production of typical New Zealand (NZ) sheep and beef farming systems. Two methods <b>of</b> <b>intensification,</b> feeding maize silage (MS) or applying nitrogen (N) fertiliser, were implemented on two farm types differing in the proportions of cultivatable land to hill land (25 % vs. 75 % hill). In addition, the consequences <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> by incorporating a beef feedlot (FL) into each of the farm types were also examined. Feeding MS or applying N fertiliser substantially increased the amount of beef produced per ha. Intensifying production was also associated with increased total N leaching and GHG emissions although there were differences between the methods <b>of</b> <b>intensification.</b> Feeding MS resulted in lower environmental impacts than applying N even after {{taking into account the}} land to grow the maize for silage. Based on 2007 / 08 prices, typical NZ sheep and beef farms were making a financial loss and neither method <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> increased profitability with the exception of small annual applications of N, especially to the 75 % hill farm.

40|$|Of all the {{possible}} vehicles for intensification, adverbial intensifiers in predicate-intensifier collocations (very interesting) and, to a lesser extent, intensifying adjectives in adjective-noun collocations (great fun), are the most widely studied intensifying devices in the relevant literature. By contrast, as far as I am aware, intensifying [N+A]A and [A+A]A compounds have not received much attention to date. It is therefore {{the purpose of this}} paper to investigate the relation <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> which links the two constituents of the compound against the background of previous research on intensifying compound adjectives and, most importantly, on predicate-intensifier collocations, in order to discuss degree <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> and underlying pattern <b>of</b> <b>intensification.</b> As will be seen using a preliminary set of examples and lexicographic evidence from previous studies and the Oxford English Dictionary, such compounds achieve intensification for the extremely high and absolute degree (snow-white, all-red) chiefly via semantic-feature copying (snow-soft), or are motivated via direct or indirect comparison (snow white, blind drunk) ...|$|R

Qualitative and {{quantitative}} analysis of selected parameters of mandible movements, electronically registered {{in patients with}} temporomandibular joint dysfunction and healthy ones. Material. Function test of the mandible movements was conducted in 175 patients. Gender distribution was 143 women and 32 men, aged 9 to 84. Methods. The studied population, after accurate clinical examination, was divided into age groups with the range of five years. All the patients had Zebris JMA computerized facebow examination done, according to the generally accepted principles and procedures. Results. Mean values of mouth opening calculated to 45. 6 [*]mm in healthy group and 37. 6 [*]mm in TMJ dysfunction group.
