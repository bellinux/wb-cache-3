50|$|In June 2012, an EIMCO 12B <b>Rocker</b> <b>Shovel</b> was {{featured}} in an episode of the American reality television series Auction Hunters, filmed in Littleton, Colorado. It was sold to a gold miner for $3,600.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers {{added the}} EIMCO 12B <b>Rocker</b> <b>Shovel</b> Loader of 1938 to its List of Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks as {{reference}} number 212 {{out of a}} total number of 259 objects (as of 2015).|$|E
50|$|A <b>Rocker</b> <b>Shovel</b> {{is usually}} powered by {{compressed}} air, {{or in some}} cases electricity. It is commonly mounted on steel wheels designed to run on narrow gauge rails, with some later models using metal or rubber-tyred road wheels. The operator, standing on a raised platform {{to one side of the}} machine, operates the controls, one lever to drive the machine along the tracks, and another to raise and lower the bucket. Once the bucket has been filled by driving the loader forwards into the pile of material, the rocker mechanism throws the contents over the top of the machine and into a wagon behind. Once full, the loaded wagon can be taken away and replaced with an empty one to allow loading to continue.|$|E
