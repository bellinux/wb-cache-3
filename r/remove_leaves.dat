50|$|Locomotive ESL103 was {{scrapped}} in 1954 as {{the result}} of collision damage sustained in 1948. It was deemed to be beyond economical repair. Gradually, de-icing gear was fitted to service trains, beginning with the A stock on the Metropolitan line, and the need for separate sleet locomotives decreased. ESL100 and ESL112 were modified in 1972, so that they could be used to <b>remove</b> <b>leaves</b> from the running rails. Experiments were made to find a suitable fluid which would assist adhesion, but none was found. The two locomotives continued to be used for brushing leaves from the rails. All of the vehicles had ceased to be used by August 1985. ESL107 was the last to be withdrawn, and was preserved by the London Transport Museum.|$|E
50|$|The {{harvest of}} the usable parts is often {{done with a}} machete, the {{harvester}} taking care to avoid the spines. Instead of cutting down a tree, a harvester may use a media luna, a long pole with a curved blade at the end, to <b>remove</b> <b>leaves.</b> A bamboo pole with a chisel at the end may also be used. The Emberá prefer to harvest the plant during the full moon, when they believe the fibers are strongest. The leaf is split and two types of fibers can be extracted, a thick one useful for making the frames of baskets, and a thinner one used for weaving. The fibers are washed and sun-dried, then sometimes dyed with extracts of other plants, bleached with sulphur, or buried in mud to darken them. In basketry the fibers may be woven together with fibers from the Nahuala palm (Carludovica palmata), a palm-like monocot.|$|E

50|$|Mechanical {{harvesters}} {{are large}} tractors that straddle grapevine trellises and, using firm plastic or rubber rods, strike the fruiting {{zone of the}} grapevine to dislodge the grapes from the rachis. Mechanical harvesters {{have the advantage of}} being able to cover a large area of vineyard land in {{a relatively short period of}} time, and with a minimum investment of manpower per harvested ton. A disadvantage of mechanical harvesting is the indiscriminate inclusion of foreign non-grape material in the product, especially leaf stems and leaves, but also, depending on the trellis system and grapevine canopy management, may include moldy grapes, canes, metal debris, rocks and even small animals and bird nests. Some winemakers <b>remove</b> <b>leaves</b> and loose debris from the grapevine before mechanical harvesting to avoid such material being included in the harvested fruit. In the United States mechanical harvesting is seldom used for premium winemaking because of the indiscriminate picking and increased oxidation of the grape juice. In other countries (such as Australia and New Zealand), mechanical harvesting of premium winegrapes is more common because of general labor shortages.|$|E

40|$|Agent Orange is at {{the core}} of an ongoing {{controversy}} involving veterans organizations that want the Federal govenment to complete a study intended to examine possible lasting health effects of exposure to this herbicide during the Vietnam War. Many Vietnam veterans are quite concerned that various health problems they have suffered may be associated with exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam. The problem now is to get the government, or possibly some university or private contractor, to complete a well-conducted study on this subject. Various phenoxy herbicides were used in Vietnam from about 1962 to 1971, principally as defoliants to kill plant life and <b>remove</b> <b>leaves</b> from trees so as to allow observation of enemy movement from the air. Agent Orange, a mixture of equal parts of the two active ingredients 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2, 4, 5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, was the most commonly used herbicid...|$|E
40|$|The banana leaf {{spotting}} disease yellow Sigatoka {{is established}} and actively controlled in Australia through intensive chemical treatments and diseased leaf removal. In the State of Queensland, the State government imposes standards for de-leafing to minimise {{the risk of}} the disease spreading in 6 banana pest quarantine areas. Of these, the Northern Banana Pest Quarantine Area is the most significant in terms of banana production. Previous regulations imposed obligations on owners of banana plants within this area to <b>remove</b> <b>leaves</b> from plants with visible spotting on more than 15 per cent of any leaf during the wet season. Recently, this leaf disease threshold has been lowered to 5 per cent. In this paper we examine the likely impact this more-costly regulation will have on the spread of the disease. We estimate that the average net benefit of reducing the diseased leaf threshold is only likely to be $ 1. 4 million per year over the next 30 years, expressed as the annualised present value of tightened regulation. This result varies substantially when the timeframe of the analysis is changed, with shorter time frames indicating poorer net returns from the change in protocols. Overall, the benefit of the regulation change is likely to be minor...|$|E
40|$|A single {{treatment}} of nutrient/defoliant chemicals {{was found to}} advance bloom significantly {{in the first half}} of the bloom period; this treatment was applied on 25 October. This treatment advanced bloom from 4 % to 73 % in 5 days (March 3 to March 7), compared to the control (0 - 40 %) and the hand defoliation on the same date (0 - 11 %). Hand defoliation tended to result in a bloom progression that was equivalent to, or delayed, compared to the untreated control. Chemical nutrient/defoliant treatments did not <b>remove</b> <b>leaves</b> very far in advance of normal leaf fall, although leaves were ‘burned’. The treatments did result in bloom advance that was equivalent to, or slightly ahead of, the control. By March 9, bloom had progressed so far that treatments generally did not differ in the percentage of truss buds open. All truss buds opened and no vegetative or reproductive bud death was found. The significance of the results is discussed as they relate to previous defoliation work and the use of the Dynamic model for calculating chill accumulation. Problem and its Significance: While rest-breaking agents have become commonly used in California cherry production, application timing continues to involve a certain amount of uncertainty from year-to-year. In order to use any chilling model adequately and thereby schedule rest-breaking treatments, both the beginning point of dormancy and the beginning point of chill accumulation must be understood. One method of testing dormancy onset is tre...|$|E

40|$|In high-tech, heated tomato glasshouses, stem infections {{caused by}} Botrytiscinerea usually end up {{girdling}} the stem, resulting in plant death and consequently high economic losses. Such infections originate primarily from wounds created during leaf pruning, a common cultural practice {{in which it}} is intended to <b>remove</b> <b>leaves</b> completely, resulting in smooth stem wounds. However, hasty leaf pruning often results in numerous petiole stubs accidentally left behind. In this study analysis of disease incidences clearly proved that pruning leaves flush to the stem resulted in absolute resistance of the stem wounds, whereas petiole stubs displayed a high level of susceptibility to B. cinerea. Postponing inoculation of wounds after pruning indicated that development of nearly complete resistance occurs within 48 h after deleafing. Monitoring of the wound wetness period showed that drying of the wound surface is not the cause of the decreased susceptibility, contrary to what was commonly believed. Tomato mutants deficient in disease signalling showed altered phenotypes for susceptibility to B. cinerea, indicating that defences against this pathogen in petiole stubs depend on ethylene signalling. Additionally, the decreased susceptibility of mutants deficient in the biosynthesis of jasmonates and abscisic acid suggest an antagonistic effect of these signal molecules. On the other hand, resistance of smooth stem wounds could not be altered by disruption of salicylic acid, ethylene, jasmonate or abscisic acid signalling. This indicates that this remarkable absolute resistance to B. cinerea does not depend on the major disease signalling pathways...|$|E
40|$|This paper extends a {{previous}} study {{on the use of}} image analysis to automatically estimate mango crop yield (fruit on tree) (Payne et al., 2013). Images were acquired at night, using artificial lighting of fruit at an earlier stage of maturation (‘stone hardening’ stage) than for the previous study. Multiple image sets were collected during the 2011 and 2012 seasons. Despite altering the settings of the filters in the algorithm presented in the previous study (based on colour segmentation using RGB and YCbCr, and texture), the less mature fruit were poorly identified, due to a lower extent of red colouration of the skin. The algorithm was altered to reduce its dependence on colour features and to increase its use of texture filtering, hessian filtering in particular, to <b>remove</b> <b>leaves,</b> trunk and stems. Results on a calibration set of images (2011) were significantly improved, with 78. 3 % of fruit detected, an error rate of 10. 6 % and an R 2 value (machine vision to manual count) of 0. 63. Further application of the approach on validation sets from 2011 and 2012 had mixed results, with issues related to variation in foliage characteristics between sets. It is proposed the detection approaches within both of these algorithms be used as a ‘toolkit’ for a mango detection system, within an expert system that also uses user input to improve the accuracy of the system...|$|E
40|$|Those {{of us who}} are {{fortunate}} to study animal behaviour cannot but marvel at the seemingly conscious and intelligent behaviours that animals sometimes display. Birds are known to adapt the behaviour they use to obtain insects from under the barks of trees, to steal cream from milk bottles covered with metal foil. Robert Hinde and others in England showed that such behaviour was ‘invented’ by a few individuals and then copied by many others. Jane Goodall has described how chimpanzees will select a small branch, <b>remove</b> <b>leaves</b> and twigs and thus fashion it into a suitable tool, carry it to a termite’s nest and then use it to retrieve termites by probing with it. Alex Kacelnik at Oxford and others have shown how crows can bend pieces of metal wire and fashion hooks with which they retrieve worms from bottles. Closer home, Milind Watve and his students have shown that bee eaters will not approach their nests if they spot intruders to whom they are visible, but will do so if they spot intruders to whom they are not visible, suggesting that bee eaters have what psychologists call a ‘theory of mind’. In our own research, we have found numerous instances of members of social wasp colonies behaving in seemingly intelligent ways. For example, groups of workers will revolt against the queen and leave together to start their own colony, a given set of workers will cooperate with some queens and not others, workers will sometimes show preferential behaviour towards one but not another dominant individual...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLeaf litter {{decomposition}} is {{an important}} ecosystem function carried out by a diverse array of consumers, including aquatic hyphomycetes. Aquatic hyphomycetes are found in streams worldwide, but their diversity and abundance varies across systems. In general, species diversity is lower across tropical and subtropical systems when compared with temperate biomes. The low diversity in tropical and subtropical areas may be related to: (a) lower seasonality; (b) our inability to detect fungi by traditional techniques; (c) low tur- bulence of rivers where many studies were carried out; (d) low nutrient content in many studied tropical systems; (e) leaves highly defended against consumers; and (f) competition from other decomposers. In terms of function, fungal biomass, sporulation rates and litter decomposition by aquatic hyphomycetes in the tropics {{was reported to be}} equivalent to or much lower than observed in temperate zones. The feeding ecology of shredder inverte- brates is strongly related to the presence of microbial decomposers in the environment. The lack of shredders reported for some tropical rivers may be related to a low microbial biomass, well defended tropical leaves and frequent hydrological events which <b>remove</b> <b>leaves</b> before they can be used by shredders. Seasonal variations in rain fall in tropical and subtropical systems are likely to affect litter fall, the identity and quality of litter, the reproduction of aquatic hyphomycetes (due to turbulence effects) and therefore the community composition of aquatic hyphomycetes throughout the year. Future research on aquatic hyphomycetes and litter decomposition in the tropics and sub-tropics should address the diversity/identity gap, altitudinal gradient changes and the contribution of aquatic hyphomycetes to the trophic ecology of shredders...|$|E
