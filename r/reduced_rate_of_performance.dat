Maximum speed of the G-2 was 537km/h (334mph) at sea level and 660km/h (410mph) at 7,000m (22,970ft) rated {{altitude}} with the initial <b>reduced</b> 1.3atm <b>rating.</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>of</b> the G-1 was similar, but above rated altitude the GM-1 system it was equipped with {{could be used to}} provide an additional 350horsepower. With his G-1/R2, pilot R. Klein achieved 660km/h (420mph) at 12,000m (39,370ft), and a ceiling of 13,800m (45,275ft).|$|R
40|$|Sodium-aided {{hyperhydration}} {{has been}} shown to <b>reduce</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> dehydration, improve <b>performance,</b> and alleviate markers of physical stress during endurance exercise in the heat. Caffeine use as an ergogenic and through casual consumption of foods is common among endurance athletes; but caffeine can have diuretic effects and its use prior to exercise may compromise hydration status and exercise performance by promoting fluid excretion. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of caffeine consumption on sodium-aided hyperhydration. METHODS: Fifteen well-hydrated male subjects (21 ± 2 yr, 176 ± 6 cm, 80. 2 ± 10. 1 kg) who were free from known renal, digestive, and cardiovascular disease underwent five hyperhydration strategies. Each strategy began with a complete bladder void from which urine specific gravity was measured. The bladder void was followed immediately by ingestion of 20 mL H 2 O ∙ kg bm- 1 combined with either no treatment (NT), placebo (P), 5 mg caffeine ∙ kg bm- 1 (Caf), 110 mg NaCl ∙ kg bm- 1 (Na), or 5 mg caffeine ∙ kg bm- 1 plus 110 mg NaCl ∙ kg bm- 1 (CafNa) administered in a randomized, double-blind, crossover manner. Subjects then rested quietly for two hours, performing a bladder void every 15 minutes. Total urine production during the two hour collection periods for each strategy were compared using repeated measures ANOVA with Sidak post hoc analyses. Levels of significance were set a priori at P 3 ̆c 0. 05. RESULTS: Urine specific gravity measured before each strategy (1. 006 ± 0. 003) did not differ significantly between treatments or subjects and indicated that subjects were well and similarly hydrated {{at the beginning of each}} hyperhydration strategy. Total urine productions as a percentage of fluid consumed were 103...|$|R
