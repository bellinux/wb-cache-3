5|$|In the 1940s, Gandhi pooled {{ideas with}} some Muslim leaders who sought {{religious}} harmony like him, and opposed the proposed partition of British India into India and Pakistan.

Gandhi accepted this and began having Muslim prayers <b>read</b> <b>in</b> Hindu temples to play his part, {{but was unable to}} get Hindu prayers <b>read</b> <b>in</b> mosques.

40|$|AbstractOne of the {{fundamental}} problems many English language teachers face with is enhancing L 2 learners’ reading ability and maintaining their interest <b>in</b> <b>reading.</b> Most L 2 learners have certain difficulties while <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English since they {{are not aware of}} the effective ways of reading and understanding a text, which might cause resistance and affect their attitudes towards <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English. Thus, research emphasizes the importance of instruction on graphic organizers (GOs) to promote <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> a second (L 2) or foreign (FL) language (Fly, Jean & Hunter, 1988; Ellis, 2004; Amin, 2004). The present study investigates the possible effects of instruction on four concrete graphic organizers (GOs) on students’ application of those visual displays in a text, and examines their attitudes towards <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> an EFL classroom. Data coming from pre and post questionnaires, focus group interviews and think alouds revealed congruence between instruction on graphic organizers and learners’ attitudes towards <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> an EFL classroom...|$|R
5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when <b>read</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap {{may be involved in}} the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé had <b>read</b> <b>in</b> a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting {{that there had been}} a number of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article's author suggested that it may have been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility. To develop this plot further, Hergé consulted Professor , an astrophysicist at Liège.|$|E
5|$|After William's {{death the}} Historia was copied and {{circulated}} in the crusader states and was eventually brought to Europe. In the 13th century, James of Vitry {{had access to}} a copy while he was bishop of Acre, and it was used by Guy of Bazoches, Matthew Paris, and Roger of Wendover in their own chronicles. However, there are only ten known manuscripts that contain the Latin chronicle, all of which come from France and England, so William's work {{may not have been}} very widely <b>read</b> <b>in</b> its original form. In England, however, the Historia was expanded in Latin, with additional information from the Itinerarium Regis Ricardi, and the chronicle of Roger Hoveden; this version was written around 1220.|$|E

The sample group consists of 70 learners and a background questionnaire, interviews, oral presentations, classroom discussions, essay papers, and responses to examination questions were used for data collection.

5|$|After {{attending}} Salisbury Boys' School, Milton High School in Bulawayo and Diocesan College, Rondebosch, Beadle studied {{law at the}} University of Cape Town.

There he played rugby and tennis for the college, boxed for the university and qualified as a pilot with the Oxford University Air Squadron. He graduated with a second-class Bachelor of Civil Law degree in 1930, and soon after was called to the English bar.

40|$|AbstractThis {{experimental}} study investigated pre-intermediate level Turkish EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners⿿ attitudes towards <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English, {{the effect of}} their attitudes towards unknown words <b>in</b> <b>reading</b> texts on their attitudes towards <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English {{in general and the}} effect of explicit strategy instruction in contextual inferencing strategies on pre-intermediate level EFL students⿿ attitudes towards <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English. The study was carried out at Bülent Ecevit University, School of Foreign Languages, with the participation of 82 pre-intermediate level EFL learners and two instructors. Data were collected through questionnaires and interviews in two phases: pre- and post-treatment. An ⿿Attitudes towards Reading in English⿿ questionnaire was used to find out the students⿿ pre-training attitudes towards reading. Data from the pre-questionnaire and pre-interviews provided information about the effect of the students⿿ attitudes towards unknown words <b>in</b> <b>reading</b> texts on their attitudes to <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English. After a three-week explicit strategy training period and a two week interval, the students were given the same questionnaire and interviews were held. The analyses of the pre-training data revealed that the students⿿ attitudes towards <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English were neutral, and their negative attitudes towards unknown words <b>in</b> <b>reading</b> texts had a negative impact on their attitudes towards <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English.

Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E
