40|$|A {{physically}} based distributed {{slope stability}} model is described that utilizes a combined surface-subsurface kinematic wave module to assess groundwater fluctuations related to slope stability. A total of 82 major <b>rainstorms</b> from 1972 to 1990 in Carnation Creek, British Columbia, were examined {{to determine the}} influence of different characteristics of <b>rainstorms</b> (such as mean and maximum hourly intensity, duration, and rainfall amount) on the slope stability. These <b>rainstorms</b> vary in mean intensity from 16 to 112 mm h- 1, storm duration from 11 to 93 h, and maximum hourly intensity from 34 to 35 mm h- 1. Four synthetic 'uniform intensity' <b>rainstorms</b> were also tested against real storms to assess the effect of short-term hourly rainfall intensity peaks on landslide occurrence. Altogether, 602 simulations were conducted. The combined influence of mean and maximum hourly intensity, duration, and total rainfall amount of <b>rainstorms</b> were important in generating landslides. The temporal distribution of short-term intensity also influenced the landslide occurrence. When saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil was lowered or soil depth was raised, most <b>rainstorms</b> produced larger numbers of landslides. For the most part, actual <b>rainstorms</b> produced less stable conditions than their synthetic 'uniform intensity' counterparts. For all landslide-producing storms, slope failure usually occurred after some threshold of cumulative rainfall and maximum hourly rainfall intensity. These simulations provide insights into the distributed behaviour of landslide occurrence during large <b>rainstorms</b> with varying characteristics. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R

The video begins with past scenes of Carey's mother being disowned by her family after becoming romantically involved with a black man, and finds the singer in the present walking through a heavy <b>rainstorm</b> in New York.

In May 1861, the excavation collapsed at Euston causing considerable damage to the neighbouring buildings.

30|$|Rapid {{assessment}} of the adverse impact of <b>rainstorms</b> on city transport networks is a typical interdisciplinary topic, which requires holistic understanding of the interactions between the networks and meteorological hazards, {{as well as any}} intrinsic system properties of a network. In this study, we combined the knowledge from the fields of disaster risk research, transportation engineering, and network systems and developed a mesoscopic model to assess the adverse impact of <b>rainstorms</b> through quantitatively estimating traffic volume in a regional transport network. The proposed impact assessment model takes into account the direct and secondary impacts of <b>rainstorms</b> on transport infrastructures, as well as the indirect effect caused by network connectivity. We used the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region as the case study area and simulated the impact of the 21 July 2012 storm event. We evaluated the impact of <b>rainstorms</b> on the regional transport network using traffic data obtained from toll booths. The results show reasonable accuracy and computational efficiency, which demonstrate the potential of the proposed model for rapid disaster impact assessment and risk reduction planning.|$|R
5|$|In {{the small}} town of Home, Pennsylvania, a woman gives birth to a {{deformed}} baby. Three similarly-deformed men bury it near their dilapidated house during a <b>rainstorm.</b> Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are sent to investigate after the corpse is found by children during a sandlot ball game. While talking to Home's sheriff Andy Taylor (Tucker Smallwood), Mulder asks whether the Peacock brothers—the inhabitants of the house nearest to the crime scene—have been questioned about the baby. Taylor informs him that the house dates back to the American Civil War and is without electricity, running water, or heat. He also insinuates that the family has been inbreeding since the war. The three Peacock brothers watch the agents from their front porch.|$|E

One night when Mr. Fisher leaves the store dressed in Primont's hat and coat (lent due to a <b>rainstorm),</b> Shark recognizes him, but decides to mug him anyway, as that would be even better for Maxie's purposes. Danny's father is so badly injured that he needs expensive surgery; so Maxie pays for a specialist to perform it. Maxie later blackmails Danny into signing with him by threatening to tell his father about {{his involvement in the}} mugging, and then does it anyway.

5|$|Benjamin Boyce died in 1928 {{of a heart}} embolism. His {{father did}} not arrive home until after his son's death. Boyce was so saddened over his son's death that his own health suffered. One of Boyce's last efforts was to publish his son's letters from his South Seas expeditions: Dear Dad Letters from New Guinea. Boyce died from {{bronchial}} pneumonia on June 11, 1929, in Chicago and was buried in his adopted hometown of Ottawa, Illinois, on June 13, 1929, in the Ottawa Avenue Cemetery, with West delivering the eulogy. Boy Scouts maintained an honor guard with an American flag in a heavy <b>rainstorm</b> in two-hour shifts at his Ottawa home and 32 Boy Scouts were chosen as honorary pallbearers. BSA officials sent his widow a telegram that said the entire American nation owed him a debt of gratitude.

5|$|Müller {{then decided}} to depart, owing {{to the risk of}} encountering {{superior}} warships. Upon leaving the harbor, he encountered a British freighter, , loaded with ammunition, that had already stopped to pick up a harbor pilot. While preparing to take possession of the ship, Emden had to recall her boats when she spotted an approaching ship. This proved to be the French destroyer , and the unprepared ship was quickly destroyed. Emden stopped to pick up survivors from Mousquet and departed at around 08:00 as the other French ships were raising steam in preparation to get underway. One officer and thirty-five sailors were plucked from the water. Another French destroyer tried to follow, but lost sight of the German raider in a <b>rainstorm.</b> On 30 October, Emden stopped the British steamer Newburn and put the French sailors aboard her after they signed statements promising not to return to the war. The attack on Penang was a significant shock to the Entente powers, and caused them to delay the large convoys from Australia, since they would need more powerful escorts.|$|E
