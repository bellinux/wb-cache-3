40|$|<b>Current</b> <b>transfer</b> {{behaviour}} in anisotropic superconducting bodies is {{the central}} topic of this thesis and focuses on {{the effect that the}} nonlinearity of the electric field dependence upon the local current density value and anisotropy have on the nature of current transport. The main motivation for this work was the desire for {{a better understanding of the}} conceptually difficult behaviour of current transport in superconducting bodies and examines <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> quantitatively for a number of important problems on the macroscopic and microscopic scale. This behaviour is examined both experimentally and using computer models. The successful development of a powerful, robust and adaptable numerical model for analysing the complex <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> behaviour has been the primary aim of this work. The range of parameters appropriate to macroscopic models of the Bi- 2212 CRT system has been experimentally examined using a specifically constructed apparatus for the measurement of current transport characteristics. A study of the self-field properties of the Bi- 2212 CRT material using a new experimental technique and mathematical analysis is presented and has allowed the importance of the self-field effect in the numerical model to be assessed. An essential requirement for the practical application of high current superconducting devices is the development of low resistance current contacts. The research presented examines this macroscopic <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> problem and aims to explain experimentally observed <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> characteristics at high applied currents. Existing models cannot explain these characteristics. <b>Current</b> <b>transfer</b> on the microscopic scale is also examined. Models of <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> have been developed from descriptions of specific microstructures that are thought to characterise the microstructure of Bi- 2223 and Bi- 2212 silver-sheathed tapes. This thesis specifically presents modelling of <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> between c-axis, low-angle c-axis and edge-on c-axis tilt oriented grain interfaces; the principal <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> paths between individual current elements of the microstructural models of current flow in polycrystalline HTSs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper investigates a {{miniature}} rectangular triplate-printed antenna, which {{acts as a}} magnetic field probe to estimate amplitude of the RF Electromagnetic Interference current by non-contact measurement. To characterize the probe, a <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> factor defined as {{the ratio of the}} probed voltage over the current is investigated by measuring the frequency-dependent S-parameter. Moving and rotating the probe will change the <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> factor, and then significantly affect the estimation of the RF current under detection.

Applying this model to Germany, using macro data for the period from 1970 to 2000, we show that almost 87 % of the German trade balance's surplus {{is due to the}} provision of <b>current</b> <b>transfers.</b> Accordingly, the main part of Germany's well-known strong export position is determined by factors underlying political decisions and not economic factors...|$|R

40|$|The <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> {{length of}} multi-filamentary superconducting NbTi and Nb 3 Sn strands was {{measured}} and analyzed. The {{aim is to}} understand and quantify the current distribution process between matrix and superconducting filaments occurring at current injection joints or shunting localized interruptions like originated by transverse cracks or high strain, temperature, or magnetic field in filaments. The <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> length was investigated on two different multi-filamentary Nb 3 Sn wires and one NbTi wire. Opposite to earlier clarifications, {{it was found that}} the <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> length cannot be simply represented by a single parameter but depends on the ratio of transport current and critical current and the distance from the current injection point or local interruption of the superconducting path in the filamentary zone. With the aid of our numerical 3 D multi-filamentary strand model, simulations were performed showing excellent agreement with the experimental data. For broader use, analytical formulae are proposed to determine the <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> length for multi-filamentary superconductors with complex cross-sectional layout. The increasing <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> length with the higher injected current and/or along with the distance away from the current injection point is explained by a progressive current penetration, which is caused by the high resistive matrix layers and complex layout.

Author Summary: Neurons take a great variety of shapes that allow them to perform their different computational roles across the brain. The most distinctive visible feature of many neurons is the extensively branched network of cable-like projections that make up their dendritic tree. A neuron receives current-inducing synaptic contacts from other cells across its dendritic tree. As in the case of botanical trees, dendritic trees are strongly tapered towards their tips. This tapering has previously been shown to offer a number of advantages over a constant width, both in terms of reduced energy requirements and the robust integration of inputs at different locations. However, in order to predict the computations that neurons perform, analytical solutions for the flow of input currents tend to assume constant dendritic diameters. Here we introduce an asymptotic approximation that accurately models the <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> in dendritic trees with arbitrary, continuously changing, diameters. When we then determine the diameter profiles that maximise <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> towards the cell body we find diameters similar to those observed in real neurons. We conclude that the tapering in dendritic trees to optimise signal transmission is a fundamental architectural principle of the brain...|$|R

Index Terms—Arc attachment, arc cathode, bifurcation of <b>current</b> <b>transfer,</b> bifurcation theory, high-pressure arc. CONSIDERABLE advances in theoretical and experimen-tal investigation of the plasma–cathode interaction in high-pressure arc discharges have been achieved during the last decade [1]. Simulation methods, available at present and validated experimentally, allow one to reliably describe many aspects of operation of thermionic cathodes. A challenging task is to simulate operation of cathodes of complex geometries, which are of practical interest, in particu-lar, those with protrusions [2], [3]. Results of such simulations are reported in this paper. Steady-state modes of <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> have been calculated with the use of the commercial software COMSOL Multi-physics, as described in [4]. Stability of each of the steady-state modes has been investigated, as described in [5].
