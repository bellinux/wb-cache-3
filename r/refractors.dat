25|$|Although {{the only}} way to move in the game is on foot, once Roll Caskett repairs a support car, she is able to {{directly}} take Mega Man to specific areas. In Legends, large gems called <b>Refractors</b> are used as a power source. Small shards of them can be exchanged for money, and in the game, enemies that are destroyed will often drop these Refractor Shards. When shards are picked up, the equivalent amount of Zenny, the game's basic unit of currency, is added automatically. The health of Mega Man can be increased through the game in the shops, while it can be recovered through packs bought at shops, obtaining red spheres from defeated opponents or by asking the character Data to recover Mega Man's health. Mega Man also has a Life Shield which reduces the damage that he can receive from enemies. The damage caused by enemies can also be reduced by obtaining upgrades to Mega Man's armor or his helmet. Mega Man's interactions with characters from the game can also affect the price of objects. If the player makes Mega Man be rude with characters, prices from objects will be increased and the dialogues with people will also change.|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of an atmosphere on Venus was concluded by Mikhail Lomonosov {{on the basis of}} his observation of the transit of Venus of 1761 from the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg. He used a two-lens achromat refractor and a weak solar filter (smoked glass) and [...] reported seeing a bump or bulge of light ("Lomonosov's arc") off the solar disc as Venus began to exit the Sun. Lomonosov attributed that effect to refraction of solar rays through an atmosphere; he also reported the appearance of a sliver around the part of Venus that had just entered the Sun's disk during the initial phase of transit. [...] In 2012, Pasachoff and Sheehan reported, based on knowing what Venus's atmosphere would look like because of Pasachoff and Schneider's observations of the 2004 transit of Venus, that what Lomonosov reported was not Venus's atmosphere. To make a decisive test, a group of researchers carried out experimental reconstruction of Lomonosov's discovery of Venusian atmosphere with antique <b>refractors</b> during the transit of Venus on [...] 5–6 June 2012. They observed the [...] "Lomonosov's arc" [...] and other aureole effects due to Venus's atmosphere and concluded that Lomonosov's telescope was fully adequate to the task of detecting the arc of light around Venus off the Sun's disc during ingress or egress if proper experimental techniques as described by Lomonosov in his 1761 paper are employed.|$|E

2500|$|The Legends series {{takes place}} on a flooded Earth. Because of the flooding, only a few sparse islands exist and energy sources are rare. In order to satisfy this {{increasing}} demand for energy to power up machinery, quantum <b>refractors</b> found in ancient ruins are used. These <b>refractors</b> are valuable; they serve as an energy source, and their shards are used as currency. However, the main goal of every person {{is to find the}} Mother Lode, an item of supposed infinite power that can fill the need for the energy in one swoop. Those who try to excavate these ruins are called [...] "Diggers" [...] ("Digouters" [...] in the Japanese version). The protagonist of the game is Mega Man Volnutt, a Digger living in a ship called Flutter. He lives there alongside Roll Caskett, his Spotter who is searching for her missing father, Barrel Caskett, Roll's grandfather, and Data, a mysterious monkey that talks in gibberish only Mega Man himself can understand. The game's antagonists are pirates known as the Bonnes who want to steal Kattelox's secret treasure in order to become rich. They consist of Teisel Bonne, the leader of the group. His sibling is Tron Bonne, who builds most of their robots used in their elaborate schemes (and develops feelings for Mega Man), and the youngest brother, Bon Bonne, who can only say one word—"Babu!" [...] The Bonnes are accompanied by forty Servbots, robots under the care of Tron.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the types}} of telescopes that amateurs build vary widely, {{including}} <b>Refractors,</b> Schmidt–Cassegrains and Maksutovs, the most popular telescope design is the Newtonian reflector, described by Russell W. Porter as “The Poor Man's Telescope”. The Newtonian {{has the advantage of}} being a simple design that allows for maximum size for the minimum expense. And since the design employs a single front surface mirror as its objective it only has one surface that has to be ground and polished, as opposed to three for the Maksutov and four for the refractor and the Schmidt–Cassegrain. Typically a Newtonian telescope of 6” or 8" [...] (15 or 20cm) aperture is a standard starter project, constructed as a club project or by individuals working from books or from plans found on the Internet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulties}} with the impractical metal mirrors of reflecting telescopes {{led to the}} construction of large refracting telescopes. By 1866 refracting telescopes had reached [...] in aperture with many larger [...] "Great refractors" [...] being built in the mid to late 19th century. In 1897, the refractor reached its maximum practical limit in a research telescope with the construction of the Yerkes Observatorys' [...] refractor (although a larger refractor Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900 with an objective of [...] diameter was temporarily exhibited at the Paris 1900 Exposition). No larger <b>refractors</b> could be built because of gravity's effect on the lens. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens will sag due to gravity, distorting the image it produces.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} main {{instrument of}} the observatory, housed in the dome, was a 280mm <b>refractor</b> with a focal distance of 4.9 m. In 1895, this telescope {{was replaced by a}} 360mm <b>refractor</b> with a focal length of 4.9 m and a 200mm photographic lens with a focal length of 4.8 m. The purchase of the double <b>refractor</b> enabled the observatory to participate in photographic observations without having to give up visual observations. This double <b>refractor</b> is still found in the dome of the Østervold Observatory, while the 1861 <b>refractor</b> is displayed at the Steno Museum in Århus.|$|R

2500|$|In 1636 Marin Mersenne {{proposed}} a telescope {{consisting of a}} paraboloidal primary mirror and a paraboloidal secondary mirror bouncing the image {{through a hole in}} the primary, solving the problem of viewing the image. James Gregory went into further detail in his book Optica Promota (1663), pointing out that a reflecting telescope with a mirror that was shaped like the part of a conic section, would correct spherical aberration as well as the chromatic aberration seen in <b>refractors.</b> The design he came up with bears his name: the [...] "Gregorian telescope"; but according to his own confession, Gregory had no practical skill and he could find no optician capable of realizing his ideas and after some fruitless attempts, was obliged to abandon all hope of bringing his telescope into practical use.|$|E
2500|$|Mega Man Legends 2 {{brings back}} several {{characters}} from its predecessor. This includes the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt (whose original name is Mega Man Trigger), a Digger {{in charge of}} exploring ruins to find <b>Refractors,</b> Roll Caskett, his spotter, who is searching for her missing parents, and Data, a mechanical monkey who contains all of Mega Man's original memories. Roll's grandfather, Barrel Caskett, also appears alongside his old friend Werner Von Bluecher {{in search of the}} Mother Lode, a legendary treasure supposed to have infinite energy. The pirates [...] "the Bonnes", made up of siblings Teisel, Tron, and Bon, return once again as antagonists of the series but allied with three new members: a blonde-haired man named Glyde previously seen in The Misadventures of Tron Bonne who uses Birdbots as servants, and Bola and Klaymoor, a floating samurai and an enormous man wearing armor, respectively. Other characters include Yuna and Sera, whose purposes remain unknown during the game's start, as well as the Master: a 3000-year-old man who {{is referred to as the}} last [...] "true" [...] human.|$|E
2500|$|The puzzles {{require the}} player to collect tetromino-shaped [...] "sigils" [...] by {{navigating}} mazes and overcoming obstacles within them. These include computer-controlled drones that will detonate {{if they are}} {{too close to the}} player and kill them, and wall-mounted turrets that will shoot down the player if they get close; if the player dies this way, they are reset {{to the start of the}} specific puzzle. Drones and turrets can be disabled using portable jammer units, which can also disable force-field walls that block the player's path. As the player collects sigils and completes more puzzles, new puzzle elements become available. Portable crystalline <b>refractors</b> allow the player to activate light-based switches. Boxes let the player climb to higher levels or to block the path of drones, among other factors, and large fans that can launch the player or other objects across the puzzle. Later, the player gains access to a device that can create a time recording of their actions, such that they can then interact with this recording to complete tasks, such as having the clone stand atop a switch to keep it activated for some time.|$|E
50|$|The University {{purchased}} the observatory's <b>refractor</b> telescope in 1863. The telescope is named the Yeatman <b>refractor,</b> after philanthropist James Yeatman who donated US$1,500 for its construction. The Yeatman <b>Refractor</b> has an aperture of 6 inches, with lenses made by Henry Fitz & Co. The transit {{was made in}} 1882, and the clock was made in 1885.|$|R
50|$|The {{telescope}} {{was made by}} Alvan Clark & Sons of Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, who were regarded as the finest telescope makers of the age. At {{the time it was}} the equal largest telescope in the United States, and the second largest <b>refractor</b> in the world when completed. It was nearly a twin of the earlier 26-inch <b>refractor</b> at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington. However, the Clarks made some adjustments to the lens to improve the image quality over that of the Naval Observatory <b>refractor.</b> In 1877 while the McCormick <b>Refractor</b> was still in Cambridgeport, Alvan Clark used it to verify the discovery of the moons of Mars the night after the discovery observations were made by Asaph Hall with the Naval Observatory <b>refractor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some <b>Refractor</b> {{variants}} {{were tested}} {{and found to}} be not popular and therefore discontinued. One {{example of this is}} the Pigskin <b>Refractor</b> which appeared in the 2009 Topps Finest Football release.|$|R
2500|$|Through {{his career}} T. W. Webb {{served as a}} clergyman at various places {{including}} Gloucester, and finally in 1852 {{was assigned to the}} parish of Hardwicke near the border with Wales. [...] In addition to serving faithfully the members of his parish, T. W. Webb pursued astronomical observation in his spare time. [...] On the grounds of the vicarage or parsonage he built a small canvas and wood observatory that was home to instruments including a small 3.7" [...] (94mm) refractor. Webb acquired progressively larger <b>refractors</b> and reflectors with which the observations in the guide were made. The largest telescope was a 9-1/3" [...] (225mm) silver on glass reflector used from 1866 until his last observation in March 1885. [...] It was at Hardwick that he wrote his classic astronomical observing guide Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes (2 vols) in 1859 for which he is best known today. [...] This two volume work was written as a guide for the amateur astronomer, containing instructions on the use of a telescope as well as detailed descriptions of what could be observed with it. This work became the standard observing guide of amateur astronomers worldwide, and remained so until well into the 20th Century, gradually supplanted by more modern guides such as Burnham's Celestial Handbook.|$|E
