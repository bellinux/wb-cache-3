50|$|In {{planning}} for atmospheric re-entry, the landing site is selected in advance. For reusable reentry vehicles, typically a primary site is preferred that {{is closest to}} the launch site {{in order to reduce}} costs and improve launch turnaround time. However, weather near the landing site is a major factor in flight safety. In some seasons, weather at landing sites can change quickly relative to the time necessary to initiate and execute re-entry and safe landing. Due to weather, it is possible the vehicle may have to execute a landing at an alternate site. Furthermore, most airports do not have runways of sufficient length to support the approach landing speed and <b>roll</b> <b>distance</b> required by spacecraft. Few airports exist in the world that can support or be modified to support this type of requirement.

40|$|Golfers are {{demanding}} increased ball roll distances {{on a daily}} basis, but cultural practices to achieve this often are detrimental to the green. One option for increasing ball <b>roll</b> <b>distance</b> without altering cultural practices may be to select creeping bentgrass genotypes that provide less resistance to ball roll. Studies were conducted at the John Seaton Anderson Turfgrass and Ornamental Research Facility near Ithaca, Neb., and at the Rocky Ford Turfgrass Research Facility in Manhattan, Kans., to determine genotype and seasonal influences on golf ball <b>roll</b> <b>distance.</b> Eighteen creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris Huds.) genotypes were evaluated. Genotype {{was not a significant}} source of variability, but the location × season interaction was. Significant seasonal differences in ball roll occurred at both locations. Ball roll distances for spring, summer, and fall were 98, 15, and 31 cm greater at the Nebraska test location than at the Kansas site. Correlations between turfgrass visual quality and ball <b>roll</b> <b>distance</b> were not significant. Therefore, the use of genotypes exhibiting high turfgrass visual quality will not necessarily result in longer ball rolls. Since there were no season × genotype or genotype x location interactions, ball <b>roll</b> <b>distance</b> on genotypes at each location changed similarly with season. Genotype selection appears to have little influence on ball <b>roll</b> <b>distance</b> under the conditions tested at these two locations...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} flight tests was {{conducted}} to evaluate the reduction of takeoff ground <b>roll</b> <b>distance</b> obtainable from a rapid extension of the nose gear strut. The NASA Quiet Short-haul Research Aircraft (QSRA) used for this investigation is a transport-size short takeoff and landing (STOL) research vehicle with a slightly swept wing that employs the upper surface blowing (USB) concept to attain the high lift levels required for its low speed, short-field performance. Minor modifications to the conventional nose gear assembly {{and the addition of}} a high pressure pneumatic system and a control system provided the extendible nose gear, or 'jump strut,' capability. The limited flight test program explored the effects of thrust-to-weight ratio, storage tank initial pressure, and control valve open time duration on the ground <b>roll</b> <b>distance.</b> The data show that the predicted reduction of takeoff ground roll on the order of 10 percent was achieved {{with the use of the}} jump strut.

40|$|Poly (ethylene terephthalate) was {{modified}} by a KrF excimer laser 248 nm. It was {{observed that the}} PET surface developed a very often periodic roughness or ripple. The roughness size is in the micron range and the surface shows some sign of global melting. Irradiated samples were imaged and studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). AFM was used to follow the morphological changes caused by subsequent laser pulses on the very same area of the irradiated PET samples. AFM also provided quantitative data on the laser induced surface and allowed three-dimensional imaging of non-conducting surfaces. Changes in surface morphology of PET fibres were found in relation to laser energy applied. The mean roll to <b>roll</b> <b>distance</b> increased with increasing laser energy. Merging of ripples was observed and {{believed to be a}} major reason of increased roll to <b>roll</b> <b>distance.</b> With approximately 50 to 200 pulses, ripple almost approached parallelism.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} aircraft takeoff performance from brake release to air-phase height that requires fewer tests than conventionally required {{is evaluated with}} data for the XB- 70 airplane. The method defines the effects of pilot technique on takeoff performance quantitatively, including the decrease in acceleration from drag due to lift. For a given takeoff weight and throttle setting, a single takeoff provides enough data to establish a standardizing relationship for the distance from brake release to any point where velocity is appropriate to rotation. The lower rotation rates penalized takeoff performance in terms of ground roll distance; the lowest observed rotation rate required a ground <b>roll</b> <b>distance</b> that was 19 percent longer than the highest.

40|$|For centuries, oil {{derivatives}} {{have been applied}} to plants for pest control. The novel horticultural oil called Civitas(TM) has been developed {{for use in the}} turfgrass industry. Incorporation of Civitas with low rates of fungicides provides excellent disease control reduced environmental impact. Civitas, like other horticultural spray oils, can be phytotoxic. Chlorosis, membrane disruption, and reduced photosynthesis, transpiration, and growth can result from horticultural oil phytotoxicity. Chlorosis is masked with a green pigment added to Civitas. Unsubstantiated claims by turfgrass managers suggest Civitas increases clipping yield, reduces ball roll, can cause stand decline. The primarily goals of this work were to understand how Civitas affects turfgrass in the field and then understand how physiology is affected in the growth chamber. The objectives of this dissertation were to document how Civitas affects turfgrass growth, performance, and quality in the field, investigate factors known to induce spray oil phytotoxicity, measure turfgrass transpiration and photosynthesis, and finally monitor turfgrass carbon partitioning and nonstructural carbohydrate status. Putting green clipping yield increased and golf ball <b>roll</b> <b>distance</b> declined for 10 days after application of Civitas. Ball roll was not correlated with clipping yield which indicates some other factor besides increased leaf elongation affected ball <b>roll</b> <b>distance.</b> Civitas application to a mixed annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera Hud.) putting surface caused chlorosis, which was masked with the green pigment, and decline in stand density. Civitas also increased turfgrass canopy temperature 0 to 2 °C depending on solar intensity. The phytotoxicity induced by Civitas is consistent with chronic phytotoxicity described in the literature. While Civitas did not directly damage or alter the cuticle quantity or composition, oil deposition on the leaf reduced gas exchange. The decline in gas exchange reduced transpiration rate and radiation use efficiency (RUE) for several days after application. The decline in RUE was particularly dramatic at higher photosynthetic photon flux densities. Carboxylation efficiency was more sensitive to Civitas than transpiration, most likely due to a reduction in Rubisco activity. Increased clipping yield and reduced RUE reduced the content of storage carbohydrates, starch and fructans...|$|E
