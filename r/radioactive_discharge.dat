40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn {{a recent}} {{ecological}} study among residents living around Belgian nuclear sites (the NUCABEL study), significant increased incidences of thyroid cancer were observed around the two nuclear facilities with industrial and research activities (Mol-Dessel and Fleurus), prompting further research. MethodsThe {{data from the}} NUCABEL study were reanalysed {{to test the hypothesis}} of a gradient in cancer incidence with increasing levels of exposure from these sites using three measures of surrogate exposure, being (i) residential proximity, (ii) prevailing wind directions and (iii) simulated dispersion of radioactive discharges. Single-site focussed hypothesis tests were complemented with Generalized Additive Models to estimate the exposure-response relationships. ResultsFor Mol-Dessel, the results of the focussed hypothesis tests were far from significant. For Fleurus, the p-values were much closer to significance with p= 0. 05 for Bithell's Linear Risk Score using <b>radioactive</b> <b>discharge</b> estimates as surrogate. ConclusionsThe re-analyses refute an association with the nuclear facilities for the site of Mol-Dessel. For the site of Fleurus, one of Europe's major production sites of radio-iodines, the results were less conclusive and further research suggests itself...|$|E

40|$|The Yenisei River, one of {{the largest}} rivers in the world, is {{contaminated}} with artificial radionu-clides released by a Russian nuclear facility producing weapon-grade plutonium, which has been in operation for many years. Examination of Yenisei River sediment samples revealed the pres-ence of artificial radionuclides typical of <b>radioactive</b> <b>discharge</b> from the Mining-and-Chemical-Combine (MCC) nuclear facility: isotopes of europium (152 Eu, 154 Eu, and 155 Eu), cesium (137 Cs and 134 Cs), 60 Co, 90 Sr, and transuranium elements. The MCC is also a source of radioactive particles in the Yenisei. New data on radionuclide concentrations in sediments and radioactive particles in the Yenisei River were obtained using a wide range of analytical methods. Sequential extraction per-formed on samples of sediment cores showed different degrees of potential environmental avail-ability of artificial radionuclides and uranium. In a few samples, 241 Am was present in the unex-tractable form, which may be accounted for by the presence of microparticles of the reactor fuel. These microparticles were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, and their reactor origin was confirmed...|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{was made of}} the obstetric outcome of 18, 252 babies born in West Cumberland Hospital in the years 1975 to 1985. There were 934 premature births (before 37 weeks), 555 small for dates births (under 2. 5 kg but not before 37 weeks), 167 stillbirths, 125 neonatal deaths and 236 reported congenital malformations. The 212 babies born to mothers from Seascale during that time were compared with the births to mothers from other areas in West Cumbria Health District in order to assess any adverse effect from possible <b>radioactive</b> <b>discharge</b> at nearby Sellafield. There was no evidence of any increased incidence of these outcomes in Seascale births. Adequate retrospective data on miscarriage rates were not available, but using indirect information on hospital inpatients, no statistically significant increased incidence was found, although the absolute numbers of miscarriage in Seascale were slightly higher than expected. From this evidence, no adverse effects on completed pregnancies {{can be attributed to the}} Sellafield plant of British Nuclear Fuels.

40|$|In 2011, a large <b>radioactive</b> <b>discharge</b> {{occurred}} at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. This plant is located within a climatically temperate region where outdoor swimming pools are popular. Although it {{is relatively easy to}} decontaminate pools by refilling them with fresh water, it is difficult to maintain safe conditions given highly contaminated diurnal dust falls from the surrounding contaminated ground. Our objectives in this paper were to conduct daily radioactivity measurements, to determine the quantity of radioactive contaminants from the surrounding environment that invade outdoor pools, and to investigate the efficacy of traditional pool cleaners in removing radioactive contaminants. The depositions in the paper filterable particulates ranged from 0 to 62, 5 Bq/m 2 /day, with the highest levels found in the southern Tohoku District containing Fukushima Prefecture and in the Kanto District containing Tokyo Metro. They were approximately correlated with the ground contamination. Traditional pool cleaners eliminated 99 % of contaminants {{at the bottom of the}} pool, reducing the concentration to 41 Bq/m 2 after cleaning. Authors recommended the deposition or the blown radionuclides into outdoor swimming pools must be considered into pool regulations when the environments exactly polluted with radionuclides...|$|E
