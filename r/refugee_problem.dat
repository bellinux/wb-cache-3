Although board members were uncertain whether Nea Salamina should play (due to the <b>refugee</b> <b>problem),</b> they decided to participate so the team could remain in the Cypriot First Division and stay alive. Since there was no permanent stadium, the team used GSZ Stadium in 1974–75, the Deryneia municipal stadium in 1975–76, the GSZ Stadium again in 1976–77, Dasaki Stadium in Dasaki Achnas in 1977–78 and GSZ Stadium from 1978 to 1980.|$|E

He was one of the signatories of an open letter, published in The Guardian, criticising the government for its actions regarding the <b>refugee</b> <b>problem.</b> He also gave nightly speeches after his curtain call as Hamlet at the Barbican in London, asking for donations to help Syrian refugees. At the end of the run, the audience contributed more than £150,000 for Save the Children.|$|E

5|$|President Sadat {{believed}} that Egypt's economic, political, social and military problems were {{a result of}} the Six Day War. He believed the solution to these problems lay with erasing the humiliation of the 1967 defeat, which required regaining the Sinai. In 1971 Sadat began the coordinated political and military groundwork to achieve this. In February, he proposed a phased Israel withdrawal from the Sinai, which would involve a reopening of the Suez Canal, and Israeli fulfillment of the UNSCR 242, including resolving the Palestinian <b>refugee</b> <b>problem.</b> In return Egypt would sign a peace treaty with Israel and reestablish relations with the United States. However Israeli insistence on retention of territory necessary for its security ended diplomatic efforts.|$|E
5|$|The first Vietnamese {{refugee camp}} was opened in Pulau Bidong in August 1978 with United Nations assistance; the island {{accommodated}} up to 25,000 refugees. Other refugee camps {{were set up}} at Pulau Tengah, Pulau Besar, Kota Bharu, Kuantan, Sarawak and Sabah. In 1982, a transit centre was established at Sungei Besi, where refugees awaiting deportation to Western countries that were willing to accept them would be housed. The number of Vietnamese refugee arrivals fluctuated between 1981 and 1983, before a period of significant decrease from 1984 to 1986. In 1987, Malaysia and other neighbouring countries saw a sudden {{increase in the number}} of Vietnamese refugees landing in Malaysia. At an ASEAN summit in June 1987, member countries chastised the Vietnamese government for not having sufficiently addressed the <b>refugee</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E

25|$|All of Upper Bavaria, {{like most}} of the rest of Bavaria, became part of the US {{occupation}} zone. Only the Pfalz, geographically separated from the rest of the state, became part of the French occupation zone. Political power, at first lying with the occupation authorities, was soon returned to the new Bavarian government. The Regierungsbezirk Swabia, never having formally been dissolved, took control of the civil administration of the region again. Its most pressing issue was the reconstruction of the destroyed cities and the <b>refugee</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following the {{emergence}} of the Palestinian <b>refugee</b> <b>problem</b> after the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, many Palestinians tried, in one way or another, to return to their homes. For some time these practices continued to embarrass the Israeli authorities until they passed the Prevention of Infiltration Law, which defines offenses of armed and non-armed infiltration to Israel and from Israel to hostile neighboring countries. According to Arab Israeli writer Sabri Jiryis, the purpose of the law was to prevent Palestinians from returning to Israel, those who did so being regarded as infiltrators.|$|E

25|$|The about 711,000 Palestinians {{who fled}} or were {{expelled}} from the areas that became Israel {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, and took up residence in refugee camps in surrounding countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and the area that was later {{to be known as the}} Gaza Strip; they were usually not allowed to leave refugee camps and mix with the local Arab society either, leaving the Palestinian <b>refugee</b> <b>problem</b> unsolved even today. Around 400 Arab towns and villages were depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East was established to alleviate their condition.|$|E

40|$|Afghanistan is {{a country}} that {{produces}} the world's largest single group of refugee emergencies in the world. The causes of refugee flows in Afghanistan are believed to be due to domestic as well as external factors. Domestic factors like local government and different ideologies and external factors such as foreign dominations, have caused conflicts which later led to the flow of refugees in Afghanistan. However, external factors such as foreign domination, have triggered higher flow of refugees in the country. Due to this complexity, the <b>refugee</b> <b>problems</b> still exist. Thus, an understanding on the causes of refugee flow is crucial because the <b>refugee</b> <b>problems</b> need to be tackled from the roots and subsequently this can minimize the problems. Afghanistan is the focal analysis because it produces the largest single group of refugees in the world. The statistics of refugees from Afghanistan are gathered from various sources but mainly from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The statistics are presented from the 1970 s until 2003. A general background of refugee numbers from Afghanistan is presented...|$|R
