They follow Illich-Svitych's correspondences in which Nostratic voiceless stops give (traditional) PIE voiced ones, and Nostratic glottalized stops give (traditional) PIE voiceless stops, in contradiction with the PIE glottalic theory, which makes traditional PIE voiced stops appeared like glottalized ones. To correct this anomaly, linguists such as Manaster <b>Ramer</b> and Bomhard have proposed to correlate Nostratic voiceless and glottalized stops with PIE ones, {{so this is}} done in the table.|$|E

2500|$|Markham {{was first}} {{surveyed}} as a township in 1793 by William Berczy, who in 1794 led 75 German families including the <b>Ramers,</b> Reesors, Wheters, Burkholders, Bunkers, Wicks and Lewis from Upstate New York {{to an area}} of Markham now known as German Mills. Each family was granted [...] of land; however the lack of roads in the region led many to settle in York (now Toronto) and Niagara. German Mills later became a ghost town. Between 1803 and 1812, another attempt at settling the region was made. The largest group of settlers were Pennsylvania Dutch, {{most of whom were}} Mennonites. These highly skilled craftsmen and knowledgeable farmers settled the region and founded Reesorville, named after the Mennonite settler Joseph Reesor. In 1825, Reesorville was renamed to Markham having taken the name of the unincorporated village (see Markham Village, Ontario).|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of certain factors on the impedance signal in structural health monitoring. These factors were: the quality of the bond between the sensor and the host structure, and the characteristics of the host structure, such as geometry, mass, and material properties. This work was carried out to answer a set of questions, related to these factors, that were developed by the project team. The project team was comprised of Dr. Doug <b>Ramers</b> and Dr. Abdul Jalloh of the Summer Faculty Fellowship Program, Mr. Arnaldo Colon- Perez, a student intern from the University of Puerto Rico of Turabo, and Mr. John Lassiter and Mr. Bob Engberg of the Structural and Dynamics Test Group at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). This study was based on {{a review of the literature}} on structural health monitoring to investigate the factors referred to above because there was not enough time to plan and conduct the appropriate tests at MSFC during the tenure of the Summer Faculty Fellowship Program project members. The surveyed literature documents works on structural health monitoring that were based on laboratory tests that were conducted using bolted trusses and other civil engineering type structures for the most part. These are not the typical types of structures used in designing and building NASA s space vehicles and systems. It was therefore recommended that tests be conducted using NASA type structures, such as pressure vessels, to validate the observations made in this report...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to try to}} {{interpret}} the results of some tests that were performed earlier this year and to demonstrate a possible use of emergence in computing to solve IVHM problems. The test data used was collected with piezoelectric sensors to detect mechanical changes in structures. This project team was included of Dr. Doug <b>Ramers</b> and Dr. Abdul Jallob of the Summer Faculty Fellowship Program, Arnaldo Colon-Lopez - a student intern from the University of Puerto Rico of Turabo, and John Lassister and Bob Engberg of the Structural and Dynamics Test Group. The tests were performed by Bob Engberg to compare the performance two types of piezoelectric (piezo) sensors, Pb(Zr(sub 1 - 1) Ti(sub x)) O 3, which we will label PZT, and Pb(Zn(sub 1 / 3) Nb(sub 2 / 3)) O 3 -PbTiO, which we will label SCP. The tests were conducted under varying temperature and pressure conditions. One set of tests was done by varying water pressure inside an aluminum liner covered with carbon-fiber composite layers (a cylindrical "bottle" with domed ends) and the other by varying temperatures down to cryogenic levels on some specially prepared composite panels. This report discusses the data from the pressure study. The study of the temperature results was not completed in time for this report. The particular sensing done with these piezo sensors is accomplished by the sensor generating an controlled vibration that is transmitted into the structure to which the sensor is attached, and the same sensor then responding to the induced vibration of the structure. There is a relationship between the mechanical impedance of the structure and the resulting electrical impedance produced in the in the piezo sensor. The impedance is also a function of the excitation frequency. Changes in the real part of impendance signature relative to an original reference signature indicate a change in the coupled structure that could be the results of damage or strain. The water pressure tests were conducted by pressurizing the bottle on a test stand, and running sweeps of excitations frequencies for each of the piezo sensors and recording the resulting impedance. The sweeps were limited to 401 points by the available analyzer, and it was decided to perform individual sweeps at five different excitation frequency ranges. The frequency ranges used for the PZTs were different in two of the five ranges from the ranges used for the SCP. The bottles were pressurized to empty (no water), 0 psig, 77 psig, 155 psig, 227 psig in nearly uniform increments of about 77 psi. One of each of the two types of piezo sensors was fastened on to the bottle surface at two locations: about midway between the ends on cylindrical portion of the bottle and at the very edge of one of the end domes. The data was collected in files by sensor type (2 cases), by location (2 cases), by frequency range (5 cases), and pressure (5 cases) to produce 100 data sets of 401 impedances. After familiarization with the piezo sensing technology and obtaining the data, the team developed a set of questions to try to answer regarding the data and made assignments of responsibilities. The next section lists the questions, and the remainder of the report describes the data analysis work performed by Dr. <b>Ramers.</b> This includes a discussion of the data, the approach to answering the question using statistical techniques, the use of an emergent system to investigate the data where statistical techniques were not usable, conclusions regarding the data, and recommendations...|$|R
40|$|A large {{diversity}} of tetrapods - amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds - populate this planet today, {{all of which}} share a common ancestor. Tetrapods show an exponential pattern of growth, punctuated by losses during major extinctions over the last 400 million years. Detailed study of three major evolutionary events and a macroscopic analysis to identify broad patterns helps us understand how vertebrates have evolved. expanded and diversified on land. After the evolution of tetrapods in the Devonian, a sparse record {{is present in the}} early Carboniferous, punctuated by a hiatus termed <b>Ramer's</b> Gap. Growing tetrapod diversity was impacted in the Late Pennsylvanian by the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse of Euramerica. Changes in taxa, communities, and tTophic structure indicate that amphibian diversity stagnated in the drier climate while reptiles invaded empty habitats, explored new feeding strategies, and created endemic faunas. Reptiles continued to flourish until the Permian-Triassic Boundary extinction. Ecosystems were destroyed by a multi-pulse event, communities were restructured and though taxa recovered quickly, full ecological recovery occurred in the Late Triassic. Patterns of mass extinction and recovery have reoccurred throughout tetrapod history: large c 1 ades were wiped out, disaster taxa become widespread, animals possessing unique and advantageous adaptations thrived, and communities took many millions of years to recover. A macroevolutionary analysis supports the Court Jester model of diversification where external, abiotic elements have had a broader influence than the intrinsic, biotic factors of the Red Queen model. Tetrapod taxonomic and ecological diversity are strongly linked, having been driven at an increasing rate by the different tetrapod classes. The Court Jester is supported by the unrestricted taxonomic and ecological expansion of tetrapods, the ability of taxa to invade empty ecospace and rare catastrophic events which have devastated life.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Salmonberry {{community}} {{structure was}} examined in alder-dominated riparian buffer strips in the Oregon Coast Range. Salmonberry growing on slopes {{was found to}} respond differently, to both characteristics of the buffer strips and to environmental factors, than salmonberry growing on terraces. Salmonberry, as measured by total height, number of ramets or sprouting centers, cover, and estimated biomass, was found to increase with increasing light on the slopes. Salmonberry cover, height and number of <b>ramers</b> were all found to be greater on slopes within buffer strips, than on slopes in undisturbed riparian stands, where the adjacent stand had not been cut and no buffer created. The greater dominance of salmonberry within buffer strips was attributed to increased sidelight into the riparian area, due to the hest of the adjacent stand. None of the four salmonberry characteristics {{were found to be}} related to light on the terraces. Salmonberry height, cover, number of ramets, and biomass on terraces did, however, all increase with increasing age of the buffer strip. There {{did not appear to be}} any clear edge effect on salmonberry within the buffer strips. An index of herbaceous vegetation was developed, through ordination, to examine the effects of unquantified environmental factors on salmonberry. Disturbance appeared to play a role in the variation seen in the salmonberry population. Salmonberry's aerial stem diameter distribution, both within buffer strips and in undisturbed stands, resembled an uneven-aged distribution. Sairnonberry stem distribution followed the same pattern whether on slopes or terraces. This suggests persistent, self-replacing salmonberry stands in these alder-dominated riparian communities. Salmonberry was found to be negatively correlated with herb, vine maple, and swordfern cover, and also with herbaceous species abundance. There was no relationship between salmonberry and elderberry cover. Tree regeneration was found to be extremely sparse. Only one alder seedling per hectare was found in the undisturbed riparian stands. There were 29 seedlings per hectare found within the buffer strips, 22 of which were conifers. The four salmonberry community variables increased in response to buffer strip creation when growing on both slopes and terraces. Salmonberry was shown to have a self-replacing canopy, and to dominate other shrubs and herbs in the riparian community. These factors, along with the lack of tree regeneration in these alder-dominated riparian areas, all suggest that without silvicultural intervention salmonberry could eventually dominate the riparian community...|$|R
