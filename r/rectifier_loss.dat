40|$|This work {{is focused}} on direct-driven {{permanent}} magnets synchronous generators (PMSG) with diode rectifiers for use in offshore wind turbines. Reactive compensation of the generator, power losses {{and control of the}} generator are studied. Configurations for power transmission to onshore point of common connection are also considered. Costs, power losses, reliability and interface with the PMSG are discussed. The purpose of the laboratory tests and simulations are to learn how a PMSG with diode rectifier behaves. A 55 kW PMSG is tested in "Vindlabben", with and without reactive compensation. The generator current and generator voltage are measured and the total harmonic distribution (THD) of the current and the voltage are calculated. The results are compared to simulations on an equal generator in PSCAD/EMTDC. A 2 MW PMSG is also simulated to compare parallel and series compensation and to find how the generator efficiency varies with the wind speed. The generator is also simulated with constant DC-link voltage and varying local wind to find how much the turbine and generator efficiency decreases when a Cluster step-up configuration is used. The DC-link voltage is in this case equal for parts of the wind farm or the whole wind farms. A 3 MW ironless PMSG with very low synchronous reactance is simulated to find how this generator behaves with a diode rectifier. The laboratory tests and PSCAD simulations show that the maximal generator power increases when reactive compensation of the generator is used. The measured and simulated generator voltage and current shapes are found to be approximately equal. Series compensated PMSGs have lower generator current rms and lower current THD than parallel compensated PMSGs when the synchronous reactance is large. Therefore, the generator losses are 2 - 15 % lower and the diode <b>rectifier</b> <b>losses</b> are 0 - 1 % lower, depending on the wind speed. The diode <b>rectifier</b> <b>losses</b> are lower than 1 %. The losses can be reduced even more if the diodes are connected in parallel. If a Cluster step-up configuration is used, the turbine efficiency is reduced by 3 - 4 %. %The generator efficiency is more or less the same. The ironless PMSG has a low synchronous reactance and reactive compensation is not needed because the reactive power produced by the generator is low. Parallel connected capacitors have no positive effect and series connected capacitances must be very large and can therefore not be used. The generator current THD is very large when no reactive compensation is used. However, the current THD can be reduced by connecting an inductance to the DC-link. Cluster step-up, two-step DC/DC system, turbine step-up and series connected wind turbine are the most relevant layouts of the wind farms transmission system discussed in this thesis. The cluster step-up system has low power losses since only one large DC/DC converter is used. Also, the power equipment in the turbine is very reliable. However, the turbine efficiency is reduced since the generator torque and generator speed could not be controlled for one specific turbine. The other transmission systems require DC/DC converters in the turbines and they are therefore probably not as reliable. The total cost is crucial for the chose of the transmission system. Further cost accountings for the different DC systems are needed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Good {{understanding}} of power loss {{in a high}} frequency synchronous buck converter is important for design optimization of both power MOSFET and circuit itself. Most of the MOSFET power losses are relatively easy to quantify. The exception is the power loss associated with Cdv/dt induced turn on of the low-side MOSFET (synchronous rectifier). This paper characterizes the Cdv/dt induced power loss in two ways. First, detailed device characterization, in-circuit testing, and modeling are used for a comparative loss calculation. This method requires specialized test equipment and is rather complicated and time consuming. A simple method is then introduced to very accurately quantify the Cdv/dt loss. With this method, the impacts of the Cdv/dt power loss on synchronous buck converters at different operation conditions can be readily assessed. The impacts of Cdv/dt induced turn on different applications are addressed. Index Terms — Synchronous <b>rectifier,</b> switching <b>loss.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|A {{complete}} laboratory breadboard {{version of}} a ion engine power converter was built and tested. This prototype operated on a line voltage of 80 - 120 Vdc, and provided output ratings of 1100 V at 1. 8 kW, and 250 V at 20 mA. The high-voltage (HV) output voltage rating was revised from the original value of 1350 V {{at the beginning of}} the project. The LV output was designed to hold up during a 1 -A surge current lasting up to 1 second. The prototype power converter included a internal housekeeping power supply which also operated from the line input. The power consumed in housekeeping was included in the overall energy budget presented for the ion engine converter. HV and LV output voltage setpoints were commanded through potentiometers. The HV converter itself reached its highest power efficiency of slightly over 93 % at low line and maximum output. This would dip below 90 % at high line. The no-load (rated output voltages, zero load current) power consumption of the entire system was less than 13 W. A careful loss breakdown shows that converter losses are predominately Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) conduction <b>losses</b> and HV <b>rectifier</b> snubbing <b>losses,</b> with the <b>rectifier</b> snubbing <b>losses</b> becoming predominant at high line. This suggests that further improvements in power efficiency could best be obtained by either developing a rectifier that was adequately protected against voltage overshoot with less snubbing, or by developing a pre-regulator to reduced the range of line voltage on the converter. The transient testing showed the converter to be fully protected against load faults, including a direct short-circuit from the HV output to the LV output terminals. Two currents sensors were used: one to directly detect any core ratcheting on the output transformer and re-initiate a soft start, and the other to directly detect a load fault and quickly shut down the converter for load protection. The finished converter has been extensively fault tested without failure. The finished converter has been packaged suitable for use as a laboratory prototype for further testing. The finished converter is readily transportable. An article on design issues for high voltage converters for ion engines is included as an attachement...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is the {{analysis}} and design of a DC/DC converter for aircraft applications. This converter {{is part of the}} output of an isolated rectifier unit for the distribution of electric power inside the airplane. This work is part of the research effort done by the Center of Industrial Electronics in Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (CEI-UPM), in the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) topic. The system works as a rectifier of the current obtained at the turbines, the generator of the plane. A three-phased current flows to a device for eliminating the electronic interference (EMI). Then, a buck rectifier reduces the current, and finally a DC/DC converter adjusts its input voltage to the voltage at the load. The objective of this project is designing an efficient and lightweight DC/DC converter in order to reduce fuel consumption on the plane. Its input voltage come from the rectifier. Output voltage is 28 V as it is nowadays integrated in most planes. It is formed by active elements (switches and control) and by passive elements (transformer and bridge). The topology chosen is full-bridge as isolation is needed and transformer is simpler than in half-bridges. Inside full-bridge, there are different possibilities: phase shifted, dual active bridge, resonant dual active bridge and triangular full bridge. The Triangular Full-Bridge is the chosen topology because the soft switches on both bridges at the primary and the secondary, and it only needs one magnetizing component, which gives the leakage needed for obtaining the triangular wave form. Due to the high ripple on this current, high capacitance is needed at the output. This capacitance can cover a big volume, being a disadvantage for this topology. It is mandatory to avoid Continuous Current Mode (CCM) and always operate with Discontinuous Current Mode (DCM), as behavior control of the converter changes and less hard-switchings are required. ZCS is achieved on most switches and less losses and noise on output are produced. Anyway, there are some disadvantages that must be considered: • High number of transistors: The main disadvantage of a full-bridge topology is that it needs minimum eight transistors. Because of this the total voltage drop in transistors duplicates of that in case of center-tap rectifiers, if both sides of the transformer are connected as <b>rectifiers.</b> <b>Losses</b> are increased and conversion efficiency is somewhat reduced. • High RMS currents: The RMS current is the equivalent steady DC value which gives the same effect and therefore the same losses on transformer and transistors, as they have internal resistances. Another disadvantage of high RMS current is high ripple, that leads to high capacitance on the output. With interleaving ripples can be compensated and capacitance can be smaller. There are three different states per cycle on current waveform. The Dead state allows to have ZCS. Different types of power semiconductor switches are designed for functioning in diverse conditions. Voltage, current and switching frequency of the application are the parameters that need to be considered for electing the right switch. Increasing frequency allows the transformer to be smaller. As converter’s layout depends {{on the size of the}} transformer and specifications establish that it is needed a high power density. Therefore, a high frequency is obligatory. MOSFET is the technology that best fits these exigencies. Some IGBTs are also good solutions. There are different kinds of MOSFETs depending on their material: Silicon MOSFETs are the traditionally used; Silicon Carbide MOSFETs are good for preforming with high voltages and high power, Gallium Nitride MOSFETs are excellent for high frequencies. Interleaving consists in producing a multiphase current thanks to various converters connected in parallel. There are as many phases as converters. The main advantage is that every converter handles less power so current peaks are lower. In this application, interleaving helps to take advantage of the leakage inductance of the transformer. With a single converter, for most turn ratios it is mandatory to add another external inductance to the circuit. This is a big disadvantage as it would force to operate with specifications that would not produce the less losses possible, or to place an external inductance that would drop power density. In order to evaluate the efficiency of this converter, a proper calculation of losses in the devices as well as in the transformer is required. As it was explained before, the design and optimization of the transformer is out of the aim of this work so it will not be calculated. However, the optimized design is going to take into account some of the restrictions on the transformer design and the integration of the magnetizing components needed to achieve a good power density. The parameters regarded for the design space are: • Frequency • Inductance • Turns ratio of the transformer. • Number of devices in parallel (Primary and secondary) • Diodes or MOSFET in secondary • Number of Parallel converters • Stability • Maximum current on devices Primary bridge MOSFETs operate with 400 V, therefore the best materials are Silicon and Silicon Carbide. It is possible to discriminate two types of MOSFET side: - High side has switching, conduction and reverse recovery losses. Consequently, the number of MOSFET in parallel per side and the MOSFET employed are determined by the configuration that reaches the lower losses. - Low side only has conduction losses. For that reason, the MOSFET chosen is the one with less RDS at temperature of operation. Also a high number of MOSFET per side is desired. Secondary bridge performs with 28 V, for that reason GaN MOSFETs and diodes can be taken into account as alternatives to Silicon and Silicon Carbide MOSFETs. Secondary side mainly has conduction losses. Therefore, the same configuration selection as in low MOSFETs in primary is applicable. An important fact to take into account is that devices have to be able to endure the current that flows through them without breaking. With low frequencies, the time demanded for reaching the current peak that delivers on output the correct power is bigger than in high frequencies. Consequently, slope is smaller and inductance bigger in low frequencies than in high frequencies. But with more converters, different turn ratios produce different waveforms at the output, and consequently ripple changes as well. Ripple drops and capacitance thus is not forced to be that big. Its size changes with turn ratio as well. However, there are some turn ratios where adding more converters ripple increases. Losses in transformer are reduced by ZVS. But, in order to achieve zero voltage, some magnetizing current is required. As a consequence, on dead state there is no zero current and ZCS on MOSFETs is not achieved. Therefore, switching losses increase in configurations where high magnetizing current is needed. It is not possible to determine which is the best solution. Future research lines on the transformer will allow to choose the configuration with lower volume, weight and losses...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a part of a larger project that deals with the design of an {{offshore}} DC wind turbine system. The aim of this thesis is to design and evaluate the Vienna rectifier for a 5 MW wind turbine system (WTS) with a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). In order to estimate the efficiency and the maximum power of the rectifier’s generator that can be extracted, the power losses have to be calculated and suitable power electronic switches should be chosen. Finally, the results are to be compared with the performance of the diode rectifier and the conventional IGBT converter. Generally, the Vienna rectifier is applied to many applications with high switching frequency such as a power supply for an electronic system, especially for telecommunication devices. However, in this project, an effort is made to use it in a wind turbine system application, which has a low switching frequency. The idea behind is to enhance the pure diode rectifier and in this way extract more output power. Therefore, to investigate the performance of the Vienna rectifier and design it according to the project’s requirements, several steps have been done. In the first part, the rectifier operation is studied. The Vienna rectifier is a three phase, three levels and three-switch rectifier; {{it is a kind of}} PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) with a partly controlled output voltage. iv There is a midpoint N, between two equal dc voltages at the output DC bus voltage, which is considered as a reference point with zero voltages. Therefore, three different voltages, + !! !, 0, - !! ! are available as output. Based on the phase current direction and the state of the switches, the phase potentials voltages could be determined. An important point in controlling of the Vienna rectifier is the phase displacement angle φ!. According to available literature, it has the limitation between (- ! !, + ! !). However, it is shown here that this is not completely true in this application. In the next part, the designs of the converter and the power as well as the loss calculation have been done. The circuit of the Vienna rectifier is simulated in the Simplorer software and all of the waveforms are exported to Matlab in order to do the calculations. The simulation results show that the Vienna <b>rectifier</b> has low <b>losses</b> partly due to a very low switching frequency. The IGBTs are turned on only twice during one line period. When the IGBT is in the ON state position during a half period, the output power that can be extracted is 5 MW with a 43 ° phase shift angle. This power is extracted when the output dc-link voltage has the value, 9100 V. As the Vienna rectifier can work in a wide voltage range, other dc voltages are examined. Simulations are performed for, 4300 V, 8400 V, 9100 V and as expected, the Vienna rectifier has the similar operation with diode rectifier at 4300 V. The pure diode rectifier that works with the same generator can only provides 2. 5 MW if no extra capacitors are used. Due to usage of only three IGBTs in designing the Vienna rectifier, the voltage stress during blocking of power electronic switches would be reduced, as well as manufacturing cost, in comparison with the conventional IGBT converter...|$|R
