It analyses {{the system of}} dividing revenues among the three spheres of government. The paper highlights the challenges of designing and implementing intergovernmental fiscal policies and institutions in the post-apartheid era. The paper argues that the costed norms approach developed by the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) has tremendous potential in evolving a simple, objective, and fair system of transfers. However, significant additional work in terms of research, its meaningful dissemination to various governmental units, and building the information system undertake the task is necessary to make it operational. The absence of <b>revenue</b> <b>equalisation</b> in the transfer system is an important weakness of the transfer design. However, provinces do not have much revenue powers. <b>Revenue</b> <b>equalisation</b> in the transfer formula is meaningful only when some broad-based tax handles are assigned to provinces. It {{is also an important}} moral and a policy question as to whether there should be incentive to raise revenues from sources such as, gambling taxes and hospital services. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{interactions}} of horizontal fiscal equalisation schemes with debt policy by sovereign regional governments. Local public goods are either financed by debt or taxation. A horizontal equalisation scheme eleviates regional public revenue disparities under horizontal and vertical tax competition. We show that fiscal equalisation schemes have {{no impact on the}} optimal central government grant whereas they can either soften or harden the regional budget constraint depending on the specific formulae. <b>Revenue</b> <b>equalisation</b> softens the budget constraint whereas tax base equalisation hardens the budget constraint of poor states.

40|$|In this paper, we model {{a federal}} economy where {{perfectly}} mobile labour supply is taxed on an ad valorem basis {{by the federal}} as well as lower-level (state) governments. We find that either under- or overtaxation occurs, under similar conditions as in Keen and Kotsogiannis (2002, 2004). However, the neat trade-off between positive horizontal externalities and negative vertical externalities breaks down entirely in our ad valorem setting. Precisely because of this ambiguity, decentralizing the unitary outcome via <b>revenue</b> <b>equalisation</b> becomes far more complex than under unit taxation. Only when the marginal valuation of public provision is on par with private consumption, can we replicate the clear-cut, efficiency-enhancing equalisation formulas given by Kotsogiannis (2010) and Bucovetsky and Smart (2006). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Fiscal {{capacity}} equalisation, {{at least}} of the type implemented in Australia, is shown to link regions together through a grant distribution formula that creates an incentive for regions to act strategically in order to influence {{the size of their}} grant. This behaviour distorts the provision of local public goods away from optimal levels of provision by changing regional perceptions of the marginal benefit from local public good provision. In addition, the inter-regional transfer of income that occurs with equalisation leads to inefficiency in the spatial allocation of mobile factors of production. As a result, we conclude that equalisation may create economic inefficiency, and lead to a lower level of social welfare. fiscal <b>equalisation,</b> <b>revenue</b> needs, expenditure needs, local public goods, Nash equilibrium, labour mobility, fiscal externalities, economic rents. ...|$|R
40|$|Intergovernmental {{transfers}} can {{be either}} conditional or unconditional {{with regard to the}} autonomy of local governments in spending such financial means. Although fiscal decentralisation has recently been quite pronounced in Eastern European transition countries, the dominance of a purpose- and project-oriented, down-flow transfer system is apparent. In the context of unification, the west German municipal resource allocation system was also implemented {{in the eastern part of}} the country, which provides primarily unconditional transfers for local governments. Furthermore, in the case of adopting the principle of parallel development of fiscal capacity between the state and municipalities, as Saxony already has done, the intergovernmental transfer ratio is no longer exogenously but endogenously determined, which better guarantees a just resource allocation between the two jurisdictions. Since the subsidiarity principle backed by sufficient own fiscal resources and unconditional transfers appears to gain significance in providing local utilities, this study shows the recent Saxon experience with the unconditional transfers, which can be considered for the future fiscal devolution process of Eastern European transition countries. intergovernmental transfers, fiscal decentralisation, local expenditure needs, municipal tax <b>revenues,</b> vertical fiscal <b>equalisation,</b> Saxony, Germany, European transition economies...|$|R
40|$|A {{semi-quantitative method}} of {{analysing}} {{the relationship between}} health care resources and need is described.

40|$|By Hansjörg Blöchliger and Claire Charbit Fiscal {{equalisation}} is {{a transfer}} of fiscal resources across jurisdictions to offset disparities in revenue raising capacity or public service cost. It covers on average 2. 5 % of GDP or 5 % of total government expenditure across OECD countries. Equalisation reduces fiscal disparities by two-thirds on average and in some countries levels them virtually out. Strong equalisation comes at a price: on average, around 70 % of a jurisdiction’s additional tax income must be dedicated to an equalisation fund. The equalisation rate is generally higher for jurisdictions with low fiscal capacity, reducing their tax effort and likely to slow down regional economic convergence. Cost equalisation is larger than <b>revenue</b> <b>equalisation</b> in terms of GDP despite smaller cost disparities, pointing at inefficiencies in the distribution formulae. Fiscal equalisation can be pro-cyclical but most countries succeed in reducing fluctuations of entitlements, sometimes {{at the cost of}} sub-central budget needs. Fiscal equalisation is very country specific, and data and analysis must be taken with care. ...|$|E
40|$|Using an {{estimated}} large-scale New-Keynesian model, we assess welfare and business cycle {{consequences of a}} fiscal union within EMU. We differentiate between three different scenarios: public <b>revenue</b> <b>equalisation,</b> tax harmonisation and a centralised fiscal authority. Relative to the status quo, long term consequences generate winners and losers depending {{on the degree of}} integration and on how key macroeconomic variables adjust. Short term differences between the regimes are minor, both in terms of business cycle statistics as well as in terms of risk sharing of asymmetric shocks. This also explains why welfare differences are negligibly small across the fiscal union scenarios. Even when introducing risk premia on government bonds, this general finding is not changed - although risk premia per se decrease welfare notably. We further perform a counterfactual exercise analysing the effects of what would have happened had a fiscal union regime been installed at the start of EMU already. While key macroeconomic variables would have reacted very similarly, debt dynamics could have changed notably over the estimation period...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the European Community {{is likely to be}} financed through expansion of tax sharing on VAT and by introducing general-revenue sharing indirectly. Tax sharing on VAT does not necessarily imply the harmonisation of tax rates, however. Other options for <b>revenue</b> <b>equalisation</b> schemes are the transfer of tax bases to the centre that exhibits implicit distributional effects. It is argued that capital taxation is the Achilles heel of any future tax system given the fact that [...] in globalised capital markets [...] effective marginal tax rates will more and more influence the international flow of capital, a phenomenon that forces governments into tax competition through market processes. A cash-flow corporation tax seems to be likely to become more and more prominent as an alternative to comprehensive capital income taxation. Applied at the Community level such a tax could serve as an implicit equalisation scheme that fosters developing regions by exempting new investment while taxing the proceeds from the more mature economic areas in the EC. It would also be neutral as to investment and financing decisions and it would attract savings funds from abroad to be invested in the Community. As far as explicit equalisation is concerned, it is argued that differentials among regions are best dealt with by a system of matching grants that concentrate on aspects of allocation rather than by general-revenue redistribution. Harmonisation of personal income taxation in Europe could also be achieved by introducing a piggyback tax onto the income tax system which taxes personal consumption at a flat rate. Shifting the centre of gravitation within these two-tiers of income - consumption taxation would allow national governments to maintain their sovereignty as regards allocative and distributive policy. The consumption tax part could also form the nucleus of a future supranational direct tax. ...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{semi-quantitative method}} of {{analysing}} {{the relationship between}} health care resources and need is described. It utilises the Donabedian model which expresses needs and resources in equivalent units in order to estimate the ratio of resources to need. The optimum resource/need ratio is regarded as that pertaining to the reference population; deviation from this optimum ratio in the subunits of the reference population is interpreted {{as a manifestation of}} inequitable resource distribution. An example is presented of the application of the method to the Greater Glasgow Health Board and its five constituent districts for the years 1974 - 77. It is argued that this method might, without undermining the principle of geographical equity, meet some of the objections to the more rigid 'formula ' approach in the report of the Resource Allocation Working Party (RAWP) and in the Scottish Health Authorities <b>Revenue</b> <b>Equalisation</b> (SHARE) report. Both the RAWP 1 and the SHARE 2 reports attempted to formulate a means of allocating health care resources in accordance with relative need. Baldly stated, their remit was to seek to balance the equation: HEALTH RESOURCES = HEALTH NEED An imbalance had arisen, it was felt, because resources were becpming increasingly 'finite ' while need, as expressed by demand, appeared to be 'infinite'. The reports went further than previous official pronouncements on health policy in emphasising the principle of geographical equity in order that 'every person would have an equal opportunity of access to the health facilities which they need'. 2 The formulas proposed by these working parties encountered several criticisms which were directed mainly at the various implicit and explicit assumptions about the nature of need. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose an alternative method of formulating the need-resource equation which is capable of accommodating different perceptions of need but also sufficiently quantitative to be useful for detailed rational planning...|$|E
