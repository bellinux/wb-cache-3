Considering the motion characteristics of the <b>rigid</b> <b>base,</b> the moving base is modeled to have a motion with disturbances, and the dynamic model of the FMMB is established. With the dynamic model, vibration responses of the FMMB for the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> having disturbance velocities and accelerations are specifically presented. Subsequently, to investigate {{the effect of the}} disturbances on the vibration energy distributions of the FMMB, power flow of the FMMB is exhibited. To verify the dynamic model, an ADAMS physical model of the FMMB is constructed. It reveals that the motion characteristics of the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> have a noticeable effect on the vibration responses and power flow of the FMMB and should be considered. The results are significant and contribute to the vibration control of flexible manipulators...|$|R

We assume that the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> rotates with a constant angular velocity and that the motion of the flexible beam takes place on a plane. To suppress the beam vibrations, we propose dynamic control laws for boundary control force and torque, both applied to the free end of the beam. We show that, under some conditions, one of which is the strict positive realness of the actuator transfer functions which generate the boundary control force and torque, the beam vibrations asymptotically decay to zero if the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> angular frequency is sufficiently small. Moreover, if the transfer functions are proper but not strictly proper, we show that the decay is exponential. We also give a bound on the constant angular velocity above which the system becomes unstable. © 1994...|$|R

Multiple elastic subsystems are rigidly mounted on the rigid body; the elastic degrees of freedom are constrained relative to the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> body. A mathematical model is developed for this multibody attitude system that exposes the dynamic coupling between the rotational degrees of freedom of the base body and the deformation or shape degrees of freedom of the elastic subsystems. The models are used to assess passive dissipation assumptions that guarantee asymptotic stability of an equilibrium solution. These results are motivated and inspired by...|$|R
40|$|A soil-structure {{interaction}} (SSI) analysis {{may be a}} better approach for designing structures to withstand earthquakes than the practical <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> approach. The <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> analysis neglects {{soil-structure interaction}} effects that occur during an earthquake loading and that affect the structure’s behavior.

The effect of saturation on the damping ratio of finite sand stratum underlain by a <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> has been verified and compared with the results obtained for the case of finite dry sand stratum underlain by the <b>rigid</b> <b>base.</b> Comparison of results of the experimental study showed that the damping in both the cases is less than 10. The damping ratio obtained for finite saturated sand stratum is marginally lower than that obtained on finite dry sand stratum at H/B ratio of 0. 5. The difference between the two cases becomes significant when the H/B ratio increases to 3. 0, indicating the significant influence of soil moisture on damping ratio of foundation- soil system with increase in the thickness of the finite sand stratum. Comparison of the predicted damping ratio for a homogeneous sand stratum with the experimental damping ratio obtained corresponding to the height to width ratio of 3. 0 of the finite sand stratum underlain by the <b>rigid</b> concrete <b>base</b> indicates a significant reduction in damping ratio of the foundation-soil system for both the cases...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{ship and}} {{aircraft}} turbine rotors, the rotating mass unbalance {{and the different}} movements of the rotor base are among the main causes of vibrations in bending. The goal {{of this paper is}} to investigate the dynamic behavior of an on-board rotor under <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> excitations. The modeling takes into consideration six types of base deterministic motions (rotations and translations) when the kinetic and strain energies in addition to the virtual work of the rotating flexible rotor components are computed. The finite element method is used in the rotor modeling by employing the Timoshenko beam theory. The proposed on-board rotor model takes into account the rotary inertia, the gyroscopic inertia, the shear deformation of shaft as well as the geometric asymmetry of shaft and/or rigid disk. The Lagrange's equations are applied to establish the differential equations of the rotor in bending with respect to the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> which represents a noninertial reference frame. The linear equations of motion display periodic parametric coefficients due to the asymmetry of the rotor and time-varying parametric coefficients due to the base rotational motions.

The main objective {{of this article is}} to predict the dynamic behavior of a rotor in the presence of base excitations. The proposed on-board rotor model is based on the Timoshenko beam finite element. It takes into account the effects corresponding to rotary inertia, gyroscopic inertia, and shear deformation of shaft as well as the geometric asymmetry of disk and/or shaft and considers six types of deterministic motions (rotations and translations) of the rotor's <b>rigid</b> <b>base.</b> The use of Lagrange's equations associated with the finite element method yields the linear second-order differential equations of vibratory motion of the rotating rotor in bending relative to the moving <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> which forms a non-inertial frame of reference. The linear equations of motion highlight periodic parametric terms due to the geometric asymmetry of the rotor components and time-varying parametric terms due to the rotational motions of the rotor <b>rigid</b> <b>base.</b> These parametric terms are considered as sources of internal excitation and can lead to lateral dynamic instability. In the presented applications, the rotor is excited by a rotating mass unbalance combined with constant rotation and sinusoidal translation of the base.

40|$|One {{approach}} to the numerical solution of a wave equation on an unbounded domain uses a bounded domain surrounded by an absorbing boundary or layer that absorbs waves propagating outward from the bounded domain. A perfectly matched layer (PML) is an unphysical absorbing layer model for linear wave equations that absorbs, almost perfectly, outgoing waves of all non-tangential angles-of-incidence and of all non-zero frequencies. In a recent work [Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 2003; 192 : 13378 ̆ 51375], the authors presented, inter alia, time-harmonic governing equations of PMLs for anti-plane and for plane-strain motion of (visco-) elastic media.
