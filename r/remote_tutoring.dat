40|$|The aims of {{this project}} will be to {{establish}} a patient-centered process for cardiology and interventional cardiology to optimize the processes of diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and training through the development, implementation and testing of the following innovative technologies: - Automatic Identification System through the patient's active implementation of new technologies like RFID and QrCode, for patient’s automatic mapping (intra and extra hospital) {{in order to avoid}} mistakes in patient identification and exchange of identity, allowing its rapid geographic location, the automatic and fast data covering the full medical history of each patient; - New systems for remote control of diagnostic and therapeutic processes of high complexity for the management of critical cardiac patients, ie integrated systems that automatically acquire patient data (electrocardiogram, laboratory-troponin, etc-, with Xray data) entered into a software which, starting from international flow chart, will design a diagnostic-therapeutic strategy, optimized in the individual patient and in the single local environment. This automatic control system of a healthcare professional that will be created by building appropriate software, will be very useful especially in hospitals / ER with low cardiac expertise. It might be useful also for checking the quality of care delivered and to reduce the malpractice. - System for continuity of care of cardiac patients and for controlled access and distributed to health data. We will create a hardware / software through to create a “virtual doctor” for the individual patient that will accompany him for life (before and after hospitalization) with direct access to all data in different formats (pdf, video, audio, DICOM, AVI, MPEG, etc.), to have access to images (coronary angiography, CT, endoscopy) in time real. The system will work on the web for rapid, controlled, ubiquitous access of patient data. - Device front-end innovative, technology-based multi-touch and voice and gesturerecognition, for cardiac imaging, cardiology diagnosis and prognosis; These innovative imaging systems will be the backbone of the station equipment (Cardio Control Station) which will be done in the Campus of Germaneto and that will serve to integrate the different languages and different formats of existing data for individual patients. - New technologies in interventional cardiology (angiography integrated system); The project will involve research and development of new innovative technologies such as design and implementation of a new angiographic arch "U" type, an injector to visualize the arterial tree using CO 2, a system for magnetic navigation of catheters. - Design and assembly of a control station (Cardio Control Station) that would virtually duplicate a room located at a distance in an innovative project for remote control of Cath Lab with active mentoring and management of remote images in order to "help" peripheral centers in interventional cardiology procedures. - Virtual reality system for interventional cardiology planning and <b>remote</b> <b>tutoring.</b> - Integrated system for monitoring the rehabilitation process of the program of health education and food and follow-up. Technologies for diagnosis, therapy and training in interventional cardiology will be integrated into a service center called Cardio Control Station (CCS), to locate at the new campus Germaneto in Catanzaro, who already has advanced technologies and suitable areas.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{development}} and delivery of a Higher Education course module {{as part of a}} large European University's Integrated Masters Program operating through a regional network of Rural Area Training and Information Opportunities (RATIO) telematic centres. The aim of the project was to provide remote learners living in the southwest of England with computer-supported solutions to access higher education as part of a technology-assisted distance education program. The module represented a shift from traditional educational delivery systems by using instructional courseware via an Internet Web site. Personal communications with module participants were conducted with the use of e-mail and videoconferencing information technology (IT) resources. Out of the original sixteen participants who enrolled in this Masters course module, four actually completed the learning sessions and two submitted final assignments. This article considers the key lessons learned from this attrition rate and shares the mainly positive experiences of the <b>remote</b> <b>tutor</b> and the students engaged in this initiative. The implications regarding the use of the Internet for delivering higher education course modules through online distance learning are discussed in the light of cautions learned from this research project and important practical recommendations for future practice are made...|$|R

In places {{it seemed to him}} fine, and in other places queer. About obeying, for instance. If you loved anybody, it seemed rotten to expect them to obey you. If you loved them and they loved you, there couldn't ever be any {{question}} of obeying, because you would both do the things always of your own accord. And if they didn't love you, or you them, then--oh! then it would be simply too disgusting for anything, to go on living with a person you didn't love or who didn't love you. But of course SHE didn't love his tutor. Had she once? Those bright doubting eyes, that studiously satiric mouth came very clearly up before him. You could not love them; and yet--he was really very decent. A feeling as of pity, almost of affection, rose in him for his <b>remote</b> <b>tutor.</b> It was queer to feel so, since the last time they had talked together out there, on the terrace, he had not felt at all like that.|$|R
40|$|Many ICT {{technologies}} {{have been used}} to develop systems to support collaborative learning. These systems are mainly developed to support interaction between users when they collaborate with each other to learn knowledge and solve a problem. However, there are many situations for collaborative learning in which geographically distributed participants play distinct roles and work together to produce or manipulate physical objects. For example, a teacher in a major city teaches a disabled child at a remote area; a <b>remote</b> <b>tutor</b> provides a tutoring service to a local student at home to finish an art or handcraft assignment; or more often, a teacher guides a class of students online through a series of activities in which physical objects are involved such as drawing a picture using different pens. In these scenarios, traditional learning systems may be limited since students not only need to see and hear their teacher, but also need to interact with their teacher to use or manipulate physical objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel system platform called RETutor that is proposed to support this category of collaborative learning scenarios. In this system, while physically distributed, a teacher is enabled to talk to his students, see what the students are working on, and provide guidance information using hand gestures or annotations which are often needed for physical tasks...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: the {{objective}} {{of the study was to}} report the evidence for effectiveness of different self-management course characteristics and components for chronic musculoskeletal pain. Methods: we searched 9 relevant electronic databases for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers selected studies against inclusion criteria and assessed their quality. We classified RCTs according to type of course delivery (group, individual, mixed or <b>remote),</b> <b>tutor</b> (healthcare professional, lay or mixed), setting (medical, community or occupational), duration (more or less than 8 weeks), and the number and type of components (psychological, lifestyle, pain education, mind body therapies, and physical activity). We extracted data on pain intensity, physical function, self-efficacy, global health, and depression and compared these outcomes for self-management and usual care or waiting list control. We used random effects standardized mean difference meta-analysis. We looked for patterns of clinically important and statistically significant beneficial effects for courses with different delivery characteristics and the presence or absence of components across outcomes over 3 follow-up intervals. Results: we included 46 RCTs (N= 8539). Group-delivered courses that had healthcare professional input showed more beneficial effects. Longer courses did not necessarily give better outcomes. There was mixed evidence of effectiveness for components of courses, but data for courses with a psychological component showed slightly more consistent beneficial effects over each follow-up period. Discussion: serious consideration should be given to the development of short (< 8 weeks) group and healthcare professional-delivered interventions but more research is required to establish the most effective and cost-effective course component...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNew text {{analysis}} software developed thanks to research {{in areas such}} as Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing is also useful in language theory and research. Littératron is a new data-processing tool for automatic syntactic pattern extraction that was designed at the LIP 6 laboratory by Jean-Gabriel Ganascia. By syntactic pattern we mean an association of coherent linguistic units. More exactly, the inputs of Littératron are syntactic analysis trees, provided by a linear text analyzer, and its outputs being recurrent syntactic patterns. In addition, Littératron is able to compare several texts in order to detect which syntactic pattern is present in one text and absent from another. It is this kind of discrimination which issued to help build the characteristics of learner writing. Littératron performs a learner cognitive diagnosis by analysising the linguistic style of the written French of learners of French as a foreign language. Our experiments were based on certification in French as a foreign language following the guidelines laid down by ALTE (Association of Language Testers in Europe). The narrative framework of writing tests is postcards, friendly letters and personal statement. Because we work with written productions with strong textual models, comparing these productions allows us to detect syntactic particularities (linguistic and stylistic mistakes for example). The acquisition of French as a foreign language is studied here by comparing the nature and frequency of extracted syntactic patterns taken from the written production of learners and native speakers. The learner may come from a heterogeneous group (different language levels and different mother tongues) or from a homogeneous group (only one language level and one mother tongue, here Arabic). We found decisive patterns in these two groups of learners. In the aim of computer-assisted language learning, a cognitive diagnosis can be carried out using Littératron to study stylistic figures that are counted using recurrent patterns. The diagnosis is built from the stylistic mistakes taken from the learners' written work. Our software extracts a set of characteristic figures concerning noun expansion for instance, or the use of adjectives, adverbs, punctuation, etc. It then analyses the mistakes or the over-use of certain expressions using these figures. Future developments might be to transfer the data to the inference module, which is based on a rule database in order to establish the learner profile. This profile {{could be used as a}} diagnostic tool by the <b>remote</b> <b>tutor.</b> From the information provided by the system about the characteristics of the learner's mistakes, the tutor can make choices and point the learner to the learning activities that are best adapted to the learner's needs, as well as show him how to build a representation of his own learning and needs. This approach can be of interest in three fields: language teaching, on a purely educational basis; computational linguistics; computer-assisted learning (as a tutoring tool) ...|$|R
40|$|One-on-one {{tutoring}} {{is significantly}} {{more effective than}} traditional classroom instruction. In recent years, automated tutoring systems are approaching that level of effectiveness by engaging students in rich natural language dialogue that contributes to learning. A promising approach for further improving the effectiveness of tutorial dialogue systems is to model the differential effectiveness of tutorial strategies, identifying which dialogue moves or combinations of dialogue moves are associated with learning. It {{is also important to}} model the ways in which experienced tutors adapt to learner characteristics. This paper takes a corpus-based approach to these modeling tasks, presenting the results of a study in which task-oriented, textual tutorial dialogue was collected from <b>remote</b> one-on-one human <b>tutoring</b> sessions. The data reveal patterns of dialogue moves that are correlated with learning, and can directly inform the design of student-adaptive tutorial dialogue management systems. 1...|$|R

40|$|Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) {{complement}} {{training simulators}} by providing automated instruction {{when it is}} not economical or feasible to dedicate an instructor to each student during training simulations. To lower the cost and difficulty of creating scenario-based intelligent tutoring systems for procedural task training, we developed the Task Tutor Toolkit (T 3), a generic tutoring system shell and scenario authoring tool. The Task Tutor Toolkit employs a case-based reasoning approach where the instructor creates a procedure template that specifies the range of student actions that are &quot;correct &quot; within each scenario. The system enables a non-programmer to specify task knowledge quickly and easily by via graphical user interface, using a &quot;demonstrate, generalize, and annotate&quot; paradigm, that recognizes the range of possible valid actions and infers general principles that are understood (or misunderstood) by the student when those actions are carried out. The annotated procedure template also enables the Task Tutor Toolkit to provide hints requested by the student during scenarios, such as “What do I do now? ” and “Why do I do that? ” At the end of each scenario, RPOT displays the principles correctly or incorrectly demonstrated by the student, along with explanations and background information. The Task Tutor Toolkit was designed to be modular and general {{so that it can be}} interfaced with a wide range of training simulators and support a variety of training domains.

40|$|Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) encode {{and apply}} the subject matter and {{teaching}} expertise of experienced instructors {{to provide students with}} individualized instruction automatically. ITSs complement training simulators by providing automated instruction when it is not economical or feasible to dedicate an instructor to each student during training simulations. Despite their proven training effectiveness and favorable operating cost, however, relatively few ITSs are in use. This is largely because it is usually costly and difficult to encode the task knowledge used by the ITS to evaluate the student's actions and assess the student's performance. Procedural tasks are tasks for which there exist procedures, guidelines, and strategies that determine the correct set of steps to be taken within each situation. To lower the cost and difficulty of creating tutoring systems for procedural task training, Stottler Henke Associates, Inc. (SHAI) worked closely with the Operations Training Group at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center to develop the Task Tutor Toolkit (T (exp 3)), a generic tutoring system shell and scenario authoring tool. The Task Tutor Toolkit employs a case-based reasoning approach where the instructor creates a procedure template that specifies the range of student actions that are "correct" within each scenario. Because each procedure template is specific to a single scenario, the system can employ relatively simple reasoning methods to represent a correct set of actions and assess student performance. This simplicity enables a non-programmer to specify task knowledge quickly and easily by via graphical user interface, using a "demonstrate, generalize, and annotate" paradigm, that recognizes the range of possible valid actions and infers principles understood (or misunderstood) by the student when those actions are carried out. The Task Tutor Toolkit was also designed to be modular and general, {{so that it can be}} interfaced with a wide range of training simulators and support a variety of training domains. SHAI and NASA applied the Task Tutor Toolkit to create the <b>Remote</b> Payload Operations <b>Tutor</b> (RPOT). RPOT is a specific tutoring system application which lets scientists who are new to space mission operations learn to monitor and control their experiments aboard the International Space Station according to NASA payload regulations, guidelines, and procedures. The RPOT simulator lets students practice these skills by monitoring the telemetry variable values of a simple, hypothetical experiment, sending commands to the experiment, coordinating with NASA personnel via voice communication loops, and submitting and retrieving information via documents and forms. At the end of each scenario, RPOT displays the principles correctly or incorrectly demonstrated by the student, along with explanations and background information. The effectiveness of RPOT and the Task Tutor Toolkit are currently under evaluation at NASA...|$|R
