40|$|ABSTRACTRoasted {{plantain}} (boli) is a delicacy in Nigeria. The conventional {{method of}} processing this food is crude, stressful and unhygienic. In this work, an electric roaster capable of roasting twenty-one plantain fingers per batch was designed, fabricated and tested. The roaster had two electric heating elements (one {{at the top}} and the other {{at the base of the}} roaster) supplying power at the rate of 2. 4 kW In addition, moisture <b>release</b> <b>pipe</b> and a temperature regulator were incorporated. The roaster was used to produce plantain, product was compared with roasted plantain prepared using the conventional method to test acceptability. At a p< 0. 05 significance level, it was observed that the samples had no significant difference in appearance, aroma, texture and overall acceptability. However, sample at the upper layer of the roaster was significantly different from the other samples in taste. Generally, sample roasted in the lower part of the roaster was most preferred...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} benefits, {{as well as}} limitations, of using the LES technique to predict the combustion efficiency, emissions and temperatures of wake-stabilised flares. LES calculations have been performed for two jet-to-cross-flow momentum flux ratios, with the results being compared with experimental data, where available, and with predictions of a closed RANS model using a second-moment turbulence closure. The flame fragmentation and the secondary flame zone attached to the <b>release</b> <b>pipe</b> at high jet-to-cross-flow momentum flux ratios, and their influence {{on the evolution of}} the counter-rotating vortex pair found in such flames, are discussed in detail, with realistic predictions being produced by the LES. The global mixing characteristics and the combustion efficiency of such flames are also compared with available data with reasonable agreement found. In all cases, LES predictions are found to be superior to equivalent RANS results, although the extra computational effort required in predicting species concentrations and flare efficiencies, in particular, may not be warranted...|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} predicting the major flow properties in wake-stabilised jet flames in a cross flow of air using first- and second-order turbulence models, applied within a RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) modelling framework. Standard and RNG (re-normalisation group) versions of the k-ε turbulence model were employed at the first-order level and the results compared with a second-moment closure, or RSM (Reynolds stress model). The combustion process was modelled using the laminar flamelet approach together with a thermal radiation model using the discrete ordinate method. The ability of the various turbulence models to reproduce experimentally established flame appearance, profiles of velocity and turbulence intensity, {{as well as the}} combustion efficiency of such flames is reported. The results show that all the turbulence models predict similar velocity profiles over the majority of the flow domain considered, except in the wake region, where the predictions of the RSM and RNG k-ε models are in closer agreement with experimental data. In contrast, the standard k-ε model over-predicts the peak turbulence intensity. Also, it is found that the RSM provides superior predictions of the planar recirculation and flame zones attached to the <b>release</b> <b>pipe</b> in the wake region...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine detailed vertical, horizontal, intensive, and diel distributions of juvenile salmonid passage at the spillway at The Dalles Dam from April 12 to July 16, 2006. These data are being applied in the Spillway Improvements Program to position <b>release</b> <b>pipes</b> for direct injury and mortality studies and to provide baseline data for assessment of the vortex suppression devices scheduled for deployment in 2007. We estimated fish distributions from hydroacoustic data collected with split-beam transducers arrayed across Bays 1 through 9 and 14. Spill at ~ 20 kcfs per bay was bulked at Bays 1 - 6, although the other bays were opened at times during the study to maintain a 40 % spill percentage out of total project discharge. The vertical distribution of fish was skewed toward the surface during spring, but during summer, passage peaked at 2 - 3 m above the spillway ogee. Fish passage rates (number per hour) and fish densities (number per kcfs) were highest at Bay 6, followed by passage at Bay 5. This result comports with spillway horizontal distribution data from radio telemetry and hydroacoustic studies in 2004. The vertical and horizontal distribution of fish passage at bays 5 and 6 was much more variable during spring than summer and more variable at bay 5 than bay 6. Diel distribution data revealed that fish passage was highest during 0600 - 0700 h in spring; otherwise passage was reasonably uniform on a diel basis. This study substantiates the purpose of the spillway vortex suppression device to re-distribute downstream migrants away from Bay 6 toward Bays 1 - 5...|$|R

40|$|CO 2 ocean {{sequestration}} {{is considered to}} be an effective global warming countermeasure. In CO 2 {{ocean sequestration}}, dilution process of injected CO 2 plays an important roll on biological impact. In this study, we investigated a turbulent wake flow behind a circular cylinder at Reynolds number(Re) = 5 x 105, which simulates the wake flow behind the CO 2 <b>releasing</b> <b>pipe</b> in CO 2 ocean sequestration. By using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV), we examined flow behaviour as well as turbulent properties of the wake flow over the critical Reynolds number. Figure 1 a) shows a snapshot of measured two-dimensional velocity field at Re= 5 x 105. In the figure, the result at Re= 6 x 104 (Fig. 1 b)) is also displayed for comparison. Wake width at Re= 5 x 105 is narrower than that at Re= 6 x 104. It was also revealed that turbulent intensities normalised by mean flow velocity in case of the flow at Re= 5 x 105 was about one-half to the flow at Re= 6 x 104. At Re= 5 x 105, vortex marching was limited in narrow region behind the wake and vortex size was small compared to that at Re= 6 x 104. Thus, turbulent motion in the wake was restricted {{in the case of the}} high Reynolds number flow. This leads to reduction of wake width and turbulent intensities in the wake flow over critical Reynolds number. a) b) Fig. 1.
