5|$|In {{accordance}} with magnetic data, electrical <b>resistivity</b> of curium increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature. There {{is a significant}} increase in <b>resistivity</b> over time (about 10 µΩ·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute <b>resistivity</b> value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The <b>resistivity</b> of curium {{is similar to that of}} gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, polonium and thorium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Resistivity</b> is {{a measure}} of how {{strongly}} a material opposes the flow of electric current. The <b>resistivity</b> of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals. This trend continues down to 100K, below which <b>resistivity</b> rapidly decreases for fresh samples. <b>Resistivity</b> then begins to increase with time at around 20K due to radiation damage, with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical <b>resistivity.</b> So for americium-241, the <b>resistivity</b> at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its <b>resistivity.</b> In fresh samples, the <b>resistivity</b> gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E
40|$|The highly {{anisotropic}} <b>resistivities</b> in strained manganites are theoretically studied {{using the}} two-orbital double-exchange model. At the nanoscale, the anisotropic double-exchange and Jahn-Teller distortions {{are found to}} be responsible for the robust anisotropic <b>resistivities</b> observed here via Monte Carlo simulations. An unbalanced in the population of orbitals caused by strain is responsible for these effects. In contrast, the anisotropic superexchange is found to be irrelevant to explain our results. Our model study suggests that highly anisotropic <b>resistivities</b> could be present {{in a wide range of}} strained manganites, even without (sub) micrometer-scale phase separation. In addition, our calculations also confirm the formation of anisotropic clusters in phase-separated manganites, which magnifies the anisotropic <b>resistivities.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

These <b>resistivities</b> are complex but their magnitudes {{are the same}} as those of the classical formulas. However, the phases of the complex <b>resistivities</b> are double those of the corresponding impedances because of the squared complex impedance. Both ϱ_s and ϱp are invariant under rotation of coordinates because this is a property of the trace of Z^TZ and Y^TY.|$|R

The southern deeper part contains two regions {{as shown by the}} region X and Y in Fig. 4. <b>Resistivities</b> of the region X is higher than those of the upper layer, in contrast to those of the region Y, which shows <b>resistivities</b> that are lower than the upper layer. In this analysis, the <b>resistivities</b> of those regions were oppositely revised, and the fit of the changed soundings to the observed data was examined.|$|R

5|$|The first {{investigation}} of the chapel ruins, supported by the National Trust, was conducted by the local history group {{in the winter of}} 1998–99. This survey was conducted under a licence from English Heritage that allowed access but did not permit excavation, so it relied on height measurements, geophysics (<b>resistivity,</b> and magnetometry) and molehill sampling. The area surveyed was 100m long and 40m wide (109yd by 44yd). The magnetometry failed to detect the subterranean features of the chapel, but did show an unexpected linear anomaly, related to buried ironwork from wartime defences. The <b>resistivity</b> survey clearly showed the larger room, but barely detected the smaller, suggesting that it had less substantial foundations, was probably less well-constructed, and possibly later in date.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium {{has three}} allotropes labeled by the Greek letters alpha, beta and gamma; their {{transformation}} temperatures are −13°C and 795°C, although the exact transformation temperature {{depends on the}} pressure and stress. The beta allotrope (6.966 g/cm3) exists at room temperature, {{and it has a}} face-centered cubic crystal structure. The high-temperature gamma allotrope (6.57 g/cm3) has a body-centered cubic crystalline structure. The alpha allotrope (6.903 g/cm3) has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is stable at low temperatures. The beta allotrope has a metallic electrical conductivity at normal atmospheric pressure, but it becomes a semiconductor when exposed to a pressure of about 16,000 atmospheres (1.6GPa). Its electrical <b>resistivity</b> increases ten times upon compression to 39,000 atmospheres (3.9GPa), but then drops to about 10% of its room-temperature <b>resistivity</b> at about 40,000atm (4.0GPa).|$|E

40|$|Electrodeposition {{is being}} used to {{fabricate}} magnetic microstructures directly on patterned n-type Si wafers of various substrate <b>resistivities.</b> The Ni–Si Schottky barrier is characterized and found to be of high quality for relatively low Si <b>resistivities</b> (1 - 2 Ohm cm), with extremely low reverse leakage. It is shown that a direct correlation exists among the electrodeposition potential, the roughness, and the coercivity of the films.

5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical <b>resistivity</b> of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E

5|$|The {{softness}} of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} <b>resistivity</b> to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E

Low <b>resistivities</b> were measured at high temperatures for all the titanate-based systems (Li 2 TiO 3, ZrTiO 4, MgTiO 3, CaTiO 3, and SrTiO 3) when: (i) doping with M § impurities and (ii) the atmosphere was necessarily reducing (low PO 2).
