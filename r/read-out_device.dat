40|$|Ab initio {{investigations}} performed {{within the}} framework of the spin-polarised relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green’s function method show that the longitudinal thermopower in the metallic M/Co/M systems (with M a non-magnetic transition metal) depends in a significant manner on the relative orientation (in-plane versus out-of-plane) of the sample magnetisation. As thermoelectric analogue of the conventional anisotropic magneto-resistance (AMR), the amplitude of this magneto-thermopower (MTP) signal is related to the asymmetry of the AMR around the Fermi energy. This asymmetry can be sizable, and thus the MTP accordingly large, even if the AMR itself is small. An enhancement of the MTP based on this understanding opens the possibility of implementing efficient spin <b>read-out</b> thermoelectric <b>devices</b> based on a single ferromagnetic layer. Our calculations reveal a rather non-intuitive behaviour of the MTP in the investigated systems, with the Pd/Co/Pd trilayer exhibiting an extremely small valued MTP, not necessarily expected from the monotonous increase of the spin-orbit coupling strength for the different heterostructure partners M = Cu; Pd; Pt...|$|R

40|$|To {{overcome}} the limited field of view, {{which can be}} achieved with single superconducting tunneling junction (STJ) arrays, distributed <b>read-out</b> imaging <b>devices</b> (DROIDs) are being developed. DROIDs consist of a superconducting absorber strip with proximized STJs on either end. The ratio of the two signals from the STJs provides information on the absorption position, and the sum signal is a measure for {{the energy of the}} absorbed photon. In our devices, the absorber is an epitaxial Ta strip that extends underneath the Ta/Al read-out STJs. Thus, the bottom electrode of the STJs {{is an integral part of}} the absorber. Due to the proximity effect, the STJs have a lower energy gap than the absorber, causing trapping of quasiparticles (QPs) in the STJs. The trapping will change with thicker Al layers because the energy gap of the devices will decrease. A series of 50 × 200 μm 2 and 20 × 200 μm 2 absorbers (including 50 × 50 μm 2 STJs) and different Al trapping layer thicknesses, ranging from 65 to 130 nm, have been tested.

The current measurement is then compared to readout using real-time detection of the SET island's charge state. For the latter method we show that the quantum efficiency is always unity. Comparing the two methods a simple geometrical interpretation of the quantum efficiency of the current measurement appears.

In attempts to find solutions to detect bacteria causing antibiotic resistance we turn to technological solutions that are miniaturized, portable and cheap. The current diagnostic procedures cannot provide correct information outside laboratory settings, at the point-of-care, within necessary time. This has led to ineffective treatment of urinary tract infections causing recurrent infections and multi-drug resistant bacteria to spread. The bacteria genes show which antibiotic that is required to eliminate disease and spread of resistance. Hence, the solution would be to perform nucleic acid testing at the point-of-care.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of, position-sensitive, Transition Edge Sensors (TES) operating at cryogenic temperatures (~ 0. 1 K). The Distributed <b>Read-Out</b> Imaging <b>Device</b> (DROID) concept uses TES read-out at both ends of a linear X-ray absorber, to derive, through heat diffusion, both spectral and spatial information. Potentially, DROIDs offer a simpler technological alternative to the development of large area pixel arrays for future X-ray space observatories (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 presents a comprehensive review of the theory of microcalorimeter detectors. A finite-element model is established in Chapter 3, to numerically simulate the response of the DROID to an X-ray photon, as well as the noise spectral density at the detector outputs, including frequency dependent correlations between the two TESs. In Chapter 4 this model is used to implement pre-existing algorithms, based {{on the use of the}} optimal filter, to calculate the position and energy resolution along the length of experimental DROID designs. We show that these algorithms do not lead to optimum performance under all conditions and then derive the true optimal filters, based on least-squares minimisation of the total noise power in the DROID. By numerical simulation we show that significant improvements in both the energy and in particular, the position resolution, are theoretically possible. The design and experimental characterisation of two prototype DROIDs are described in Chapter 6 and 7, using the equipment described in Chapter 5.

Current available methods for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma infection, including cultivation, serological assays, and PCR, are time-consuming and require fully equipped stationary laboratories, which make them incompatible with testing in the resource-poor settings that are most relevant to this disease. We report a rapid, specific, and sensitive assay employing isothermal DNA amplification using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) {{for the detection of}} M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae. We developed the assay using a specific target sequence in M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae, as found in the genome sequence of the field strain ILRI 181 and the type strain F 38 and that was further evidenced in 10 field strains from different geographical regions. Detection limits corresponding to 5 × 10 (3) and 5 × 10 (4) cells/ml were obtained using genomic DNA and bacterial culture from M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae strain ILRI 181, while no amplification was obtained from 71 related Mycoplasma isolates or from the Acholeplasma or the Pasteurella isolates, demonstrating a high degree of specificity.

In typical force spectroscopic setups the molecule is connected via linkers to a <b>read-out</b> <b>device,</b> forming a mechanically coupled dynamic network. Deconvolution of equilibrium distributions, filtering out the influence of the linkers, is a straightforward and common practice. We have developed an analogous dynamic deconvolution theory for the more challenging task of extracting kinetic properties of individual components in networks of arbitrary complexity and topology. Our method determines the intrinsic linear response functions of a given molecule in the network, describing the power spectrum of conformational fluctuations. The practicality of our approach is demonstrated for the particular case of a protein linked via DNA handles to two optically trapped beads at constant stretching force, which we mimic through Brownian dynamics simulations. Each well in the protein free energy landscape (corresponding to folded, unfolded, or possibly intermediate states) will have its own characteristic equilibrium fluctuations. The associated linear response function is rich in physical content, since it depends both on the shape of the well and its diffusivity [...] -a measure of the internal friction arising from such processes like the transient breaking and reformation of bonds in the protein structure. Starting from the autocorrelation functions of the equilibrium bead fluctuations measured in this force clamp setup, we show how an experimentalist can accurately extract the state-dependent protein diffusivity using a straightforward two-step procedure.

40|$|AbstractThe {{bremsstrahlung}} X-ray spectrum in high-energy, high-intensity X-ray cargo inspection {{systems is}} attenuated and modified by cargo materials {{depending on the}} cargo atomic number (Z). Spectroscopy of transmitted x rays is thus useful to measure the approximate Z of the cargo. Due to the broad features of the energy spectrum, excellent energy resolution is not required. Such “Z-Spectroscopy” (Z-SPEC) is possible at low enough count rates. A statistical approach, Z-SCAN (Z-determination by Statistical Count-rate ANalysis), can also be used, complementing Z-SPEC at high count rates. Both approaches require fast X-ray detectors and fast digitizers. Z-SPEC, in particular, benefits from very fast scintillators, {{in order to avoid}} signal pile-up. Preferentially, Z-SPEC, Z-SCAN and cargo imaging are implemented in a single detector array to reduce system cost, weight, and complexity. To preserve good spatial resolution of the imaging subsystem, dense scintillators are required. Previously, we studied ZnO, BaF 2 and PbWO 4, as well as suitable photo-detectors, read-out electronics and digitizers. ZnO is not suitable because it self-absorbs its scintillation light. BaF 2 emits in the UV, either requiring fast wavelength shifters or UV-sensitive solid state read-out devices, and it also has a long decay time component. PbWO 4 is currently the most attractive choice because it does not have these problems, but it is significantly slower and has low light output. There is thus a need for alternative fast high-density scintillators that emit visible light. Alternatively, {{there is a need for}} a fast solid-state <b>read-out</b> <b>device</b> that is sensitive to UV light for use with BaF 2, or other UV-emitting scintillators.

The same edges exhibit also a finite bias-dependent Kerr angle, indicative of spin accumulation induced by a transversal spin Hall effect in the bulk states of the Bi 2 Te 2 Se platelets. A symmetry analysis shows that the helical photoconductance is distinct to common longitudinal photoconductance and photocurrent phenomena, but consistent with the accumulated spins being transported in the side facets of the platelets. Our findings demonstrate that spin effects in the facets of 3 D topological insulators can be addressed and <b>read-out</b> in optoelectronic <b>devices</b> even at room temperatures...|$|R
