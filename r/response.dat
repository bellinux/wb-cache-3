5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional <b>response</b> is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global <b>response</b> to damage. Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock <b>response</b> {{indicates that a}} general global stress <b>response</b> pathway exist {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global <b>response.</b> The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E
5|$|Fear <b>response</b> {{in women}} during two {{different}} points in the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear <b>response</b> was a more powerful <b>response.</b> To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E

5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency <b>response</b> irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency <b>response</b> at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency <b>response.</b> Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general <b>response</b> since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E

We used autobiographical recalls to examine differences between vengeful and anger-driven <b>responses.</b> Our findings revealed that vengeful <b>responses</b> {{are not the}} same as anger-driven <b>responses.</b> Compared to anger-driven <b>responses,</b> vengeful <b>responses</b> resulted more from offences that induce a self-threat, which elicited more intense negative self-conscious emotions and more rumination. Moreover, compared to anger-driven <b>responses,</b> vengeful <b>responses</b> consisted more of behaviours that induced a self-threat to the other person, were motivated more by intrapersonal goals, were more delayed, elicited more positive emotions and resulted in less relationship restoration.

5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific <b>response.</b> Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate <b>response,</b> vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate <b>response.</b> Here, the immune system adapts its <b>response</b> during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved <b>response</b> is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E
5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in <b>response</b> to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the {{sensitive}} plant, Mimosa pudica, close up rapidly in <b>response</b> to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The proximate cause of this mechanical <b>response</b> is an abrupt change in the turgor pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed.|$|E
40|$|Early life <b>responses</b> to {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (RSV) -F DNA and RSV-F protein immunization {{were studied}} in murine models of neonatal immunization. RSV-F DNA induced similar antibody (Ab) <b>responses,</b> antigen-specific IFN-gamma production and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) <b>responses</b> in 1 -week-old and adult BALB / c mice. In contrast, RSV-F protein induced much higher IL- 5 <b>responses</b> in early life. Both vaccines elicited Ab and CTL <b>responses</b> in spite of maternal Ab, but with distinctive kinetics. Sequential RSV-F DNA priming / protein boosting primed 1 -week-old mice for RSV-F-specific CTL <b>responses,</b> reduced IL- 5 production and enhanced Ab <b>responses.</b> In contrast, IL- 5 exceeded IFN-gamma <b>responses</b> when young mice were primed with protein and boosted with DNA. Last, when protein and DNA immunization were combined, a single vaccine dose induced early Ab <b>responses,</b> preferential IL- 5 <b>responses</b> but strong CTL <b>responses.</b> Sequential or combined DNA / protein immunization thus represent interesting strategies for early life immunization...|$|R

40|$|African Americans’ {{experiences}} of racism {{have been found}} to be linked with higher levels of psychological distress. Coping <b>responses</b> to racism and racial identity may serve as moderators to this relationship. The present study uses an implicit measure to assess coping <b>responses</b> and racial identity. The main goal was to determine any correlation between implicit and explicit coping <b>responses</b> and racial identity, and between implicit coping <b>responses</b> to racism and explicit coping <b>responses</b> to general stress. A significant correlation was observed between implicit and explicit measures of coping <b>responses</b> and racial identity, and between implicit coping <b>responses</b> to racism and explicit coping <b>responses</b> to general stress. A significant correlation was also observed between implicit coping <b>responses</b> to racism and psychological distress.

25|$|In the {{psychology}} of visual perception and motor control, the term <b>response</b> priming denotes a special form of visuomotor priming effect. The distinctive feature of <b>response</b> priming is that prime and target are presented in quick succession (typically, less than 100 milliseconds apart) and are coupled to identical or alternative motor responses. When a speeded motor <b>response</b> is performed to classify the target stimulus, a prime immediately preceding the target can thus induce <b>response</b> conflicts when assigned to a different <b>response</b> as the target. These <b>response</b> conflicts have observable effects on motor behavior, leading to priming effects, e.g., in <b>response</b> times and error rates. A special property of <b>response</b> priming is its independence from visual awareness of the prime: For example, <b>response</b> priming effects can increase under conditions where visual awareness of the prime is decreasing.|$|E

30|$|This study {{examined}} {{the role of the}} HPA axis in OTS. To learn whether the differences in hormone <b>responses</b> between OTS and ATL resulted from a physiological adaptation to sports (which has not been analyzed in previous studies) or from dysfunctional OTS <b>responses,</b> we included two control groups, of healthy athletes and healthy non-active subjects. Overall, we found that OTS have blunted hormonal <b>responses</b> compared to ATL, but not to NCS, whereas ATL showed more exacerbated <b>responses</b> than NCS. It means that athletes affected by OTS do not disclose actual dysfunctional <b>responses,</b> as hormonal <b>responses</b> were not different from normal non-active control subjects, but nullifies the likely adaptive hormonal <b>responses</b> observed in healthy athletes, as healthy athletes disclosed different <b>responses</b> compared to sedentary control subjects, whereas the different <b>responses</b> compared to NCS were not observed when compared to OTS-affected subjects. This means that the different <b>responses,</b> a likely adaptive process observed in healthy athletes, are nullified when OTS is present.|$|R
