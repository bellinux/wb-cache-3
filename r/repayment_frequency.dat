40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} access to saving instruments directly improves access to credit. In a typical framework, households borrow, invest and then repay loan with interest. If households can save without di ¢ culty, {{they should be able}} to follow any <b>repayment</b> <b>frequency.</b> However, in reality it is likely that income gets diverted into miscellaneous expenses. If houshe-olds realize this, then it is possible that they tie the loan repayment schedule to their income schedule. In this paper, I provide a simple model and empirical support to illustrate this point. The results indicate that a household which does not save is 32 percent more likely to tie the repayment schedule of a loan to its income schedule and pays 3. 6 percent higher interest rate for a loan. I am able to show this by exploiting the unique preferredloan <b>repayment</b> <b>frequency</b> data available for each household...|$|E

40|$|As an {{intrinsic}} {{part of the}} classic microfinance model, group meetings are intended to employ social capital to ensure timely repayment. Recent research suggests that more frequent meeting can, itself, increase social capital among first-time clients. Using ran-domized variation in group meeting frequency for 174 microfinance groups in India, we demonstrate that social capital gains associated with more frequent meeting continue to accrue across multiple lending cycles. However, these effects are reduced when group members differ in their borrowing history. In addition, clients who start {{with low levels of}} empowerment report higher social capital gains when matched with similar clients. We discuss how current microfinance policy debates overlook the creation of social capital, including through <b>repayment</b> meeting <b>frequency,</b> and we encourage regulators to undertake a holistic understanding of microfinance’s impacts. ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{primarily}} {{focuses on}} the investigation of repayment performance under conventional interest based (IB) contracts and non-interest based contracts (Profit Sharing-PS and Joint Venture-JV) using an experimental approach. Towards the end, we conducted three different experiments with three different types of subject pools. The first experiment was a classroom experiment conducted at the International Institute of Islamic Economics (IIIE), International Islamic University, Islamabad (IIUI), Pakistan, using student subjects. The second experiment was an artefactual field experiment using subjects from the general populace in a semi-rural town of District Sialkot, Pakistan. The third and the last experiment was a laboratory experiment conducted at the University of Sydney, Australia, using undergraduate as well as graduate students. Significantly, our subject pool was a mix of {{both male and female}} in all the three experiments. Repayment performances under these contracts were analysed under different situations such as contract enforcement with penalty conditions set by the lenders. We also attempted to identify the preferences of the subjects by allowing them to choose over such contracts. Further, we studied the effects of peer monitoring on the repayment behaviour of the subjects. We also explored how gender differences and the degree of religiosity of subjects affect their repayment behaviour. Importantly, in all our experiments, we studied the behavioural responses of the subjects under individual as well as group lending - mutual decision scenarios except for the laboratory experiment in the University of Sydney, Australia, which was based on group lending with joint liability. Chapter 3 of the thesis reports on the classroom experiments (conducted in Pakistan) and compares the repayment performance of subjects under three different contracts. Our results indicate that in terms of <b>repayment</b> <b>frequencies,</b> PS and JV contracts dominate the IB contract, in both individual and group lending - mutual decision situations. The effect of enforcement and penalty conditions resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} <b>repayment</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Prior knowledge of Islamic economics and the degree of religiosity of the subjects significantly and positively affected the repayment behaviour. However, no significant gender differences were observed in this study. Chapter 4 of the thesis reports on an artefactual field experiment (conducted in Pakistan) and studies the preference of subjects over the PS and the IB contracts as well as how these affect subject’s repayment behaviour under individual as well group lending - mutual decision setting. We found a strong preference of the subjects to opt for the PS contract over the IB contract. However, the repayment rates across the contracts did not differ significantly. Enforcement and penalty treatments along with the religiosity of the subjects had a significant and positive effect on the repayment behaviour of the subjects. Chapter 5 addresses the effects of peer monitoring and choice of contracts (among PS and IB) on the repayment behaviour of the subjects in a laboratory experiment conducted at the University of Sydney, Australia. We noted that monitoring had a statistically significant and positive effect on the repayment rates. While we found the subjects have a preference for the PS over the IB contract, the choice of contracts did not have an effect on the repayment rate of the subjects. Nevertheless, unlike in our earlier experiments, the degree of religiosity was not found to be an important variable affecting the repayment behaviour of the subjects. Overall, we feel that the Muslim communities would have a natural preference for the use of non-interest based contracts (like PS or JV) over conventional interest contracts (IB). This is possibly because of the religious sentiments against the use of “usury” contracts. This preference, however, can also be because of the “perceived fairness” of these contracts. Under these contracts, the borrowers are required to pay only when the project succeeds (but not when it fails) unlike in the conventional interest based contracts. Thus, we argue that non-interest based microfinance contracts could be effective alternatives for the Muslim communities. Our study also suggests that peer monitoring within the group members could be an effective way to increase the repayment rates of the borrowers. Finally, in a real world context, the Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) may be better off, leaving the choice of contracts to the borrowers as this may lead to an increase in the effort level, which will result in higher repayment rates.

40|$|Microfinance {{clients were}} {{randomly}} assigned to repayment groups that met ei-ther weekly or monthly during their first loan cycle, and then graduated to identical meeting frequency for their second loan. Long-run survey data and a follow-up pub-lic goods experiment reveal that clients initially assigned to weekly groups interact more often and exhibit a higher willingness to pool risk with group members from their first loan cycle nearly two years after the experiment.

40|$|Excerpt] This paper {{focuses on}} a key aspect of {{microfinance}} contracts - repayment schedules - to determine the impact of greater flexibility in repayment schedules on clients’ ability to smooth consumption as well as increase income by putting their loans in less liquid but higher return investments. Traditionally, microfinance repayment schedules are notoriously rigid, involving high frequency repayment in small installments beginning soon after loan disbursement, {{an important aspect of}} the lending model pioneered by earliest MFIs such as the Grameen Bank (Armendariz and Morduch 2005). However, in theory, clients are likely to be better off under more flexible repayment terms, which would give them greater ability to smooth consumption in the face of unanticipated shocks and encourage them to invest more of the loan in relatively illiquid but potentially higher return business investments (Field and Pande 2008). Through both of these channels, introducing flexibility in the timing of repayment by reducing <b>repayment</b> <b>frequency</b> could increase client long-run business income...|$|E
40|$|The {{mismatch}} between credit repayments and income seasonality poses {{a challenge for}} microfinance institutions (MFIs) working in developing countries. For instance, in northern Bangladesh, income and consumption downfalls during the lean season after the transplanting of major paddy crops are {{a serious threat to}} a household's economy. Poor landless agricultural wage laborers suffer the most owing to this seasonality as they face difficulties in smoothing their consumption. However, in designing microcredit products, MFIs do not usually provide flexibility or seasonal adjustment during the lean season. This is mainly because MFIs are afraid that such flexibility might break the repayment discipline of borrowers, resulting in higher default rates. We thus conducted a randomized controlled trial in 2011 - 12 in northern Bangladesh to empirically test whether seasonality-adjusted flexible microcredit leads to an increase in repayment problems for MFIs as well as whether it can increase and stabilize consumption of borrower households. Our results suggest no statistically discernible difference among the treatment arms in case of default, overdue amount, or <b>repayment</b> <b>frequency.</b> On the other hand, we find no positive impact of repayment flexibility on immediate food consumption during the period of seasonality, except for in-kind full moratorium treatment group. After a year of initial intervention, however, we see positive changes in food intake during the lean season. Thus, our preliminary results are in favor of seasonality-adjusted flexible microcredit...|$|E

Analyzing databases to manage customer behaviors seems difficult since databases are multi-dimensional, comprised of monthly account records and daily transactional records.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this {{dissertation}} examines the market for private school. Private school market shares are rising steadily in many developing countries, {{but we have a}} limited understanding of how private schools set prices, how parents respond, and how this affects enrollment and performance in equilibrium. To shed shed light on demand behavior and supply response, I present a model of school pricing that incorporates an unusual feature of schooling compared to other goods - a potential preference by parents for small classes, and hence low school enrollment - that interacts with schools having market power. I show that, for a relatively broad range of parameter values, these two features can lead to the surprising result that an increase in aggregate household income, and hence an increase in willingness to pay for private schooling, can actually cause equilibrium private school enrollment to decrease. To investigate how private school enrollment responds to rising household income in practice, I exploit aggregate community-level income shocks in Chile, which has had a nationwide school voucher system since 1981. These shocks are caused by different responses to the price of copper in different municipalities. I show that private school prices rise by 0. 9 % in response to a shock that causes a 1 % rise in income while private school enrollment falls by 2. 0 %. I find that falling private school enrollment is primarily caused by the middle-income students at the top schools. Those middle-income students induced to downgrade by rising prices do not experience the test score gains from the income shock experienced by students {{in the rest of the}} income distribution. I structurally estimate an extended version of the model and find that both market power and parental preferences for reduced class size are contributing to the observed declines in enrollment. The second chapter studies the responsiveness of United States-Mexico migration to U. S. border enforcement policy. Spending on border enforcement has risen by 240 % in the U. S. in the last decade, and the construction of a fence on the U. S. -Mexico border has become a focal point in the debate over the costs and benefits of increased border security. However, whether and by how much the fence actually reduces migration from Mexico to the U. S. remains an open question. This paper estimates the impact of the fence on migration flows between Mexico and the U. S. and investigates the mechanisms driving observed impacts. To conduct this analysis, I exploit variation in the timing of U. S. government tactical infrastructure investment in fence construction in the period after the passage of the 2006 Secure Fence Act. Using Mexican household survey data and data I collected on border fence construction, I find that construction in a given municipality reduces migration by 39 % from that municipality and by 26 % from adjacent municipalities. I also find evidence that fence construction reduces migration rates for residents of non-border states with historically low access to smugglers by 38 %. Based on these estimates, I calculate that the implied cost of the fence per migrant deterred is $ 4, 800 USD. My findings suggest that fence construction deters migration because the migration costs faced by prospective migrants are sensitive to the particular set of available crossing locations. I derive a simple migration selection model to test this hypothesis and find that a left-censoring of the migration cost distribution, consistent with the disproportionate elimination of low-cost crossing options, best rationalizes evidence on changing migration patterns. The third chapter of this dissertation (coauthored with Erica Field and Rohini Pande) examines the economic returns to social interaction. For this research, microfinance clients were randomly assigned to repayment groups that met either weekly or monthly during their first loan cycle and then graduated to identical meeting frequency for their second loan. Long-run survey data and a follow-up public goods experiment reveal that clients initially assigned to weekly groups interact more often and exhibit a higher willingness to pool risk with group members from their first loan cycle nearly two years after the experiment. They were also three times less likely to default on their second loan. Evidence from an additional treatment arm shows that, holding meeting frequency fixed, the pattern is insensitive to <b>repayment</b> <b>frequency</b> during the first loan cycle. Taken together, these findings constitute the first experimental evidence on the economic returns to social interaction, and provide an alternative explanation for the success of the group lending model in reducing default risk. by Benjamin Feigenberg.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has {{two general}} objectives. The {{first is to}} investigate key factors affecting credit constraints conditions and to assess their effects on farm-households in the hinterland of Kinshasa. The second is to measure the efficiency of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and examine whether or notthe provision of microcredit to farm-households affects thier efficiency scores. Specifically, the dissertation examines the following: the difficulties {{in the provision of}} microcredit towards farm-households, the key drivers affecting the probability that a farm-household is credit-constrained, the production efficiency of farm-households and thier determinants, the impact of credit constraints on the technical and scale efficiency of farm-households, the effects of credit constraints on farm-household welfare distribution and the efficiency of MFIs. Furthermore,it investigates the trade-off between financial sustainability and social performance; and tests whether the provision of agricultural credit affects the efficiency of MFIs. Data used are cross-sectional and collected from households of hinterland of Kinshasa and MFIs operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Probit and logit models are applied to identify household and community characteristics affecting the probability that a farm-household is credit-constrained. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied to measure the technical and scale efficiency of farm-households producing cassava. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) is applied to compute the impact of credit constraints on the efficiency and the welfare of farm-households. Truncated regression (TR) is applied to identify the key drivers of the technical efficiency scores of farm-households. DEA is also applied to compute the efficiency of MFIs, while standard ANOVA and Mann-Whitney tests are applied to investigate whether or not the provision of agricultural microcredit affects the efficiency of MFIs. The results are presented in four core chapters with specific objectives. Chapter three is on the constraints to the financing of agriculture by MFIs and the factors affecting the probability that a farm-household is credit-constrained. The results establish the existence of a high prevalence of credit constraints among farm-households. The findings reveal that short loan terms; frequency of repayment not adapted to farm-households cash flows; lack of collateral requirements; high interest rates and small loan size provided by MFIs are among the key factors explaining a households decision not to apply for a loan. The findings also reveal that low returns and high systemic risks related to the agricultural activities are among factors constraining farm-households participation in microcredit programs. The results of the analysis show also that households are partially or totally rationed because ofinsufficient resources of MFIs. The results from logit and probit models show that household size, association participation, landholding property and remittances are significant covariates associated with credit constraints. This suggests that farm-household capital endowments, providing information on the risk-bearing and repayment capacity, are importantin explaining the probability of being credit-constrained. This findingis convincing evidence that MFIs from hinterland of Kinshasa are not pro-poor and challenges the assumption shared in the dominant literature that MFIs help to correct the imperfections of credit markets by increasing the access to credit of poor households, particularly farm households. Furthermore, this finding contrasts with the outcomes of large microfinance programs developed by NGOs under the welfarist framework, which effectively target the poorest. The fourth chapter estimates the technical and scale efficiency of cassava producing households andthe effect of credit constraints on the efficiency score distribution. This chapter also explores the key drivers affecting differences in terms of technical efficiency score distribution across farm-households. Thefindings reveal that on average, scale efficieny score is three times as big as the technical efficiency score under both Constant Returns to Scale and Variable Returns to Scale assumptions. This suggest that inffeciency in cassava production is more a technical than a scale issue. The results of analysis show that landholding property, formal education of the household, social capital and farm size are important factors increasing technical efficiency score of farm-households. The results of the analysis also show that constraints {{have a negative effect on}} technical efficiency score. However, the effect of credit constraints on scale efficiency score is found to be negative as expected, but the magnitude of causal inference remains non-statistically significant. Fifth chapter examines the effects of credit constraints on farm-household welfare. The findings reveal that, on average, credit constraintssignificantly reduce household food consumption, total expenditure and welfare index (1 USD and 2 USD). This confirms the hypothesis that credit constraints decrease household economic welfare. These results suggest that removing credit constraints among farm-households, for example through the strategy of microfinance, will substantially improve the economicwelfare of households. Thus, it will have a reducing effect on rural poverty by improving food consumption. However, the effect of credit constraints on non-food consumption is found to be negative, but not statistically significant. This insignificant effect of credit constraints on non-food consumption may possibly be due to small loan size and lack of good rural markets and infrastructure. Sixth chapter estimates the efficiency of microfinance organizations operating in the DRC, and tests whether there is a substantial difference in efficiency distribution between MFIs with and without the provision of agricultural credit. The findings reveal that the inefficiency in MFIs from the DRC is more scale inefficiency than technical inefficiency. Furthermore, the results show that many MFIs from the sample are working on the frontier of the double bottom efficiency line, and a higher level of average technical efficiency score in the double bottom efficiency model. This challenges what is often stated in the mainstream literature that social performance and financial sustainability are conflicting objectives. In addition, the results reveal non-substantial difference in efficiency distribution between MFIs with and without the provision of agricultural microcredit. The findings of this dissertation yield some policy implications. The findings imply, among other things, new ways to think about the role of the public sector, donors and traditional financial institutions in financing the small scale and local MFIs as most of them are liquidity-constrained. Lending technology applied in microfinance needs to be adapted to farm-households. Thus, the <b>repayment</b> <b>frequency</b> and loan maturity should be adapted to farm-household cash flows. The collateral should be diversified and extended to non-physical assets,such as land property and social pressure. This requires public interventions to promote social networks and improve farm-household access to landholding property, which will help collaterizing loans, and therefore reducing the risk of being credit-constrained. There is also need for MFIs to set up lending technology and innovations to provide adequate medium and long term credit adapted to the specific needs of agriculture. Toadress the isssue of high risk and low returns of agriculture, there isa need of public policy and investment to increase farmers access to new technology and innovations such as HYV, which will improve agricultural profitability. MFIs, especially NGOs with microcredit program, have an important role to play by providing high yielding input credit and various mechanisms, such as insurance, to cope with risks. Public investment in human capital and social capital is likely to improve agricultural efficiency since the education level of the household head and association participation are found to be positively correlated with the technical efficiency sore of farm-households. Furthermore, public investment with support of donors might create risk-guarantee funds to copewith systemic risk. Finally, the findings of this dissertationyield also some recommendations for further research. It would be important to go deeper, by testing how the profile and performance of MFIs affect the probability that a farm-household is rationed. Further researchmay be needed to examine how institutional design and the logical framework affect the outreach of MFIs and the poors access to microcredit. Research may also be needed to explore the key drivers affecting the efficiency of microfinance. There is need for a better understanding of thiscausal relationship in the dynamic and multivariate perspective, using for example, the panel data from a large geographical area. status: publishe...|$|E
