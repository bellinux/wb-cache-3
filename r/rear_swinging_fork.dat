50|$|BMW {{has been}} an {{innovator}} in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, front suspension by <b>swinging</b> <b>fork</b> (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular <b>swinging</b> <b>fork</b> usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm).Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.|$|R

50|$|<b>Swinging</b> <b>fork</b> - the {{original}} version consisting {{of a pair of}} parallel pipes holding the rear axle at one end and pivoting at the other. A pair of shock absorbers are mounted just before the rear axle and attached to the frame, below the seat rail.|$|R
5000|$|A swingarm, or [...] "swinging arm" [...] (UK), {{originally}} {{known as}} a <b>swing</b> <b>fork</b> or pivoted fork, is {{the main component of}} the rear suspension of most modern motorcycles and ATVs. It is used to hold the rear axle firmly, while pivoting vertically, to allow the suspension to absorb bumps in the road.|$|R
50|$|The Country Buggy {{was based}} on an Australian-made Type 1 {{platform}} with engine, gearbox and front axle from the Type 1. The <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> axles had reduction gears from a 1st generation Volkswagen Transporter (1950-1967).|$|R
5000|$|Orla E. Watson (June 3, 1896 - January 17, 1983) was an American inventor, engineer, and draftsman. He is most {{remembered for}} his {{invention}} of the <b>rear</b> <b>swinging</b> door feature on grocery shopping carts allowing the cart to telescope, or [...] "nest" [...] {{in order to save}} space.|$|R
50|$|Cantilever - An {{extension}} of the <b>swinging</b> <b>fork</b> where a triangulated frame transfers swingarm movement to compress shock absorber/s generally mounted {{in front of the}} swingarm. The HRD-Vincent Motorcycle is a famous early form of this type of swingarm, though Matchless used it earlier, and Yamaha subsequently. The Harley-Davidson Softail is another form of this swingarm, though working in reverse, with the shock absorbers being extended rather than compressed.|$|R
25|$|One year later, {{a revised}} model, called the 6C 2300 B was presented. In this version {{the engine was}} placed in a {{completely}} newly designed chassis, with individual front suspension and <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> axle, and hydraulic brakes. The 6C-2300 was produced in 760 copies with rigid axles and 870 copies of the B-model.|$|R

The frame, <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> arm, <b>rear</b> suspension, seat and front brakes are redesigned from the Suzuki FX125 chassis, making it more aerodynamic.|$|R
50|$|Final {{drive is}} by shaft, {{running from the}} {{transmission}} by universal joint to an oil bath within the right <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> arm and connecting to a bevel gear and ring gear on the other end. Like the /5 models, the /6 models are equipped with telescopic front forks, 12-volt alternator and electrics, and standard tachometer and turn signals.|$|R
50|$|The floorpans {{came from}} the Type 1 Karmann Ghia, which had a wider floorpan than the Beetle. <b>Rear</b> <b>swing</b> axle {{suspension}} with reduction gearing from the discontinued split-screen Volkswagen Transporter was used until 1973, when it was replaced with double-jointed axles used by Porsche and IRS semi-trailing arm setup as used on the 1303 and US-spec Beetles.|$|R
50|$|Final {{drive is}} by shaft, {{running from the}} {{transmission}} by universal joint to an oil bath within the right <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> arm and connecting to a bevel gear and ring gear on the other end.

50|$|The bike had a {{prototype}} sprung frame built under the Bentley and Draper patents. The frame {{as far back}} as the gearbox bracket was normal K. Behind this however is a triangulated tubular <b>swinging</b> <b>fork</b> assembly worked in a trunnion bearing. From the rear fork-ends two seta-stays were pivoted and connected to the sprung part of the frame below the saddle by a system of links and spindles incorporating two coil springs. Friction dampers were fitted to these links and there were also two more at the bottom pivots at the fork-ends.|$|R
50|$|During fishtailing, {{the rear}} end of the car skids to one side, which must be offset by the driver counter-steering, which is turning the front wheels in the same {{direction}} as the skid, (e.g. left if the <b>rear</b> <b>swings</b> left) and reducing engine power. Overcorrection will result in a skid in the opposite direction; hence the name. Without a proper driver's reaction, the fishtailing vehicle will spin completely.|$|R
50|$|Limited edition racing {{homologation}} model. The redesigned engine {{reverted to}} the original long stroke (70 x 48.7 mm) configuration. The crankcase, crankshaft connecting rods and clutch were upgraded {{to serve as a}} ready to race platform. The RR also received new 40 mm Slingshot carbs and 4-into-1 exhaust pipe, close-ratio gearbox, braced <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> arm, single-seat unit and 19 l aluminium fuel tank. Only 150 were sold in US.|$|R
50|$|Some later {{automobile}} <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> axles have {{universal joints}} connecting the driveshafts to the differential, which {{is attached to}} the chassis. They do not have universal joints at the wheels: the wheels are always perpendicular to the driveshafts. Swing axle suspensions traditionally used leaf springs and shock absorbers. It was also used in early aircraft (1910 or before), such as the Sopwith and Fokker, usually with rubber bungee and no damping.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{featured}} a Siemens and Halske-built [...] overhead valve W6 engine, with three banks of paired cylinders, all {{working on a}} common crankshaft. Producing , it was mounted {{just ahead of the}} rear axle. The engine, transmission, and final drive were assembled together and installed as a unit. The <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> axles were suspended by trailing leaf springs, while the front beam axle was suspended by leading leaf springs.|$|R
5000|$|The Tempest {{also used}} a rear transmission, or {{transaxle}} to permit four wheel independent suspension, a flat floor, eliminating the driveshaft hump, for improved interior space, while the Buick Special and Olds F-85 used a conventional front engine/front transmission drivetrain. * The Tempest also used an independent <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> axle suspension {{similar to the}} rear-engine Chevy Corvair while the Buick and Olds compacts featured a conventional rear coil spring suspension.|$|R
5000|$|Launched in 1951 the Mk II had a [...] engine, {{giving an}} extra , and {{strengthened}} bearings. Sales remained poor, however, {{and the company}} had to reduce the price. The clutch was upgraded, and an Amal 363 monobloc carburetor replaced the standard unit. The <b>rear</b> <b>swinging</b> arm was uprated with cast aluminium to improve rigidity, and the brakes were improved. The petrol tank capacity was also increased from 1.25 to 1.62 imp gal.|$|R
50|$|The Lambert {{automobile}} chassis {{with the}} gearless friction drive speed change transmission {{was the basis}} for the Lambert automobiles and trucks built from 1906 through 1916. The valve action of the engines were hardened steel cams that were applied to the cam shaft. The cam faces were slightly convex, and worked on hardened rollers, carried in <b>swinging</b> <b>forks,</b> which bore against square ended sliders. The valves were alumimum heads driven to shoulder on riveted steel stems. The valve action was direct with no side action on the sliders. The compression was between 50 to 55 pounds of pressure.|$|R
5000|$|The BSA {{designers}} {{made the}} design {{a mirror image}} with right hand side controls and Imperial fixings for manufacture in Birmingham. This original Bantam, the D1, was released in October 1948 and continued in production for several years. It had telescopic forks, a rigid rear end, direct electrics, shovel front-mudguard and fishtail silencer, was available only in [...] "mist green" [...] and sold for Â£60 plus tax. Although the frame changed out of recognition (beginning with conversion to plunger and then <b>swinging</b> <b>fork</b> <b>rear</b> suspension), the engine remained a recognizable development of the original for the entire 23 years of production.|$|R
50|$|The {{entire body}} (with {{exception}} of the front forks, crash rails and legshields) was produced in cast aluminium, with {{the front and rear}} castings bolted to the engine to form a monocoque which resulted in a light and rigid construction. The <b>rear</b> <b>swinging</b> arm, chaincase and silencer box were also constructed in cast aluminium. These models originally HAD 8 inch wheels, but by 1958 they reverted to 10 inch which gave a better stability and ground clearance.|$|R
50|$|Announced in October 1958, {{this model}} was wider and longer than its forebears and {{differed}} structurally {{in that the}} <b>rear</b> <b>swinging</b> arms were lower and external to the body, and the spare wheel was mounted {{at the rear of}} the car. The type reference is supposed to be SE492/4 but one has the reference B.100. The chassis numbers are D1/1 to D1/19 but then again one example has D1/100, this particular car could be the prototype since it appears in publicity pictures.|$|R
50|$|The 120 series {{cars were}} {{equipped}} with a six-cylinder in-line engine (as opposed to the four-cylinder Steyr 100) driving the rear wheels via a four-speed transmission. Front wheels had a transverse leaf spring suspension while the <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> axle was mounted on quarter-elliptic leaf springs. On the four-door sedan model the rear doors were hinged at the back-end (known as suicide doors), allowing the B-pillar to be omitted. By 1936 a total of 1200 Steyr 120 Super had been produced.|$|R
5000|$|Leedskalnin {{named his}} new place [...] "Rock Gate" [...] after the huge <b>rear</b> <b>swinging</b> gate he {{built into the}} back wall. He {{continued}} {{to work on the}} castle up until his death in 1951. The coral pieces {{that are part of the}} newer castle, not among those transported from the original location, were quarried on the property only a few feet away from the castle's walls. The pool and the pit beside the southern wall are quarries. The east and west quarries have been filled in.|$|R
50|$|Aerodynamics {{played an}} {{important}} role in the 2497 pound car's speed. Unlike many cars of the 1950s, steering was relatively precise and the four-wheel independent suspension allowed for a reasonably comfortable ride and markedly better overall handling. However, the <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> axle, jointed only at the differential, not at the wheels themselves, could be treacherous at high speeds or on imperfect roads due to extreme changes in camber. The enormous fuel tank capacity also caused a considerable difference in handling depending on the quantity of fuel on board.|$|R
50|$|Owing to its {{overwhelming}} success, {{many different}} manufacturers desired to produce shopping carts with the <b>rear</b> <b>swinging</b> door feature but were denied {{due to the}} exclusive license issued to Goldman. The federal government {{filed a lawsuit against}} Telescope Carts, Inc. in 1950 alleging the exclusive license granted to Goldman was invalid, and a Consent Decree was entered into where Telescope Carts, Inc. agreed to offer the same license to any manufacturer. Orla Watson and Telescope Carts, Inc. licensed their telescoping shopping cart design to several manufacturers throughout the 1950s and 1960s until the patent expired.|$|R
5000|$|This luxury vehicle had a {{water-cooled}} six-cylinder OHC engine with {{a capacity}} of 3406 cc and brakepower of [...] The engine camshaft was driven by a Bevel, which gave power to multiple dry clutch discs and a 4-speed gearbox to the rear wheels. The achievable maximum speed of this approximately 2400 kg car was 110 km/h. The chassis had a central tube construction; the foreground is a rigid axle with overhead Transverse leaf spring and a <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> axle with half transverse leaf springs was installed. The wheels were designed as slices.|$|R
5000|$|Aerodynamics {{played an}} {{important}} role in the car's speed, with Mercedes-Benz engineers placing horizontal [...] "eyebrows" [...] over the wheel openings to reduce drag. Unlike many cars of the 1950s, steering was relatively precise and the four-wheel independent suspension allowed for a reasonably comfortable ride and markedly better overall handling. However, the <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> axle, jointed only at the differential, not at the wheels themselves, could be treacherous at high speeds or on imperfect roads due to extreme changes in camber. The enormous fuel tank capacity also caused a considerable difference in handling depending on the quantity of fuel on board.|$|R
5000|$|Designed by Roy Fedden, {{assisted}} by Alec Moulton, Ian Duncan, Peter Ware, and Gordon Wilkins, the styling resembled the contemporary Jowett Javelin, with a sloping rear, four doors, seating for six, and rear spats. The design {{drew inspiration from}} the Volkswagen Type 1, including the rear-mounted engine and <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> axle suspension. The car was powered by a horizontally-mounted [...] sleeve valve three-cylinder air-cooled radial engine, which had the carburettor between the rear window and the passenger compartment. The engine sat over the torque converter and rear axle, which contributed to a high center of gravity and a tendency to skid.|$|R
50|$|The 6C 2300 (2309 cc) was {{designed}} by Vittorio Jano as a lower-cost alternative to the 8C. In 1934 Alfa Romeo had become a state-owned enterprise. This year was presented a new 6C model with a newly designed, larger engine. Chassis technology, however, {{had been taken from}} the predecessor.One year later, a revised model, called the 6C 2300 B was presented. In this version the engine was placed in a completely newly designed chassis, with individual front suspension and <b>rear</b> <b>swing</b> axle, and hydraulic brakes. The 6C-2300 was produced in 760 copies with rigid axles and 870 copies of the B-model.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962 the motocarro AIACE {{appeared}} as a cheap means of transport for urban distribution. He was equipped with the engine of Moto Guzzi Zigolo 110, a small tweetaktje [...] He had a cabin with no doors where the engine was mounted behind. Therefore, the drive could be made directly from the three- speed gearbox with integrated differential [...] Of course, {{there was also a}} reverse gear on board. The driver had a motorcycle handlebars and there was a <b>swing</b> <b>fork</b> used. Were behind hydraulic shock absorbers [...] Without cab and superstructure AIACE cost 164,000 lire, built completely was the price 243,000 lira. It was not a success: in 1963, production was again stopped, but there were still two 50cc successors: the Dingotre and Furghino.|$|R
