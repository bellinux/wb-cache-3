40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Deep convolutional network model for Identity-Aware Transfer (DIAT) of facial attributes. Given the source input {{image and the}} reference attribute, DIAT aims to generate a facial image (i. e., target image) that not only owns the reference attribute but also keep the same or similar identity to the input image. We develop a two-stage scheme to transfer the input image to each reference attribute label. A feed-forward transform network is first trained by combining perceptual identity-aware loss and GAN-based attribute loss, and a face enhancement network is then introduced to improve the visual quality. We further define perceptual identity loss on the convolutional feature maps of the attribute discriminator, resulting in a DIAT-A model. Our DIAT and DIAT-A models can provide a unified solution for several representative facial attribute transfer tasks such as expression transfer, accessory <b>removal,</b> <b>age</b> progression, and gender transfer. The experimental results validate their effectiveness. Even for some identity-related attribute (e. g., gender), our DIAT-A can obtain visually impressive results by changing the attribute while retaining most identity features of the source image...|$|E
40|$|Mathematical models, that {{depict the}} {{dynamics}} of a cancer cell population growing out {{of the human body}} (in vitro) in unconstrained microenvironment conditions, are considered in this thesis. Cancer cells in vitro grow and divide much faster than cancer cells in the human body, therefore, the effects of various cancer treatments applied to them can be identified much faster. These cell populations, when not exposed to any cancer treatment, exhibit exponential growth that we refer to as the balanced exponential growth (BEG) state. This observation has led to several effective methods of estimating parameters that thereafter are not required to be determined experimentally. We present derivation of the age-structured model and its theoretical analysis of the existence of the solution. Furthermore, we have obtained the condition for BEG existence using the Perron- Frobenius theorem. Amathematical description of the cell-cycle control is shown for one-compartment and two-compartment populations, where a compartment refers to a cell population consisting of cells that exhibit similar kinetic properties. We have incorporated into our mathematical model the required growing/aging times in each phase of the cell cycle for the biological viability. Moreover, we have derived analytical formulae for vital parameters in cancer research, such as population doubling time, the average cell-cycle age, and the average <b>removal</b> <b>age</b> from all phases, which we argue is the average cell-cycle time of the population. An estimate of the average cell-cycle time is of a particular interest for biologists and clinicians, and for patient survival prognoses as it is considered that short cell-cycle times correlate with poor survival prognoses for patients. Applications of our mathematical model to experimental data have been shown. First, we have derived algebraic expressions to determine the population doubling time from single experimental observation as an alternative to empirically constructed growth curve. This result is applicable to various types of cancer cell lines. One option to extend this model would be to derive the cellcycle time from a single experimental measurement. Second, we have applied our mathematical model to interpret and derive dynamic-depicting parameters of five melanoma cell lines exposed to radiotherapy. The mathematical result suggests there are shortcomings in the experimental methods and provides an insight into the cancer cell population dynamics during post radiotherapy. Finally, a mathematical model depicting a theoretical cancer cell population that comprises two sub-populations with different kinetic properties is presented to describe the transition of a primary culture to a cell line cell population...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of San Bernardino County’s Family Visitation Centers (FVC) and their effect on improving rates of reunification in families that use the visit centers, as opposed to those families who do not use the visit centers. The FVC were developed out of the Department Human Services Redesign to enhance the visitation experience for families, staff and others involved in the process. The FVC centers are a place to provide safe visits, in a non-sterile environment, for children to maintain the bonds with their parents that they have been removed from by child welfare while in a reunification process. The County of San Bernardino has invested approximately 1. 9 million dollars annually into the FVC’s, and to date, there has not been a clear evaluation as to the effectiveness in reunifying families faster with usage of the FVC. The researchers used a descriptive statistical approach to examine the effect FVC’s has on the reunification process. The research methods used were quantitative in design and included comparative research, looking both at the results of clients use and non-use of the FVC’s. Data was collected February 2017. The size of our sample was ninety cases that used the FVC, and ninety families that did not use the center in the same regions, but were participating in visits and in reunification services, 180 families in total. To ensure that a random sample was used, a third-party person collected statistical information from Case Management System/Child Welfare System (CMS/CWS). The list was composed from preselected data included in the San Bernardino County Visitation Center Instrument. The variables used included families that were in the reunification process and having visits either at a CFS office or at the FVC, primary and secondary reason for <b>removal,</b> <b>age</b> of youngest child, age of parent, race/ethnicity, if a visit occurred and number of months in placement. Data was collected using every fifth family was selected, the researchers received a list, with only the above pertinent information for each of the families. The researchers did not need any Protected Identifying Information (PII) and no human subjects were used. All items related to the research was maintained in electronic form on password protected computers and was only calculated and read in a protected area. The hope of this research project was to find out if the money being invested in the FVC was working toward returning children in shorter time frames, than the traditional way of handling visits within the county at the CFS offices. Results from this study could change things dramatically within CFS. Positive outcomes could allow for more outside contracted agencies to be used to promote faster reunification, while lightening the duties of the social worker. Negative results could result in the FVC losing funding, the department would go back to supervising the visits within the offices, many social worker hours would be used supervising visits, the visit could be affected by the presence of the social worker. The outcomes could change business on a daily basis for the department or FVC in that, adjustments may need to be made, and provide a different standard of ideology of what visitation should be for families that are trying to work through their case plans to reunify with their children. This study found families who used visitation centers had longer placement episodes lengths than non-visitation center users. This outcome is contrary to our assumption, use of visitation centers help families reunify in less tim...|$|E

Apoptotic cells develop dramatic morphological changes including contraction, membrane blebbing and apoptotic body formation, which were among the first and most readily identifiable features of cellular suicide. However, understanding the purpose of apoptotic cell morphological changes has proven to be elusive, and recent studies have made somewhat surprising, and occasionally opposing, conclusions about the contribution of blebbing to phagocytic clearance and prevention of inflammatory/autoimmune disease.
