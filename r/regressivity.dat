In other words, if the activity being taxed {{is more likely to be}} carried out by the poor and less likely to be carried out by the rich, the tax may be considered regressive. To measure the effect, the income elasticity of the good being taxed as well as the income substitution effect must be considered. The measure can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2004, a {{commission}} established {{to study the}} state's tax structure criticized the Hall income tax as regressive, anti-competitive, and [...] "unfairly selective." [...] Not all analysts agree about the tax’s <b>regressivity,</b> however. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) {{has found that the}} Hall Tax is actually the only major progressive tax levied in Tennessee—amounting to 0.4 percent of income for high-income taxpayers compared to 0.0 - 0.1 percent for less affluent Tennesseans. The Tennessee Tax Structure Study Commission characterized the tax as [...] "particularly harmful to retirees with limited income derived mainly from investments," [...] noting in its final report that low-income retirees with dividend and interest income pay the tax, but low-income people with income from other sources do not. The commission's report also asserted that the Hall tax [...] "effective (sic) encourages retirees to leave the State." [...] The commission recommended repealing the Hall income tax, reducing or repealing certain other state taxes, and enacting a general personal income tax in their place. Other critics have suggested that the tax discourages people from saving and hinders efforts to encourage retirees to settle in Tennessee. Organizations including the League of Women Voters of Tennessee and Tennesseans for Fair Taxation have endorsed the repeal of the Hall income tax as part of comprehensive tax reform that includes implementation of a broad-based personal income tax. In its [...] "Legislator's Guide to the Issues" [...] issued in 2009 and 2011, the Tennessee Center for Policy Research called the 6 percent rate [...] "sizeable" [...] and said the tax [...] "makes Tennessee an unwelcoming place, particularly for retirees and the wealthy." [...] The organization advocated repealing the tax [...] "to encourage wealthy and retired individuals to move to Tennessee" [...] and cutting state spending to offset the lost revenue.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{progressive}} public {{intellectuals and}} prominent scholars have asserted that monopoly power {{lies at the}} root of wealth inequality and that increases in antitrust enforcement are necessary to stem its rising tide. This claim is misguided. Exercises of market power have complex, crosscutting effects that undermine the generality of the monopoly <b>regressivity</b> claim. Contrary to what the <b>regressivity</b> critics assume, wealthy shareholders and senior corporate executives do not capture the preponderance of monopoly rents. Such profits are broadly shared within and dissipated outside the firm. Further, many of the subjects of antitrust law are middle-class professionals, sole proprietors, or small business owners who extract rents from households above them in the income distribution. On the consumer side, the monopoly <b>regressivity</b> claim is confounded by the fact that large swaths of overcharged goods and services are purchased by government buyers or third-party healthcare payers, who pass on the incidence of the overcharge progressively, or by other corporate buyers who absorb a share of the overcharge. Even as to household spending, exercises of monopoly power may have progressive wealth redistribution effects to the extent that market power facilitates progressive price discrimination. Finally, antitrust law sometimes stymies private efforts to redistribute income, further casting doubt on the generality of the monopoly <b>regressivity</b> claim...|$|E

The paper focuses on 'impact effects' and does not account for behavioral responses. However, special emphasis is placed on lifetime incidence. The results suggest that, compared with a tax on food which is the most regressive of all consumption taxes, the impact effects on income distribution of introducing a tax on domestic fuel are likely to be small.

40|$|A {{behavioural}} {{analysis of}} the distributional impacts of tax policy and public spending shows that the Brazilian tax system has remained quite regressive, and, as an innovation, there have been gains, some quite significant, in the progressivity of social spending. While, in 2003, the progressivity of social spending moderately compensated for the <b>regressivity</b> of the tax system, in 2009, {{with the increase in}} social spending and the deepening of its progressivity, its distributional effects have overcome the concentrating impact of collection. The <b>regressivity</b> of the Brazilian tax system — that is, the excessive burden that taxes have on the income of the poor and the intermediate income strata of the population — is due to indirect taxes or, more specifically, their magnitude. Such <b>regressivity</b> in indirect taxation does not clash with the international reality, but the burden of indirect taxes in tax collection enhances its income concentration effect. In turn, the progressivity of direct taxation is relatively high; however, the distributional effect is attenuated b...|$|E
40|$|We analyse the {{distributional}} {{impact of}} financing {{energy and environmental}} policies through additional charges on electricity consumption, focussing on the impact Ireland’s flat-rate Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy has on domestic consumers. Switching Ireland’s flate-rate charge to a unit-based charge results in reduced <b>regressivity</b> across the entire income distribution. A unit-based scheme reduces aggregate burden for most households on low incomes. Regressive impacts are greater for a subset of heavy electricity users. Incremental block pricing (IBP) exaggerates these effects. A hybrid fixed/variable structure mitigates <b>regressivity</b> for high users but lessens overall <b>regressivity</b> reduction. Redistribution via Ireland’s Household Benefits Package is sub-optimal relative to a hypothetical equivalised income-based scheme. Net of ‘merit order’ savings, flat charges redistribute burden incidence from rich to poor whilst fixed per-unit charges have a neutral effect.

40|$|The Pigou-Dalton {{principle}} {{demands that}} a regressive transfer decreases social welfare. In the unidimensional setting this principle is consistent, because <b>regressivity</b> {{in terms of}} attribute amounts and <b>regressivity</b> in terms of individual well-being coincide {{in the case of}} a single attribute. In the multidimensional setting, however, the relationship between the various attributes and well-being is complex. To formulate a multidimensional Pigou-Dalton transfer principle, a concept of wellbeing must therefore first be defined. We propose a version of the Pigou-Dalton principle that defines <b>regressivity</b> in terms of the individual well-being ranking that underlies the social ranking on which the principle is imposed. This well-being ranking (of attribute bundles) is induced from the social ranking over distributions in which all individuals have the same attribute bundle. It is shown that this new principle—the consistent Pigou-Dalton principle—imposes a quasi-linear structure on the well-being ranking.

Wealth is identified by property value, income and a range of socio-economic variables collected from the most recent New Zealand Census before the earthquake series. In explaining EQC total dwelling payout by property value and by these socio-economic variables, the research shows there is a distributional implication to EQC’s building cover.

40|$|This paper investigates {{sales tax}} inequities {{from a new}} perspective: by house-Abstract hold heads ’ age groups and income classes. With income constant, spending{{variations}} exist due to family head’s age, just as variations exist due to familysize. This study examines effective rates (and composite burden indices) for three age groups over ten income classes, computed by applying food-exempt and food-taxed structures. There is evidence of vertical and horizontal in-eguities for various age groups, though such inequities are reduced when food is exempt. An important policy implication is that food exemption (or tax credit) can mitigate both types of inequities for different age groups, an argument already well established concerning family sizes. This paper investigates sales tax burden differentials forconsumers who are distinguished primarily according to age groups of the family heads and income classes.

40|$|Value added tax (VAT) {{is often}} {{described}} as a regressive tax because it taxes consumption, and the propensity to consume tends to decrease as income rises. Countries that maintain progressive tax systems take several measures to remove the <b>regressivity</b> of VAT. These measures include (i) exempting food and social necessities and (ii) taxing luxuries at high rates and necessities at low rates. VAT of the subtraction type has two main variants, namely the tax credit method and the subtraction method.

However, in cases where multiple rates and exemptions 3 are implemented, these two types of VAT no longer have the same effects on a firm’s liability for VAT and a firm’s decision on price.

40|$|This paper proposes {{and tests}} a better defined {{interpretation}} of the different responses of gasoline demand to tax changes and to market-related price changes. Namely, the signaling effect of gasoline taxes is one that impacts on long-run consumer decisions {{in addition to the}} incentives provided by tax-inclusive gasoline prices. Our hypothesis is tested using a complete demand system augmented with information on gasoline taxes and fitted to household-level data from the 2006 to 2013 rounds of the US Consumer Expenditure survey. Information on gasoline taxes is found to be a significant determinant of household demand additional to tax-inclusive gasoline prices. The equity implications are examined by contrasting the incidence across income distribution of a simulated $ 0. 22 /gallon tax increase to that of a market-related price increase equal in size. The tax increase is clearly regressive, slightly more than the market-related price increase. However, <b>regressivity</b> {{is by no means a}} reason to give up gasoline taxes as an instrument for reducing gasoline consumption externalities. Their high effectiveness in reducing gasoline demand implies that small tax increases can substantially improve the environment while minimizing the related distributional effects.
