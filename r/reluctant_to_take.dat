5|$|People {{with cancer}} may not report pain due to costs of {{treatment}}, {{a belief that}} pain is inevitable, an aversion to treatment side effects, fear of developing addiction or tolerance, fear of distracting the doctor from treating the illness, or fear of masking a symptom that is important for monitoring progress of the illness. People may be <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> adequate pain medicine because they are unaware of their prognosis, or may be unwilling to accept their diagnosis. Failure to report pain or misguided reluctance to take pain medicine can be overcome by sensitive coaching.|$|E

5|$|Chosen to play Quatermass was the {{distinguished}} actor John Mills, who {{had appeared in}} significant roles in many high-profile British films, including The Way to the Stars (1945), Great Expectations (1946) and Ice Cold in Alex (1958), and had won an Academy Award {{for his role in}} Ryan's Daughter (1970). Mills, whose only previous television credit at the time was The Zoo Gang (1974), was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the part but was convinced by his wife, who liked the script. Following Quatermass he appeared in Gandhi (1982), Martin Chuzzlewit (1994) and Hamlet (1997), working right up to his death in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The {{murder of}} the pacifist Overhill chiefs under a flag of truce angered the entire Cherokee nation.

Not only did the Cherokee from the Overhill Towns join those from the Lower Towns on the warpath, so too did {{a large number of}} Muscogee warriors, outraged at the senseless murders.|$|R
5|$|In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Minister for Defence Kim Beazley {{decided to}} {{transfer}} {{all of the}} RAAF's Iroquois and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time. The transfer of the RAAF's other helicopter types increased {{the cost to the}} service of operating the Chinooks, and made it more difficult to find aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF subsequently proposed transferring the Chinooks as well, but the Army was unwilling to accept them. The problems the Army was experiencing keeping the Iroquois and Black Hawk helicopters operational may have influenced this position, with the service being <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on an even more complex helicopter type.|$|E
5|$|Michelangelo, {{who was not}} {{primarily}} a painter but a sculptor, was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on the work. Also, he was occupied with a very large sculptural commission for the pope's own tomb. The pope was adamant, leaving Michelangelo {{no choice but to}} accept. But a war with the French broke out, diverting the attention of the pope, and Michelangelo fled from Rome to continue sculpting. The tomb sculptures, however, were never to be finished because in 1508 the pope returned to Rome victorious and summoned Michelangelo to begin work on the ceiling. The contract was signed on 10 May 1508.|$|E

When published, {{the book was}} quite exceptional for it uncharacteristically dealt with the analysis and criticism of another Maltese philosopher, and a living one at that. Apart from Angelo Pirotta's investigation into the philosophy of Anastasio Cuschieri in the early 20th century, it seems that Maltese philosophers are <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> so <b>take</b> on, at least so directly, other living philosophers (or even dead ones, for that matter).

5|$|Only {{recently}} {{promoted to}} {{general manager of}} the New Jersey system, Stanley had been <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the position in London and took it for one year only, provided he would be free to return to America {{at the end of the}} year. He told the company's senior managers that the company was almost bankrupt and got resignation letters from each of them post-dated by six months. Through better integration of the separate companies within the group and by improving advertising and public relations, he was quickly able to turn the fortunes of the company around, while the company's chairman, Sir Edgar Speyer, renegotiated the debt repayments. In 1908, Stanley joined the company's board and, in 1910, he became the managing director.|$|E
5|$|By William's death, after {{weathering}} {{a series}} of rebellions, most of the native Anglo-Saxon aristocracy {{had been replaced by}} Norman and other continental magnates. Not all of the Normans who accompanied William in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in England. Some appear to have been <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up lands in a kingdom that did not always appear pacified. Although some of the newly rich Normans in England came from William's close family or from the upper Norman nobility, others were from relatively humble backgrounds. William granted some lands to his continental followers from the holdings of one or more specific Englishmen; at other times, he granted a compact grouping of lands previously held by many different Englishmen to one Norman follower, often to allow for the consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle.|$|E
5|$|Everton were {{a declining}} force, and {{finished}} 12th {{in the league}} in 1991–92 whilst exiting both the FA Cup and League Cup at the Fourth Round. They then finished 13th in the 1992–93 season in the newly created Premier League, just four points above the relegation zone. Kendall resigned mid-way through the 1993–94 campaign and was replaced by Mike Walker – Southall later described Walker as a man who loved his suntan more than football. Walker oversaw a run of bad results and Everton only escaped relegation with a final day victory over Wimbledon, winning 3–2 after turning round a 2–0 deficit. Southall saw that his teammates were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a penalty in the match and so took the ball himself before Graham Stuart plucked up the courage to take the ball from him and convert the penalty.|$|E

Their {{families}} {{meet at the}} engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends Imran (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each of them will have to pick an adventure sport which all three will try together. Initially, Arjun is <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> trip as {{he does not want}} to lose his pay for missing work. It is later revealed that Arjun's former girlfriend left him due to his workaholism and his obsession with money. Imran has an additional secret agenda on the trip, to find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain, about whom he learnt soon after the death of his step-father.|$|E
5|$|The {{minister}} Bernardo Monteagudo {{was removed}} from office by a Peruvian rebellion, during San Martín's absence. San Martín resigned as Protector of Peru {{a few days later}} and returned to Valparaíso, Chile. Several reasons influenced him to resign. The military discipline of the Army of the Andes was compromised, but San Martín was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> drastic action against his officers. The authority of San Martín and Bolívar, and the local rivalry of their respective countries Peru and Colombia, limited their options for joint work: Colombians would not have liked Bolívar to give many of his forces to San Martín, whilst Peruvians would not have liked their Protector to be second in command to Bolívar, and a joint command would complicate the maintenance of military discipline. Unlike Bolívar, backed up by the Colombian government, San Martín did not have more resources than those he already had: Buenos Aires denied him any support, the other Argentine governors (such as Juan Bautista Bustos) supported him but did not have resources to provide, O'Higgins was about to be deposed in Chile, and Cochrane took the navy and left him without naval power. Finally, he felt that only a very strong authority would be able to prevent balkanization, but refused to rule as a dictator himself.|$|E
5|$|The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to {{play and}} coach in India {{in the winter of}} 1927–28. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was very <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up the {{invitation}} and hesitated before accepting. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggest this triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire team mates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspiration while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed. He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in {{the first few days of}} April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from enteric fever in the presence of his wife.|$|E

50|$|Ted Baryluk's Grocery is a 1982 short {{documentary}} about Ukrainian-Canadian Ted Baryluk's {{grocery store in}} Winnipeg's North End. Co-directed by John Paskievich and Michael Mirus and produced by the National Film Board of Canada, the film consists of Baryluk talking about his store, his customers and the changes in his neighbourhood, set against Paskievich's black and white still photography. It also chronicles his efforts <b>to</b> convince a <b>reluctant</b> daughter <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the business, despite her fears about the store's unruly clientele.

30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that unemployed persons {{are more willing to}} accept such hypothetical job offers than employed persons. Moreover, we did not find substantial differences in the way unemployed individuals evaluate the characteristics of interregional job offers compared with their employed counterparts. The only difference found was that unemployed persons were more likely to accept short-term contracts than employed persons. Otherwise, neither job characteristics, such as length of employment, nor moving conditions, such as the distance from the current residence, were evaluated differently by the two groups. With respect to the effect of increasing unemployment duration on job offer acceptance, we found no evidence for increasing willingness to accept jobs with unfavourable characteristics over time. On the contrary, long-term unemployed individuals seemed discouraged by demanding jobs and more <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> relocate <b>to</b> <b>take</b> non-permanent jobs than individuals who had been unemployed for shorter periods of time. In addition, the factors that indicated the costs and risks related to household relocation seemed to pose greater impediments for the long-term unemployed. However, evidence for this observation is weak and may suffer from the explicit oversampling of unemployment benefit II recipients in the PASS survey, which have predominantly long unemployment durations of one year or more.|$|R
