40|$|Abstract: In next {{generation}} heterogeneous wireless networks, a user with a multi-mode terminal {{may have different}} bearer services using different access technologies. Various approaches {{can be applied to}} improve user QoS, such as bandwidth degradation for real-time services, integration of <b>real-time</b> and <b>data</b> traffic, and overflow traffic in overlay networks. In this paper, new techniques are derived to analyse <b>real-time</b> and <b>data</b> traffic performances in wireless networks, revealing the different influences of mobility on <b>real-time</b> and <b>data</b> traffic. In addition, simulations have been carried out to study the performance of the joint allocation and overflow control of <b>real-time</b> and <b>data</b> traffic. A simple bearer service allocation policy is proposed, which not only maximizes network capacity and increases user QoS, but also simplifies overflow management...|$|R

This RTIS can also deduce the travel {{times on the}} other road links without <b>real-time</b> AVI <b>data.</b> The travel times, in RTIS, are estimated by the <b>real-time</b> AVI <b>data,</b> the off-line travel time estimates and the related spatial variance-covariance relationships between road links. The <b>real-time</b> AVI <b>data</b> adopted for RTIS are Autotoll tag data in Hong Kong; whereas the off-line link travel time estimates and their spatial variance-covariance matrices are obtained from a traffic flow simulator. By integration of these real-time and off-line traffic data together, the travel times on the road links either with or without <b>real-time</b> AVI <b>data</b> can be updated at 5 -min intervals. Validation of journey time estimates is carried out at various selected paths in Hong Kong urban area.

25|$|The {{previously}} announced mission {{end date}} of July 1, 2008, {{came and went}} but mission operations continued albeit in a reduced capacity. The availability of science data gathering was limited to only when Ulysses was in contact with a ground station due to the deteriorating S-band downlink margin no longer being able to support simultaneous <b>real-time</b> <b>data</b> and tape recorder playback. When the spacecraft was out of contact with a ground station, the S-band transmitter was switched off and the power was diverted to the internal heaters {{to add to the}} warming of the hydrazine. On June 30, 2009, ground controllers sent commands to switch to the low gain antennas. This stopped communications with the spacecraft, in combination with previous the commands to set the shut down of its transmitter entirely.|$|E
25|$|Video game {{rehabilitation}}, {{also known}} as gaming rehabilitation {{is a process of}} using common video game consoles and methodology to target and improve physical and mental weaknesses through therapeutic processes. Platforms that feature motion control, notably the Nintendo Wii, Microsoft's Xbox Kinect, and Sony's Eye Toy, and virtual reality scenarios have all been effective in this field of research. Methodologies have been applied to all age groups, ranging from toddler to elderly aged people worldwide and have been used in a variety of cases ranging from stroke rehabilitation, cerebral palsy and other neurological impairments, to people with tendinitis and multiple sclerosis. Researchers have promoted such technology based on the personalization of gaming systems to patients which allows for further engagement and interaction. Additionally, gaming consoles have the ability to capture <b>real-time</b> <b>data</b> and provide instant feedback to the patients using the systems. Currently, several researchers have performed case studies to demonstrate the benefits of this technology, however, repeat trials and experiments have shown that outcomes are easily replicated among several groups worldwide. Additionally, the outcomes have increased interest in the field, growing experiments beyond simple case studies to experiments with larger participant basis.|$|E
