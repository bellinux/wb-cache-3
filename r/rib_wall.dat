40|$|Vehicular {{tyre tread}} and {{footprint}} characteristics {{have been investigated}} {{from the point of}} view of tyre design and manufacturing and dynamic vehicle analysis, as well as for pavement design and analysis. From these analyses, it has become clear that typical commercial truck tyres do not exhibit a uniform pressure over the footprint area. Instead, a highly non-uniform pressure distribution is observed depending on tyre type, internal pressure, axle load, etc. Nevertheless, such analyses are generally related to rigid driving surfaces, but commercial vehicles also frequently cross bridges, where the driving surface is much more flexible. Indeed, the flexibility of a steel deck will change the footprint characteristics due to the adaptation of the contact surface to the presence of more and less rigid areas. In this paper, the pressure distribution under a truck tyre when crossing a bridge with a steel orthotropic bridge deck is investigated. The contact pressure is measured by an 8. 4 mm-resolution pressure mat in between a common widebase tyre and an orthotropic bridge deck test specimen. Comparisons are made with existing literature for rigid surfaces, especially the analyses of R Blab at Berkeley, in order to investigate the influence of the tyre pressure, total applied load and the transverse position relative to the rib walls on the pressure distribution. The results indicate that the transverse positioning does indeed affect the pressure distribution, as the stiffer <b>rib</b> <b>wall</b> attracts a larger part of the load. Consequently, uniform pressure loads overestimate plate bending for loads in between the rib walls and underestimate plate bending for loads over the rib walls. In this way, the detailed non-destructive pressure distribution analysis has contributed to a better understanding of failure analysis, especially at the rib-to-deckplate connection, of steel bridge decks...|$|E

Pitch-to-rib height ratios (P/e) of 5 and 10 at constant rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio (e/D) of 0. 1 and a clearance ratio (C/e) of 0. 38 are considered. The rib angle of attack with respect to mainstream flow is 90 ∘. The channel orientation at which the <b>ribbed</b> <b>wall</b> becomes trailing surface (pressure side on which the Coriolis force acts) is considered as the 0 ∘ orientation angle. For one-wall ribbed case, channel is oriented from 0 ∘ to 180 ∘ about its axis in steps of 30 ∘ to change the orientation angle. For two-wall ribbed case, the orientation angle is changed from 0 ∘ to 90 ∘ in steps of 30 ∘. Friction factors for the detached ribbed channels are compared with the corresponding attached ribbed channel. It is found that in one-wall detached ribbed channel, increase in the friction factor ratio with the orientation angle is lower for rectangular channel compared to that of square channel for both the pitch-to-rib height ratios of 5 and 10 at a given Reynolds number and rotation number.

40|$|The {{vortical}} {{structure of}} a plane impinging jet is considered. The jet was locked both in phase and laterally in space, and time series digital particle image velocimetry measurements were made both of the jet exiting the nozzle and as it impinged on a perpendicular wall. Iso-vorticity and iso-lambda (2) surfaces coupled with critical point theory were used to identify and clarify structure. The flow near the nozzle was much as observed in mixing layers, where the shear layer evolves into spanwise rollers, only here the rollers occurred symmetrically about the jet midplane. Accordingly the rollers were seen to depict spanwise perturbations with the wavelength of flutes at the nozzle edge and were connected, {{on the same side}} of the jet, with streamwise 2 ̆ 7 successive ribs 2 ̆ 7 of the same wavelength. This wavelength was 0. 71 of the distance between rollers and, contrary to some experiments in mixing layers, did not double when the rollers paired. Structures not reported previously but evident here with iso-vorticity, lambda (2) and critical point theory are 2 ̆ 7 cross ribs 2 ̆ 7, which extend from the downstream side of each roller to its counterpart across the symmetry plane; their spanwise periodic spacing exceeds that of successive ribs by a factor of three. Cross ribs stretch because of the diverging flow as the rollers approach the wall and move apart, causing the vorticity within them to intensify. This process continues until the cross <b>ribs</b> reach the <b>wall</b> and merge with 2 ̆ 7 <b>wall</b> <b>ribs</b> 2 ̆ 7. <b>Wall</b> <b>ribs</b> remain near the wall throughout the cycle and are composed of vorticity of the same sign as the cross ribs, but the intensity level of the vorticity within them is cyclic. Details of the expansion of fluid elements, evaluated from the rate of strain tenser, revealed that both cross and successive ribs align with the principal axis and that the vorticity comprising them is continuously amplified by stretching. It is further shown, by appeal to the production terms of the phase-averaged vorticity equation, that <b>wall</b> <b>ribs</b> are sustained by merging and stretching rather than reorientation of vorticity. Moreover production of vorticity is a maximum when cross and <b>wall</b> <b>ribs</b> merge and is greatest near the symmetry plane of the jet. The demise of successive ribs on the other hand occurs away from the symmetry plane and would appear to be less important dynamically than cross <b>ribs</b> merging with <b>wall</b> <b>ribs...</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the earlier}} stage of rib vaulting, the arched ribs {{consisted}} of independent or separate voussoirs {{down to the}} springing; the difficulty, however, of working the ribs separately led to two other important changes: (1) {{the lower part of}} the transverse diagonal and <b>wall</b> <b>ribs</b> were all worked out of one stone; and (2) the lower horizontal, constituting what is known as the tas-de-charge or solid springer. The tas-de-charge, or solid springer, had two advantages: (1) it enabled the stone courses to run straight through the wall, so as to bond the whole together much better; and (2) it lessened the span of the vault, which then required a centering of smaller dimensions.
