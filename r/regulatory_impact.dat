25|$|Various {{members of}} {{parliament}} accused the process and documents of being biased. Trevor Mallard and Phil Goff claimed that the final list {{of members of the}} Flag Consideration Panel was numerically slanted towards those nominated by the National Party, despite the shortlist of candidates being roughly neutral. Kennedy Graham expressed scepticism at the official rationale that the referendums simply reflected a pre-existing public debate, and argued that recent discussion was actually deliberately sparked by the referendums announcement itself. Denis O'Rourke said that the shortlisting process was undemocratic because the Flag Consideration Panel would select the final flag design options on behalf of New Zealanders, and asking the public to choose between alternative designs before asking if they wanted a change was intentionally manipulative. Stuart Nash presented quotes in the <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Impact</b> Statement document admitting that referendum options were restricted by prior decisions by the National Party dominated Cabinet and prime minister, accusing them of pre-determining the process.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of its federal bailout and {{management}} problems, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Bank of America was operating under a secret [...] "memorandum of understanding" [...] (MOU) from the U.S. government that requires it to [...] "overhaul its board and address perceived problems with risk and liquidity management". With the federal action, the institution has taken several steps, including arranging for six of its directors to resign and forming a <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Impact</b> Office. Bank of America faces several deadlines in July and August and if not met, could face harsher penalties by federal regulators. Bank of America did not respond to The Wall Street Journal story.|$|E
2500|$|The {{increased}} {{usage of}} CBA in the US regulatory process is {{often associated with}} President Ronald Reagan's administration. Though the use of CBA in US policy making dating back many decades, Reagan's Executive Order 12291 mandated the use of CBA in the regulatory process. Reagan campaigned on a deregulation platform, and once he took office in 1981 quickly issued this EO, which vested the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) with the authority to review agency regulations and required federal agencies to produce <b>regulatory</b> <b>impact</b> analyses when the annual impact could be estimated over $100M. Shortly thereafter, in the 1980s, academic and institutional critiques of CBA started to emerge. The three main criticisms were: ...|$|E

It has been increasingly recognized, however, that modeling and measuring fisheries' production relationships is central to understanding and ultimately correcting the repercussions of externalities and poorly designed regulations. We use a transformation function production model to estimate productivity and its components for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands pollock fishery. We recognize the roles of externalities from pollock harvesting by incorporating data on environmental conditions, bycatch, and biomass stock, and capture <b>regulatory</b> <b>impacts</b> through fishing strategy indicators and fixed effects. We find that the productive contributions and interactions of environmental conditions, bycatch, and fishing strategies are statistically significant, and that regulatory changes have had both direct and indirect impacts on catch patterns.

40|$|Tidal-in-Stream {{energy has}} been heralded {{by many as}} a {{significant}} potential source for clean power, a scheme where kinetic energy is extracted from tidal currents. A number of estimates have suggested that tidal power may become a sizeable fraction of overall electricity generation, however these estimates have been largely based on a resource assessment methodology that dramatically oversimplifies the physical phenomenon at play. This paper develops a model that considers the effect of energy extraction on the bulk flow, showing that tidal energy inventories that assess solely kinetic energy flux may represent both an order-of-magnitude overestimation of the resource and a significant oversimplification of <b>regulatory</b> <b>impacts.</b> The interplay between {{the characteristics of a}} flow and the regulatory and economic issues will likely limit tidal power generation to levels significantly below the physical maximums. Permitted flow reduction, turbine design and staging of development all have significant and predictable impacts on the extractible resource. Energy planners must therefore understand these relationships in order to appropriately assess the magnitude of generation that can be realistically be produced from tidal energy.
