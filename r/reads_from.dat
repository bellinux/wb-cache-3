5|$|Imhotep, Evelyn, and Beni {{return to}} Hamunaptra, pursued by Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth. Imhotep prepares to {{sacrifice}} Evelyn, {{but she is}} rescued after an intense battle with Imhotep's mummified priests. When Evelyn <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> the Book of Amun-Ra, Imhotep becomes mortal again, and Rick forces him into the River of Death. Imhotep leaves {{the world of the}} living, vowing revenge. While looting treasure from the pyramid, Beni accidentally sets off an ancient booby trap and is trapped by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs as Hamunaptra collapses into the sand. Ardeth rides away as Rick and Evelyn kiss and, with Jonathan, ride off into the sunset on a pair of camels laden with Beni's treasure.|$|E
5|$|The Church holds three daily prayer {{meetings}} {{during the}} week, with two meetings on Sundays and one regular consecration. On Sunday mornings, congregants {{meet at the}} temple for Sunday School, which begins with prayers and hymns. After that, the preacherusually a ministerpresides over a talk during which he <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> the Bible and presents the material to be covered throughout the week. During the talk, {{it is common for}} members of either sex to read a cited verse from the Bible. At the end of the talk, more hymns and prayers are recited and voluntary offerings are given. Sunday evening services begin with hymns and prayers, after which members of the congregation of both sexes recite from the Bible or sing hymns. A shorter talk is held with the aim of deepening the Sunday School's talk.|$|E

5|$|The {{honor of}} {{becoming}} an altar server, was, in the past, a privilege only available to boys but has since become coed. Altar servers wear long, white, plain robes and assist the priest in his duties during the Mass. At Mt. St. Peter Church, there are four altar servers at every Mass. One is the book bearer and {{is in charge of}} bringing the Bible to the priest at the times during which the priest <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> the Bible during the Mass. The cross bearer holds a large, wooded crucifix and commences the procession in which the priest enters the church. Also present in the procession are the acolytes, and the book bearer. He or she also leads the procession out of the church {{at the end of the}} Mass. The last two altar servers are acolytes and are in charge of lighting the candles in the church prior to the beginning of the Mass and extinguishing them after Mass.|$|E
5|$|The saints are {{identifiable}} from Latin inscriptions {{lining the}} borders of the imitation bronze frame, which is original. Van der Paele is identifiable from historical records. He is dressed in the finery of a medieval canon, including white surplice, as he piously <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> a book of hours. He is presented to Mary by Saint George, his name saint, who holds aloft his metal helmet in respect. Saint Donatian, dressed in brightly coloured vestments, stands to the left. The panel is noted for the finery of clothing, including exquisite representations of furs, silks and brocades, and the elaborate and detailed religious iconography. The Virgin's throne is decorated with carved representations of Adam and Eve, prefigurations of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus, and scenes from the Old Testament. The painting is lined with a series of inscriptions which comment on the saints, and include van Eyck's signature.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to methods that align <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> individual sample(s) to a reference genome {{in order to}} detect germline genetic variants, <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> multiple tissue samples within a single individual can be aligned and compared in order to detect somatic variants. These variants correspond to mutations that have occurred de novo within groups of somatic cells within an individual (that is, they are not present within the individual's germline cells). This form of analysis has been frequently applied {{to the study of}} cancer, where many studies are designed around investigating the profile of somatic mutations within cancerous tissues. Such investigations have resulted in diagnostic tools that have seen clinical application, and are used to improve scientific understanding of the disease, for instance by the discovery of new cancer-related genes, identification of involved gene regulatory networks and metabolic pathways, and by informing models of how tumors grow and evolve.|$|E

25|$|For raw reads, {{the range}} of scores {{will depend on the}} {{technology}} and the base caller used, but will typically be up to 41 for recent Illumina chemistry. Since the maximum observed quality score was previously only 40, various scripts and tools break when they encounter data with quality values larger than 40. For processed reads, scores may be even higher. For example, quality values of 45 are observed in <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> Illumina's Long Read Sequencing Service (previously Moleculo).|$|E

25|$|Third {{generation}} sequencing {{may also}} be {{used in conjunction with}} second generation sequencing. This approach {{is often referred to as}} hybrid sequencing. For example, long <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> third generation sequencing may be used to resolve ambiguities that exist in genomes previously assembled using second generation sequencing. On the other hand, short second generation reads have been used to correct errors in that exist in the long third generation reads. In general, this hybrid approach has been shown to improve de novo genome assemblies significantly.|$|E

25|$|The <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> {{last step}} are realigned to the {{reference}} genome. In this method SSCS family pairs that have complementary tags will be grouped together (Family αβ and βα in figure 2). These reads originate from two complementary strands of DNA. High confidence sequences are {{selected based on}} the perfectly matched base calls of each family. The final sequence is called duplex consensus sequence (DCS). True mutations are those that match perfectly between complementary SSCSs. This step filter out remaining errors that raised during first round of PCR amplification or during sample preparation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{well known}} that {{eukaryotic}} genomes including primates and humans are complex and have large numbers of long repeated regions. Short <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> second generation sequencing must resort to approximative strategies in order to infer sequences over long ranges for assembly and genetic variant calling. Pair end reads have been leveraged by second generation sequencing to combat these limitations. However, exact fragment lengths of pair ends are often unknown and must also be approximated as well. By making long reads lengths possible, third generation sequencing technologies have clear advantages.|$|E
25|$|Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ MinION {{has been}} used to detect DNAm. As each DNA strand passes through a pore, it {{produces}} electrical signals which {{have been found to be}} sensitive to epigenetic changes in the nucleotides, and a hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to analyze MinION data to detect 5-methylcytosine (5mC) DNA modification. The model was trained using synthetically methylated E. coli DNA and the resulting signals measured by the nanopore technology. Then the trained model was used to detect 5mC in MinION genomic <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> a human cell line which already had a reference methylome. The classifier has 82% accuracy in randomly sampled singleton sites, which increases to 95% when more stringent thresholds are applied.|$|E

25|$|Yemenite Jews and the Aramaic {{speaking}} Kurdish Jews are {{the only}} communities who maintain the tradition of reading the Torah in the synagogue in both Hebrew and the Aramaic Targum ("translation"). Most non-Yemenite synagogues have a specified person called a Baal Koreh, who <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> the Torah scroll when congregants are called to the Torah scroll for an aliyah. In the Yemenite tradition, each person called to the Torah scroll for an aliyah reads for himself. Children {{under the age of}} Bar Mitzvah are often given the sixth aliyah. Each verse of the Torah read in Hebrew is followed by the Aramaic translation, usually chanted by a child. Both the sixth aliyah and the Targum have a simplified melody, distinct from the general Torah melody used for the other aliyot.|$|E
25|$|The Kirkwall scroll is a floor cloth which {{contains}} many masonic symbols, many more opaque images, and cryptic writing which may either be a code or badly painted Hebrew. It {{hangs on the}} west wall of the temple of Lodge Kirkwall Kilwinning No. 38(2) in Orkney, but is too long to be completely displayed. It is 18ft 6in long and 5ft 6in wide, and is composed of a full-width central strip stitched at each side to two half-width side strips. The left border appears to show the wanderings of the Israelites before they arrived in Egypt, and <b>reads</b> <b>from</b> top to bottom. The right shows their wanderings in the wilderness after the Exodus, with the route marked in years from 1 to 46, and branching many times at the end. The central cloth contains seven painted scenes and tableaux. The bottom scene shows an altar flanked by two pillars, all surrounded by more or less familiar masonic symbols. Working upwards, the second has an altar surrounded by {{a different set of}} symbols, the third has the altar and pillars together with the cherubim present on the arms of the Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Ireland and the United Grand Lodge of England. Above this is a schematic of the tabernacle of the Ark of the Covenant, followed by what may be the last judgement. The sixth shows a cross atop a pyramid, surmounted by a rainbow, surrounded by masonic and alchemical symbols, and at the top a naked woman, assumed by early authors to be Eve, sitting under a tree surrounded by animals. In the distance is a sea or lake full of fish, and beyond this are mountains. The whole is painted in oil, mainly in pale blue. In the top tableau the woman, fish and animals are pink, the sea green, and the tree and mountains brown.|$|E
