The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E

Under the administration of Dr. Clarence L. Crawford, the school began to plan and then construct a new campus high upon the river bluff {{on the edge of}} the City of Mankato. The existing Wilson Campus could not grow because development in the City had grown all round. The new campus was called the Highland Campus. The Highland Campus was designed at the time to be a modern, medium size campus with <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> over time. The Highland Campus is the location of the current campus today. It was built using primarily late 1960s modernist style using brick facade with locally mined Kasota stone. As campus operations transitioned up the hill, a tram and buses were used to shuttle students up and down the hill between campuses.|$|E

500|$|The team {{distilled}} {{the original}} concept {{into the core}} gameplay mechanics that players preferred, namely the abilities to morph into characters and to fight. In what became the core gameplay, the player would {{use a combination of}} Kameo's elemental warriors to progress through levels. Rare later expanded the conceit to that of an adventure game, though its story was secondary to the gameplay. Kameo was designed for fluidity—the team tried to minimize player chores and player waiting times. The team simplified the set of characters from a hundred to a dozen, and expanded the skill sets of those remaining. Tossell designed these characters, and started with a boulder-like animal. These creature designs later became Kameo's morphing forms. As the game transitioned and Rare attempted to distance itself from its mawkish reputation for [...] "cute characters with big eyes", the team struggled to repurpose Kameo into an elf from the fairy of the original concept. Tossell felt that this task was impossible, as Microsoft simultaneously wanted to widen its base while it did not give Rare the <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> out of its cutesy design. The Kameo character transitioned through a [...] "tribal" [...] look before becoming an elf, and her own attacks were ultimately repurposed into the elemental warriors'. Kameo became an Xbox 360 launch title (alongside Rare's Perfect Dark Zero) and received a graphics upgrade in the process. The game had been about 80% complete for the original Xbox, but the transition freed the game's vision from technical constraints.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{recognition}} {{for the book}} was from children's-book critics, among whom it garnered acclaim. A Wizard of Earthsea received an even more positive response in the United Kingdom when it was released there in 1971, which, according to White, reflected the greater admiration of British critics for children's fantasy. In her 1975 annotated collection Fantasy for Children, British critic Naomi Lewis described it in the following terms: [...] " [...] the easiest book for casual browsing, but readers who take the step will find themselves {{in one of the}} most important works of fantasy of our time." [...] Similarly, literary scholar Margaret Esmonde wrote in 1981 that [...] "Le Guin has... enriched children's literature with what may be its finest high fantasy", while a review in The Guardian by author and journalist Amanda Craig said it was [...] "The most thrilling, wise and beautiful children's novel ever, [...] in prose as taut and clean as a ship's sail." [...] In discussing the book for a gathering of children's librarians Eleanor Cameron praised the world building in the story, saying [...] "it is as if [...] herself has lived on the archipelago." [...] Author David Mitchell called the titular character Ged a [...] "superb creation", and argued that he was a more relatable wizard than those featured in prominent works of fantasy at the time. According to him, characters such as Gandalf were [...] "variants on the archetype of Merlin, a Caucasian scholarly aristocrat amongst sorcerers" [...] with little <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow,</b> whereas Ged developed as a character through his story. Mitchell also praised the other characters in the story, who he said seemed to have a [...] "fully thought-out inner life" [...] despite being fleeting presences. The 1995 Encyclopedia of Science Fiction said that the Earthsea books had been considered the finest science fiction books for children in the post-World War II period.|$|E

2500|$|From the start, Friedman {{wanted to}} use Jakks Pacific to {{consolidate}} the fragmented toy industry. At the time, the industry was dominated by the [...] "Big Two," [...] Hasbro and Mattel, who together controlled one-third of the approximately $15 billion wholesale US toy industry. With plenty of <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> the company to the ranks of Hasbro and Mattel, Friedman hoped to out-compete the hundreds of small competitors and the handful of medium-sized toy companies by acquiring their rivals and forging licensing agreements with other companies. During the company's first year, Friedman signed a licensing agreement with Titan Sports, {{at that time the}} parent company of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) whose popularity exploded during the 1990s, which secured an important source of revenue for the company. The exclusive, ten-year deal gave Jakks Pacific the rights to develop and market a line of action figures based on the WWF's wrestling personalities, such as Stone Cold Steve Austin and the Undertaker. For the next several years, Jakks Pacific attained much of its growth from the licensing agreement and the thousands of WWF action figures that were produced, similar to how Hasbro began their growth through sales of G.I. Joe.|$|E
