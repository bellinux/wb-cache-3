50|$|A simple {{realization}} of the Vernier spectroscopy setup has five basic components: a frequency comb, a scannable high finesse optical cavity, a diffraction grating, rotating mirror, and a CCD camera. The trace gas to be measured is put between the mirrors of the optical cavity to allow for optical path enhancement. The frequency comb is coupled into the resonator and made to form a Vernier ratio with the response function. The output of the cavity is reflected off a diffraction grating, providing angular separation of the frequency components of the beam. The diffracted beam is then reflected off the rotatable mirror and then focused onto the CCD camera. Three things must then happen in synchronization. The optical cavity scans through a free spectral range of the cavity while the rotating mirror simultaneously scans the direction perpendicular to the diffraction grating's diffraction plane. These two actions can be synchronized {{by means of a}} periodic <b>ramp</b> <b>voltage</b> which controls both the cavity scan (accomplished by a piezoelectric actuator) and mirror rotation (controlled by a stepper motor). If the CCD camera's exposure time is also set equal to the <b>ramp</b> <b>voltage</b> period, the resulting CCD image is a two dimensional matrix of approximately Gaussian peaks. In this manner, an entire spectrum is produced in the period of the <b>ramp</b> <b>voltage.</b> The time it takes to obtain a spectrum is limited by the cavity scan time, rotating mirror response, and minimum camera exposure time. This particular Vernier spectroscopy scheme is capable of producing an absorption spectrum of a trace gas (<1 ppmV) {{with tens of thousands of}} data points in less than a second.|$|E
50|$|The timebase is an {{electronic}} circuit that generates a <b>ramp</b> <b>voltage.</b> This is a voltage that changes continuously and linearly with time. When it reaches a predefined value the ramp is reset and settles to its starting value. When a trigger event is recognized, provided the reset process (holdoff) is complete, the ramp starts again. The timebase voltage usually drives the horizontal amplifier. Its {{effect is to}} sweep the screen end of the electron beam at a constant speed {{from left to right}} across the screen, then blank the beam and return its deflection voltages to the left, so to speak, in time to begin the next sweep. Typical sweep circuits can take significant time to reset; in some CROs, fast sweeps required more time to retrace than to sweep.|$|E
50|$|Different {{techniques}} {{exist for}} separating out the wavelengths. One {{method is to}} use a monochromator, for example a Czerny-Turner design, with an optical detector placed at the output slit. As the grating in the monochromator moves, bands of different frequencies (colors) are 'seen' by the detector, and the resulting signal can then be plotted on a display. More precise measurements (down to MHz in the optical spectrum) can be made with a scanning Fabry-PÃ©rot interferometer along with analog or digital control electronics, which sweep the resonant frequency of an optically resonant cavity using a voltage ramp to piezoelectric motor that varies the distance between two highly reflective mirrors. A sensitive photodiode embedded in the cavity provides an intensity signal, which is plotted against the <b>ramp</b> <b>voltage</b> to produce a visual representation of the optical power spectrum.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} different voltage waveforms on the growth of titanium oxide nanodots using Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) nanolithography. The resulting oxide features are compared by {{taking into account the}} current data detected during oxidation under the application of constant and linear <b>ramp</b> <b>voltages.</b> The experimental analysis of current waveforms during oxidation upon a constant bias voltage gives quantitative criteria to reduce space charge effects. The use of <b>ramp</b> <b>voltages</b> gives higher flexibility on the control of volume and aspect ratio of oxide features by varying the duty cycle...|$|R
40|$|An analog-to-digital {{converter}} (ADC) converts pixel voltages from a CMOS image into a digital output. A <b>voltage</b> <b>ramp</b> generator generates a <b>voltage</b> <b>ramp</b> {{that has a}} linear first portion and a non-linear second portion. A digital output generator generates a digital output based on the <b>voltage</b> <b>ramp,</b> the pixel <b>voltages,</b> and comparator output from an array of comparators that compare the <b>voltage</b> <b>ramp</b> to the pixel voltages.

40|$|The {{resistive}} switching {{phenomenon is}} analyzed using a purposely developed setup which allows fast <b>ramped</b> <b>voltages</b> and measurements {{in the time}} domain. Taking advantage of these capabilities, the Set and Reset processes in Ni/HfO 2 structures have been studied for a large range of <b>voltage</b> <b>ramp</b> speeds. The results obtained show that Set and Reset voltages increase with <b>voltage</b> <b>ramp</b> speed. The use of time domain measurements has allowed concluding that a critical energy is needed to trigger the Set and Reset processes, independently of the biasing condition...|$|R
50|$|A ramp-compare ADC {{produces}} a saw-tooth signal that ramps {{up or down}} then quickly returns to zero. When the ramp starts, a timer starts counting. When the <b>ramp</b> <b>voltage</b> matches the input, a comparator fires, and the timer's value is recorded. Timed ramp converters require the least number of transistors. The ramp time is sensitive to temperature because the circuit generating the ramp is often a simple oscillator. There are two solutions: use a clocked counter driving a DAC and then use the comparator to preserve the counter's value, or calibrate the timed ramp. A special advantage of the ramp-compare system is that comparing a second signal just requires another comparator, and another register to store the voltage value. A very simple (non-linear) ramp-converter can be implemented with a microcontroller and one resistor and capacitor. Vice versa, a filled capacitor can be taken from an integrator, time-to-amplitude converter, phase detector, sample and hold circuit, or peak and hold circuit and discharged. This has the advantage that a slow comparator cannot be disturbed by fast input changes.|$|E
50|$|The Wilkinson ADC was {{designed}} by D. H. Wilkinson in 1950. The Wilkinson ADC {{is based on the}} comparison of an input voltage with that produced by a charging capacitor. The capacitor is allowed to charge until its voltage is equal to the amplitude of the input pulse (a comparator determines when this condition has been reached). Then, the capacitor is allowed to discharge linearly, which produces a <b>ramp</b> <b>voltage.</b> At the point when the capacitor begins to discharge, a gate pulse is initiated. The gate pulse remains on until the capacitor is completely discharged. Thus the duration of the gate pulse is directly proportional to the amplitude of the input pulse. This gate pulse operates a linear gate which receives pulses from a high-frequency oscillator clock. While the gate is open, a discrete number of clock pulses pass through the linear gate and are counted by the address register. The time the linear gate is open is proportional to the amplitude of the input pulse, thus the number of clock pulses recorded in the address register is proportional also. Alternatively, the charging of the capacitor could be monitored, rather than the discharge.|$|E

40|$|The phase and/or period {{stability}} of a device {{is determined by}} connecting the device in one orthogonal arm of a phase detector having a mixer. In the other arm is an adjustable, variable phase shift device. The output of the mixer is fed through an active low pass filter to derive a DC voltage indicative of the phase shift. The variable phase device is adjusted so that the DC voltage will nullify the phase shift of the tested device under normal conditions. The DC voltage level is converted into a time interval indicative of the phase change of the tested device by determining when the level equals the amplitude of a low frequency <b>ramp</b> <b>voltage.</b> The interval between adjacent equality points can be measured or the period between a reference point on the <b>ramp</b> <b>voltage</b> and the quality be measured...|$|E

Both <b>ramped</b> <b>voltage</b> stress (RVS) and time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) measurements show that environmental humidity dramatically worsens the PZT reliability. Visible breakdown {{spots on the}} surface of PZT capacitors are studied in detail. The measurement results indicate that both reversible and irreversible PZT degradation/breakdown happen during TDDB. The dependence of time to breakdown on polarity of applied voltage is argued to relate to the crystal structure of PZT and the stack of the PZT capacitor...|$|R

The methods which are typically used for planar thin dielectrics did not yield feasible predictions. In particular, charge-to-breakdown value {{does not appear to}} be a suitable measurement for the determination of the dielectric failure in trench capacitors. Lifetime extrapolation using <b>ramped</b> <b>voltage</b> stress tests can be performed.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulated substrate {{response of}} an n-channel MOS floating gate transistor {{to a positive}} linear <b>ramping</b> gate <b>voltage</b> was investigated. Device parameters, such as the channel length, effective electron mobility, substrate doping level and the gate <b>voltage</b> <b>ramping</b> rate were changed to see their effects on the substrate response. The substrate response was monitored by using {{the response of the}} surface potential at the mid-channel point.

The mid-channel surface potential reached a higher peak value if the device had (1) a longer channel length, (2) a lower effective electron mobility, (3) a higher gate <b>voltage</b> <b>ramping</b> rate, or (4) a lower substrate doping level.

In this paper, we propose a gate driver model with a Thevenin equivalent circuit consisting of a <b>ramp</b> <b>voltage</b> source whose slew time is obtained from the gate slew tables, and a driver resistance in series with the gate load. We then develop analytical gate delay formulas using this Thevenin driver model and modeling the load with various gate load models under both rising and falling ramp input. ...|$|E
