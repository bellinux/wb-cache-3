There has been military cooperation with Iraqi Kurdistan and the United States {{in the conflict}} against ISIL, although neither gives official support for <b>Rojava</b> or the YPG. The Kurdistan Regional Government, which the Kurdistan Democratic Party runs, is an ally of Turkey and has co-operated to enforce a unilateral economic blockade against <b>Rojava</b> which has damaged and limited Rojava's economy. The [...] "Sultanistic system" [...] of Iraqi Kurdistan stands {{in stark contrast to}} the Democratic Confederalist system of <b>Rojava.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Russia – In February 2016, the <b>Rojava</b> {{administration}} {{opened a}} representation office in Moscow amid growing ties between Russia and <b>Rojava.</b> Russia has lent outstanding support to <b>Rojava</b> in the diplomatic arena, in particular {{more clearly than}} any other country calling for its inclusion in the Geneva III peace talks on Syria, and to some degree carrying their positions into the talks, as documented in Russia's May 2016 draft for a new constitution for Syria.|$|E

2500|$|Turkey – Neighbouring Turkey has {{received}} PYD co-chair Salih Muslim for talks in 2013 and in 2014, even entertaining {{the idea of}} opening a <b>Rojava</b> representation office in Ankara [...] "if it's suitable with Ankara's policies.". Nonwithstanding, Turkey is persistently hostile, because it feels threatened by Rojava's emergence encouraging activism for autonomy among Kurds in Turkey and the Kurdish–Turkish conflict, and in this context in particular Rojava's leading Democratic Union Party (PYD) and the YPG militia being members of the Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK) network of organisations, which also includes both political and militant assertively Kurdish organizations in Turkey itself, including the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Turkey's policy towards <b>Rojava</b> {{is based on an}} economic blockade, persistent attempts of international isolation, opposition to the cooperation of the international Anti-ISIL-coalition with <b>Rojava</b> militias, and support of Islamist Syrian Civil War parties hostile towards <b>Rojava,</b> in past times even including ISIL. Turkey has on several occasions also been militarily attacking <b>Rojava</b> territory and defence forces. The latter has resulted {{in some of the most}} clearcut instances of international solidarity with <b>Rojava.</b> In the perception of much of the Turkish public, the <b>Rojava</b> federal project as well as U.S. support for the YPG against ISIL are elements of a wider conspiracy scheme by a [...] "mastermind" [...] with the aim to weaken or even dismember Turkey, in order to prevent its imminent rise as a global power. Opposition leader Selahattin Demirtas has argued for Turkey and other countries to recognize <b>Rojava</b> and work with it as a partner.|$|E

French Special Operations Command Forces are supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces in operations. In August 2016, a French delegation and the People’s Municipality Board in <b>Rojava</b> signed a contract to open a center in the Kurdish and French languages {{in order to bring}} the cultures of <b>Rojava</b> and France together, and the opening of a branch of the Paris 8 University in <b>Rojava</b> was also discussed.

2500|$|United Kingdom – In January 2015, a British Parliament {{committee}} {{asked the}} government of Prime Minister David Cameron to explain and justify its policy of not working with <b>Rojava's</b> military in combating ISIL. In July 2015, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office formally declared that [...] "the UK has engaged with Saleh Muslim, co-leader of the Democratic Union Party (PYD)". Since then, United Kingdom Special Forces are supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces in operations. Democratic Union Party (PYD) co-chairperson Salih Muslim was invited to speak in the British Parliament Parliament in 2015 and in 2016.|$|R
5000|$|While {{conflict}} between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Syrian Army during the Syrian Civil War has been rare, compared to their fighting against other groups, {{there have been several}} skirmishes between the two forces. There has also been cooperation between the SDF and the government (and its ally Russia) against Turkey-backed rebel forces during the Northern Aleppo offensive. This has included Russian Air Force support for the advancing People's Protection Units (YPG, now part of the SDF), Syrian government dependence (during the Battle of Aleppo) on YPG forces to cut off all the rebels' northern supply routes from Turkey and YPG forces moving in to hold some areas taken by the Syrian government around Aleppo. Such Syrian government-YPG/SDF cooperation has been described by The Economist as a [...] "tacit alliance". In July 2016, Constituent Assembly co-chair Hediya Yousef formulated <b>Rojava's</b> approach towards Syria as follows: We believe that a federal system is ideal form of governance for Syria. We see that {{in many parts of the}} world, a federal framework enables people to live peacefully and freely within territorial borders. The people of Syria can also live freely in Syria. We will not allow for Syria to be divided; all we want is the democratization of Syria; its citizens must live in peace, and enjoy and cherish the ethnic diversity of the national groups inhabiting the country.|$|R
