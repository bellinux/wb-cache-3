40|$|In Hungary, {{the rates}} of direct {{payments}} to farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy for the period 2014 - 2020, the distribution of these payments, and ultimately their impacts on farming decisions, {{will depend on the}} combination of mandatory and optional Pillar I support schemes to be introduced in 2015. This paper presents estimations of the structural impact of six new support policy option mixes (scenarios) compared to 2013 (baseline), and discusses the policy implications in terms of the capping of direct payments versus the possible introduction of the <b>Redistributive</b> <b>Payment</b> in particular. The calculations of direct payment rates and the distribution of these payments were based on the database of the Hungarian Agricultural and Rural Development Agency for 2011, and the moving averages of the descriptive parameters of farms were obtained from the Farm Accountancy Data Network. To assess the structural impacts an agent-based simulation model was developed. Decisions were modelled at the micro-level and macro-outcomes were modelled as the consequences of these micro-level decisions. From an economic point of view, the <b>Redistributive</b> <b>Payment</b> would have no real advantage over the capping of direct payments in Hungary as the <b>Redistributive</b> <b>Payment</b> would benefit only farms of relatively small size and would shift funding away from even mid-sized family farms in Hungary. Furthermore a top-up on the first 30 hectares would neither cause any significant structural changes in arable production, nor in livestock farming. In terms of employment and rural livelihoods, however, the picture might be more nuanced...|$|E

We show that the government can redistribute income towards low-ability individuals in a world of asymmetric information by offering bundles of medical treatment and <b>redistributive</b> <b>payment.</b> If self-selection is a problem, then the separating scheme offers high-ability individuals complete treatment against a high payment, and low-ability individuals partial treatment against a low payment. In particular, the level of treatment offered low-ability individuals is distorted downwards.

30|$|In {{terms of}} policy implications, {{the present study}} {{suggests}} {{that the decision to}} opt for a partial convergence model (instead of a flat rate model) as well as for degressivity and capping mechanisms (instead of activating the <b>redistributive</b> <b>payment)</b> has somewhat limited the redistributive effect of direct payments in Italy. In this regard, recent evidence confirms that the impact of the application of these specific redistributive tools (such as degressivity and capping) in Italy is limited. On the other hand, if Italy had used the same amount of public resources used for the voluntary couple support (which is concentrated in the upper decile of the population by farm income) for the redistributive payments and/or for the payments for mountain areas, it is likely that a more equitable distribution of DPs could have been obtained.|$|E
30|$|However, it {{is clear}} that such an impact is due not only to changes in policy but also to market dynamics. The first aspect can be {{attributed}} to the external convergence process that decreased the Italian budget for DPs as well as to the national decision to activate VCS (that is, a highly concentrated <b>payment)</b> instead of <b>redistributive</b> <b>payments</b> or payments for areas with natural constraints (which could have further hindered farm income inequality). In terms of the market, other explanations include the increasing pressures of volatility due to climate change and globalization that expose farmers to increasing income risks (Knapp and Loughrey 2017).|$|R
30|$|In Italy, {{degressivity}} {{is applied}} since the voluntary <b>redistributive</b> <b>payments</b> {{have not been}} implemented. To generate a more equitable distribution of direct payments, a mandatory reduction in BPS by 50 % for the part exceeding 150, 000 € is introduced. Moreover, this percentage is 100 % for the part exceeding 500, 000 €, thereby introducing a de facto “capping” on BPS. In Italy, such a reduction is applied after deducting labor costs for the previous year, i.e., salaries to employees as well as taxes paid and social welfare contributions, from the basic payment.|$|R
40|$|Besley and Coate (1997 and 1998) exposit {{a formal}} model of dynamic fiscal policy that {{highlights}} the problem {{associated with the}} temporal mismatch between the incidence of benefits and costs. Their analysis focuses {{in part on the}} conditions that may result in inefficient public investment decisions in a representative democracy. This paper employs cross-national data to investigate implications of the Besley-Coate model. The findings indicate that several political institutions significantly affect public investments, including term lengths, staggered term expiration dates, and the separation of power between the executive and legislative branches. The findings also suggest that fiscal arrangements for <b>redistributive</b> <b>payments</b> may increase public investments.

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to assess the redistributive effect of the post- 2013 CAP {{decoupled}} payments (including <b>redistributive</b> <b>payment,</b> capping and greening) across EU farms, regions and MS using harmonized EU-wide micro-economic data (FADN). Results show that, due to the external convergence of the CAP, {{most of the new}} MS would gain from the post- 2013 CAP (compared to the 2012 payments); while former MS would experience a decline in their decoupled payments. The distributional effects of the post- 2013 CAP decoupled payments vary strongly among MS, depending whether the MS is applying internal convergence flat rate (in 2015 or 2019), partial convergence or SAPS. The Lorenz curve shows that the decoupled payments under the post- 2013 CAP are more equitably distributed among farms, sectors and regions, in comparison to the former CAP. JRC.

30|$|Furthermore, the {{allocation}} of national resources across the seven components of direct payments was as follows: the BPS received 58 % of resources, greening payment (GR) received 30 % of the budget (as established by Reg. 1307 / 2013), the young farmer payments (YFPs) received 1 % of national funds, the voluntary coupled support (VCS) received 11 % of funding, and the small farmers scheme (SFS) was activated. It {{must be noted that}} even though the GR refers to environmental concerns, the value of this payment in Italy depends on the value of the BPS (due to the application of the tunnel model of internal convergence, i.e., partial convergence of entitlement values). Therefore, since this aid varies based on the value of the entitlements associated with the land, its redistributive effect on farm income must be properly considered. Lastly, the <b>redistributive</b> <b>payment</b> and payment for areas with natural constraints were not activated. Other decisions are reported in Table  1.|$|E

40|$|Decoupled direct {{payments}} {{were introduced in}} the European Union (EU) by the 2003 CAP reform in form of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and the Single Area Payment System (SAPS). The 2013 CAP reform changed both the implementation of decoupled payments {{as well as its}} budget. We assess the possible effects of the 2013 CAP reform on the capitalization of decoupled payments in land rental values. Our estimates suggest that the CAP reform leads to an increase in the capitalization of decoupled payments by additional 16 cents for each EUR of decoupled payments relative to the pre-reform situation. However, there is a relatively large variation in the reform effects between MS particularly between Old Member States (OMS) and New MS (NMS). In NMS the capitalization rate slightly reduces from 76 % in the pre-reform period to 72 % in the post-reform period. Although, the rate is significantly lower in OMS, it almost doubles (from 20 % to 39 %) due to the reform. The main source of the post-reform capitalization in the EU are the entitlement stock changes accounting for 19 % of total post-reform capitalization level, followed by the internal convergence of payments with 18 %, the budget change (including external convergence) with 1 %, and the differentiation of payments (<b>redistributive</b> <b>payment)</b> with - 7 %. Overall, our estimates suggest that on average in the EU, the non-farming landowners’ policy gains are 25 % of total decoupled payments in the post-reform period compared to 17 % in the pre-reform period.
