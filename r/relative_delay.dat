50|$|Supercontinuum {{generation}} is generally unstable when pumped by long pulses. The occurrence of optical rogue waves are an extreme manifestation of this instability and arise {{due to a}} sensitivity to a particular component of input noise. This sensitivity can be exploited to stabilize and increase the generation efficiency of the spectral broadening process by actively seeding the instability with a controlled signal instead of allowing it to begin from noise. The seeding can be accomplished with an extraordinarily weak, tailored optical seed pulse, which stabilizes supercontinuum radiation by actively controlling or stimulating modulation instability. Whereas noise-induced (i.e., spontaneously generated) supercontinuum radiation usually has significant intensity noise and little to no pulse-to-pulse coherence, controlled stimulation results in a supercontinuum pulse train with greatly improved phase and amplitude stability. Additionally, the stimulus {{can also be used}} to actuate the broadband output, i.e., to switch the supercontinuum on and off by applying or blocking the seed. The seed may be derived from the pump pulse by broadening a portion of it slightly and then carving out a stable portion of the broadened tail. The <b>relative</b> <b>delay</b> between the pump and seed pulses is then adjusted accordingly, and the two pulses are combined in the nonlinear fiber. Alternatively, the extremely stable stimulated supercontinuum can be generated by deriving both pump and seed radiation from a parametric process, e.g., the two-color output (signal and idler) of an optical parametric oscillator. Added input modulations have also been studied for changing the frequency of rare events and optical feedback can be employed to speed up the spectral broadening process. Stimulated supercontinuum radiation can also be generated using an independent continuous-wave seed, which avoids the need to control the timing but the seed must instead must have higher average power. A continuous-wave-seeded supercontinuum source has been employed in time stretch microscopy, yielding improved images compared with those obtained using unseeded sources. Stimulated supercontinuum generation can be slowed or frustrated by applying a second seed pulse with the proper frequency and timing to the mix. Thus, applying one seed pulse can accelerate the spectral broadening process, and the application of a second seed pulse can once again delay spectral broadening. This frustration effect occurs because the two seeds effectively compete for gain within the pump envelope, and it is a controlled version of the rare narrowband events known to occur stochastically in certain supercontinuum pulse trains (see above).|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} aim of {{this research}} was to determine the best means of calculating the <b>relative</b> <b>delay</b> time parameter of the Laurenson runoff routing method of flood estimation. Early testing conducted as a part of achieving this end showed that the model could be quite insensitive to the means used to calculate <b>relative</b> <b>delay.</b> Model sensitivity to the means of calculating this parameter had apparently not yet been verified, and if it was insensitive, the best means of calculating the parameter was not required. Hence it was decided to test the thesis that the model was insensitive to the means of calculating the <b>relative</b> <b>delay</b> time parameter. The thesis was tested by applying the model to a range of flood sizes on two catchments using five different means of calculating <b>relative</b> <b>delay</b> time. The differences in model output produced by these delay hypotheses were examined in relation to the average model error. In a number of cases the effects on model performance of these different delay hypotheses were quite small, but in other cases they were quite large.

The fact that the means of calculating <b>relative</b> <b>delay.</b> time Has unimportant in a conditional sense left the possibility that the model could be used under these conditions, if they could be defined.

Thus, a tradeoff between power reduction and throughput is required when selecting the imposed <b>relative</b> <b>delay.</b> The proposed low-power scheme, dynamic delayed line bus (DDL) scheme, led to a power reduction of up to 25 %, 33 %, and 42 % when applied to data, address, and differential buses, respectively.
