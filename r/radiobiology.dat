25|$|The {{response}} of a tumor to radiation therapy is {{also related to}} its size. Due to complex <b>radiobiology,</b> very large tumors respond less well to radiation than smaller tumors or microscopic disease. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to radiation therapy. This is most commonly seen {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer with wide local excision or mastectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Another method is to shrink the tumor with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy. A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of radiation therapy. Examples of radiosensitizing drugs include: Cisplatin, Nimorazole, and Cetuximab.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Slotin {{expressed}} growing {{disdain for}} his personal involvement in the project. He remarked, [...] "I have {{become involved in the}} Navy tests, much to my disgust." [...] Unfortunately for Slotin, his participation at Los Alamos was still required because, as he said, [...] "I am {{one of the few people}} left here who are experienced bomb putter-togetherers." [...] He looked forward to resuming teaching and research into biophysics and <b>radiobiology</b> at the University of Chicago. He began training a replacement, Alvin C. Graves, to take over his Los Alamos work.|$|E
500|$|Slotin {{might have}} been present at the {{start-up}} of Enrico Fermi's [...] "Chicago Pile-1", the first nuclear reactor, on 2 December 1942; the accounts of the event do not agree on this point. During this time, Slotin also contributed to several papers {{in the field of}} <b>radiobiology.</b> His expertise on the subject garnered the attention of the United States government, and as a result he was invited to join the Manhattan Project, the United States' effort to develop a nuclear bomb. Slotin worked on the production of plutonium under future Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner at the university and later at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He moved to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico in December 1944 to work in the bomb physics group of Robert Bacher.|$|E

50|$|Although Brookhaven Lab {{researchers}} {{and their colleagues}} used beams of heavy ions for <b>radiobiology</b> research at another Brookhaven accelerator from 1995, the NSRL became operational during summer 2003, and over 75 experimenters from some 20 institutions from the U.S. and abroad have taken part on <b>radiobiology</b> research. Jointly managed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and NASA’s Johnson Space Center, the facility employs beams of heavy ions extracted from Brookhaven’s Booster accelerator that are then used to simulate the Cosmic rays found in space.
