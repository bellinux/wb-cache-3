5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> greater {{control of their}} lives. Husbands and fathers {{directed}} the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E
5|$|One {{animator}} {{was dedicated}} full-time during {{three years of}} the game's development to work out the boy's animations, including animations that showed anticipation on the player's actions or events in the game, such as <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a cart handle as the player moved the boy near it. Jensen felt this was important as the character was always {{at the center of the}} player's screen, and the most important element to watch. Playdead included gruesome death sequences to highlight incorrect solutions and discourage players from repeating their mistakes. While they expected players to run the boy into numerous deaths while trying solutions, Carlsen stated that their goal was to ensure death wasn't a penalty in the game, and made the death animations entertaining to keep the player interested. Carlsen noted several early puzzles were too complex for the game, but they would end up using a portion of these larger puzzles in the final release.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{causes for}} the {{evolution}} of human bipedalism involve freeing the hands for carrying and using tools, sexual dimorphism in provisoning, changes in climate and environment (from jungle to savanna) that favored a more elevated eye-position, and {{to reduce the amount of}} skin exposed to the tropical sun. It is possible that bipedalism provided a variety of benefits to the hominin species, and scientists have suggested multiple reasons for evolution of human bipedalism. There also is not only question of why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal but also why did hominins become more bipedal over time. For example, the postural feeding hypothesis explains for how earliest hominins became for the benefit of <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> food in trees while the savanna-based theory describes how the late hominins that started to settle on the ground became increasingly bipedal.|$|E
500|$|The Prince of Egypt was [...] "written" [...] {{throughout}} the story process. Beginning with a starting outline, Story Supervisors Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook led {{a team of}} fourteen storyboard artists and writers as they sketched out the entire film— sequence by sequence. Once the storyboards were approved, they were put into the Avid Media Composer digital editing system by editor Nick Fletcher to create a [...] "story reel" [...] or animatic. The story reel allowed the filmmakers to view and edit the entire film in continuity before production began, and also helped the layout and animation departments understand {{what is happening in}} each sequence of the film. [...] After casting of the voice talent concluded, dialogue recording sessions began. For the film, the actors record individually in a studio under guidance by one of the three directors. The voice tracks were to become the primary aspect as to which the animators built their performances. Because DreamWorks was concerned about theological accuracy, Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to call in Biblical scholars, Christian, Jewish and Muslim theologians, and Arab American leaders to help his film be more accurate and faithful to the original story. After previewing the developing film, all these leaders noted that the studio executives listened and responded to their ideas, and praised the studio for <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> comment from outside sources.|$|E

This resulted in the cancellation of a visit by a cross-party parliament group due to visit China, led by Peter Mandelson. Graham had also asserted that [...] "Stability for nations is not, in our eyes, about maintaining the status quo regardless, but about <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> greater involvement with the people – in this case, of Hong Kong – allowing them a greater say in choosing their leaders and, above all, trusting in the people".|$|E
2500|$|Watermark {{is formed}} of eleven tracks, eight of which Enya and Roma {{are listed as}} co-writers. The {{remaining}} three are instrumentals solely composed by Enya. She had performed solos as a vocal on Enya, but wanted them played by different instruments on Watermark, and employed additional musicians to play parts that were already written: Neil Buckley plays the clarinet on [...] "On Your Shore", Chris Hughes plays the rototoms on [...] "River" [...] and the rototoms and African hand drum on [...] "Storms in Africa", and Davy Spillane contributes the low whistle and Uillean pipes on [...] "Exile" [...] and [...] "Na Laetha Geal M'óige". Enya sings in Irish, her first language, English and Latin. She looked back on the album in 2000: [...] "Looking back ... the words are those of loss, of reflection, of exile — not necessarily from one's country, but from those whom the heart loves. It has in its theme searching, longing, of <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> an answer. The ocean is a central image. It is the symbolism of a great journey." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2012 op-ed for CNN, Fluke {{described}} {{what she called}} [...] "President Barack Obama and former [...] Mitt Romney's vastly different values and visions", specifically mentioning Obama's support of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, increasing the government's investment of Pell Grant scholarships, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Fluke described Obama as [...] "a president who has consistently shown he will defend [...] rights while working {{to ensure that all}} women and men have all the protections and opportunities they need to pursue economic success". Fluke later introduced President Obama at an August 2012 campaign rally in Denver and spoke in support of the president at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, describing the Republican Party's platform as [...] "an offensive, obsolete relic of our past". The Los Angeles Times described Fluke as [...] "a symbolic presence in a convention that has been dominated by Democrats <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the votes of women". Congressman Joe Walsh of Illinois responded to the speech by saying that Fluke was acting [...] "entitled" [...] and told her to [...] "get a job"; Fluke wrote in response that Walsh [...] "disparage my generation", and questioned why many elected officials' answer to struggling Americans was [...] "cutting their safety net".|$|E

2500|$|Democratic {{ideals of}} {{integration}} for international and European nations are {{as old as}} the modern nation-state. Ancient concepts of European unity were generally undemocratic, and founded on domination, like the Empire of Alexander the Great, the Roman Empire, or the Catholic Church controlled by the Pope in Rome. In the Renaissance, medieval trade flourished in organisations like the Hanseatic League, stretching from English towns like Boston and London, to Frankfurt, Stockholm and Riga. These traders developed the lex mercatoria, spreading basic norms of good faith and fair dealing through their business. In 1517, the Protestant Reformation triggered a hundred years of crisis and instability. Martin Luther nailed a list of demands to the church door of Wittenberg, King Henry VIII declared a unilateral split from Rome with the Act of Supremacy 1534, and conflicts flared across the Holy Roman Empire until the Peace of Augsburg 1555 guaranteed each principality the right to its chosen religion (cuius regio, eius religio). This unstable settlement unravelled in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), killing around a quarter of the population in central Europe. The Treaty of Westphalia 1648, which brought peace according to a system of international law inspired by Hugo Grotius, is generally acknowledged as the beginning of the nation-state system. Even then, the English Civil War broke out and only ended with the Glorious Revolution of 1688, by Parliament inviting William and Mary from Hannover to the throne, and passing the Bill of Rights 1689. In 1693 William Penn, a Quaker from London who founded Pennsylvania in North America, argued that to prevent ongoing wars in Europe a [...] "European dyet, or parliament" [...] was needed. The French diplomat, Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre, who worked negotiating the Treaty of Utrecht {{at the end of the}} War of Spanish Succession proposed, through [...] "Perpetual Union", [...] "an everlasting peace in Europe", a project taken up by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant after him. After the Napoleonic Wars and the Revolutions of 1848 in the 19th century, Victor Hugo at the International Peace Congress in 1849 envisioned a day when there would be a [...] "United States of America and the United States of Europe face to face, <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> each other across the seas". World War One devastated Europe's society and economy, and the Versailles Treaty failed to establish a workable international system in the League of Nations, any European integration, and imposed punishing terms of reparation payments for the losing countries. After another economic collapse and the rise of fascism led to a Second World War, European civil society was determined to create a lasting union to guarantee world peace through economic, social and political integration.|$|E
