The system, I/OWA (Input/Output time-aWare Architecture), combines a general architecture for sampling and time-stamping relevant information channels in fMRI (image acquisition, stimulation, subject responses, cardiac and <b>respiratory</b> <b>monitors,</b> etc.) and an efficient approach to manipulating these data, featuring incremental subsecond multiple linear regression. The advantages of the system are the simplification of event timing and efficient and unified data formatting. Substantial parametric analysis can be performed and displayed in realtime.

40|$|Monitoring {{breathing}} {{rates and}} patterns helps {{in the diagnosis}} and potential avoidance of various health problems. Current solutions for <b>respiratory</b> <b>monitoring,</b> however, are usually invasive and/or limited to medical facilities. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>respiratory</b> <b>monitoring</b> system, UbiBreathe, based on ubiquitous off-the-shelf WiFi-enabled devices. Our experiments show that the received signal strength (RSS) at a WiFi-enabled device held on a person's chest {{is affected by the}} breathing process. This effect extends to scenarios when the person is situated on the line-of-sight (LOS) between the access point and the device, even without holding it. UbiBreathe leverages these changes in the WiFi RSS patterns to enable ubiquitous non-invasive respiratory rate estimation, as well as apnea detection. We propose the full architecture and design for UbiBreathe, incorporating various modules that help reliably extract the hidden breathing signal from a noisy WiFi RSS. The system handles various challenges such as noise elimination, interfering humans, sudden user movements, as well as detecting abnormal breathing situations. Our implementation of UbiBreathe using off-the-shelf devices {{in a wide range of}} environmental conditions shows that it can estimate different breathing rates with less than 1 breaths per minute (bpm) error. In addition, UbiBreathe can detect apnea with more than 96 % accuracy in both the device-on-chest and hands-free scenarios.

The performance of the methods is evaluated for various possible respiration conditions, defined by the sensor orientation and respiration-induced abdomen movement.

Among them, variable orifice meters (VOMs) show some valuable characteristics, such as linearity, good dynamic response, and low cost. This paper presents the characterization of a commercial VOM intended for application in <b>respiratory</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Firstly, two nominally identical VOMs were calibrated within ± 10 [*]L·min− 1, to assess their metrological properties. Furthermore, experiments were performed by humidifying the air, to evaluate the influence of vapor condensation on sensor’s performances. The condensation influence was investigated during two long lasting trials (i. e., 4 hours) by delivering 4 [*]L·min− 1 and 8 [*]L·min− 1. Data show that the two VOMs’ responses are linear and their response is comparable (sensitivity difference of 1. 4 %, RMSE of 1. 50 [*]Pa); their discrimination threshold is < 0. 5 [*]L·min− 1, and the settling time is about 66 [*]ms. The condensation within the VOM causes a negligible change in sensor sensitivity and a very slight deterioration of precision.

Data were obtained from eleven healthy adults (six women, five men) whose body mass indices ranged from 20 to 47 kg m− 2, and whose baseline respiratory rates ranged from 4 to 19 breaths per minute. We evaluated three variables derived from frequency and amplitude measurements of the NIRMS: (1) the interval between breathing cycles (the interbreath interval or IBI); (2) the period between breathing cycles (the interbreath frequency or IBF); and (3) the amplitude of breath cycles (AMP). The frequency of NIRMS waveform deflections correlated highly with the frequency of visually observed chest movements (r = 0. 99).

40|$|Complications {{that are}} {{associated}} with surgery and hospitalization cannot be entirely ruled out. To prevent patients from experiencing addi­tional harm, it is essential that complications during hospitalization are recognized and treated adequately. A patient’s respiratory sta­tus can provide us with valuable information about the presence and progression of these complications. Unfortunately, respiratory assessment is still infrequently performed and technical solutions for (continuous) <b>respiratory</b> <b>monitoring</b> are generally not available outside high care facilities. This thesis aims to provide a strong basis for future development of continuous monitoring strategies outside high care facilities. The implementation of a system for continuous <b>respiratory</b> <b>monitoring</b> in order to im­prove patient outcomes is a ‘complex intervention’. That is illustrated by our systematic review as incomplete and suboptimal implementation of one of the components of the monitoring strategy jeopardizes the success of the complete monitoring strategy. The first of those components is the sensor technology. It is essential for success to de­velop sensor technologies that are explicitly suitable for the low care clinical setting. The frequency-modulated continuous wave radar that <b>monitors</b> <b>respiratory</b> rate would fit the low care requirements, as it operates in a non-invasive wireless, and contactless mode. However, a monitoring strategy is more than just the sensor technology. The success of a moni­toring strategy depends on several other components, including signal analysis, alarm strate­gy, as well as the diagnostic and treatment algorithms used. Illustrated by the clinical evaluations of the radar and capnograph sensor technology in this thesis. The radar prototype signal analysis was not sophisticated enough to recognize voluntary movement, that resulted in artifacts and limited the diagnostic accuracy. The additive value of monitoring with a capnograph during procedural sedation depends on the therapeutic interventions and choices that interact with the monitoring strategy. In this example, something elementary as the administration of supplemental oxygen makes the difference. Successful development of continuous <b>respiratory</b> <b>monitoring</b> strategies for use outside high care facilities also depends on the methodology that is used to study them. We compared three statistical methods to derive limits of agreement in method comparison studies in a simulation study and found that it does indeed matter which statistical method is used to determine the accuracy of monitoring devices. Furthermore, we studied the association between the duration of vital instability before intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality. Our findings suggest that ICU admission should be cautiously used as surrogate endpoint in studies evaluating a monitoring strategy to detect deteriorating patients. Based on the find­ings of our clinical studies and systematic review implementation of routine continuous non-in­vasive <b>respiratory</b> <b>monitoring</b> on general hospital wards cannot yet be advocated, however the monitoring strategy should be intensified, and this thesis reveals that technical monitoring solutions are getting closer...|$|R
