40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic matching model featuring dealers and short-term investors in an over-the-counter bond market. The model illustrates that bilateral bargaining in an over-the-counter market {{results in an}} endogenous bond-liquidation cost for short-term investors. This cost makes short-term investors need <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements</b> to buy long-term bonds. The cost also explains {{the existence of a}} margin specific to <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements</b> held by short-term investors, if <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements</b> must be renegotiation-proof. Without <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements,</b> short-term investors do not buy long-term bonds. In this case, the bond yield rises unless dealers have enough capital to buy and hold bonds. 2012 ～ 2016 年度科学研究費補助金[基盤研究(S) ]「長期デフレの解明」(研究代表者 東京大学経済学研究科・渡辺努, 課題番号： 24223003...|$|R

50|$|Rehypothecation can be {{involved}} in repurchase agreements, commonly called repos. In a two-party <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreement,</b> one party sells to the other a security at a price with a commitment to buy the security back {{at a later date}} for another price. Overnight repurchase agreements, the most commonly used form of this arrangement, comprise a sale which takes place the first day and a repurchase that reverses the transaction the next day. Term repurchase agreements, less commonly used, extend for a fixed period of time that may be as long as three months. Open-ended term repurchase agreements are also possible. A so-called reverse repo is not actually any different to a repo; it merely describes {{the opposite side of the}} transaction. The seller of the security who later repurchases it is entering into a repurchase agreement; the purchaser who later re-sells the security enters into a reverse <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreement.</b> Notwithstanding its nominal form as a sale and subsequent repurchase of a security, the economic effect of a <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreement</b> is that of a secured loan.|$|E
