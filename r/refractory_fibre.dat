40|$|In {{the present}} study, the current {{international}} standards and corresponding apparatus {{for measuring the}} thermal conductivity of <b>refractory</b> glass <b>fibre</b> products have been reviewed. <b>Refractory</b> glass <b>fibres</b> are normally produced {{in the form of}} low-density needled mats. A major issue with thermal conductivity measurements of these materials is lack of reproducibility in the test results due to transformation of the test material during the test. Also needled mats are inherently inhomogeneous, and this poses additional problems. To be able to compare the various methods of thermal conductivity measurement, a refractory reference material was designed which is capable of withstanding maximum test temperatures (1673 K) with minimum transformation. The thermal conductivity of this reference material was then measured using various methods according to the different standards surveyed.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{review the}} {{scientific}} literature on {{the health effects of}} <b>refractory</b> ceramic <b>fibres</b> (RCFs). The adverse effects of exposure to asbestos has led to concern about the potential for other fibrous materials to cause diseases. For this reason the human populations most heavily exposed to synthetic mineral fibres have been examined for any adverse effects and many types of fibre have been studied in animal experiments. One type of man made vitreous <b>fibres</b> (MMVFs), <b>refractory</b> ceramic <b>fibres</b> (RCFs), are principally used in thermal insulation at high temperatures [...] up to 1400 degrees C. As manufactured RCFs exist in a glassy, non-crystalline (sometimes called amorphous) state, they have various compositions, physical properties, and sized fibres. METHODS [...] All reports on the health effects of RCFs available up to the end of 1994 have been examined and {{the scientific literature}} reviewed although all publications have not necessarily been referenced. CONCLUSIONS [...] In recent inhalation experiments conducted with both rats and hamsters at the Research and Consulting Company, Geneva, at the highest dose tested (30 mg/m 3) there was an increased incidence of tumours in both species. Lower doses were only examined in the rat and at these doses there was no significant excess of lung tumours. Epidemiological investigations of workers engaged in the manufacture of ceramic fibres have shown a small excess of pleural plaques. This phenomenon is being further investigated but could be due to confounding exposures. The populations available for study are small and their exposures fairly short, but it is considered prudent that they should remain under surveillance for some time to come.

Work activities were grouped into dust zones (DZs). Persons to be sampled were randomly selected according to a protocol designed to assure that at least one sample was collected annually from each DZ; each work shift is also sampled at least annually. TWA exposures calculated over a sampling period of at least 360 min were included in the data set. DZs were combined into one of three groups (DZGs) : fibre production; vacuum processes; other. The data were analysed to identify any differences by DZG between airborne fibre exposures, by the shift worked at each facility, and across all facilities. There were no statistically significant shift-related differences detected between airborne fibre exposures across the five RCF facilities when analysed as a group. Within four of the facilities, no shift-related differences were detected between airborne fibre exposures; however, at one facility, first and third shift exposures were statistically different. No documentation related to job activities was found to account for the observation. The data generally support the use of a single exposure estimate for each DZG in each of these facilities, regardless of shift worked. Researchers reconstructing exposure and not able to determine the shift worked by study subjects may find these results useful, but are cautioned that substantial differences in exposure across shifts may exist in other types of manufacturing. ! © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. —...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{clearance}} rate, the related pathology, and {{the chemical and}} morphological changes of three man made mineral fibres (MMMFs) in the sheep model of pneumoconiosis. METHODS: Fibrous particles were extracted from lung parenchyma and analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). RESULTS: The concentration of MMMF 11, MMMF 21, <b>refractory</b> ceramic <b>fibre</b> (RCF- 1), and crocidolite asbestos fibres decreased with time according to a slow and a fast kinetic component. There was a statistical difference in the four regression lines {{as a function of}} time and the type of fibres (p < 0. 001). The diameter of MMMFs decreased {{during the course of the}} time, whereas the crocidolite fibres did not seem to show any change. There was a statistical difference in the four regression lines as a function of time (p = 0. 037) and type of fibres (p < 0. 001). Ferruginous bodies were counted in the 40 sheep for which the latency period was 2 years. No typical ferruginous bodies were found in the groups exposed to MMMFs. The geometric mean concentration of asbestos bodies in the group exposed to crocidolite was 2421 bodies/g lung tissue (95 % CI 385 to 15260).

40|$|International audienceAlthough human {{malignant}} mesothelioma (HMM) is {{mainly caused by}} asbestos exposure, <b>refractory</b> ceramic <b>fibres</b> (RCFs) have been classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans {{on the basis of}} their biological effects in rodents' lung and pleura and in cultured cells. Hence, further investigations are needed to clarify the mechanism of fibre-induced carcinogenicity and to prevent use of harmful particles. In a previous study, mesotheliomas were found in hemizygous Nf 2 (Nf 2 (+/-)) mice exposed to asbestos fibres, and showed similar alterations in genes at the Ink 4 locus and in Trp 53 as described in HMM. Here we found that Nf 2 (+/-) mice developed mesotheliomas after intra-peritoneal inoculation of a RCF sample (RCF 1). Clinical features in exposed mice were similar to those observed in HMM, showing association between ascite and mesothelioma. Early passages of 12 mesothelioma cell cultures from ascites developed in RCF 1 -exposed Nf 2 (+/-) mice demonstrated frequent inactivation by deletion of genes at the Ink 4 locus, and low rate of Trp 53 point and insertion mutations. Nf 2 gene was inactivated in all cultures. In most cases, co-inactivation of genes at the Ink 4 locus and Nf 2 was found and, at a lower rate, of Trp 53 and Nf 2. These results are the first to identify mutations in RCF-induced mesothelioma. They suggest that nf 2 mutation is complementary of p 15 (Ink 4 b), p 16 (Ink 4 a) and p 19 (Arf) or p 53 mutations and show similar profile of gene alterations resulting from exposure to ceramic or asbestos fibres in Nf 2 (+/-) mice, also consistent with the one found in HMM.

40|$|The {{group of}} {{man-made}} mineral or vitreous fibres (MMMFs or MMVFs) includes glass wool, rock wool, slag wool, glass filaments and microfibres, and <b>refractory</b> ceramic <b>fibres</b> (RCFs). Experimental observations have provided evidence that {{some types of}} MMVF are bioactive under certain conditions. The critical role of size parameters has been demonstrated in cellular and animal experiments, when intact fibres are {{in direct contact with}} the target cells. It is, however, difficult to extrapolate the results from these studies to humans since they bypass inhalation, deposition, clearance and translocation mechanisms. Inhalation studies are more realistic, but show differences between animal species regarding their sensibility to tumour induction by fibres. Fibre biopersistence is an important factor, as suggested by recent inhalation studies, which demonstrate positive results with RCF for fibrosis, lung tumours and mesothelioma. There is no firm evidence that exposure to glass-, rock- and slag wool is associated with lung fibrosis, pleural lesions, or nonspecific respiratory disease in humans. Exposure to RCF could enhance the effects of smoking in causing airways obstruction. An elevated standard mortality ratio for lung cancer has been demonstrated in cohorts of workers exposed to MMVF, especially in the early technological phase of mineral (rock slag) wool production. During that period, several carcinogenic agents (arsenic, asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) were also present at the workplace and quantitative data about smoking and fibre levels are lacking. It is not possible from these data to determine whether the risk of lung cancer is due to the MMVFs themselves. No increased risk of mesothelioma has been demonstrated in the cohorts of workers exposed to glass-, slag- or rock wool. There are in fact insufficient epidemiological data available concerning neoplastic diseases in RCF production workers because of the small size of the workforce and the relatively recent industrial production.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} possible {{relations between}} respiratory health and past airborne exposure to <b>refractory</b> ceramic <b>fibres</b> (RCFs) and respirable dust in workers at six European factories, studied previously in 1987.  METHODS—The target population comprised all current workers associated with RCF production, plus {{others who had}} participated in 1987  "leavers". Information was collected on personal characteristics, chest radiographs, lung function, respiratory symptoms, smoking, and full occupational history. Regression analysis was used to study relations between indices of health of individual workers and of cumulative exposure to airborne dust and fibres, and likely past exposure to asbestos.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION— 774 workers participated (90 % of current workers, 37 % of leavers). Profusion of small opacities in exposed workers (51 % 0 / 1 +; 8 % 1 / 0 +) was similar to that among an unexposed control group but higher than in new readings of the 1987  study films (11 % 0 / 1 +, 2 % 1 / 0 +). The large difference between 1987  and recent films may be, at least in part, a reading artefact associated with film appearance. Small opacities of International Labour Organisation (ILO) category 1 / 0 + were not associated with exposure. An association of borderline significance overall between 0 / 1 + opacities and exposure to respirable fibres was found for some exposure periods only, the time related pattern being biologically implausible. Pleural changes were related to age and exposure to asbestos, and findings were consistent with an effect of time since first exposure to RCFs. Among men, forced expired volume in 1  second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were inversely related to exposure to fibres, in current smokers only. FEV 1 / FVC ratio and transfer factor (TLCO) were not related to exposures. The estimated restrictive effect was on average mild. Prevalence of respiratory symptoms was low. Chronic bronchitis and its associated symptoms (cough, phlegm) showed some association with recent exposure to respirable fibres. This could be due to an irritant effect of RCFs.    Keywords: respiratory health; ceramic fibre...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The main {{research}} {{objective of the}} four articles comprising this dissertation was to provide retrospective exposure information for a planned study on cancer in a cohort within Norway’s offshore petroleum industry. Methods: Background information on possible exposure was obtained through company visits, including interviewing key personnel (n = 83) and collecting monitoring reports (n = 118) and other relevant documents (n = 329). The collected material was used to identify relevant carcinogens. Twenty-seven job categories were defined based on a previous questionnaire administered to present and former offshore employees in 1998. Descriptions of products containing known and suspected carcinogens, exposure sources and processes were extracted from the collected documentation and the interviews of key personnel (Article II). Exposure data on oil mist and oil vapour covered 37 drilling facilities and were analysed by descriptive statistics and by constructing linear mixed-effects models (Article I). A group of three university and five industry experts individually assessed the likelihood (unlikely, possible or probable) of exposure for combinations of 17 carcinogens, 27 job categories and four time periods (1970 – 1979, 1980 – 1989, 1990 – 1999 and 2000 – 2005). Each rater was to assess 1836 combinations based on summary documents on carcinogenic agents, which included descriptions of sources of exposure and products, descriptions of work processes carried out within the different job categories and monitoring data. Interrater agreement was calculated using Cohen’s kappa index and single and average score intraclass correlation coefficients. Differences in interrater agreement between the different time periods, raters, carcinogen class and amount of information provided were then studied (Article III). In subsequent plenary discussions, the experts agreed on exposed combinations. Agreement {{between the individual and}} the panel assessments was calculated using Cohen’s kappa index. Using the panel assessment as reference, sensitivity and specificity were estimated (Article IV). Results: This study indicated possible exposure to the following known and suspected carcinogenic agents, mixtures or exposure circumstances: benzene; mineral oil – inhalation exposure; mineral oil – skin exposure; crystalline silica; asbestos; refractory ceramic fibres; formaldehyde; tetrachloroethylene; trichloroethylene; welding; nickel compounds; chromium [VI]; lead; crude oil – skin exposure; diesel engine exhaust; dichloromethane; ionising radiation; and occupational exposure as a painter (Article II). Monitoring reports were obtained on seven agents: benzene, mineral oil mist and vapour, respirable and total dust, asbestos <b>fibres,</b> <b>refractory</b> ceramic <b>fibres,</b> formaldehyde and tetrachloroethylene (Article II). The arithmetic mean of 367 personal samples of benzene was 0. 037 ppm (range: less than the limit of detection – 2. 6 ppm). Asbestos fibres were detected (0. 03 fibres/cm 3) when asbestos-containing brake bands were used in drilling draw work in 1988. The personal exposure to formaldehyde in the process area ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 29 mg/m 3. Samples of oil mist and oil vapour had been taken during the use of three generations of hydrocarbon base oils: diesel oils (1979 – 1984), low-aromatic mineral oils (1985 – 1997) and nonaromatic mineral oils (1998 – 2004). Sampling done before 1984 showed high exposure to diesel vapour (arithmetic mean = 1217 mg/m 3). Downward time trends were indicated for both oil mist (6 % per year) and oil vapour (8 % per year) when the year of monitoring was introduced as a fixed effect in a linear mixed-effects model analysis. Rig type, technical control measures and mud temperature significantly determined exposure to oil mist. Rig type, type of base oil, viscosity of the base oil, work area, mud temperature and season significantly determined exposure to oil vapour. In these models major decreases in variability were found for the between-rig components (Article I). In the individual expert assessment overall, 336 (18 %) of the 1836 combinations were denoted possible exposure, and 253 (14 %) scored probable exposure. Stratified on the 17 carcinogenic agents, the prevalence of probable exposure ranged from 3. 8 % for <b>refractory</b> ceramic <b>fibres</b> to 30 % for crude oil. The overall mean kappa (κ) was 0. 42; single score intraclass correlation coefficient was 0. 62, and the average intraclass correlation coefficient was 0. 93. Providing limited quantitative measurement data was associated with less agreement than for equally well-described carcinogens without sampling data. The eight experts assessed 1157 (63 %) of the 1836 combinations in plenary, resulting in 265 (14 %) agreed exposed combinations. The agreement between the experts’ individual assessments and the panel assessment was κ = 0. 53 – 0. 74. The sensitivity was 0. 55 – 0. 86 and specificity 0. 91 – 0. 97. For these parameters, there were no apparent differences between the university experts and the industry experts. Conclusions For defined job categories in Norway’s offshore petroleum industry this study describes possible exposure to known and suspected carcinogenic agents, mixtures or exposure circumstances. An expert panel agreed on probable exposure for 265 of 1836 possible combinations of 17 agents, 27 job categories and four time periods. Measurement data on seven agents are presented. Benzene and mineral oil mist and vapour were considered to have the best potential for development of quantitative estimates of exposure. Exposure to oil mist and oil vapour declined over time in the mud-handling areas of offshore drilling facilities. Exposure was associated with rig type, mud temperature, technical control measures, base oil, viscosity of the base oil, work area and season. The eight raters in the expert group seemed to have enough documentation on which to base their individual estimates. However, providing limited monitoring data leads to more incongruence among raters. The group was large enough to give reliable estimates. The experts’ individual ratings highly agreed with the succeeding panel assessment. The university experts and the industry experts’ assessments did not apparently differ...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste (particularly of municipal solid waste) that cannot be minimized, recycled or reused presents a huge international problem. The last 20 years {{is characterized by a}} gradual transition from landfilling of the municipal solid waste (MSW) to incineration. The incineration of MSW under existing legislation and operational boundary conditions is a very complex process with the application of two-stage combustion, minimization of emissions and production of energy (generally heat and electricity). In MSW incinerators, the first stage consists of combustion of heterogeneous waste on a moving grate that transports and mixes the waste during the combustion process. The grate combustion process involves drying, devolatilization, gasification/combustion and char burn-out. Thus, gasification and pyrolysis are subsets of the combustion problem. Mathematical modeling of combustion on the grate requires the solution of the flow field and concentrations of gaseous species in a reacting and moving bed, taking into account various heat transfer mechanisms. Development of an accurate mathematical model of the incineration process is limited by the lack of measured data for validation. Requirements for specific (in-situ) data essential for the development of an incinerator burning bed model and {{a better understanding of the}} grate combustion process prompted accurate measurement of concentrations of selected gases within a moving, burning bed of solid waste. For this purpose we have designed and developed a special cube-capsule with insulating <b>refractory</b> ceramic <b>fibres</b> and materials with cooling effects enabling measurements of CO and temperature by an electrochemical sensor, small gas pump and electronics placed inside. This unique self-contained and mechanically/thermally protected probe consisting of measuring and recording electronic components was able to withstand temperatures over 1000 °C for a period longer than two hours. The measurement technique differs from all conventional methods of measurements in that the capsule (casket) can be introduced into the incinerator together with the waste and hence experiences the same conditions on the grate as the waste material. This novel device proved to be convenient for in-situ measurements in moving grate incineration. The capsule with sensor for CO measurement passed through three incinerator furnaces burning MSW and recorded CO concentration and two temperatures on opposing sides of the capsule, saving all data onto a computer memory chip. The cube-capsule was recovered from the incinerator ash pit and the recorded information was downloaded onto an Excel spreadsheet for subsequent analysis. A similar capsule/casket being designed with thermal insulation/cooling could be used for simultaneous measurement of CO, oxygen, CO 2 (or pollutants as HCl) and temperatures to characterize the combustion process of waste. A vibration sensor, detection of casket position on the grate and measurement of temperatures and intake of gas samples from more surface positions will further improve the record of the trajectory/rolling of the capsule, to elucidate the effects of horizontal and vertical distance on the grate within the furnace and the overall history (residence time in various sections) experienced on the grate by waste.
