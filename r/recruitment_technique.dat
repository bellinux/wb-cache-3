40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Purpose of the Study The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the exposure and influence of <b>recruitment</b> <b>techniques</b> and influential sources and factors which influenced student selection of vocational-technical education. Procedures The data for this study were obtained through the use of a student questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 578 community college respondents within the urban, suburban and rural geographical areas in the State of Oregon. The Chi-square and t-Test statistics were used in statistically analyzing the data in reference to the classification of students [...] high school, transfer and out-of-school students within the urban, suburban and rural geographical areas. Conclusions From the results of this study, the following conclusions and implications can be drawn: 1. Career days, scheduling a conference with the community college guidance counselor and brochures, flyers, leaflets and booklets were ranked first, second and third respectively, in all geographical areas as the three most influential <b>recruitment</b> <b>techniques.</b> 2. The influence of other <b>recruitment</b> <b>techniques</b> were dependent upon the classification of students within each geographical area. A closer analysis of these <b>recruitment</b> <b>techniques</b> may assist college personnel in providing more effective recruitment programs. 3. It can be concluded that high school students had significantly greater overall contact and influence of <b>recruitment</b> <b>techniques,</b> and transfer and out-of-school students were significantly lower. 4. Parents, guardian or relatives and the community college guidance counselor were ranked first and second respectively by the classification of students in all geographical areas as being the most influential in offering personal advice. 5. In general, the transfer and out-of-school students ranked the employer, employment agency, welfare agency and rehabilitation agency as being higher among influential sources as compared to the total composite profile. 6. The parents, guardian or relatives were ranked first as an influential source, however ranked sixth in providing recruitment information to the respective classifications of students. It would be advantageous to provide more recruitment information to the parents, guardian or relatives, considering their influence with the respective classifications of students. 7. It can be concluded that there is a direct correlation between the quantity of recruitment information disseminated by influential sources and their relative influence upon the respective classifications of students. 8. The rural composite profile provided a larger quantity of recruitment information as compared to the total composite profile. 9. The influential sources which ranked first and second respectively by all geographical areas and classifications of students were recruitment information mailed by community college and recruitment information disseminated by the community college guidance counselor and faculty. Recommendations It is recommended that the findings of this study be utilized by community college personnel of vocational-technical education in planning and developing effective recruitment programs related to the different classifications of students. It is specifically recommended that community college personnel in vocational-technical education critically analyze the findings of this study in relationship to the <b>recruitment</b> <b>techniques,</b> <b>recruitment</b> informational dissemination sources and influential sources which were influential in recruiting, and adapt these influential factors to their present recruitment programs...|$|R
50|$|Snowball {{sampling}} is a recruitment {{method that}} employs research into participants' social networks to access specific populations. According to research {{mentioned in the}} paper written by Kath Browne, using social networks to research is accessible. In this research, Kath Browne used social networks to research non-heterosexual women. Snowball sampling is often used because the population under investigation is hard to approachable either due to low numbers of potential participants or the sensitivity of the topic. The author indicated the <b>recruitment</b> <b>technique</b> of snowball sampling, which uses interpersonal relations and connections within people.Due to the use of social networks and interpersonal relations, snowball sampling forms how individuals act and interact in focus groups, couple interviews and interviews. As a result, snowball sampling not only results in the recruitment of particular samples, use of this technique produces participants'accounts of their lives. To help mitigate these risks, it is important to not rely on any one single method of sampling to gather data about a target sector. In order to most accurately obtain information, a company must do everything it possibly can to ensure that the sampling is controlled. Also, it is imperative that the correct personnel is used to execute the actual sampling, because one missed opportunity could skew the results.|$|E

Women at {{risk of breast cancer}} report interest in lifestyle modification, but recruitment to randomized physical activity intervention studies is challenging. Methods We conducted an analysis of <b>recruitment</b> <b>techniques</b> used for a prospective, randomized pilot study of physical activity in women at risk of breast cancer. We evaluated differences in proportion of eligible patients, enrolled patients, and successful patients identified by each individual recruitment method. The Fisher-Freeman-Halton test (an extension of Fisher's exact test from 2 × 2 tables to general row by column tables) was used to compare the success of different recruitment strategies. Results We received 352 inquiries from women interested in participating, of whom 171 (54 %) were eligible. Ninety-nine women completed a baseline activity evaluation, and 58 (34 % of eligible; 16 % of total inquiries) were randomized. Recruitment methods fell into three broad categories: media techniques, direct contact with potential participants, and contacts with health care providers. Recruitment strategies differed significantly in their ability to identify eligible women (p = 0. 01), and women who subsequently enrolled in the study (p = 0. 02).

To address this concern, co-formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone (BPN/NLX) replaced buprenorphine alone in Malaysia in December 2006. Methods: To assess the significance of BPN/NLX introduction, 41 BPN/NLX injectors in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia were recruited using a modified snowball <b>recruitment</b> <b>technique.</b> Results: In January 2007, all subjects had previously injected BPN alone. During the transition from injecting BPN alone to co-formulated BPN/NLX, the mean daily BPN injection dose increased from 1. 88 mg (range 1. 0 - 4. 0 mg) to 2. 49 mg/day (p. 001). Overall, 18 (44) subjects increased their daily amount of injection while 22 (54) had no change in dose; only one subject reduced the amount of injection. Development of opioid withdrawal symptoms was the primary outcome, however the only symptom that {{was significantly associated with}} BPN/NLX dosage was the report of stomach pains (p =. 01). In logistic regression analysis, the development of opioid withdrawal symptoms was associated with increased benzodiazepine injection and increased syringe sharing. Conclusion and Scientific Significance: These data suggests that the introduction of BPN/NLX did not reduce injection related risk behaviors such as syringe sharing and was associated with increased benzodiazepine use.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive human {{pathogen}} that is readily internalized by professional phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils {{but also by}} non-professional phagocytes such as epithelial or endothelial cells. Intracellular bacteria have been proposed {{to play a role}} in evasion of the innate immune system and may also lead to dissemination within migrating phagocytes. Further, S. aureus efficiently lyses host cells with a battery of cytolytic toxins. Recently, phenol-soluble modulins (PSM) have been identified to comprise a genus-specific family of cytolytic peptides. Of these the PSM peptides have been implicated in killing polymorphonuclear leucocytes after phagocytosis. We questioned if the peptides were active in destroying endosomal membranes to avoid lysosomal killing of the pathogen and monitored integrity of infected host cell endosomes by measuring the acidity of the intracellular bacterial microenvironment via flow cytometry and by a reporter <b>recruitment</b> <b>technique.</b> Isogenic mutants of the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains USA 300 LAC, USA 400 MW 2 as well as the strongly cytolytic methicillin-sensitive strain 6850 were compared with their respective wild type strains.

40|$|Background: ‘Hard-to-reach’ is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} those sub-groups of the populationthat {{may be difficult to}} reach or involve in research or public health programmes. Applicationof a single term to call these sub-sections of populations implies a homogeneity within distinctgroups, which does not necessarily exist. Different sampling techniques were introduced sofar to recruit hard-to-reach populations. In this article, we have reviewed a range of approachesthat have been used to widen participation in studies. Methods: We performed a Pubmed and Google search for relevant English language articlesusing the keywords and phrases: (hard-to-reach AND population* OR sampl*), (hidden ANDpopulation* OR sample*) and (“hard to reach” AND population* OR sample*) and a consultationof the retrieved articles’ bibliographies to extract empirical evidence from publicationsthat discussed or examined the use of sampling techniques to recruit hidden or hard-to-reachpopulations in health studies. Results: Reviewing the literature has identified a range of techniques to recruit hard-to-reachpopulations, including snowball sampling, respondent-driven sampling (RDS), indigenousfield worker sampling (IFWS), facility-based sampling (FBS), targeted sampling (TS), timelocation(space) sampling (TLS), conventional cluster sampling (CCS) and capture re-capturesampling (CR).

Secondly, targeted services evaluation methods that are culturally tailored are often not comparable to the mainstream population. Culturally diverse groups are often left out of evaluation as it is considered difficult and expensive, however {{this can lead to}} further inequalities and disinvestment in already disadvantaged groups. In 2013, Queensland University of Technology and NAQ Nutrition were funded by the Queensland Government to develop LEAPS (Learning, Eating, Active Play, Sleep), a Professional Development Program implementing the Commonwealth Government Get Up and Grow Guidelines which provide recommendations on healthy eating and physical activity in Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) settings. QUT developed the Evaluation Framework and implemented the evaluation component of the project which was rolled out in ECEC services in Queensland. Within these services the populations are diverse with services on Thursday Island in the Torres Strait through to Family Day Care in Brisbane run by the Somalian Community. Development of LEAPS’ evaluation involved consultation with education and health experts as well as a CALD reference group.

40|$|Dietary habits {{change over}} the life-course and might be profoundly {{affected}} by changes in lifestyle. The transition from living as a dependent in the family home to independent living is a crucial stage in most young people's lives, and the initial diet and lifestyle choices adopted following leaving home may {{form the basis of}} dietary habits and health status in adulthood. Many young people leave home to pursue further education, begin employment and/or co-habit/start a family. However, some leave home involuntarily or due to family conflict, becoming homeless. The circumstances of a young person's transition into independent living are likely {{to have an impact on}} their health behaviour and dietary habits. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the diet and lifestyles of young people living at home or independently. In particular, the diet and nutritional status of young adults at various stages of independent living (students, homeless and working young adults) was investigated. Phase 1 of the study investigated the differences in diet and health behaviour of young people living independently or in the family home (n= 219). Phases 2, 3 and 4 investigated the diet and nutritional status of (phase 2) students during their first year of study (n= 58), (phase 3) homeless young adults residing temporarily in hostels (n= 24) and (phase 4) working young adults who have lived independently for more than 4 years (n= 33). The study was based in Liverpool, and volunteers were recruited largely from Merseyside, although the `snowball' <b>recruitment</b> <b>technique</b> resulted in some volunteers from Leicestershire, the Midlands, Surrey and Kent. An age range of 18 - 30 years was used for this study. This was in order to include both young people who had recently left home (who were likely to be at the lower end of the age range), and those who had lived independently for more than four years (who were likely to be at the higher end of the age range). The dietary habits of working young adults, who had lived independently for more than four years, were closest to recommended nutritional intakes. Students and the homeless generally consumed diets that were high in fat and sugar, and low in fibre. Alcohol intakes were high amongst male and female students and female working adults.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a result of {{fieldwork}} on foraging ecology of Afrotropical stingless bees in Uganda. This is because most studies on stingless bee ecology are largely based in South America and South-east Asia and have ignored the aspects of Afrotropical stingless bees. The central question is how the Afrotropical bees co-exist by partitioning their resources. Aspects of nesting behaviour of the stingless bees are presented in chapter 3. In BINP there are at least five stingless bee species belonging to two genera: Meliponula (four species) and Hypotrigona (one). The bee species nest in tree cavities, mud house wall crevices and underground. The relative importance of predation, food supply, nesting site and elevation affecting abundance of stingless bees were studied for meliponines in chapter 4. Predators were treated more comprehensively compared to previous field studies. Our figures for nest density for both the honey bee and the combined stingless bee species may agree with estimates from drier parts of Africa and some habitats in the American and Asian tropics. At an average of 12 percent/year, meliponine colony mortality from predators in this study was generally higher than those reported for American and Asian tropics. The use of tools by humans and chimpanzees caused high rates of stingless bee nest mortality. Temporal resource partitioning and climatological factors influencing colony flight and foraging of stingless bees is discussed in chapter 5. Foragers of M. ferruginea and M. nebulata exited their nests in characteristically distinct foraging bouts suggesting the recruitment methods used may be direct leading or ‘piloting’. The number of individuals in a returning bout was less than that in an exiting bout suggesting recruits do not follow experienced foragers the whole distance to food source. Differences in pollen foraging by A. mellifera and stingless bees (M. bocandei and M. nebulata) were studied in chapter 6. Palynological results showed an overlap among the three bee species. A. mellifera the larger bee had the highest diversity while M. nebulata had the lowest. The <b>recruitment</b> <b>technique</b> to food sources is implicated to {{have been one of the}} factors accounting for the differences in pollen foraging behaviour. Foragers of M. nebulata flew out in distinct bouts which probably led to the low pollen diversity. Chapter 7 discusses factors influencing sugar concentration of collected nectar. Two stingless bee species (H. gribodoi and M. ferruginea) were used to show co-existence among the two genera. The smaller bee (H. gribodoi) collected nectar of higher sugar concentration. Factors that influenced sugar concentration of collected nectar included botanic origin of the nectar, bee species, bee colonies, month of year, time of day and the local environment. In Chapter 8, a study on seasonal floral resource utilisation and pollen collection by A. m. scutellata was undertaken. Results showed that the flowering time of bee plants varied with the different seasons of the year. Most plants bloomed during the rainy season while agricultural crops flowering depended on sowing date. There was more brood-rearing during the rainy season, when flowers were in bloom...|$|E
5000|$|Reisman {{has claimed}} that the homosexuals employ <b>{{recruitment}}</b> <b>techniques</b> that rival those of the United States Marine Corps. Reisman cited [...] "a clear avenue for the recruitment of children" [...] by homosexuals in her public support of Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992). In 1994, Reisman spoke at a conference of Christian leaders in Colorado Springs, saying that homosexual [...] "recruitment is loud; it is clear; it is everywhere." [...] She estimated the homosexual population {{at the time to}} be 1-2%, but she predicted at least 20% (and possibly over 30%) [...] "of the young population will be moving into homosexual activity" [...] as a result of recruitment.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the impact of}} recruitment and training policies for the incentives of agents with career concerns. Training can be targeted it can be chosen {{to have more of}} an impact on particular types of agents. Similarly, <b>recruitment</b> <b>techniques</b> can focus on nding superstars or weeding out poor performers. In a model that nests two forms of production, routinework in which compe-tence substitutes for e¤ort and creativework where ability and e¤ort are comple-ments, we highlight that di¤erent ways to improve average ability can have exactly opposite implications for career concerns. While teaching to the top (training which is complementary to ability) or identifying star performers increases agentsreputational concerns, teaching to the bottom has the opposite e¤ect...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine effective <b>recruitment</b> and retention <b>techniques</b> for increasing enrollment in the West Virginia 4 -Hprogram. Data were collectedfor this survey research from county 4 -H club leaders and Extension agents via two mail questionnaires. The sample consisted of I 65 county 4 -H club leaders and 55 Extension agents. A total of 115 (52 %) usable questionnaires were returned Participants rated the perceived importance of various <b>recruitment</b> and retention <b>techniques</b> used by 4 -H club leaders. The highest rated <b>recruitment</b> <b>techniques</b> were “have exciting and active clubs to entice others to join, " "word of mouth [...] friends telling friends about 4 -H, " “make meetings/programs interesting and fun, " "make members feel welcome, " and “‘allow 4 -H members to participate and take active roles in the club. " The highest rated retention techniques were “‘an effective county agent, s ta f f, and 4 -H leader, " “must be pro 4 -H, " "fun camping programs, " “provide praise, motivation, and encouragement, " “let older members know how important they are {{to the success of the}} club, " and ‘provide efficient and fun meetings, programs, and activities. " Inservice workshops for West Virginia Extension agents and 4 -H club leaders should be conducted on organizing an effective and exciting 4 -H club meeting and maintaining a dynamic 4 -H club...|$|R
