25|$|Raman {{scattering}} {{is another}} phenomenon that involves inelastic scattering of light {{caused by the}} vibrational properties of matter. The detected <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> shifts and other effects are very different compared to Brillouin scattering. In Raman scattering, photons are scattered by the effect of vibrational and rotational transitions in the bonds between first-order neighboring atoms, while Brillouin scattering results from the scattering of photons caused by large scale, low-frequency phonons. The effects of the two phenomena provide very different information about the sample: Raman spectroscopy {{can be used to}} determine the transmitting medium's chemical composition and molecular structure, while Brillouin scattering can be used to measure the material's properties on a larger scale – such as its elastic behaviour. The frequency shifts from Brillouin scattering, a technique known as Brillouin Spectroscopy, are detected with an interferometer while Raman scattering uses either an interferometer or a dispersive (grating) spectrometer.|$|E

50|$|Prescalers are {{typically}} used {{at very high}} frequency to extend the upper frequency <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> counters, phase locked loop (PLL) synthesizers, and other counting circuits. When {{used in conjunction with}} a PLL, a prescaler introduces a normally undesired change in the relationship between the frequency step size and phase detector comparison frequency. For this reason, it is common to either restrict the integer to a low value, or use a dual-modulus prescaler in this application. A dual-modulus prescaler is one that has the ability to selectively divide the input frequency by one of two (normally consecutive) integers, such as 32 and 33. Common fixed-integer microwave prescalers are available in modulus 2, 4, 8, 5 and 10, and can operate at frequencies in excess of 10 GHz.|$|E
5000|$|Above the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> counters, {{frequencies}} of electromagnetic signals are often measured indirectly {{by means of}} heterodyning (frequency conversion).

If the two signals are close together in frequency the heterodyne is low enough to be measured by a frequency counter. This process only measures the difference between the unknown frequency and the reference frequency. To reach higher frequencies, several stages of heterodyning can be used. Current research is extending this method to infrared and light frequencies (optical heterodyne detection).|$|E

50|$|Gas {{composition}} - The {{frequency of}} a whistle driven by steam is typically {{higher than that}} of a whistle driven by compressed air at the same pressure. This frequency difference is caused by the greater speed of sound in steam, which is less dense than air. The magnitude of the frequency difference can vary because the speed of sound is influenced by air temperature and by steam quality. Also, the more squat the whistle, the more sensitive it is to the difference in gas flow rate between steam and air that occurs at a fixed blowing pressure. Data from 14 whistles (34 resonant chambers) sounded under a variety of field conditions showed a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> differences between steam and air (5 - 43 percent higher frequency on steam).

50|$|Like {{other species}} of cricket they produce their calling song by rubbing the ridges of their wings together. The chirp (or trill) of a tree cricket is long and {{continuous}} and can sometimes be mistaken for the call of a cicada or certain species of frogs. While male tree crickets {{have the ability to}} call, females lack the ability (Brown 1997). This call is then received by other tree crickets in the area through a system called sender-receiver matching. For example, a male tree cricket will produce a mating call at a specific <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This allows females to be able to pick out the males mating call without becoming distracted or confused by other calls from other species <b>of</b> insects. This <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> is called a carrier frequency.

Due to this, female tree crickets have tympanum (hearing organs) that can receive a much wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> than most other insects (Mhatre 2011). Female tree crickets seem to prefer calls at the lower <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> indicating the presence of a large male.
