5|$|Since 2004, new glaciers {{have formed}} on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice to Crater Glacier below. In addition, {{there are two}} rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier and one north of the western lobe. Two of these rock glaciers have merged with the Crater Glacier, with one on the west and one on the east. The other <b>rock</b> <b>glacier</b> on the eastern slopes of the crater wall is very close to {{touching}} the glacier.|$|E
25|$|As glaciers flow over bedrock, they soften {{and lift}} blocks of rock into the ice. This process, called plucking, {{is caused by}} {{subglacial}} water that penetrates fractures in the bedrock and subsequently freezes and expands. This expansion causes the ice {{to act as a}} lever that loosens the rock by lifting it. Thus, sediments of all sizes become part of the glacier's load. If a retreating glacier gains enough debris, it may become a <b>rock</b> <b>glacier,</b> like the Timpanogos Glacier in Utah.|$|E
500|$|After the {{volcanic}} {{activity of the}} 2000s, {{the thickness of the}} glacier continues to increase at a slower rate of [...] per year and the glacier continues to advance at 3ft (1 m) per day. The latest aerial imagery taken in 2012 shows that the glacier has entered {{the upper reaches of the}} Loowit Creek canyon and the headwaters of the creek. Ice mixed with rock debris now spills into the canyon and the creek has been pushed to the east. Nearby, on the slopes of the eastern crater wall, the glacier touches one of the rock glaciers and the glacier is very close to merging with the other <b>rock</b> <b>glacier.</b> A medial moraine can be seen at the interface of the eastern and western arms of the Crater Glacier.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> in the Chilean Andes help {{supply the}} water for much of Chile, {{including}} the capital of Santiago. Mining operations in the high mountains {{have led to the}} degradation and destruction of more than two <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers.</b> Several copper mines dump their waste <b>rock</b> onto <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers,</b> which results in faster melting and higher velocity movement of these <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers.</b> The dumping of waste rock on the <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> may lead to their destabilization.

40|$|Northern Tien Shan is characterised by a {{distinct}} periglacial belt that contains many <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> with {{an area of}} 1 km² or more. To investigate the reason for their large size and variable occurrence, we analysed a representative subsample of the <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> with respect to topographic and climatic variables. A simple permafrost model indicates that the <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> originate in the zone where permafrost occurrence is very likely and some large <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> flow down to elevations where permafrost is unlikely to exist outside the <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> themselves. Correlation and multiple regression analyses revealed that the occurrence and characteristics of the <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> can only be partly explained by {{the characteristics of the}} contributing area (e. g. its area or the headwall height). The correlation is greater with talus-type <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> than with moraine-type <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers.</b> The climate can explain the general occurrence of <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> but not their specific characteristics. It is hypothesised that the main reason for the specific distribution and characteristics of these large <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> relates to the interaction with polythermal glaciers, topographic characteristics, intensive weathering and rock avalanches triggered by seismic activity...|$|R
50|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> {{have been}} seriously intervened by Andina {{since the late}} 1980s, when it started to deposit several million tons of waste rock on top of <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers,</b> {{resulting}} in their acceleration and partial destabilisation.

500|$|With the {{volcanic}} activity from 2004 to 2008, the glacier lobes were pushed aside and overthickened by {{the growth of}} new volcanic domes. As the two streams of ice were compressed between the caldera wall and the new lava domes, the ice moved rapidly downhill, much like the squeezing of toothpaste out of a container. This resulted in a very rapid advance of the glacier termini; first the western glacier arm merged with the <b>rock</b> <b>glacier</b> on the western crater wall and then, both arms of the Crater Glacier joined north 1980s lava dome in May 2008, despite {{the volcanic}} activity. In addition, the volcanic activity modified {{the surface of the}} glacier and transformed it from being mostly crevasse-free to being a chaotic jumble of icefalls heavily criss-crossed with crevasses and seracs due to movement of the crater floor and lava dome growth. At the south end, the new domes almost split the Crater Glacier into two separate glaciers and melted 10% in volume of the glacier's ice. However, cold rock {{on the edge of the}} glacier insulated the glacier ice from the [...] lava spewing out of the lava domes, easing concerns of a catastrophic lahar caused by glacier melting. The porous nature of the crater floor also reduced the amount of meltwater flowing out of the caldera.|$|E
6000|$|The scenery, though dismal, (no juniper even {{attaining}} this elevation,) {{was full}} of interest and grandeur, from the number and variety of snowy peaks and glaciers all around the elevated horizon; the ancient lake-beds, now green or brown with scanty vegetation, the vast moraines, the ridges of glacial debris, the flat terraces, marking, as it were with parallel roads, the bluff sides of the mountains, the enormous boulders perched upon them, and strewed everywhere around, the little Boodhist monuments of quaint, picturesque shapes, decorated with poles and banners, the many-coloured dresses of the people, the brilliant blue of the cloudless heaven by day, the depth of its blackness by night, heightened {{by the light of}} the stars, that blaze and twinkle with a lustre unknown in less lofty regions: all these were subjects for contemplation, rendered more impressive by the stillness of the atmosphere, and the silence that reigned around. The village seemed buried in repose throughout the day: the inhabitants had already hybernated, their crops were stored, the curd made and dried, the passes closed, the soil frozen, the winter's stock of fuel housed, and the people had retired into the caverns of their half subterranean houses, to sleep, spin wool, and think of Boodh, if of anything at all, the dead, long winter through. The yaks alone can find anything to do: so long as any vegetation remains they roam and eat it, still yielding milk, which the women take morning and evening, when their shrill whistle and cries are heard for a few minutes, as they call the grunting animals.

5000|$|The two known {{factors that}} must be present {{in order to create}} <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> are low ice {{velocity}} and permafrost. Most glacial <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> are created by the recession of debris covered <b>glaciers.</b> Glacial <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> are often found in cirque basins where rocky debris falls off the steep sides and accumulates on ice glaciers. As the glaciers shrink, their composition changes as they become increasingly covered with debris. Eventually, the glacial ice is replaced by ice cored rocks.

Design of suitable counter-measures requires detailed knowledge of the internal structures of <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers,</b> which can be obtained using geophysical methods. We examine benefits and limitations of diffusive electromagnetics, geoelectrics, seismics and ground-penetrating radar (georadar) for determining the depth and lateral variability of the active layer, the distributions of ice and water, the occurrence of shear horizons and the bedrock topography. In particular, we highlight new developments in data acquisition and data analysis that allow 2 -D or even 3 -D structures within <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> to be imaged. After describing peculiarities associated with acquiring appropriate geophysical datasets across <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> and emphasizing the importance of state-of-the-art tomographic inversion algorithms, we demonstrate the applicability of 2 -D imaging techniques using two case studies of <b>rock</b> <b>glaciers</b> in the eastern Swiss Alps.
