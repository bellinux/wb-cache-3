A blocked design consists of different blocks of trials of the same stimulus type and is characterized by three factors: the length of blocks, i. e., number of trials per blocks, the ordering of task and <b>rest</b> <b>blocks,</b> and the time between trials within one block. Optimal design theory was applied to find the optimal combination of these three design factors. Furthermore, different error structures were used within a general linear model for the analysis of fMRI data, and the maximin criterion was applied to find designs which are robust against misspecification of model parameters.

Watermarking is one such technique for protecting the digital data like image, video and audio signal. In this paper, we process a novel fragile watermarking using the Hierarchical Mechanism which {{is a combination of}} Block-wise and Pixelwise Approach. The embedded watermark data are derived both from pixels and blocks. On the receiver side, one can first identify the blocks containing the tampered content, and then use the watermark hidden in the <b>rest</b> <b>blocks</b> to exactly locate the tampered pixels. By combining the advantages of both block-wise and pixel-wise techniques, this scheme is capable of finding the detailed tampered positions even if the modified area is more extensive. Moreover, after localizing the tampered-pixel, the original watermarked version can be perfectly restored using exhaustive attempts...|$|E

40|$|Neurogenesis {{requires}} {{mechanisms that}} coordinate early cell-fate decisions, migration, and terminal differentiation. Here, {{we show that}} the transcriptional repressor, repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST), regulates radial migration and the timing of neural progenitor differentiation during neocortical development, and that the regulation is contingent upon differential REST levels. Specifically, a sustained presence of <b>REST</b> <b>blocks</b> migration and greatly delays—but does not prevent—neuronal differentiation, resulting in a subcortical band heterotopia-like phenotype, reminiscent of loss of doublecortin. We further show that doublecortin is a direct gene target of REST, and that its overexpression rescues, at least in part, the aberrant phenotype caused by persistent presence of REST. Our studies {{support the view that}} the targeted down-regulation of REST to low levels in neural progenitors, and its subsequent disappearance during neurogenesis, is critical for timing the spatiotemporal transition of neural progenitor cells to neurons...|$|E
40|$|In {{monkeys and}} rats, neural {{activity}} patterns during learning are reactivated during subsequent periods of rest or sleep. According to the reactivation-consolidation account, this process underlies {{the consolidation of}} memories. Brain imaging studies have extended these findings to humans during sleep, but not yet, during rest. Here, we show that learning-related reactivation also occurs in humans during rest. During functional MRI-scanning, participants trained on a perceptuomotor task flanked by rest periods. During training, we found robust activity in the superior parietal cortex. During post-training rest, this same area reactivated. We also found a link between parietal reactivation and learning. Activity in superior parietal cortex was associated with learning during training, and a control group that did not train on the perceptuomotor task did not show any difference between the pre- and post-training <b>rest</b> <b>blocks</b> in this region. These findings indicate that, during rest, reactivation also occurs in humans. This process may contribute to consolidation of perceptuomotor memories...|$|E

However, the task-related modulation of these measures is essential to identifying the functional relevance of the identified network. In this study, we provide evidence for the efficacy of measuring "state-related" (i. e., task vs. rest) changes in MEG functional connectivity for revealing a sensorimotor network. We investigate changes in functional connectivity, measured as cortico-cortical coherence (CCC), between <b>rest</b> <b>blocks</b> and the performance of a visually directed motor task in a healthy cohort. Task-positive changes in CCC were interpreted in the context of any concomitant modulations in spectral power. Task-related increases in whole-head CCC relative to the resting state were identified between areas established as part of the sensorimotor network as well as frontal eye fields and prefrontal cortices, predominantly in the beta and gamma frequency bands. This study provides evidence for the use of MEG to identify task-specific functionally connected sensorimotor networks in a non-invasive, patient friendly manner. 9 2012 Bardouille, Boe.

40|$|After encoding, {{memories}} {{undergo a}} process of consolidation that determines long-term retention. For conditioned fear, animal models postulate that consolidation involves reactivations of neuronal assemblies supporting fear learning during postlearning "offline" periods. However, no human studies to date have investigated such processes, particularly in relation to long-term expression of fear. We tested 24 participants using functional MRI on 2 consecutive days in a fear conditioning paradigm involving 1 habituation block, 2 acquisition blocks, and 2 extinction blocks on day 1, and 2 re-extinction blocks on day 2. Conditioning blocks were preceded and followed by 4. 5 -min <b>rest</b> <b>blocks.</b> Strength of spontaneous recovery of fear on day 2 served {{as a measure of}} long-term expression of fear. Amygdala connectivity primarily with hippocampus increased progressively during postacquisition and postextinction rest on day 1. Intraregional multi-voxel correlation structures within amygdala and hippocampus sampled during a block of differential fear conditioning furthermore persisted after fear learning. Critically, both these main findings were stronger in participants who exhibited spontaneous recovery 24 h later. Our findings indicate that neural circuits activated during fear conditioning exhibit persistent postlearning activity that may be functionally relevant in promoting consolidation of the fear memory...|$|E
40|$|The dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC) and the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) {{are known}} to {{interact}} during motor coordination behavior. We previously discovered that the directional influences underlying this interaction in a visuo-motor coordination task are asymmetric, with the dACC→SMA influence being significantly greater than that in the reverse direction. To assess the specificity of this effect, here we undertook {{an analysis of the}} interaction between dACC and SMA in two distinct contexts. In addition to the motor coordination task, we also assessed these effects during a (n-back) working memory task. We applied directed functional connectivity analysis to these two task paradigms, and also to the rest condition of each paradigm, in which <b>rest</b> <b>blocks</b> were interspersed with task blocks. We report here that the previously known asymmetric interaction between dACC and SMA, with dACC→SMA dominating, was significantly larger in the motor coordination task than the memory task. Moreover the asymmetry between dACC and SMA was reversed during the rest condition of the motor coordination task, but not of the working memory task. In sum, the dACC→SMA influence was significantly greater in the motor task than the memory task condition, and the SMA→dACC influence was significantly greater in the motor rest than the memory rest condition. We interpret these results as suggesting that the potentiation of motor sub-networks during the motor rest condition supports the motor control of SMA by dACC during the active motor task condition...|$|E

Within a {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) scanner, a motor task, comprised move and <b>rest</b> <b>blocks,</b> was performed baseline and post stimulation. Anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS (1 mA - 20 minutes) were performed on the left M 1 in a within subject design (3 separate sessions per participant). Region of Interest (ROI) group baseline analysis for the contrast move>rest found the task activated all motor ROIs [p value < 0. 05, Family wise error (FWE) corrected].

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the role of pore {{residues}} on drug binding in the NaV 1. 8 channel. Alanine mutations {{were made in the}} S 6 segments, chosen {{on the basis of their}} roles in other NaV subtypes; whole cell patch clamp recordings were made from mammalian ND 7 / 23 cells. Mutations of some residues caused shifts in voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and gave faster time course of inactivation, indicating that the residues mutated play important roles in both activation and inactivation in the NaV 1. 8 channel. The resting and inactivated state affinities of tetracaine for the channel were reduced by mutations I 381 A, F 1710 A, and Y 1717 A (for the latter only inactivated state affinity was measured), and by mutation F 1710 A for the NaV 1. 8 -selective compound A- 803467, showing the involvement of these residues for each compound, respectively. For both compounds, mutation L 1410 A caused the unexpected appearance of a complete <b>resting</b> <b>block</b> even at extremely low concentrations. <b>Resting</b> <b>block</b> of native channels by compound A- 803467 could be partially removed (“disinhibition”) by repetitive stimulation or by a test pulse after recovery from inactivation; the magnitude of the latter effect was increased for all the mutants studied. Tetracaine did not show this effect for native channels, but disinhibition was seen particularly for mutants L 1410 A and F 1710 A. The data suggest differing, but partially overlapping, areas of binding of A- 803467 and tetracaine.

The mean percent reduction was 38. 3 ± 5. 8 % at 50 μM. Further, zonisamide shifted the inactivation curve approximately 20 mV negative compared to the control. These <b>resting</b> <b>blocking</b> actions suggest that zonisamide shifts the channel population toward the inactivation state, allowing fewer channels to open during membrane depolarization.

40|$|The default mode network (DMN) is a {{collection}} of brain areas found to be consistently deactivated during task performance. Previous neuroimaging studies of resting state have revealed reduced task-related deactivation of this network in autism. We investigated the DMN in 13 high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 14 typically developing control participants during three fMRI studies (two language tasks and a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) task). Each study had separate blocks of fixation/resting baseline. The data from the task blocks and fixation blocks were collated to examine deactivation and functional connectivity. Deficits in the deactivation of the DMN in individuals with ASD were specific only to the ToM task, with no group differences in deactivation during the language tasks or a combined language and self-other discrimination task. During <b>rest</b> <b>blocks</b> following the ToM task, the ASD group showed less deactivation than the control group in a number of DMN regions, including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus. In addition, we found weaker functional connectivity of the MPFC in individuals with ASD compared to controls. Furthermore, we were able to reliably classify participants into ASD or typically developing control groups based on both the whole-brain and seed-based connectivity patterns with accuracy up to 96. 3 %. These findings indicate that deactivation and connectivity of the DMN were altered in individuals with ASD. In addition, these findings suggest that the deficits in DMN connectivity could be a neural signature {{that can be used for}} classifying a...|$|E

40|$|N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) is {{responsible}} {{for the majority of the}} most prominent peak in (1) H-MR spectra, and has been used as diagnostic marker for several pathologies. However, ~ 10 % of this peak can be attributed to N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG), a neuropeptide whose release may be triggered by intense neuronal activation. Separate measurement of NAA and NAAG using MRS is difficult due to large superposition of their spectra. Specifically, in functional MRS (fMRS) experiments, most work has evaluated the sum NAA+NAAG, which does not appear to change during experiments. The aim of this work was to design and perform an fMRS experiment using visual stimulation and a spectral editing sequence, MEGA-PRESS, to further evaluate the individual dynamics of NAA and NAAG during brain activation. The functional paradigm used consisted of three blocks, starting with a <b>rest</b> (baseline) <b>block</b> of 320 s, followed by a stimulus block (640 s) and a <b>rest</b> <b>block</b> (640 s). Twenty healthy subjects participated in this study.

These results may relate to: 1) the only known NAAG synthesis pathway is from NAA and glutamate; 2) a relationship between NAAG and the BOLD response...|$|R
