50|$|Before {{sequencing}} was automated, {{it would}} have been prohibitively expensive to sequence an entire DNA strand. To find the relative positions of restriction sites on a plasmid, a technique involving single and double restriction digests is used.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of OM over traditional mapping techniques {{is that it}} preserves {{the order of the}} DNA fragment, whereas the order needs to be reconstructed using <b>restriction</b> <b>mapping.</b> In addition, since maps are constructed directly from genomic DNA molecules, cloning or PCR artifacts are avoided. However, each OM process is still affected by false positive and negative sites because not all restriction sites are cleaved in each molecule and some sites may be incorrectly cut. In practice, multiple optical maps are created from molecules of the same genomic region, and an algorithm is used to determine the best consensus map.|$|E
5000|$|When {{subjected}} to denaturing factors like increased heat or chemicals like formamide in low levels, DNA is partially denatured in a predictable pattern {{based on its}} nucleotide content in different regions. This allows unique fingerprints or ‘barcodes' to be generated for molecules with different sequences not unlike <b>restriction</b> <b>mapping.</b> In the earliest forms of denaturation mapping, DNA was denatured by heating in presence of formaldehyde [...] or glyoxal and visualized using electron microscopy. Dyes that selectively bind to double stranded DNA like ethidium bromide {{could be used to}} monitor the extent of denaturation. But {{it was not possible to}} observe locations of denaturation based on this information. And requirement of electron microscopy made this method more strenuous to perform.More recently microfluidics were used for denaturation mapping of single molecules. In this method a reservoir that contains individual stained DNA molecules is placed next to nanochannels. Under pressure the molecules are pushed towards the nanochannels, and stretch out. With the application of heat in the presence of formamide the molecules denature and while in these channels, denaturation profile of these molecules can be observed by fluorescence microscopy.|$|E

40|$|We use the {{extensive}} published information describing the genome of Escherichia coli and new <b>restriction</b> <b>map</b> alignment software to align DNA sequence, genetic, and physical <b>maps.</b> <b>Restriction</b> <b>map</b> alignment software is used which considers <b>restriction</b> <b>maps</b> as strings analogous to DNA or protein sequences except that two values, enzyme name and DNA base address, {{are associated with}} each position on the string. The resulting alignments reveal a nearly linear relationship between the physical and genetic maps of the E. coli chromosome. Physical map comparisons with the 1976, 1980, and 1983 genetic maps demonstrate a better fit with the more recent maps. The results of these alignments are genomic kilobase coordinates, orientation and rank of the alignment that best fits the genetic data. A statistical measure based on extreme value distribution {{is applied to the}} alignments. Additional computer analyses allow us to estimate the accuracy of the published E. coli genomic <b>restriction</b> <b>map,</b> simulate rearrangements of the bacterial chromosome, and search for repetitive DNA.

50|$|Two {{important}} contributors, Carroll and Porter, {{in their}} study of cloning the human C4 gene, which consists of 3 subparts (α, β, and γ subunits), showed that all six of their clones contained the same C4 gene. Regarding the subunits, the α-, β-, and γ-chains were before found to have molecular weights (MWs) of ~95,000, 78,000, and 31,000, respectively, all joined by interchain disulfide bridges. In a study by Roos et al., the α-chains between the C4A and C4B were found to be slightly different (MW of ~96,000 and 94,000, respectively), proving that there is actually a structural difference between the two variants. Moreover, they implicated that a lack of C4 activity could be attributed to the structural differences between the α-chains. Nevertheless, Carroll and Porter demonstrated that there is a 1,500-bp region that acts as an intron in the genomic sequence, which they believed to be the known C4d region, a byproduct of C4 activity. Carroll et al. later published work that characterized the structure and organization of the C4 genes, which are situated in the HLA class III region and linked with C2 and factor B on the chromosome. Through experiments involving <b>restriction</b> <b>mapping,</b> nucleotide sequence analysis, and hybridization with C4A and C4B, they found that the genes are actually fairly similar though they have their differences. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected, which allowed them to be class differences between C4A and C4B. Furthermore, class and allelic differences would affect the performance of the C4 proteins with the immune complex. Finally, by overlapping cDNA cloned fragments, they were able to determine that the C4 loci, an estimated 16 kilobase (kb) long, are spaced by 10 kb and aligned 30 kb from the factor B locus.|$|E
50|$|Extensive upland {{areas of}} the Australian Wet Tropics, such as the Atherton Tableland, were cleared for farming, largely between 1940 and 1990, leaving many {{scattered}} pockets of rainforest surrounded by open pasture. The Prickly Skink is abundant throughout this area has become a research subject for studies {{on the effect of}} habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity, gene flow and adaptation in a rainforest dependent species. A 1993 phylogeographic study by Moritz and co-authors using allozyme electrophoresis and <b>restriction</b> <b>mapping</b> of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes found distinct genetic lineages in populations from the northern and southern wet tropics. These areas are currently connected by a ribbon of rainforest habitat, around 15 km wide, known as the Black Mountain Corridor or BMC, but historical climate modeling suggest that rainforests in the northern and southern wet tropics were separated by around 50 km of dry habitats in this area during Pleistocene glacial climate periods. However, the deep divergence between these lineages suggests much longer genetic isolation, with an estimated separation time of over five million years, and these populations may represent different species. Further study of mtDNA and allozyme variation from sites around the Atherton Tablelands (within the Southern Lineage) revealed additional phylogeographic structure, with a divergence between populations around the Bellenden Ker / Wooroonooran Range, east of the Atherton Tableland, and those in the central and southern tablelands. The late-Pleistocene divergence between these lineages (>0.5% across the mtDNA genome) is an order of magnitude less than that between the Northern and Southern Wet Tropics but is indicative of emergence from separate glacial refugia. The larger Wooroonooran refugium maintained higher diversity through the glacial period than the southern Tableland refugium and this natural historical difference in genetic diversity is much greater than any more recent, human induced, effects of forest clearing and fragmentation. More detailed study of genetic variation in populations from the Atherton tableland, using mtDNA sequences and microsatellite loci, revealed a slight reduction in allelic diversity and in the pattern of isolation by distance among populations. Also, Sumner found relatedness among males within fragments was lower in isolated forest fragments than within continuous forests, possibly reflecting greater dispersal within fragments due to lower habitat quality. However, these relatively slight differences show the difficulty of detecting effects of recent habitat fragmentation in a species with relatively low local population size and limited dispersal. Sumner and co-authors did find other ecological effects of fragmentation; skink abundance was higher in continuous forest sites than in fragments, and was lower in small habitat patches than in large patches, and on average, skinks from fragments were smaller than those from continuous forests. Estimates of population density and dispersal distances from capture-recapture methods and from genetic data are broadly consistent, with a density varying from 65 - 136 individuals per ha, and a dispersal distance of 404 - 843 m2, respectively. Genetic estimates of relatedness among individuals found under the same log revealed that juveniles tend to stay with their parents for 1-2 years and subsequently disperse to other logs, with marked individuals observed 0 - 80 m away from their initial capture site over three years.|$|E
40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the course, we looked at genetic mapping, which is the problem of identify the relative order of genes on a chromosome. Now we will look at physical mapping. A physical map of the DNA tells the location of precisely defined sequences along the molecule. Physical mapping often deals with real distances and not just a relative ordering. We have two approaches for physical mapping: <b>Restriction</b> <b>mapping</b> and Hybridization mapping. <b>Restriction</b> <b>mapping</b> involves the mapping of restriction sites (precise short sequences) of a cutting enzyme based on the lengths of the restriction fragments. Hybridization mapping involves the mapping of clones (fragments) based on hybridization data with probes. The mapping of clones in this case is not exact; we try to find a likely overlap of the clones.

40|$|Maps of genomic or cloned DNA are {{frequently}} constructed {{by analyzing the}} cleavage patterns produced by restriction enzymes.

Furthermore, such maps provide a useful scaffold for the alignment and verification of sequence data. <b>Restriction</b> <b>maps</b> generated by computer and predicted from the sequence are aligned with the actual <b>restriction</b> <b>map.</b> <b>Restriction</b> enzyme action has traditionally been assayed by gel electrophoresis. This technique separates cleaved molecules {{on the basis of their}} nobilities under the influence of an applied electrical field, within a gel separation matrix (small fragments have a greater mobility than large ones). Although gel electrophoresis distinguishes different sized DNA fragments (known as a fingerprint), the original order of these fragments remains unknown.

DNA molecules were bound to derivatized glass surfaces, cleaved with NheI or BamHI, and imaged by digital fluorescence microscopy.
