A few of the busiest national <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>motorways</b> link the city to all of Romania's major cities, {{as well as to}} neighbouring countries such as Hungary, Bulgaria and Ukraine.

25|$|The city {{invested}} heavily in roads infrastructure, with an extensive system of arterial <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>motorways</b> that bisected the central area. There are also accusations that the Scottish Office had deliberately attempted to undermine Glasgow's economic and political influence in post-war Scotland by diverting inward investment in new industries to other regions during the Silicon Glen boom and creating the new towns of Cumbernauld, Glenrothes, Irvine, Livingston and East Kilbride, dispersed across the Scottish Lowlands to halve the city's population base.|$|E

25|$|Trams and railway lines shaped Auckland's rapid {{expansion}} in the early {{first half of the}} 20th century, but soon afterward the dominance of the motor vehicle emerged. This has not abated: arterial <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>motorways</b> have become both defining and geographically dividing features of the urban landscape. They also allowed further massive expansion that resulted in the growth of urban areas such as the North Shore (especially after the construction of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in the late 1950s), and Manukau City in the south.|$|E
25|$|The Highways Agency is the {{executive}} agency responsible for trunk <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>motorways</b> in England apart from the privately owned and operated M6 Toll. The Department for Transport states that traffic congestion {{is one of the}} most serious transport problems and that it could cost England an extra £22billion in wasted time by 2025 if left unchecked. According to the government-sponsored Eddington report of 2006, congestion is in danger of harming the economy, unless tackled by road pricing and expansion of the transport network.|$|E
25|$|On 15 April 2014, the Federal Government {{announced}} that Badgerys Creek would be Sydney's second international airport, {{to be known}} as Western Sydney Airport. Press releases suggest that the airport will not be subject to curfews and will open in phases, initially with a single airport runway and terminal. It would be linked to Sydney Airport by local <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>motorways,</b> and by extensions to the existing suburban rail network. In May 2017 the Federal Government announced it would build (pay for) the second Sydney Airport, after the Sydney Airport Group declined the Government's offer to build the second airport.|$|E

25|$|The N7 is {{the only}} one of the inter-urban routes out of Dublin which does not {{commence}} in Dublin city centre, but rather at the M50. The original N7 route (under the Local Government (<b>Roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>Motorways)</b> Act, 1974 (Declaration of National Roads) Order, 1977) started the route in Dublin city centre, like the other national routes, with the route originally running through Inchicore village before reaching the Naas Road. However in 1994, following the construction of the Chapelizod bypass which brought the N4 road into Dublin city centre as dual carriageway, the N7 inside the M50 was downgraded to regional road status (as the R110 road), with N7 traffic being signposted to use the N4 and M50 rather than the original route through Inchicore.|$|E

2500|$|The post-war years brought {{increased}} {{wealth and}} {{a demand for}} much greater mobility for people and goods. The number of road vehicles in Britain increased fivefold between 1950 and 1979, with similar trends in other Western nations.

The thesis explains the basic concepts, identifies the relevant legisla-tion and examines the appraising methods used for these easements as described in the literature. It then discusses and critically assesses, based on existing legislation and best practices, the indi-vidual appraising approaches used in expert opinions prepared for the <b>Road</b> <b>and</b> <b>Motorway</b> Di-rectorate of the Czech Republic. Drawing on this assessment, it makes recommendations for a standardized approach for establishing the fair market value of easements and demonstrates its application on a model example...|$|R

2500|$|In the 18th {{century the}} area was the cradle of Scotlands's Industrial Revolution, {{becoming}} the earliest major centre of the iron-casting industry. James Watt cast some of the beams for his early steam engine designs at the Carron Iron Works in 1765. [...] The area was {{at the forefront of}} canal construction when the Forth and Clyde Canal opened in 1790. [...] The Union Canal (1822) provided a link to Edinburgh and early railway development followed in the 1830s and 1840s. The canals brought economic wealth to Falkirk and led to the town's growth. Through time, trunk <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>motorways</b> followed the same canal corridors through the Falkirk area, linking the town with the rest of Scotland. Many companies set up work in Falkirk due to its expansion. A large brickworks was set up at this time, owned by the Howie family. During the 19th century, Falkirk became the first town in Great Britain to have a fully automated system of street lighting, designed and implemented by a local firm, Thomas Laurie & Co Ltd.|$|E
