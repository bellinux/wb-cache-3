40|$|Housing-policy {{research}} in European Union countries distinguishes between {{two kinds of}} rent control: non-targeted ""first-generation"" rent control and targeted ""second-generation"" rent control, the later which better reflects housing market relations. The article demonstrates the drastic consequences of first-generation rent control in the Czech Republic, using criteria of social effectiveness and economic efficiency. The authors present {{the results of an}} econometric simulation model on the determination of equilibrium market rents after <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation.</b> Due to a sharp decrease in housing affordability in the Czech Republic, the authors simulate the application of two housing-policy instruments: social housing and housing allowance. A cost-benefit analysis shows that <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation</b> and the application of effective policy instruments would substantially increase the income of landlords, decrease the level of currently biased market rents, and maintain the relative affordability of housing. housing policy; rent control; social housing; housing allowance...|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the actual issue of <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation</b> in the Czech Republic. The first part is dedicated to the economic theory of housing demand, housing supply and price control. Afterwards is analyzed the rental sector, focusing on the rent control from its beginning to the present. In the third part is discussed the process of deregulation, regarding the development of deregulation in our country and also the system of rent comparisons. The final part is concerned to the development of housing benefit in our country and is compared with the addressed rent allowance / housing, which is applied in the most of European countries. The main purpose of the thesis is to assess the current situation on the housing market and the economic and social effects of <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation.</b> The partial purpose is to find the appropriateness of implementation of the addressable allowance for the rent / housing...|$|E

It shows that after decades of decline, the private rental sector is now again gaining ground {{in at least some}} European countries. This apparent revival of the private rental sector is often enhanced by government interventions, such as <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation</b> and the provision of subsidies and fiscal concessions. In a number of countries, governments also try to get the private rental sector involved in the provision of social housing...|$|E

40|$|As {{deregulation}} {{takes place}} in the UK, rent tribunals are confronted with the problem of setting a “market rent” for previously controlled property. A simple partial equilibrium model of a sector of the rented accommodation market is used to examine the question of setting a “market rent” in the controlled-rent subsector. It is shown that setting the controlled rent equal to the rent prevailing in the uncontrolled part of the market is sub-optimal, and a simple formula is suggested which will give a better estimate of the true free market <b>rent.</b> Control, <b>Deregulation,</b> Housing, Legal tribunals, Rent and rates, United Kingdom...|$|R

The main aim of this thesis is to describe {{the historical development of}} regulated rents from the interwar period to the present. It is the aim of this thesis to establish a system of coefficients that will lead to solving the problem of determining the market <b>rent</b> after <b>deregulation.</b> This problem was solved on the basis of statistical processing created database offers rentals in Blansko.

40|$|We study {{a natural}} {{experiment}} in the Czech Republic where the maximum regulated rent appreciation has depended explicitly {{on the price of}} real estate since 2007. We track the tenure choice of households from consumption surveys for subsequent years. <b>Rent</b> <b>deregulation</b> makes households in regulated apartments more likely to own real estate while the opposite is true for other renters and owners. The net present value of buying property vs renting is an increasing function of the real estate price appreciation for renters in regulated apartments. We use their tenure choice to generate the distribution of property price expectations. Czech Republic; expectations; rent regulation and deregulation; real estate prices; tenure choice...|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} a problem of <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation,</b> which is currently in progress in the Czech Republic. In the theoretical part we get to know what actually the regulation is and why the deregulation was launched in the Czech Republic. Further there are discussed {{the problems associated with}} deregulation, continued by the question of maximum and minimum prices and the general view of economic regulation according to particular economic schools. In the operative part, the bachelor thesis seeks to analyze existing data of 2 cooperatives, whereas one is a subject to the deregulation and the another one is not. In the end, the thesis seeks to give an economic advice, to analyze the advantages, disadvantages and potential deregulation. The thesis analyses not only the impact of deregulation on cooperatives, but also on the ordinary citizens...|$|E
40|$|We use DEA-type linear {{programming}} techniques to simulate a basic component of educational reform-eliminating {{restrictions on the}} allocation of school personnel. Our technique allows us to identify potential output gains (or equivalently potential cost savings) from reform. We can also identify which personnel groups are likely to gain and lose under this reform. When we apply our model {{to a sample of}} Texas school districts, we find evidence that the educational establishment has substantial economic rents to protect from school reform, and that the primary beneficiaries of reform are likely to be affluent school districts with few minority students. The technique, which relies on the relationship between the direct and indirect distance functions, can be easily generalized to measure the potential gains from removing other input restrictions such as union work rules, environmental regulations, or deed restrictions. data envelopment analysis, school reform, distance functions, school efficiency, measuring potential gains from reform, measuring economic <b>rents,</b> input <b>deregulation...</b>|$|R
40|$|We study Pareto {{improvements}} whose implementation requires {{knowledge of}} only market prices and traded quantities, not utility and demand functions. Quantity stabilization gives agents {{the right to}} repeat the net trades they previously conducted, but requires policymakers to have records of those trades. While reasonable in some partial equilibrium contexts, such an assumption is implausible in general equilibrium. To diminish informational requirements further, we also consider price stabilization, which holds constant the relative prices that consumers face. Although price stabilizations do not achieve first-best efficiency, they lead to Pareto-improvements and production efficiency. Moreover, the production efficiency advantage persists under price stabilization but not under quantity stabilization when some firms are not profit-maximizers; this difference can be critical in transition policies for planned economies. In addition to planning, we consider several other applications of quantity and price stabilization, both partial equilibrium and general equilibrium: removal of <b>rent</b> controls, <b>deregulation</b> of a cross-subsidizing public utility, and the entry of an autarkic economy into world trad...|$|R
40|$|Rent seeking {{is often}} studied with {{reference}} to a contemporaneous rent evaluated {{at a point in}} time. We study the social cost of rent seeking when rents endure over time, but may have to be re-contested because of imperfect rent protection, or may disappear because of deregulation. The present value of a contested rent measures the social cost of rent seeking, irrespective of imperfect rent protection and the prospect of <b>deregulation.</b> <b>Rent</b> seeking is discouraged by the inability of governments to commit to protect rents and by their inability to commit to rent-generating regulations and policies. Moreover, lasting deregulation can preempt a substantial fraction of the potential rent seeking cost. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{evaluate}} the regulation and manner of deregulation in the Czech Republic. The first part describes regulation in general and interest groups approach to the deregulation of rents. In society there are many myths about rent control that are overturned at work. The rent control in the Czech Republic, the legal framework of regulation and regulation impacts are discussed in next part of the work. Then are described the impacts and possible ways of solving problems associated with deregulation. Ways of <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation</b> in selected foreign countries are compared with the way deregulation in the Czech Republic. In the practical part are analysed revenues and expenditures of owner of real estate property during the regulated years and modelled an example of fair rents made {{with regard to the}} cost of tenant and lessor...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the theme of <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation</b> in {{selected}} countries in Central and Eastern Europe, {{attention is paid to}} the comparison between the Czech Republic and Slovakia. There are theoretically described the characteristics and impacts of rent control and its possible elimination through privatization and deregulation. The thesis summarizes the specifics of regulation and deregulation process in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland since its beginning {{in the first half of}} the 20 th century to the present. It focuses on the Czech and Slovak law on unilateral rent increases and a Polish citizen's complaint to the European Court of Human Rights. The second part is devoted to a more detailed comparison of the impacts of regulation, such as the proportion of rental housing in the total housing stock and the rate of internal migration, in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and in their regions. The rate and speed of deregulation in both countries is also compared. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} an {{analysis}} of regional differences in rental housing affordability following <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation</b> in the Czech Republic. The objective is to identify the types of households potentially {{at risk of being}} unable to afford housing, to map the development of potential housing (un) affordability since 2000, and to trace the development of regional differences in the percentage of at-risk households in the Czech Republic. Owing to the absence of useful aggregate data on incomes and expenditures for different household types in the regions of the Czech Republic, the authors created their own simulation methodology for measuring housing affordability, which uses available regional wage statistics and data on market rents. The results indicate that the general risk of being unable to afford rental housing and regional differences in housing affordability are both decreasing, but there is still a relatively large group of households that under current wage conditions for paying social benefi ts would be unable to afford to pay market rents...|$|E

The theoretical part {{is dedicated to the}} economic theory of housing offer and demand, economic theory of state regulation of rent and on ways of abolishing these regulations. Furthermore it displays the regulation and deregulation process in our country. At the end of the theoretical part it shows the means of subsidising housing for the socially weak. The practical part covers a model example of three socially weak households, and demonstrates on them the evolution of <b>rent</b> during the <b>deregulation</b> period and the evolution of the subsequent housing subsidy. It also proposes alternative ways of boosting the socially weak households in the form of a negative income tax and customised finish housing allowance. Main contribution of this work is the evaluation of the whole deregulation process, used social policy tools and the suggestion of alternative means of social benefits...|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} New York City’s rent {{stabilization system}} and estimates {{the effects of}} total or partial deregulation. It finds that rent stabilization provides little benefit to residents of the outer boroughs and the lower and middle-income neighborhoods of Manhattan, while providing a substantial subsidy only to {{the residents of the}} relatively affluent areas of Lower and Mid-Manhattan. The report also finds rent increases for stabilized housing following deregulation would be significantly less than generally expected. Because residents of neighborhoods outside of the affluent part of Manhattan are not receiving significant subsidies, their rent increases would be minimal to non-existent. In the affluent areas of Lower and Mid-Manhattan, the substantial expansion of the unregulated housing market would create downward pressure on rent levels, making rent increases for stabilized housing less than might be expected. The report’s specific findings are as follows: • The median monthly subsidy provided by rent stabilization for all of New York City is $ 42. How-ever, under total <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation</b> the median monthly rent of subsidized housing would increase by only $ 8 due to the expansion of the unregulated market. Under vacancy deregulation, the me-dian monthly rent increase during the first two years would be $ 35...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{deregulation}} of rents in the Czech Republic was unusual {{because of its}} scope caused by huge market deformation, where prices in the regulated market were even four times lower {{than those in the}} free one. Nevertheless, we focused our research just on Prague's market, because the distortion there was the most significant and the market of flats with regulated rents was the biggest there. We aimed to analyse the impact of <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation</b> on prices of flats and to test the hypothesis that deregulation should cause an increase in their prices. For these reasons we conducted an econometric analysis of time series using FDL model, which showed us lagged effect of deregulation on flats' prices. Contrary to our expectations, we found out that in our case deregulation decreases general level of flats' prices. Thus we discussed variety of reasons, why it could be the case. Moreover we estimated the value of being a tenant in a regulated flat, as it had its market price due to differences between market and regulated rents. The findings of our study thus provide us with better understanding of impacts of liberalisation on regulated markets and could be helpful for improvements of deregulatory strategies for governments...|$|E
40|$|The {{condominium}} {{has become}} a popular form of ownership in Cambridge as it provides attractive benefits of homeownership without the physical responsibilities of maintaining a detached single-family home. Furthermore, as it is often a less expensive form of homeownership than single-family housing, it enables moderate income, first-time home buyers to have comparatively easier access to homeownership. During the time when much of the rental housing was under the rent control, condominium conversions were a means of releasing housing from the controls. Many of the landlords sought to convert their housing to condominium units even after strict ordinances were passed to limit the sales of such condominiums. This study seeks to investigate and explain the condominium conversion market after the termination of rent control, {{during the years of}} 1995 through 1998. The first objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the spatial pattern of Cambridge and its neighborhoods with regard to distributions of rentcontrolled housing, converted condominium units, rent-controlled units that were converted to condominiums and the median sales prices of condominium units. The second objective is to examine further the neighborhoods and better understand the condominium market of each neighborhood. Using the data on rent controlled residential units in 1994 and residential condominium units assessed for the fiscal year 2000, we employed Geographic Information System to visually present the spatial housing patterns in Cambridge. Most importantly, we analyzed the phenomenon of condominium conversions after <b>rent</b> <b>deregulation</b> and the findings indicate that less than 2 percent of the rent controlled units in 1994 were converted to condominiums during the period of 1995 through 1998. Most of the conversions and new construction of condominiums were in five of the neighborhoods whose residents have relatively high income levels, and in which there are greater number of non-family households, young professionals, and owner-occupied dwellings. The pattern of sales price by neighborhood is also examined during the 1995 - 1998 period. by Yoon-jung Kim. Thesis (S. M.)
