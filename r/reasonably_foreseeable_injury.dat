50|$|The {{next step}} after Dillon {{was to make}} {{optional}} the element of another person (so that the injury could be to anything {{where it would be}} <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable</b> that such <b>injury</b> would cause some person emotional distress). The first such case was Rodrigues v. State, in which the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that plaintiffs could recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress as a result of negligently caused flood damage to their home. This is generally considered to be the true birth of NIED as a separate tort.|$|R

This paper describes the risks and consequences to the public from accidents that are highly unlikely but that could have severe consequences.

50|$|The {{traditional}} approach was {{that once a}} breach in the duty of care had been established, a defendant was liable for all the consequent damage no matter how unusual or unpredictable that damage might be. In Re Polemis while docked, workers employed to unload the ship negligently dropped a plank into the hold, which struck something, causing a spark that ignited petrol vapour lying in the hold. The fire destroyed the whole ship. The Lords held that although the fire was not a <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable</b> consequence of the plank falling, {{there had been a}} breach of the duty of care and all damage representing a direct consequence of the negligent act was recoverable. It was determined that once some harm was foreseeable, the defendant would be liable for {{the full extent of the}} harm. That particular consequences are possible does not make them <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable.</b> This will particularly be the case when there are a significant number of links constituting the chain. The more links, the less likely that consequence may be considered <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Giving {{the lead}} {{judgment}} in the Court of Appeal, Lord Denning held that Lord Reid {{had been wrong}} on the grounds, firstly, that the [...] "very likely" [...] test would stretch the liability of defendants too far {{and that it was}} a householder's duty to insure their property, secondly, that this test ran counter to the case of Stansbie v. Troman 1948 2 K.B. 48, where damage was unlikely but <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable</b> (and therefore recoverable), and thirdly, that this test ran counter to the Wagon Mound cases 1961 A.C. 388; 1967 1 A.C. 617 by which a tortfeasor was liable for all damage that was <b>reasonably</b> <b>foreseeable</b> however unlikely.|$|R
