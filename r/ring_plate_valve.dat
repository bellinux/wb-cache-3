Coated <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> and bronze <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> showed a steady state of friction coefficient at approximately 0. 03 and 0. 06, respectively after about 1000 rpm, but steel <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> without coating showed a continuous decrease in friction coefficient, which suggested that active wear is continuously occurring. By applying CrZrN coating on the commercial cylinder barrel and steel <b>valve</b> <b>plate,</b> much improved tribological results could be obtained, by a factor of approximately 2 in terms of friction coefficient than those from bronze <b>valve</b> <b>plate.</b> Under a tap water environment CrZrN coating appeared to perform better than CrSiN coating.

Cyclic loading tests on the cross-shaped connections are carried out by using MTS servo loading system. Comparative analyses are conducted based on the experimental results including hysteretic curves, skeleton curves and stiffness degradation curves as well as ductility coefficients of cyclic loading tests. Furthermore, effects of geometric parameters of ring-stiffened plate, axial compression ratio and backing plate on the deformation performance of cross-shaped connections are analyzed. The {{results show that the}} increase of width of <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> and the shape change of <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> from square to circle can both significantly improve the ductility and the hysteretic characteristics of connection. It is emphasized that the specimen with square <b>ring</b> <b>plates</b> is of better deformation performance but lower bearing capacity than the ones with circular <b>ring</b> <b>plates.</b> Besides, the backing plates always have positive effects on the hysteretic characteristics, ductility and energy dissipation of the CFST column connections. Conversely, the increase of axial compression ratio contributes negatively to both the bearing capacity and deformation performance of the connection specimens. It can be concluded that the presented cross-shaped connection is of good deformation performance relating to hysteretic characteristics, energy dissipation and ductility, which can provide reference towards engineering practice with potential perspective application...|$|R

The {{variable}} cross-section H-type structure, {{which is}} used in the new type of heat exchanger with longitudinal flow of shell side, could reduce the scour action of imports fluid on the tube bundle and prevent vibration of the tube bundle. It could also improve the state of the shell side fluid flow, reducing the flow dead zone, allowing for a more efficient use of the heat transfer area and improving the energy efficiency. The new structure will make the temperature and stress distribution in the heat distribution more complex, so it is necessary to analyze the stress intensity of the variable cross-section H-type structure. A three-dimensional finite element model of the variable cross-section H-type structure is established in this paper, and the surface temperature of the various parts of the heat exchanger are determined through temperature analysis. Using ANSYS Workbench software, thermal-stress analysis of the H-type structure with different structural parameters is tested, and the temperature and stress field are obtained. The results show that a Ring plate of H-type structure has a larger temperature gradient along the thickness direction. The maximum stress of the heat exchanger is 203. 13 MPa, which occurred on the connections of the <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> and jacket in the lower temperature side. The <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> thickness of the H-type structure has a significant influence on its maximum stress.

This study aims to reduce the noise emitted from an axial piston pump using a novel <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> utilizing damping holes. A dynamic pump model is developed, in which the fluid properties are carefully modeled to capture the phenomena of air release and cavitation. The causes of different noise sources are investigated using the model.

A multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization method is proposed to optimize the parameters of <b>valve</b> <b>plate.</b> The amplitudes of the swash plate moment and flow rates in the inlet and outlet ports are defined as the objective functions. The pressure overshoot and undershoot in the piston chamber are limited by properly constraining the highest and lowest pressure values. A comparison of the various noise sources between the original and optimized designs over a wide range of pressure levels shows that the noise sources are reduced at high pressures. The results of the sound pressure level measurements show that the optimized <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> reduces the noise level by 1.6  dB(A) at the rated working condition.
