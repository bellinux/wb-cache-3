50|$|DHB Bank’s {{activities}} are anchored in traditional commercial banking, {{based primarily on}} <b>retail</b> <b>funding</b> (and wholesale funding to a certain extent) and mainly wholesale asset generation (again relatively small retail asset generation). DHB Bank’s business model and revenue stream fully rely on real banking transactions, {{and there is no}} reliance on any kind of speculative income. Therefore, the bank tries to minimize the market risk by avoiding FX position or interest rate position, and derivative transactions are mainly done for assets and liabilities hedging purposes. Against the backdrop of its mission statement and vision statement, the bank conducts its activities through the executional authorities and responsibilities of the Managing Board (MB), {{under the supervision of the}} Supervisory Board (SB), and cascades these down throughout the organization founded on different building blocks (i.e. departments and functions).|$|E
50|$|After an {{influence}} of more modern thinking and {{helped by the}} 1986 act which lifted many hurdles it faced with competing with retail banks it soon recovered and branches were re-opened at Wombwell and Mexborough. Offices at Royston and Hemsworth soon followed but these were short lived and closed in 1989. During the early 1990s the society expanded once again and new branches were opened in Wakefield, Rotherham and Chesterfield. In 2001 the society's Wombwell and Mexborough offices were re-located to better premises and the Wombwell branch was refurbished shortly afterwards in 2006, during which period the society operated from a temporary location in Wombwell council offices. During the mid-1990s the society opened a second Barnsley office in the town's Alhambra Centre. Also during the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s the society carried out a rapid agency expansion programme and agencies were opened throughout Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire {{as well as more}} local sites such as Wath, Royston and Penistone, however due to increased costs and declining <b>retail</b> <b>funding</b> these agencies were closed in early 2006. In 2004 it was decided to merge the Church street and Alhambra branches and the society opened a new flagship branch on Cheapside, a prime location within Barnsley town centre.|$|E

40|$|We {{study how}} a Net Stable Funding Ratio {{as defined by}} the Basel Committee in 2014 (NSFR (2014)) would affect the {{profitability}} of German banks and their capacity to lend. With a NSFR-model that is partially calibrated against reported NSFRs, we find that 9 % of German banks do not comply with the NSFR (2014). This is a significant reduction compared to the 39 % that we find for its prior definition, the NSFR (2010), for the same sample. Structurally, banks that do not comply with the NSFR (2014) hold less liquid assets, rely less on <b>retail</b> <b>funding,</b> but more on short-term market funding and are more highly leveraged. A microeconomic model applied to each of the 163 non-compliant banks suggests that they would engage in 70 different strategies to become compliant. All strategies are growth strategies and none of them cuts lending. On average, banks would see their Return on Assets dropping once by moderate 10 bps. Our conclusion is that an introduction of the NSFR (2014) as minimum standard is unlikely to exhibit adverse consequences for credit supply and bank profitability...|$|E
40|$|Governments may be {{interested}} to develop the retail market for government debt {{for a number of}} reasons - for example, to broaden the investor base for public sector funding, to encourage the habit of saving among the population, or to stimulate the development of financial instruments and markets more generally. There are two main avenues for such <b>retail</b> <b>funding.</b> One is to sell to retail investors those marketable securities which are predominantly bought by wholesale investors. The other is to design non-marketable securities which are specifically targeted at, and possibly limited to, individuals and households. This Handbook discusses the way in which the needs of retail investors may differ from those of wholesale investors, and the particular attributes which may therefore attach to retail instruments, or to procedures for retail investment, in order to attract the small investor. The logistics of selling securities to a potentially large number of small investors are examined. Questions of taxation, marketing and regulation are also briefly reviewed. The experience of different countries, notably the United Kingdom but also some in central and eastern Europe, is drawn upon. This handbook is also available in Russian and Spanish.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the pattern of}} investment by Australian defined-contribution superannuation funds in illiquid assets, using a unique but confidential database. Not-for-profit funds allocate more of their portfolios to illiquid assets, on average, than <b>retail</b> <b>funds.</b> Their allocations reflect fund size, net cash inflows and member age — factors relevant to a fund’s liquidity requirements. Furthermore, the allocations reflect {{the extent of the}} fund’s in-house investment management.

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the role of the {{household}} sector and the retail banking services provided to this market. Italian banking for households can be defined as the cluster of investment, payment, and lending services offered to households as depositors or consumers, through direct distribution channels (branches), virtual channels (telephone, Internet, call centres, and ATMs), and indirect channels (agents, credit brokers, commercial dealers, etc.). The aim of the analysis is to identify the role and contribution of banking for households in improving stability and mitigating the effects of the financial crisis From the capitalisation point of view, it should be remembered that retail banking absorbs smaller than corporate lending amounts of regulatory capital. Together with a low funding gap (measured by the proportion of loans not financed by <b>retail</b> <b>funding),</b> in general this bank financial equilibrium and operating model mitigated the consequences of the 2007 financial crisis, leading to fewer liquidity and credit rationing problems, especially amongst the smallest banks. On the assets side, loans to households and companies account for the majority of the lending portfolio. This assets make-up helped to reduce the fall in the banks’ economic value arising from the slump in the market value of financial assets as a result of the crisis, although it left them exposed to the credit risk generated by the resulting recession. The contribution of savings by retail customers (households) to banks, and the high incidence of transactional and precautionary savings in Italian households’ current accounts, were vital in financing banks in the most critical periods of the financial crisis (2007 – 09), and they are also mitigating the economic and financial effects of the current fresh difficulties on the financial markets for Italian banks. From a corporate point of view, the large number of customers tends to stabilize the banking business’s volumes and margins by providing naturally diversified, granular loan and deposit portfolios. Within a bank’s operations, retail banking brings stability to profit margins, since it tends to compensate the trend in income from services (non-interest income and fees) against the trend in the net interest margin...|$|E
40|$|Within {{this study}} we propose {{different}} measures to prove the influence of prior <b>retail</b> <b>fund</b> performance on fund flows. In contrast to previous literature, our work indicates that investors behave directly and in a selective manner by redeeming their shares of poor performing funds. By using a large data set of 1672 <b>retail</b> <b>funds</b> in Germany from March 2008 to April 2010 {{we are able to}} underscore that in general, both the prior performance of funds and the prior net redemptions have a statistically significant influence on outflows of funds. Moreover, it seems likely that investors react faster to market signals by withdrawing their shares in crisis situations than in previous decades that might be due to lower cost of information. Our findings can serve as a warning signal for policy-makers, regulatory authorities and the fund industry to establish a strong regulatory framework to prevent liquidity shortages of <b>retail</b> <b>funds...</b>|$|R

30|$|During {{the last}} two decades the area of {{socially}} responsible investments (SRI) has grown substantially. Between 1995 and 2012 SRI assets in the US rose more than 480  % to $ 3.74 trillion in 2012 (Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (2013)). The German market grew about 9  % with respect to 2012 values. In 2013 it is estimated to have a value of € 79.9 billion (FNG (2014)). One possibility for private investors to participate in the SRI market is to invest in socially responsible (SR) funds. According to the FNG (2014), € 12.7 billion are invested in roughly 300 SR <b>retail</b> <b>funds</b> that are available in Germany. Currently, this corresponds to 1.8  % of the total volume of the German mutual <b>retail</b> <b>fund</b> market. Therefore, it has great potential to grow strongly in the following years, especially when Germany is compared to The Netherlands, the European frontrunner, where SR <b>retail</b> <b>funds</b> amount almost to a total of 15.4  % of the volume of the Dutch mutual <b>retail</b> <b>fund</b> market (see Vigeo Rating (2013)). SR funds in Germany mostly practice negative screening and/or follow a best in class investment approach (see FNG (2014)). When the performance of SR and conventional <b>retail</b> <b>funds</b> domiciled in Germany are compared, no significant underperformance of SR funds can be found (Cortez et al. 2009, 2012; Renneboog et al. 2008; Kreander et al. 2005; Bauer et al. 2005; Schröder 2004; Kreander et al. 2002)). Globally, there are more than 100 studies concerning the performance of SR funds (e.g., Chegut et al. 2011; Rathner 2013; von Wallis and Klein 2014). Capelle-Blancard and Monjon (2012) point out that “maybe too much {{attention has been paid to}} this issue”. Therefore, we want to add to the “few studies [which] examine the aspirations of SRI investors”.|$|R
