25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror,</b> and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|E
25|$|Both VAM Rebel-based Rambler Classics {{included}} {{almost the}} same equipment between the two body styles {{with only a few}} exceptions. The largest difference was in the front seats. The Classic 770 came with full-width bench seat while the Classic SST had individually adjustable units, even though some of the hardtops came with a front bench. The standard features included flow-through ventilation, front door flip-open air vents, four-wheel drum brakes, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, day-night <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror,</b> two-speed electric wipers, electric washers, luxury steering wheel, electric clock, 200km/h speedometer, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, AM Motorola radio with antenna, locking glove box, courtesy lights, dual rear ashtrays, four side armrests, front two-point seatbelts, dual coat hooks, dual dome lights on C-pillars (except 1969-1970 sedan), single dome light on headliner (1969-1970 sedan only), fold-down armrest integrated to the rear seat back, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, back-up lights, turn lights, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment for both models included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, automatic transmission (not available in 1967 and 1968), remote controlled driver and passenger outside mirrors, heater with front defroster, rubber-faced bumper guards, bumper tubes, and a locking gas cap, among others. Sales the two-door hardtop body style declined in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Buick's largest, plushest {{and most}} {{expensive}} models were restyled for 1963, with distinctive rear fenders {{culminating in a}} sharp vertical edge housing narrow back-up lights. The taillights were horizontally placed in the vertical deck cove. A unique cast grille was used at the front. Bright wheelhouse and lower body moldings, with ribbed rear fender panels were used. Red-filled Electra 225 badges {{were found on the}} rear fenders, while four VentiPorts lent status to the front fenders. Interiors were cloth and vinyl combinations, while a Custom interior in vinyl and leather, with front bucket seats and a storage console, was available for the convertible and sport coupe. Standard equipment included directional signals, full-flow oil filter, dual speed electric windshield wiper/washers, Deluxe steering wheel, cigar lighter, Step-On parking brake, dual armrests, Turbine-Drive automatic transmission, padded dashboard, heater, defroster, glovebox light, back-up lights, power steering, Glare-proof <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror,</b> power brakes, parking brake signal light, safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seats, power windows, Super Deluxe wheelcovers, Safety option group, custom padded cushions, Accessory Group options and custom moldings. Buick dropped the Riviera name as a body style designation after the 1963 model year, shifting the Riviera name exclusively to Buick's new personal luxury coupe that had been introduced in 1963. Buick added a 7-way tilt steering wheel and a new cruise control as an option.|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that nonpictorial distance cues, including accommodation and binocular disparity, play at most a minor role in driving relative to pictorial cues, such as relative size and linear perspective. However, the possibility that nonpictorial cues play a nontrivial role {{in at least some}} driving situations is of interest because of current and proposed applications of camerabased displays in driving. Such applications include the use of video systems as replacements for <b>rearview</b> <b>mirrors</b> and to enhance forward vision at night. By their nature, camera-based displays selectively eliminate or distort nonpictorial distance cues. This paper reviews analytical and experimental approaches for determining the relative importance of pictorial and nonpictorial cues in driving, and discusses the implications for the use of camera-based displays, as well as nonplanar <b>rearview</b> <b>mirrors...</b>|$|R

500|$|The {{change in}} {{position}} of the guns and {{the extension of the}} air intakes, which looked [...] "uncannily like a double-barreled shotgun," [...] allowed the nosewheel to be moved forward to lengthen the wheelbase. The guns were mounted behind the nosewheel well and a special shield was added to protect the gun barrels from debris thrown up by the nosewheel; it was mechanically linked to the nosewheel and extended when it did. Other changes included the replacement of the original AM-5F engines by the Tumansky RD-9V, an improved version of the AM-5F, the normal bombload was increased to 1,000kg and [...] in overloaded condition, and a <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror</b> was added to allow the pilot to better observe the rear upper hemisphere.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were also}} positive; Sal Cinquemani form Slant Magazine {{suggested}} that [...] "The Fear" [...] is {{proof of the}} pop singer's self-awareness, but, given her own personal tabloid history, the song possesses a trail of irony: [...] "I'll look at The Sun and I'll look in The Mirror/I'm on the right track, yeah, we're onto a winner." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly liked the song, in which Allen makes fun of her own material-girl ID {{and went on to}} say that it is in fact [...] "a tale of two Lilys: the naughty postadolescent in the <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror,</b> and the fully realized female coming around the bend." [...] Chris Buckle from The Skinny gave [...] "The Fear" [...] three stars, commenting that it [...] "is a potent reminder that she's more than just gobby gossip-fodder", but also disliked a few lyrics, which [...] "in particular [...] a clumsy attempt to inject politics amongst the celeb-woe naval-gazing", while About.com praised the song for being a [...] "pop masterpiece", Allen's [...] "witty intelligent lyrics" [...] and compared it to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls".|$|E

[...] "The title means fifty-five miles per hour on the button, like we were Johnny Conservative." [...] Dirk Vandenberg, the band's [...] "buddy/contributor," [...] took photos from the backseat as Watt drove under the sign to San Pedro; it took three circuits of the highway and two days of photography before Minutemen were happy with the cover. Vandenberg later commented on the cover art: [...] "There were three elements that Mike [...] wanted in the photo: a natural kind of glint in his eyes reflected in the <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror,</b> the speedometer pinned exactly at 55mph, and, of course, the San Pedro sign guiding us home". However, when the cover was presented to SST, [...] "someone botched the cropping for the print and cut off the end of the word Pedro." ...|$|E

Coyne said, [...] "Stephen [...] {{seems to be}} a fan of the weirder music of the late '80s and early '90s He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then." [...] Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused, saying [...] "I don't want any of those sort of commercial weirdos on there. I don't like those commercial people.

[...] Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News said, [...] "Most TV shows, after all, quickly fade from memory. This one will haunt your dreams." [...] Hank Stuever from The Washington Post said in his review that [...] "overdoing things is one of Murphy's trademark flaws, but this show has a captivating style and giddy gross-outs."
