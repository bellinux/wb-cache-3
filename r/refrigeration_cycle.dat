25|$|This {{consists}} of a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycle,</b> where heat is removed from a low-temperature space or source and rejected to a high-temperature sink {{with the help of}} external work, and its inverse, the thermodynamic power cycle. In the power cycle, heat is supplied from a high-temperature source to the engine, part of the heat being used to produce work and the rest being rejected to a low-temperature sink. This satisfies the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{naturally}} {{flows from}} hot to cold. Work {{is applied to}} cool a living space or storage volume by pumping heat from a lower temperature heat source into a higher temperature heat sink. Insulation is used to reduce the work and energy needed to achieve and maintain a lower temperature in the cooled space. The operating principle of the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycle</b> was described mathematically by Sadi Carnot in 1824 as a heat engine.|$|E
25|$|The Carnot {{heat-engine}} cycle described is {{a totally}} reversible cycle. That is, all the processes that comprise it can be reversed, in which case it becomes the Carnot <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycle.</b> This time, the cycle remains exactly the same except that the directions of any heat and work interactions are reversed. Heat is absorbed from the low-temperature reservoir, heat is rejected to a high-temperature reservoir, and a work input is required to accomplish all this. The P-V diagram of the reversed Carnot cycle {{is the same as}} for the Carnot cycle except that the directions of the processes are reversed.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a class of irreversible Carnot <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycles</b> operating between two heat reservoirs at a low temperature TL and a high temperature TH, for which the only irreversibility results from the finite rate of heat conduction, is studied.

Moreover, the optimal performance of these cycles is discussed {{and the effect of}} different heat transfer laws on the optimal performance is investigated.

Expressions for the main parameters of the system are derived. By using the optimal control theory, the minimum total power input of the system with non-zero cooling rates is calculated and the temperatures of the working fluid in the isothermal processes of the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycles</b> are optimized. The optimal allocation of the heat-transfer areas of the heat-exchangers in the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycles</b> is discussed in detail.

25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} more {{effective}} for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because the compressor's input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has {{the net effect of}} heating up the room rather than cooling it, because its <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycle</b> rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat pump}} uses an {{electrically}} driven compressor {{to operate a}} <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycle</b> that extracts heat energy from outdoor air, the ground or ground water, and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. A liquid contained within the evaporator section of the heat pump boils at low pressure, absorbing heat energy from the outdoor air or the ground. The vapor is then compressed by a compressor and piped into a condenser coil within the building to be heated. The heat from the hot dense gas is absorbed by {{the air in the}} building (and sometimes also used for domestic hot water) causing the hot working fluid to condense back into a liquid. From there the high pressure fluid is passed back to the evaporator section where it expands through an orifice and into the evaporator section, completing the cycle. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed to move heat out of the conditioned space and to the outside air.|$|E
500|$|Despite an {{incomplete}} {{understanding of the}} principles behind them, in some ways Evans's thinking {{about the potential for}} steam engines was once again far ahead of its time. In the postscript of the Steam Engineer's Guide, Evans noted that drawing a vacuum on water reduces its boiling point and cools it. He further observed that a vacuum would have the same effect upon ether, and the resulting cooling should be sufficient to produce ice. He went on to describe a piston vacuum pump apparatus to produce this effect, and also showed that a compression cylinder, or the compression stroke of the vacuum pump, should produce heat in a condenser. Thus Evans had produced the first detailed and theoretically coherent design for a vapor-compression refrigerator, identifying all the major components (expander, cooling coil, compressor and condenser) of a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycle,</b> leaving some to credit him as the 'grandfather of refrigeration'. [...] Although Evans never developed a working model of his designs, and {{there is no evidence that}} he ever attempted to, Evans in his later life worked and associated extensively with fellow inventor Jacob Perkins on steam engines and the potential for refrigeration. Perkins would later develop and build a refrigeration device for which he received patents in 1834–1835, employing much the same principles originally put forward by Evans.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{technical}} challenges have often hindered the economical application of <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycles</b> using water (R 718) as refrigerant.

40|$|The {{relation}} between the geometry of <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycles</b> and their performance is explored. The model studied {{is based on a}} coupled spin system. Small cycle times termed sudden refrigerators, develop coherence and inner friction. We explore the interplay between coherence and energy of the working medium employing a family of sudden cycles with decreasing cycle times. At the point of minimum ratio between energy and coherence the cycle changes geometry. This region of cycle times is characterised by short circuit cycles where heat is dissipated both to the hot and cold baths. We rationalise the cycle change of geometry {{as a result of a}} half integer quantisation which maximises coherence. From this point on, increasing or decreasing the cycle time, eventually leads to <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycles.</b> The transition point between refrigerators and short circuit cycles is characterised by a transition from finite to singular dynamical temperature. Extremely short cycle times reach a universal limit where all cycles types are equivalent...|$|R
2500|$|Alternatively, {{thermal energy}} is {{transferred}} to water, which is then used to heat the building via radiators or underfloor heating.

[...] The refrigerant is then allowed to expand, cool, and absorb heat from the outdoor temperature in the outside evaporator, and the cycle repeats. This is a standard <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycle,</b> save that the [...] "cold" [...] side of the refrigerator (the evaporator coil) is positioned so it is outdoors where the environment is colder.|$|E
2500|$|The gas {{cycle is}} less {{efficient}} than the vapor compression cycle because the gas cycle {{works on the}} reverse Brayton cycle instead of the reverse Rankine cycle. [...] As such the working fluid does not receive and reject heat at constant temperature. In the gas cycle, the refrigeration effect {{is equal to the}} product of the specific heat of the gas and the rise in temperature of the gas in the low temperature side. Therefore, for the same cooling load, a gas <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycle</b> needs a large mass flow rate and is bulky.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the liquid}} side of these heat exchangers, the common fluids are water, a water-glycol solution, steam, or a refrigerant.

Chilled water is supplied from a chiller that is potentially located very far away, but refrigerant must come from a nearby condensing unit.

An air conditioning system with two parallel <b>refrigeration</b> <b>cycles</b> consisting of two compressors and two condensers for satisfying the required cooling performance of the special purpose vehicle was tested under extremely hot weather conditions and high thermal load conditions and then optimized by varying the refrigerant charge amount. The optimum refrigerant charge amount of the tested air conditioning system was 1200 g with the consideration of the cooling speed and cooling capacity. The indoor temperatures of the suggested air conditioning system at the refrigerant charge amounts of 1200 g, 1400 g, and 1600 g were 24. 7 °C, 25. 2 °C, and 26. 4 °C, respectively, at the elapsed time of 300 s. The cooling time required to reach a 15. 0 °C  inner temperature in the suggested air conditioning system increased by 13. 3 % with the decrease of the refrigerant charge amount from 1600 g to 1200 g. The cooling capacity and the coefficient of performance (COP) of the suggested air conditioning system increased by 37. 9 % and 10. 9 %, respectively, due to a decrease of the refrigerant charge amount from 1600 g to 1200 g.
