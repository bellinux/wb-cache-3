40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the plate waste, energy and selected-nutrient intake, from elderly residents {{living in a}} high-level care (HLC) and low-level care (LLC) facility. Design: Three, single, whole day assessments of plate waste, energy, and selected nutrients, using a visual <b>rating</b> <b>plate</b> waste scale. Setting: Long-term residential care establishment. Subjects: One hundred and sixty-nine (93 HLC and 76 LLC) individual daily intakes. Main findings: The mean energy wasted throughout the whole day was 17 %. The energy wasted from main meals (16 %) was significantly less than the energy wasted at mid-meals (22 %, P = 0. 049). The lowest mean energy wastage occurred at breakfast (8 %) compared to lunch (22 %) and dinner (25 %, P < 0. 001). The mean (s. d.) daily energy served and consumed was 8. 1 (2. 0) and 6. 6 (2. 2) MJ, respectively. There {{was no difference in}} energy served or consumed between HLC and LLC residents. On the observation day, 60 % of residents consumed less than their estimated energy requirement. The mean calcium intake was 796 (346) mg, and the median (inter-quartile range) vitamin D intake was 1. 78 (2. 05) μ g. Conclusion: On 1 day, more than half the residents surveyed were at risk of consuming an inadequate energy intake, which over-time, may result in body weight loss. Although wastage was not excessive and energy served was adequate, the amount of food eaten was insufficient to meet energy and calcium requirements for a significant number of residents and {{it is not possible to}} consume sufficient vitamin D through food sources. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{how to provide}} standardized, current based, differential protection for any three-phase power transformer, including phase-shifting transformers with variable phase angle shift and transformers of all construction types and internal on-load tap-changer configurations. The use of standard transformer differential protection for such applications is considered impossible in the protective relaying standards and practices currently applied. The {{first part of the}} thesis provides the background for different types of power transformers and the differential protection schemes currently applied. After that a complete mathematical proof for the new, universal transformer differential protection principle, based on theory of symmetrical components, is derived. It is demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} make numerical differential protection relays which can properly calculate differential currents for any power transformer, regardless of whether it is of fixed or variable phase angle shift construction and whether current magnitude variations are caused by on-load tapchanger(s). It is shown how to correctly calculate differential currents by simultaneously providing on-line compensation for current magnitude variations, on-line compensation for arbitrary phase angle shift variations and settable zero-sequence current reduction on any power transformer side. By using this method differential protection for arbitrary power transformers will be ideally balanced for all symmetrical and nonsymmetrical through-load conditions and external faults. The method is independent of individual transformer winding connection details (i. e. star, delta or zigzag), but dependent on having the correct information about actual on-load tap-changer(s) position if they are built-in within the protected power transformer. The implementation and practical use of this new universal principle is quite simple, as all necessary transformer data is commonly available on the protected power transformer <b>rating</b> <b>plate.</b> Practical application of the universal method for the differential protection of standard transformers, special transformers and phase shifting transformer is presented. Detailed testing of this new universal differential protection method is given and it is based on actual field recordings captured by numerical relays in existing phase-shifting transformer installations and on simulations from the Real Time Digital Simulator for a practical dual-core, symmetrical phaseshifting transformer. The implementation of the universal transformer differential method for analogue and numerical transformer differential relays is also described. Problems for the differential protection caused by transformer inrush currents are discussed. The mathematical relationship between differential protection and directional protection is derived. Then it is shown that through the addition of supplementary directional criteria security and speed of the operation of the transformer differential protection can be improved. Finally, the use of additional directional criteria to significantly improve the sensitivity of the differential protection for transformer winding turn-to-turn faults is suggested. Captured disturbance files from numerical differential relays in actual power transformer installations, during internal and external faults, have been used to demonstrate the performance of additional directional criteria...|$|E

50|$|As {{many areas}} of the ocean floor, {{particularly}} the Atlantic Ocean, are currently inactive, {{it can be difficult to}} determine past plate motion. However, by observing the fracture zones, one can determine both the direction and <b>rate</b> of past <b>plate</b> motion. This is found by observing the patterns of magnetic striping on the ocean floor (a result of the reversals of Earth's magnetic field over time). By measuring the offset in the magnetic striping, one can then determine the <b>rate</b> of past <b>plate</b> motions. In a similar method, one can use the relative ages of the seafloor on either side of a fracture zone to determine the <b>rate</b> of past <b>plate</b> motions.

The combination of tidal components also depends on location, a complication {{for the analysis of}} rhythmites. The pattern for each tidal component can be combined into a global series of spherical harmonic functions.

In this work the metallized films were developed by electroless copper plating of polyethylene films grafted with vinyl ether of monoethanoleamine. There are several techniques for metal deposition on surface of polymers such as evaporation, sputtering, electroless plating and electrolysis. In this work the metallized films were developed by electroless copper plating of polyethylene films grafted with vinyl ether of monoethanoleamine. Polyethylene films were subjected to gamma-radiation induced surface graft copolymerization with vinyl ether of monoethanolamine. Electroless copper plating was carried out effectively on the modified films. The catalytic processes for the electroless copper plating in the presence {{and the absence of}} SnCl 2 sensitization were studied and the optimum activation conditions that give the highest <b>plating</b> <b>rate</b> were determined. The effect of grafting degree on the <b>plating</b> <b>rate</b> is studied.
