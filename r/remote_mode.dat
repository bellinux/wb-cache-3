40|$|When {{considering}} the possible {{use of an}} online mode of experimentation {{it is important to}} evaluate the suitability of the <b>remote</b> access <b>mode</b> to a particular learning exercise. Within a large and diverse set of possible experiment-oriented learning exercises, it follows that not all laboratory experiments are well-suited for conversion to the <b>remote</b> access <b>mode.</b> In this paper we consider a range of factors that should be considered before the decision is taken to implement a remote laboratory. These factors fit broadly into four categories: learning factors, equipment factors, cohort factors and accreditation factors. Some of the factors may demonstrate a tendency to belong to more than one category, and some may present with a more significant weighting than others, but the categorical organization of the factors adds an ability to apply an objective assessment to <b>remote</b> access <b>mode</b> suitability...|$|R
40|$|Keywords:industry cluster;collaboration design platform;enterprise; {{construction}} mechanism Abstract. From {{the perspective}} of the synergy effect, the paper discusses how to construct the industry cluster collaboration design platform. As is known, the concept of industry cluster collaboration platform has been paid great attention with the economic growth, which has become a national leading research programs and key research projects in various provinces and cities. Therefore, it is very necessary to build industry cluster collaboration design platform. In this paper, the construction mechanism of industry cluster collaboration design platform is divided into collaborative session, collaborative browsing, collaborative text editing, collaborative tagging and collaborative inquiry.

40|$|AbstractThe {{personal}} identification {{in mobile}} scenarios {{has attracted a}} lot of attention {{in the last few years}} due to the emergence of new communications paradigms that enable the establishment of ad hoc communications. These communications must be carried out in a secure way since they can be involved in applications such as payments and access systems. Consequently, new secure systems should be proposed for managing security in such complex, mobile and variable conditions. This paper proposes a new authentication system based on the Spanish ID card and the wireless NFC (Near Field Communication) technology. It uses cryptography techniques and authentication certificates to establish secure communications between two interlocutors. The proposed network oriented architecture enables the proposed authentication system to operate in both local and <b>remote</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R

50|$|In early 1966, BECO's MTA became {{available}} for examining human factors and other testing. MSFC built a small test track with craters and rock debris where the LSSM and MOLAB MTAs were compared; {{it was soon}} obvious that a small rover {{would be best for}} the proposed missions. The vehicle was also operated in <b>remote</b> <b>mode</b> to determine characteristics in tests that might be dangerous to the operator, such as acceleration, bounce-height, and turn-over tendency as it traveled at higher speeds and over simulated obstacles. The LSSM performance under one-sixth gravity was obtained through flights on a KC-135A aircraft in a Reduced Gravity parabolic maneuver; among other things, the need for a very soft wheel and suspension combination was shown. Although Pavlics' wire-mesh wheels were not available for the MTA, testing of these was conducted on various soils at the Waterways Experiment Station of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Later, when wire-mesh wheels were tested on low-g flights, the need for wheel fenders to reduce dust contamination was found. The LSSM MTA was extensively tested at the U.S. Army's Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, as well as the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.|$|E

The transport coefficients are obtained for a varying range of temperature and doping density for three different types of substrates SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, and HfO 2.

40|$|Closure-free long cracks {{under the}} <b>remote</b> <b>mode</b> III loading grow {{in a more}} {{complicated}} way than those under the <b>remote</b> <b>mode</b> II. For bcc metals, a coplanar in-plane spreading of tongues driven by the local mode II loading components at crack-front asperities prevails while twisting of crack-front segments to mode I, often leading to factory-roof morphology, is typical for other materials. In bcc metals, therefore, the formulation of a quantitative relationship connecting effective thresholds in modes II and III demands to calculate the local mode II components of stress intensity factors at typical asperities of a crack front loaded in the <b>remote</b> <b>mode</b> III. Therefore, a numerical model of a serrated crack front was created {{and the results were}} compared with experimentally determined ratio of mode II and III effective thresholds for the ARMCO iron.

By analyzing the similarity of time profiles for different-polarity Stokes V sources, one can reveal magnetic connectivity.
