5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter <b>recover</b> <b>with</b> mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|The Seahawks won {{the coin}} toss and kicked off. Before the Bears' first {{offensive}} play, they were penalized for delay of game, and eventually punted. After both teams each traded punts once, Seattle's Richard Sherman utilized a trick punt return, {{similar to one}} the Bears had utilized with Devin Hester and Johnny Knox in the past, to record a 64-yard return to the Bears' 19-yard line. Seattle eventually scored first with Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal. Five drives (all of which ended in punts for both teams) later, the Seahawks ended the first half with Hauschka's 21-yarder. Prior to the Seahawks' last drive, controversy over the Bears' last punt arose: after Pat O'Donnell punted, the ball started to bounce out of bounds, but it hit Seahawks linebacker Brock Coyle in the leg, making it available to <b>recover,</b> <b>with</b> defensive back Sherrick McManis taking advantage. However, the officials ruled the punt as downed by McManis, which led to John Fox challenging the call, though it stood. The Bears special teams struggles continued in the second half, when Lockett returned the opening kickoff 105 yards for the touchdown. The Seahawks increased the score with another touchdown later {{in the third quarter}} via Jimmy Graham's 30-yard touchdown catch from Wilson, followed by 45- and 48-yard field goals by Hauschka in the fourth quarter to make the final score 26–0.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in IMAX on May 31, 2013. Upon release, After Earth was panned by film critics; its acting was criticized as melodramatic, and the writing and storytelling were also singled out for criticism. It grossed $243 million against a net production budget of $128 million. The film is commonly {{considered to be the}} low-point of Shyamalan's career, which had been in decline after he directed a series of critically panned films, and would subsequently <b>recover</b> <b>with</b> films such as The Visit and Split.|$|E

25|$|The Appomattox Campaign was {{an example}} of masterful, {{relentless}} pursuit and maneuver by Grant and Sheridan, skills that had been in short supply by previous generals, such as Meade after Gettysburg and McClellan after Antietam. Lee did the best he could under the circumstances, but his supplies, soldiers, and luck finally ran out. The surrender of Lee represented the loss of only one of the Confederate field armies, but it was a psychological blow from which the South did not <b>recover.</b> <b>With</b> no chance remaining for eventual victory, all of the remaining armies capitulated by June 1865.|$|E
25|$|California built a 14–0 lead about {{midway through}} the first quarter, but Utah was able to <b>recover</b> <b>with</b> 27 {{straight}} points. Running back Shane Vereen scored the first touchdown of the game off of a 36-yard rush. The next play from scrimmage, Eddie Young intercepted a Jordan Wynn pass and returned it for a touchdown. Utah responded with an eight-play, 30-yard touchdown drive when Wynn completed a 6-yard pass to tight end Kendrick Moeai. The drive got started when Shaky Smithson returned the kickoff 61 yards to the 30-yard line. Utah scored 17 {{points in the second}} quarter to take a 24–14 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|Most {{in-flight}} shutdowns are harmless {{and likely}} to go unnoticed by passengers. For example, it may be prudent for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing {{in the event of}} a low oil pressure or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a compressor surge — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine’s inlet and tailpipe. A compressor surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine’s inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken blade. While this situation can be alarming, the engine may <b>recover</b> <b>with</b> no damage.|$|E

25|$|In immunocompromised individuals, such as AIDS patients, {{cryptosporidiosis}} resolves slowly {{or not at}} all, {{and frequently}} causes a particularly severe and persistent form of watery diarrhea coupled with a greatly decreased ability to absorb key nutrients through the intestinal tract. As a result, infected individuals may experience severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition, wasting, and potentially death. In general, the mortality rate for infected AIDS patients is based on CD4+ marker counts. Patients with CD4+ counts over 180 cells/mm³ <b>recover</b> <b>with</b> supportive hospital care and medication; but, in patients with CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm³, the effects are usually fatal within 3 to 6months. During the Milwaukee cryptosporidiosis epidemic (the largest of its kind), 73% of AIDS patients with CD4+ counts lower than 50 cells/mm³ and 36% of those with counts between 50 and 200 cells/mm³ died within {{the first year of}} contracting the infection.|$|E
25|$|The written {{history of}} Tibet {{begins in the}} early 7th century, when the Tibetan kingdoms were united, and Tibet {{expanded}} throughout large parts of Central Asia. Songtsen Gampo (reign ca.617-649/50) conquered the kingdom of Zhangzhung in western Tibet, dominated Nepal, and threatened the Chinese dominance in strategically important areas of the Silk Road. He is also credited with {{the adoption of a}} writing system, the establishment of a legal code, and the introduction of Buddhism, though it probably only played a minor role. Tri Songdetsen (742-ca.797) adopted Buddhism, but also maintained the martial traditions of the Tibetan empire. The Tibetans controlled Dunhuang, a major Buddhist center, from the 780s until the mid-ninth century. Halfway through the 9th century the Tibetan empire collapsed. Royal patronage of Buddhism was lost, leading to a decline of Buddhism in Tibet, only to <b>recover</b> <b>with</b> the renaissance of Tibetan culture occurring from the late 10th century to the early 12th century, known as the later dissemination of Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|On the {{day prior}} to the start of the first Test Jacob Oram {{suffered}} a calf strain and was unable to <b>recover</b> <b>with</b> Kyle Mills being flown in to replace him. Daniel Vettori won the toss for New Zealand and decided to bat first. The new opening partnership – New Zealand's 18th in 36 Tests – had only put on ten runs before Jamie How got out. Daniel Flynn and Tim McIntosh put on a partnership of 87 until McIntosh was dismissed after lunch followed by Ross Taylor falling to an injudicious shot. Flynn became the first New Zealander to be dismissed under the experimental review system, being given out LBW for 95; when bad light stopped play early, New Zealand were 226/4. There was no action on the second day of the match with the umpires calling off play due to rain. A further session was lost on the third day while the ground was dried, with play beginning at 2:45pm (just over 3 hours after the scheduled start). Brendon McCullum and Jesse Ryder began well but were both dismissed shortly after the West Indies took the new ball. After some resistance from the final batsmen, New Zealand were dismissed for 365. The West Indian opening batsmen negotiated the 14 overs remaining in the day to be 39 without loss at stumps.|$|E
