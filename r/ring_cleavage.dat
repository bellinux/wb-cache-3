50|$|After PCP is {{released}} into the atmosphere it decomposes through photolysis. The main biodegradative pathway for PCP is reductive dehalogenation. In this process, the compound PCP is broken down to tetrachlorophenols, trichlorophenols, and dichlorophenols. Another pathway is methylation to pentachloroanisole (a more lipid-soluble compound).

50|$|Bilobalide and ginkgolide {{both have}} very similar {{biosynthesis}} pathway. Bilobalide is formed by partially degraded from ginkgoglide. Bilibalide {{is derived from}} geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is formed by addition of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) unit, to form a C15 sesquiterpene. Such formation went through the mevalonate pathway (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate MEP pathway. In order to generate bilobalide, C20 ginkgolide 13 must form first. To transform from GGPP to abietenyl cation 5, a single bifunctional enzyme abietadiene synthase E1 is required. However, due {{to the complexity of}} ginkgolide structures for rearrangement, <b>ring</b> <b>cleavage,</b> and formation of lactone rings, diterpene 8 is used to explain instead. Levopimaradiene 6 and abietatriene 7 are precursors for ginkgolide and bilobalide formation. The unusual tert-butyl substituent is formed from A <b>ring</b> <b>cleavage</b> in 9. Bilobalide 13 then formed in loss of carbons through degradation from ginkgolide 12, and lactones are formed from residual carboxyl and alcohol functions.

50|$|Although limited {{literature}} is available, {{there is some}} data on metabolism of 6-APB in rats. Its Phase I metabolism involves hydroxylation of the furan <b>ring,</b> then <b>cleavage</b> of the <b>ring,</b> followed by a reduction of the unsaturated aldehyde from the previous step. The resulting aldehyde may then takes two paths. It is either oxidized to a carboxylic acid or reduced to an alcohol, and then hydroxylated. Phase II metabolism consists of glucuronidation.

40|$|AbstractThe title radical (1) is {{generated}} in the gas-phase by collisional neutralization of carbonyl-protonated oxolan- 3 -one. A 1. 5 % fraction of 1 does not dissociate and is detected following reionization as survivor ions. The major dissociation of 1 (∼ 56 %) occurs as loss of the hydroxyl H atom forming oxolan- 3 -one (2). The competing <b>ring</b> <b>cleavages</b> by OC- 2 and C- 4 C- 5 bond dissociations combined account for ∼ 42 % of dissociation and result {{in the formation of}} formaldehyde and 2 -hydroxyallyl radical. Additional ring-cleavage dissociations of 1 resulting in the formation of C 2 H 3 O and C 2 H 4 O cannot be explained as occurring competitively on the doublet ground (X) electronic state of 1, but are energetically accessible from the A and higher electronic states accessed by vertical electron transfer. Exothermic protonation of 2 also produces 3 -oxo-(1 H) -oxolanium cation (3 +) which upon collisional neutralization gives hypervalent 3 -oxo-(1 H) -oxolanium radical (3). The latter dissociates spontaneously by ring opening and expulsion of hydroxy radical. Experiment and calculations suggest that carbohydrate radicals incorporating the 3 -hydroxyoxolan- 3 -yl motif will prefer ring-cleavage dissociations at low internal energies or upon photoexcitation by absorbing light at ∼ 590 and ∼ 400 nm...|$|R

50|$|To {{cope with}} {{the wide variety of}} {{phenolic}} compounds found in nature, bacterial pathways for degradation of aromatic compounds generally begin by channeling these diverse substrates towards a few common intermediates, which are then further degraded.

50|$|A {{molecule}} of GGPP generates (1) (+)-copalyl in {{the presence}} of levopimaradiene synthase. (a) Then (1) loses its OPP group catalyzed by this same synthase, performing an intramolecular allylic cyclization with the two alkenes, to form (2) the sandaracopimarenyl cation. (b) This cation then undergoes an internal cyclization to stabilize the carbocation in the ring by proton transfer to form (3) intermediate.(c) By doing this, the molecule sets itself up for a methyl migration to stabilize that secondary cation and generate that tertiary carbocation at (4). (d) This induces a loss of proton to get (5) levopimaradiene. (e) With oxidation, a loss of a proton to form an aromatic ring generates (6) abietatriene.

5000|$|A {{complete}} biodegradation under aerobic conditions {{consists of}} two steps, primary biodegradation and ultimate biodegradation. The first step begins from the terminal carbon in the alkyl chain as omega-oxidation, which can start from one or both ends, then is followed by beta-oxidation. After the first step the residual is sulfophenyl(di)carboxylates (SP(d)Cs), a large molecule which can {{be involved in the}} second step. The second step occurs only when the required bacteria exist. The <b>ring</b> <b>cleavage</b> of benzene and the further desulphonation of the mono- and dicarboxyilic sulphophenyl acids happen. After the two-step biodegradation, LAS is degraded into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic salts and residual biomass. During the biodegradation, several specific bacteria and oxygen are required in both omega-oxidation of the alkyl chain and the benzene ring cleaving process, so this biodegradation can only happen in aerobic conditions. [...] In anaerobic conditions in treatment process, LAS shows no change. Researchers also prove that biodegradation process is restricted in 20-40 mg/L and even inhibited at a higher concentration, which leads to the incomplete biodegradation of LAS in sewage treatment plants.|$|E
50|$|Thromboxane A (TXA) {{is derived}} from the {{prostaglandin}} H2 (PGH2) molecule. PGH2 contains a relatively weak epidioxy bond, and a possible mechanism is known to involve homolytic cleavage of the epidioxide and a rearrangement to TXA. A heme group in the active site of TXA synthase {{plays an important role in}} the mechanism. Stopped-flow kinetic studies with a substrate analog and recombinant TXA synthase revealed that substrate binding occurs in two steps. First, there is a fast initial binding to the protein and then a subsequent ligation to the heme iron. In the first step of the mechanism, the heme iron coordinates to the C-9 endoperoxide oxygen. It participates in homolytic cleavage of the O-O bond in the endoperoxide, which represents the rate-limiting step, and undergoes a change in redox state from Fe(III) to Fe(IV). A free oxygen radical forms at C-11, and this intermediate undergoes <b>ring</b> <b>cleavage.</b> With the free radical now at C-12, the iron heme then oxidizes this radical to a carbocation. The molecule is now ready for intramolecular ring formation. The negatively charged oxygen attacks the carbonyl, and the electrons from one of the double bonds are drawn to the carbocation, thus closing the ring.|$|E

They studied {{the effect of}} molecular weight (MW) on the efficiency of aerobic as well as anaerobic biodegradation processes of polyethylene glycols (MW 600, 6000 and 20, 000) and found that aerobic degradation is more efficient than anaerobic degradation by means of PEG degradation abilities; 80 % of biodegradability was reported in 5  days under aerobic conditions with diverse molecular weight PEGs. While the PEG biodegradation under the anaerobic condition showed 50 % biodegradability of PEG 600 in 9  days, 40 % biodegradability of PEG 6000 in 10  days and 80 % biodegradability of PEG 20, 000 obtained after 6  days of incubation. Huang et al. (2005) further investigated the nutrition effect on the degradation process under anaerobic conditions. The enriched organic media showed its positive effect on PEG 6000 biodegradation by increasing the biodegradability. Similarly, Sridevi et al. (2012) studied the metabolic pathways for phenol biodegradation and found that under aerobic conditions phenol biodegradation can form catechols and serves as intermediate products by <b>ring</b> <b>cleavages</b> at the ortho or meta position. In aerobic conditions, initially phenol is converted into catechol and then intermediates of the central metabolism by ortho or meta fission and catalyzed by catechol 1, 2 dioxygenases or catechol 2, 3 dioxygenase, respectively.

The MS 2 fragmentation spectrum of m/z 381 contained two major fragments, B 2 and B 2 -H 2 O.
