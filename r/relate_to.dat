Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor.

5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{the former}} {{researchers}} who focus only {{on one of the}} factor <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments, this study analyzes factors <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments. This study investigates wether cash, equity, expense and income are <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments. The reasons why the issue becomes a crucial matter are: First, recent accounting and finance literature say that intangible assets are a firm value creator and increasingly becoming the major drivers of firm value and performance. Second, current financial statements provide very little information about these assets. Even worse, much of the information that is provided is partial, inconsistent, and confusing. Third, intangible assets empirical studies in Indonesia are still very limited. Using sample from manufacture firms listed at the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) over 2003 - 2007, the result indicates that generally cash, equity, expense and income are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets. These findings have twelve main concerns: First, unexpected cash are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Second, the increasing unexpected cash are negatively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically insignificant. Third, the decreasing unexpected cash are negatively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically insignificant. Fourth, unexpected equity are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Fifth, the increasing unexpected equity are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Sixth, the decreasing unexpected equity are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Seventh, unexpected expense are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Eighth, the increasing unexpected expense are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Ninth, the decreasing unexpected expense are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Tenth, unexpected income are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Eleventh, the increasing unexpected income are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant.

5|$|In vertebrates, {{the part}} of the brain that plays the {{greatest}} role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.|$|E
