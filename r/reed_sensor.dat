With the development of Science and Technology, Automatic Ammeter Reading System (RAARS) has made great improvement on Stability, accuracy and intelligence. The system with Automatic Ammeter for remote Reading is connected to property management center through Acquisition memory attached on the Bus using advanced sensing, electronics technologies based on traditional Mechanical instruments. As a result, managers can get the meter readings of central air conditioning, water, electricity, and gas of users from computer automatically which greatly decrease the labor force of workers and improve the management {{of property}} managing department. Methodology for Three-Ammeters Intelligent Reading To digitalize the traditional Analog Ammeters, variety of methods are available, like impulse ammeter using computer remote meter reading, intelligent ammeter charged by IC Card, and Prepaid gas ammeter and electricity ammeter with card. Pulsing Ammeter. Traditional Three-ammeter works at simulation mode. To satisfy the requirement of data acquisition and computer managing, these ammeters should be digitalized first, and pulsing ammeter is developed. Pulsing ammeter {{can be considered as}} a ordinary ammeter with pulsing sensor like <b>Reed</b> <b>sensor,</b> Hall sensor, Wigand sensor and Photoelectric sensor. The workflow of pulsing ammeter can be described as follows, at first sensors of Pulsing Ammeter acquire data from ammeters of gas, water, electricity and hot water, then sampling them and record the result in EPROM for accumulating[1, 2]. Finally, the calculation result is transferred to computer of property management. The Pulsing Ammeter counts the meter of water, electricity and gas using pulsing, and calculate the result based on the counts. Generally, the meter of water, electricity, gas and Heating can be calculated using four formula...|$|E

25|$|A {{reed switch}} is an {{electrical}} switch {{consisting of two}} ferromagnetic and specially shaped contact blades (reeds) positioned in a hermetically sealed glass tube with a gap between them and in a protective atmosphere. Operated by an applied magnetic field, reed switches are used as <b>reed</b> relays, automotive <b>sensors,</b> robotics sensors, security sensors and are found in many toys and games. The reed switch was invented in 1936 by W. B. Elwood at Bell Telephone Laboratories.|$|R
40|$|This book {{provides}} both {{engineers and}} scientists with a competent and comprehensive survey {{on the different}} types of sensors currently applied in modern electronic household devices, their strengths, weaknesses and the reason for using them in which subsystem. More and more microelectronics are establishing themselves in all aspects of our daily life, and the use {{of a growing number of}} increasingly sophisticated, low-cost sensors is directly linked to this trend, and they are responsible for many of the technical achievements of the last decades. Their use in modern washing machines, dish washers, dryers, freezers as well as in cooking, domestic heating, air conditioning or small appliances results in reduction of electricity, water or detergent consumption, less noise emission, increased efficiency and higher user comfort. Market data is given, demonstrating the increasing demand for large quantities of suitable, reliable sensor systems, and the subsequent growing need for comprehensive information on their potentials and limitations. Exemplary products, new types of appliances and improved electronic control are presented. Chapters on thin film temperature <b>sensors,</b> <b>Reed</b> switches, gas <b>sensors,</b> UV sensors, acceleration and pressure sensors illustrate the utilization of modern device mass fabrication technologies. Finally, an outlook into the future forecasts the needs of the appliances of the coming decade...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic sensors {{are widely}} used in nearly all {{engineering}} and industrial sectors, including high-density magnetic recording, navigation, target detection, anti-theft systems, non-destructive testing, magnetic labeling, space research, and bio-magnetic measurements in the human body. Miniature magnetic sensors with high sensitivity are particularly advantageous in biomedical and specialized industrial applications. Amongst the various extant magnetic sensors, Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) and Giant Magneto impedance (GMI) sensors {{have the ability to}} sense low levels of magnetic field in the order of 10 millitesla as well as the space to be further miniaturized. In this thesis, MEMS and GMI sensors are studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally. Multiphysics analyses have been developed to provide a path to further investigate these two types of sensors for various sensor configurations. Several prototype units are successfully developed, fabricated and tested to verify the validity of these models. MEMS <b>reed</b> <b>sensors</b> consist of tri-layer beams of Au/Ni/Au. The actuation of these sensors is initiated by the magnetic force to maintain the continuity of magnetic field streamlines. The Ni layer is deployed as the main magnetic core, and the gold layers are used to enhance the contact quality of the switches. In this work, a unique fabrication process is developed that significantly reduces the number of masking and lithography steps. As well, a detailed finite element method is presented to study the behavior of these sensors and to optimize the device performance. The FEM study considers various magnetic environments, providing a performance map for the sensors. Having a performance map is essential for a system's operation and for tracking its operational behavior. The study also considers the effects of various device formations and packaging for these types of sensors. The generated magnetic force is observed to be much higher than the required mechanical force for device actuation. The GMI sensors exhibit many advantages over their conventional counterparts. In particular, thermal stability and high sensitivity make GMI sensors attractive candidates {{for a wide range of}} applications. The GMI sensors are based on concepts different from those for conventional giant magneto resistance (GMR) sensors. GMI sensors have been under active research only in the past decade. In this thesis, thin film multilayer GMI sensors are realized using microfabrication technology. The fabricated sensors are tri-layers of Co 73 Si 12 B 15 /Au. / Co 73 Si 12 B 15 The thin film GMI sensors are studied in detail using FEM simulation, and several sensors are developed, fabricated and tested to work in the millitesla range. A post-processing step is proposed to optimize the performance of GMI sensors and to enhance their magnetic sensitivity. The post-processing characterization shows that annealing the devices with a specific annealing cycle has the optimal effect of enhancing the magnetic characteristics of CoSiB. The sensors are treated with this post-processing recipe, demonstrating a considerable increase in their magneto impedance (MI) ratio. The research has made a contribution to establishing the engineering foundation toward the development of low-cost miniature GMI magnetic sensors for low field intensity applications...|$|R
50|$|Reed {{switches}} actuated by magnets {{are commonly}} used in mechanical systems as proximity sensors. Examples are door and window sensors in burglar alarm systems and tamperproofing methods (however they can be disabled by a strong, external magnetic field). Reed switches are used in modern laptops to put the laptop on sleep/hibernation mode when the lid is closed. Speed sensors on bicycle wheels and car gears use a reed switch to actuate briefly each time a magnet on the wheel passes the <b>sensor.</b> <b>Reed</b> switches were formerly used in the keyboards for computer terminals, where each key had a magnet and a reed switch actuated by depressing the key; cheaper switches are now used. Electric and electronic pedal keyboards used by pipe organ and Hammond organ players often use reed switches, where the glass enclosure of the contacts protects them from dirt, dust, and other particles. They may {{also be used to}} control diving equipment such as flashlights or camera, which must be sealed to keep pressurized water out.|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} smart {{lighting}} {{systems have been}} designed to adjust the lighting condition according to the occupancy in the space, and there are various options for the occupancy sensor, from imaging sensors to non-imaging sensors. For example, in 1987, Rea and Jaekel used video systems, infrared, ultrasonic, and electric eyes to assess energy efficiency in lighting a staff room (6.0 Ã— 8.8 m) [7]. In 1992, an imaging lighting control system called ImCon was proposed, which used a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to monitor the occupancy in a test room (5.6 Ã— 5.6 m) and control four fluorescent fixtures [8]. In 2009, Delaney et al. proposed using a network of passive infrared (PIR) sensors and light sensors to evaluate energy efficiency in lighting systems [9]. In 2010, Agarwal et al. proposed a smart building automation solution using a combination of PIR <b>sensors</b> and magnetic <b>reed</b> switch door <b>sensors</b> [10]. Recently, Aldrich et al. developed a lighting control application using networks of PIR sensors [11]. In 2010, Caicedo et al. looked into {{the problem of how to}} optimize the dimming levels of LED fixtures based on localized occupancy information [12]. A review paper by Guo et al. has comprehensively discussed different sensors that have been used in occupancy-based lighting control systems, including PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, audible sound sensors, microwave sensors, light barriers, video cameras, biometric systems, and pressure sensors [13]. Another review paper by Hassan et al. also discussed several occupancy detection techniques for lighting control applications, including PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, radio frequency identification (RFID), and cameras [14].|$|R
