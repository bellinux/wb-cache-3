40|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> <b>incineration,</b> which is widely used in China for treating industrial hazardous waste (IHW), is evaluated in this work through life cycle assessment (LCA). Emissions data of key pollutants, along with energy and material inputs and outputs of <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> <b>incineration,</b> were collected from a commercial-scale operating IHW incineration plant located in Hangzhou city in eastern China, and the corresponding {{environmental impacts}} were analyzed based on the LCA model. It is concluded that the IHW incineration process has {{the greatest impact on}} human toxicity, followed by global warming. Heavy metals, especially Pb and As, are the main contributors to human toxicity, while CO 2 is the main cause of global warming. PCDD/Fs have a relatively small contribution to human toxicity and overall environmental safety. This study has two improvement suggestions based on the assessment results: An energy recovery system and a DeNOx system should be added to the IHW incineration process, since the former would reduce the contribution of IHW incineration to global warming, while the latter would enable incineration plants to minimize the emissions of NOx; Fly ash and bottom ash should be stabilized and further treated to mitigate the problems caused by heavy metals...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project investigated {{the fate of}} trace metals in <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> <b>incineration</b> with venturi- and packed tower-scrubber particulate- and acid gas-control.

Synthetic waste formulations included the hazardous trace elements arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium, and barium, {{as well as the}} non-hazardous trace elements copper, magnesium, bismuth and strontium, spiked into a clay absorbent material. The indepenaent variables chosen for evaluation were chlorine content of the feed, kiln temperature, and afterburner temperature. Cadmium, lead and bismuth appeared volatile over the range of kiln temperatures tested, while the other six metals displayed refractory properties. Of the three independent variables tested, feed chlorine content had the strongest effect on changes in metal partitioning across the tests; as chlorine content increased, metal volatilization appeared to increase, while scrubber efficiency for metals decreased...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{amounts of}} {{municipal}} solid waste are becoming an issue for urban and rural municipalities. One method for dealing with {{municipal solid waste}} is converting it into energy. In Saskatchewan, no waste-to-energy plants for municipal solid waste currently exist. This thesis explores the technical and economic feasibility of developing waste-to-energy facilities in the province in cities and towns smaller than the two largest centers of Saskatoon and Regina. A waste composition study was performed at 12 municipal solid waste landfills throughout the province with varying demographic and socioeconomic attributes. This study revealed that municipal solid waste across the province did not vary significantly, regardless of different socioeconomic and demographics factors. The average composition of the municipal solid waste in the selected small cities and towns in Saskatchewan was 7 % inert, 45 % wet putrescible, 33 % dry combustible, and 15 % plastic, making it suitable for most types of waste-to-energy. Several types of waste-to-energy were assessed for communities in Saskatchewan. The feasibility of each type of waste-to-energy was assessed based upon {{the results of the}} waste composition study, and the quantity of waste required.

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the most}} {{important}} parts of a cement factory is the cement <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> which {{plays a key role in}} quality and quantity of produced cement. In this part, the physical exertion and bilateral movement of air and materials, together with chemical reactions take place. Thus, this system has immensely complex and nonlinear dynamic equations. These equations have not worked out yet. Only in exceptional case; however, a large number of the involved parameters were crossed out and an approximation model was presented instead. This issue caused many problems for designing a cement <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> controller. In this paper, we presented nonlinear predictor and simulator models for a real cement <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> by using nonlinear identification technique on the Locally Linear Neuro-Fuzzy (LLNF) model.

40|$|The Grillo {{process is}} {{designed}} to produce sulphur dioxide from solid and liquid sulphur, spent sulphuric acids and other high-calorific-value waste materials of the chemical industry. The raw materials used are converted in a <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> with a moving coke bed at approximately 1000 °C under a weak reducing atmosphere; the hydrocarbon compounds are cracked and sulphur is converted into SO 2. To supply additional energy, the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> is fitted with an oil burner. After passing through post-combustion chambers, the product gases from the decomposition process are cooled down in a waste heat recovery boiler and fed to an absorption-desorption reactor. In there, high-purity sulphur dioxide is obtained and stored in liquid form in pressure tanks for sale. In the Grillo process both, solid and liquid sulphur, can be used separately but also simultaneously. The use of sulphur and its combustion with air represents {{the state of the}} technology. The combustion of liquid sulphur with pure oxygen combined with the decomposition process, however, has only been practiced in the Grillo process so far. This study investigates the reactions taking place in the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln,</b> in particular the vaporisation and combustion of liquid sulphur and the separation of spent acids using thermodynamic and reaction kinetic methods. The thermodynamic-based calculation of the chemical changes and energy conversions in the Grillo process (<b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> – post combustion chamber – waste heat recovery boiler) is used to assess the effects of the decomposition in the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> on the entire process. The field tests on the system using a variation of the type and quantity of substances represent an important basis for the process analysis. The temperatures and gas compositions were measured continuously at the outlet of the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln,</b> in the post-combustion chamber as well as the waste heat recovery boiler. One of the priorities of the investigation, is the combustion of liquid sulphur with oxygen, an area which has barely been investigated up to now. During the vaporisation of liquid sulphur, gaseous sulphur molecules from S 8 to S 1 are created, which make up different amounts in the gaseous phase, depending on temperature and pressure. This influences, e. g., the sulphur combustion by the oxygen supply in the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln.</b> In addition to an oxygen supply, sustaining the sulphur flame also requires a certain droplet spectrum. A further object of investigation is the separation of spent sulphuric acids, tar acids and high-heat-value waste materials in the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln.</b> The spent acids also contain hydrocarbons and heavy metal compounds, which may be present in a solute form or as independent phases, which react differently in the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln,</b> where special effects, such as microexplosion, may occur. The soot formation frequently occurring in the gasification of hydrocarbon compounds also takes place in the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> and thus feed the coke bed, which serves as both a heat reservoir and a carbon supply in the Grillo process. This study shall describe the kinetics of vaporisation and combustion of liquid droplets on simplistic conditions. First of all, the size of the liquid droplets that enter the hot gas compartment of the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> is calculated, considering the entry conditions. The time related sequence of the substance and heat transmission processes during the heating, vaporisation, separation and combustion of sulphuric and spent acid droplets is described on the basis of simple single droplet models. In this way the maximum diameters of the droplets which can be converted in the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> are determined. Following from calculations and actual measurements, large spent acid droplets are evidently fragmented {{as a result of the}} microexplosions and can thus fully react in the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln.</b> One of the practical objectives of this study is the control and monitoring of the overall process, going beyond the empirical field tests. This objective is served by the thermodynamic-based process calculations carried out in combination with field tests in which the chemical changes and energy conversions in the individual reactors were recorded. The quantities and compositions of the reaction products formed in both the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> and the post-combustion chambers have also been determined. While doing so, it was possible to demonstrate that the delayed conversion of substances such as tar acids can impair the energy balance in the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> and thus the entire process. All in all, the calculations in comparison with measurements have considerably improved the basis for the practice-oriented analysis and optimisation of the process in the reactor coupling comprising <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln,</b> post-combustion chamber and waste heat recovery boiler...|$|R
