40|$|The {{digital era}} invoked new {{challenges}} to judicial systems. The Internet enabled {{violation of privacy}} and intellectual property rights and enhanced the magnitude of criminal activity. Recognizing the inability of courts to handle a high magnitude of lawsuits, along with enforcement difficulties, policymakers worldwide chose to delegate quasi-judicial powers to online intermediaries that facilitate or enable such potential violations or infringements <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> Search engines were first tasked to perform a quasi-judicial role under a notice-and-takedown regime to combat copyright infringement around the world. Recently, the European Union (EU) decided to delegate judicial authority to search engines by granting <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>erasure,</b> or delisting <b>of</b> personal data, about EU individuals under certain circumstances. Effectively, the EU placed search engines—mainly Google currently—as a judiciary, tasked to balance different fundamental human <b>rights.</b> This privatization <b>of</b> the judiciary represents a new paradigm in legal systems and possesses vast global ramifications, which must be further scrutinized. This Article provides such scrutiny. It begins by briefly exploring the rights to be forgotten and delisted. It then {{provides an overview of}} the quasi-judicial roles played by search engines prior to the new EU rights regime and compares them to their new judicial role. Following an examination of the pragmatic and normative difficulties in the implementation <b>of</b> the EU <b>rights</b> regime, this Article evaluates and discusses the future of the private judiciary. It examines the drawbacks and benefits of judicial privatization; explores whether other means of regulation are more appropriate; and proposes modest solutions to properly address the shortcomings of the new privatized judiciary. This Article warns against such form of privatization and its current implementation, especially when fundamental rights are at stake. If policymakers insist on adjudicating search engines, they must also restrain their judicial power and provide adequate safeguards for society in the form of transparency and proper oversight on both their removal procedure and decisions...|$|R
40|$|This report {{puts the}} EC {{proposal}} for {{a right to be}} forgotten in context and discusses it from the perspective of freedom of expression. As will become apparent, the right to be forgotten as proposed in data protection law is a concept that relates closely to the regulation of privacy harms caused by new forms of publicity online, most notably search engine and social media publicity. These new forms of publicity are the subject of daily news reports about the privacy impact of the Internet and related services Even though scientific literature shows that the Web is extremely volatile, that valuable information constantly disappears and that the structural preservation of historic publications online is a very hard problem, the perception that the Web never forgets seems to remain prevalent. Acting on concerns over online publicity, over the last decade, Data Protection Authorities (in France, Spain and Italy in particular) have laid the foundation for the establishment of strengthening the control of people over the public data that is processed about them online through a so-called ‘right to be forgotten’. The European Commission, after consulting on the topic, has made the name and (some parts of) this right into a central element of its {{proposal for a}} General Data Protection Regulation. Considering the fact that these proposals relate to new forms of publicity online, a fundamental question is whether freedom of expression is sufficiently taken into account. Much of the public debate in the general media that has taken place {{over the last two years}} about the right to be forgotten touches on this important question, that will be addressed in this report through a discussion of the proposed Article 17 and 80 and related legal doctrines. The EC proposals are discussed in detail, taking into account recent developments in the European Parliament and the Council. The EU data protection framework seems to have become the most important legal framework for addressing privacy concerns relating to online media. This report also addresses the fundamental question to what extent this is a good development. It does so by first looking at the interface of data protection as applied to online publications of personal data and the laws at the national level relating to the lawfulness of publishing about natural persons. Second, and finally, this report looks at extremely (and ever more) complex interface of data protection with intermediary liability regulation at the EU level (limited safe harbors) and the Member States (secondary liability). Data protection law currently lacks the tools for setting the boundaries for intermediary and the current proposals do not effectively address this issue either. This raises the question of how this interface could be better established, which will be addressed in the final part of this report. Section 2 will discuss the backgrounds of the right to be forgotten. Section 3 discusses the already existing principle and the implied <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>erasure</b> under the current Data Protection Directive. After that, the EC proposal for a right to be forgotten in Article 17 of the Regulation will be addressed (Section 4), the way data protection deals with freedom of expression concerns in Article 80 and recital 121 (Section 5) as well as some of the proposals to amend Article 17 and 80 by the European Parliament and the Council (Section 6). Section 7 discusses the interface of data protection with privacy tort law and media law and Section 8 discusses the interface with intermediary liability regulation. Section 9 concludes. JRC.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{decoding}} 2 D convolutional codes over an erasure channel.

The main idea is to reduce the decoding problem of 2 D convolutional codes to a problem of decoding a set of associated 1 D convolutional codes.

40|$|Erasure list {{decoding}} {{was introduced}} to correct a larger number <b>of</b> <b>erasures</b> with output <b>of</b> a list of possible candidates. In the present paper, we consider both random linear codes and algebraic geometry codes for list decoding erasure errors. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, we show that, for arbitrary 0 0 (R and ϵ are independent), with high probability a random linear code is an erasure list decodable code with constant list size 2 ^O(1 /ϵ) that can correct a fraction 1 -R-ϵ <b>of</b> <b>erasures,</b> i. e., a random linear code achieves the information-theoretic optimal trade-off between information rate and fraction <b>of</b> <b>erasure</b> errors. Secondly, we show that algebraic geometry codes are good erasure list-decodable codes. Precisely speaking, for any 0 0, a q-ary algebraic geometry code of rate R from the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower can correct 1 -R- 1 /√(q) - 1 + 1 /q-ϵ fraction <b>of</b> <b>erasure</b> errors with list size O(1 /ϵ). This improves the Johnson bound applied to algebraic geometry codes. Furthermore, list decoding of these algebraic geometry codes can be implemented in polynomial time...|$|R

40|$|Determining fault {{tolerance}} <b>of</b> XOR-based <b>erasure</b> codes efficiently We propose a new {{fault tolerance}} metric for XOR-based erasure codes: the minimal erasures list (MEL). A minimal erasure {{is a set}} <b>of</b> <b>erasures</b> that leads to irrecoverable data loss and in which every erasure is necessary and sufficient {{for this to be}} so. The MEL is the enumeration <b>of</b> all minimal <b>erasures.</b> An XOR-based erasure code has an irregular structure that may permit it to tolerate faults at and beyond its Hamming distance. The MEL completely describes the fault tolerance <b>of</b> an XOR-based <b>erasure</b> code at and beyond its Hamming distance; it is therefore a useful metric for comparing the fault tolerance of such codes. We also propose an algorithm that efficiently determines the MEL <b>of</b> an <b>erasure</b> code. This algorithm uses the structure <b>of</b> the <b>erasure</b> code to efficiently determine the MEL. We show that, in practice, the number <b>of</b> minimal <b>erasures</b> for a given code is much less than the total number <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>erasures</b> that lead to data loss: in our empirical results for one corpus of codes, there were over 80 times fewer minimal erasures.
