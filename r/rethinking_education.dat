30|$|Hurled into hypercomplexity, we {{are facing}} a complex process of anthropological transformation, of a shift in paradigms, models and codes, other than an {{irreversible}} synthesis of new value systems and criteria for judgment. Our extraordinary scientific discoveries and technological innovations not only open dizzily onto as yet unimaginable horizons and scenarios, but show, ever more clearly, the urgency of radically <b>rethinking</b> <b>education,</b> teaching and training, and of a systemic approach to complexity, which in the meantime has become hypercomplexity, underlining the substantial inadequacy of our schools and universities in dealing with this hypercomplexity, {{in dealing with the}} indeterminateness and ambivalence of the ongoing metamorphosis, in dealing with the global extension of all political, social and cultural processes. The conceptual framework of this paper, therefore, has the following objectives: a) to provide a functional definition of complexity and hypercomplexity and of our limits in understanding them; b) to highlight the urgency of a systemic approach to complexity and of <b>rethinking</b> <b>education</b> and training beyond «false dichotomies» (education determines new asymmetries and inequalities, which in turn influence educational policies). The social and cultural innovation belongs to those who will succeed in healing the fracture between the human and the technological, to those who will succeed in redefining and rethinking the complex relationships between the natural and the artificial, to those who will manage to bring knowledge and skills together (not to separate them), to those who will, furthermore, know how to unite and merge the two cultures (scientific and humanistic), both in terms of education and formative training and in defining profiles and professional competences.|$|E

This article explores the implications of spatial analysis for <b>rethinking</b> <b>education</b> in new conditions of cultural complexity. The experience of living and learning with difference is conceptualized as an open journey in which the very act of movement across spatial boundaries unlocks the fixity of meanings and identities and, hence, problematizes the spatial logic of bounded learning places. Explicating the tension between fixity and mobility, boundedness and flows, this article deploys the concepts of cultural-semiotic space, scale, and boundary to theorize locations of learning and meaning-making in new times. <br /...|$|E

The essays discuss the practical, political and theoretical dimensions of practitioner inquiry, advancing the argument that the adoption of an inquiring approach to practice is both an integral dimension of teachers’ work in the modern school as well as critical to effective and authentic professional learning. And the essays draw on the work of Groundwater-Smith to demonstrate the benefits brought to bear on schools, teachers and learners when the complex nature of the relationship between inquiry and practice is understood and acted upon in pursuit of democratic knowledge interests. ...|$|E

40|$|This book brings {{together}} {{a number of}} academics who have conducted research and written about effective practices and pedagogies that incorporate the use of information and communications technologies (ICT). The book is intended for graduate and undergraduate students in Teacher Education programmes, as well as teachers and those who areinterested in contemporary educational issues. The authors in this book {{have been engaged in}} <b>rethinking</b> <b>education</b> with ICT. Implicit in this, is the view that we need to reconceptualise our pedagogies and practices in order to make schools relevant to the lives of the young people who inhabit them. The chapters in this book are based on empirically grounded research work. The chapters illustrate the various dimensions of innovative practices with ICT that can extend teachers’ pedagogies and engage learners so that they are able to extend their potential for knowledge building in new and dynamic ways...|$|E
40|$|Mainstream {{education}} {{promotes a}} narrow conception of listening, centred on the reception and comprehension of human meanings. As such, it is ill-equipped {{to hear how}} sound propagates affects, generates atmospheres, shapes environments and enacts power. Yet these aspects of sound are vital to how education functions. We therefore {{argue that there is}} a need to expand listening in education, and suggest that listening walks could provide a pedagogy for this purpose. Using interview data in which early years practitioners reflect on a listening walk, we show how the method can: (i) produce heightened multisensory experiences of spaces; (ii) generate forms of difficulty and discomfort that produce new learning; and (iii) influence practice, particularly practitioners’ ability to empathise with young children. Listening walks function by disrupting everyday sensory habits, provoking listeners to listen anew to their own listening, in an open-ended way that is not tied to predetermined learning outcomes. The method therefore has wider pedagogic potential for <b>rethinking</b> <b>education</b> and childhood beyond rationality, representation and meaning...|$|E
40|$|Resistance & Representation: Rethinking Childhood Education is a {{collection}} of essays, the 12 th volume in the <b>Rethinking</b> <b>Education</b> series. Both the volume and the series grow out of a position that challenges the "hegemony" of the psychologically based prevailing perspective in education, especially early childhood education. This edited volume includes chapters applying feminist, critical, multicultural, postcolonial and postmodern theories and methodologies. For the rest of the review, the term post modern will be used as a way to refer to these various theories. In addition to these closely allied theoretical positions, the editors also see the essays connected by a "shared commitment to creating social change and improving the lives of children. " The aim of the book is to provide a place to present alternative representations of knowledge and considerations of issues of identity and theory making, as well as to examine resistances and reconceptualizations of traditional practice in early childhood education...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} is to research the conditions, limits, and possibilities of designing a transdisciplinary education as a teaching project in the philosophical field of Good Living. This philosophical perspective of intercultural pedagogical praxis implies a polilogical approach to epistemic diversity, in order to <b>rethink</b> <b>education</b> from an ecology of knowledge that integrates and combines scientific knowledge and non-scientific wisdom. Transdisciplinarity is the appropriate methodology for educating in and for diversity, since it organizes knowledge horizontally, without hierarchizing the different epistemes that co-exist in the same space-time. As a result, the work studies the pedagogical principles for a transdisciplinary and polilogical human training, establishing the procedures of a polylogical evaluation to innovate in the educational sciences of Good Living...|$|R
40|$|Regardless the {{ideology}} one would embrace in thinking or <b>rethinking</b> <b>education,</b> he/she {{would agree that}} education is a real vehicle of change-making. The present article attempts to summarize through a review of multidisciplinary literature three convergent ideological trends in contemporary educational theory, which underline this powerful principle: intercultural, feminist and critical pedagogy. Although choices of concepts, suggested educational approaches or classroom strategies may seem to illustrate different view points, there are common standings shared by theorists of the respective fields: education is primarily a tool of changing society through empowerment, respecting diversity of personal experiences, building community, privileging individual voices etc. Intercultural, feminist and critical pedagogy challenge in specific ways traditional pedagogical notions, {{but they may be}} conceived as roads to the inclusive movement in education. As a consequence, boundaries of inclusive education go beyond the simple adjustement of school provisions to the special needs of the disabled, becoming a rather largely shared educational ideology, covering all educational approaches addressing specific target groups...|$|E
30|$|There is, however, {{an agency}} {{formally}} {{in place that}} has offered {{to take on this}} task, namely, UNESCO. Institutionally, it is the right agency for the undertaking. However, it needs to be empowered for the task, in formal, visible and practical terms. Not to decide on the curricular issues, these should not be determined on a global level, as has proven to be the unintended consequence of the OECD PISA exercise. Given the vision and depth of the previous UNESCO reports on education, the next step in UNESCO’s endeavour should be very welcomed, see in particular UNESCO: Education Research and Foresight [18], <b>Rethinking</b> <b>Education,</b> which emphasises the changing nature of education, both with regard to form and content, but also its complexity when addressed within different cultures. Another promising agent is the Council of Europe, e.g., its Pestalozzi Programme, which perhaps does not quite have the legitimacy of UNESCO on the global scale, but has by its past endeavour, motivation and scope shown it might take the initiative. This needs to be done by a legitimate and a powerful actor.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{discussion}} {{regarding what}} kind of education impacts more on individual success and social wealth is currently ongoing and full of implication for educational policies, including on adult learning. There {{is no doubt that}} education correlates positively with wealth, health and success (at both individual and social levels), but there is not clear enough {{what kind of}} skills ensure the success in adult life, in terms of earnings and career. On the way of <b>rethinking</b> <b>education,</b> there are increasingly more studies and surveys trying to respond to several dilemmas and concerns regarding the relative importance of different skills and competencies (e. g. : key, general, versus professional, specific competencies), of different contexts of learning (e. g. : formal, versus nonformal and informal; school based versus work based learning), of different contents of learning (e. g. “knowledge” versus “skills” and “attitudes”; “intellectual” education versus “social”, “civic”, “moral” or “aesthetic” education), and of different forms of assessment (e. g. standardized versus non-standardized). This paper tries to present different perspectives and to argue the need for new balance points in approaching the above mentioned topics...|$|E

Ten databases from IEA and PISA were used to analyse such gender differences in an international perspective from 1995 to 2009. Differences in standard deviation, effect size and variance ratios were computed. The main results may be summarised as follows. The gender differences at the extreme tails of the distribution are often more substantial than the gender differences at the mean, which may suggest the need to <b>rethink</b> <b>education</b> policies for low-achieving boys in reading and for high-achieving girls in mathematics and science. The “greater male variability hypothesis” is confirmed, although our results suggest that this may depend on the test content, the study design and the computed statistics. Peer reviewe...|$|R
