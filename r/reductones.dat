40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of cell membranes i their capacity to discrimi-nate between ions of different sign or different chemical nature. In the erythrocyte membrane, coulombic forces seem to govern the discrimination between anions and cations. There is reason to believe that, without impeding the movements of anions, positive fixed charges impose a severe restriction on the movements of diffusible ca-tions between cells and medium. But although a number of very conspicuous changes of cation permeability with pH and ionic strength can be related to variations of the fixed charge density of the membrane (Passow, 1965; LaCelle and Rothstein, 1966), observations have been made that passive cation permeability is not entirely gov-erned by coulombic forces. In particular, it has been observed that a number of agents such as fluoride, lead, triose <b>reductone,</b> IAA and adenosine (Passow, 1964), and others are capable of inducing a selective increase in passive K + movements without greatly affecting Na + permeability.

The plant polysaccharides acted as a reducing agent by effecting the conversion of the Fe 3 +/ferricyanide complex to the Fe 2 + form.

40|$|Die Maillard-Reaktion ist dafür bekannt, bei der thermischen Behandlung von Lebensmitteln neben deren organoleptischen Eigenschaften, wie Geschmack, Geruch, Textur und Farbe, auch die {{oxidative}} Stabilität zu beeinflussen. Letzteres ist auf die Bildung von komplexierenden und reduzierenden Verbindungen zurückzuführen, die antioxidativ und prooxidativ wirken können. Im Rahmen der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die antioxidativen Kapazitäten von dreizehn Maillard-Reaktionsintermediaten mit Furan-, Furanon- und Pyranonstruktur verglichen. Dabei kann festgestellt werden, dass alle eingesetzten Verbindungen mit Reduktonstruktur antioxidative Eigenschaften besitzen. Doch nur die Furan- 3 -one und 3, 5 -Dihydroxy- 6 -methyl- 2, 3 -dihydro- 4 H-pyran- 4 -on (DHHM) zeigen in allen Methoden ähnliche antioxidative Kapazitäten wie das Referenzredukton Ascorbinsäure. Isomaltol, Maltol und Maltosin sind aufgrund ihrer komplexbildenden Eigenschaften in Gegenwart von Metallionen nicht reduzierend, verhalten sich aber ansonsten vergleichbar zu den anderen Reduktonen. Ein prooxidatives Verhalten in Anwesenheit von Metallionen kann dementsprechend ausschließlich für die Furan- 3 -one und DHHM beobachtet werden. Die selektive Blockade der freien Hydroxyfunktionen der Reduktone durch Schutzgruppen bewirkt eine signifikante Abnahme der antioxidativen Kapazitäten, wodurch die Reduktonstruktur als entscheidendes Strukturmerkmal identifiziert werden kann. Auf Grundlage des Produktspektrums ausgewählter Reduktone nach Umsatz mit Oxidationsmitteln wird ein entsprechender Reaktionsmechanismus vorgestellt. In Modellreaktionen von Maltose mit verschiedenen Aminokomponenten kann sowohl im wässrigen als auch im trockenen System eine Korrelation zwischen Bräunung und antioxidativer Aktivität festgestellt werden. Es ergibt sich jedoch kein Zusammenhang zwischen beiden Eigenschaften und der Konzentration einzelner heterocyclischer Reduktone. Das antioxidativ inaktive Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) ist in allen Systemen die Hauptkomponente und in etwa zehnfach höheren Konzentrationen nachweisbar als die Reduktone Maltol und DHHM. Der Beitrag zu Farbe und antioxidativen Eigenschaften der Reduktone Maltol, Furaneol, DHHM und Isomaltol sowie von HMF wird in wässrigen Modellsystemen untersucht. Dabei zeigt Isomaltol die stärkste Farbbildung und den stärksten Abbau. Der Abbau von HMF ist hingegen minimal, aber führt zur zweithöchsten Bräunung. Bei Furaneol und DHHM verhalten sich die Restkonzentrationen und die Farbbildung wiederum proportional zueinander. Maltol zeigt weder einen Abbau noch eine Farbentwicklung. Für die Reduktone kann mit steigender Bräunung eine Abnahme der antioxidativen Aktivität beobachtet werden, während die Reaktionsprodukte von HMF zu einem leichten Anstieg der antioxidativen Eigenschaften führen. Da die verwendeten Modelle annäherungsweise die Prozesse der Bierherstellung abbilden, werden zum Vergleich Bierproben analysiert. Für Gerstenmalzbiere kann eine Korrelation zwischen antioxidativer Aktivität und der Farbe festgestellt werden. Das Spektrum an α-Dicarbonylverbindungen entspricht einer Mischung der D-Glucose- und Maltosemodelle, doch der HMF-Gehalt ist deutlich niedriger. Der Anteil an metallreduzierenden Substanzen ist in allen Bierproben geringer als in den Modellversuchen. It is {{well known}} that the Maillard reaction leads to significant changes of the organoleptic characteristics of food during heat treatment. But besides aroma, color, and texture the oxidative stability is influenced, because of the formation of complexing and reducing compounds. In this thesis, the antioxidant capacities of thirteen heterocyclic Maillard reaction intermediates were measured with five different methods. All used substances with reductone structure showed an antioxidative behavior, but only furan- 3 -ones and 3, 5 -dihydroxy- 6 -methyl- 2, 3 -dihydro- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one (DHHM) were on a comparable level to the reference reductone ascorbic acid in all assays. Isomaltol, maltol, and maltosine did not exhibit measurable antioxidant capacities in the presence of metal ions due to their complexing abilities. Consequently, these <b>reductones</b> did not cause radical generation through redox cycling in contrast to the furan- 3 -ones and DHHM. The antioxidant capacities of the <b>reductones</b> were lowered significantly by the introduction of protecting groups to their free hydroxyl function. Therefore, the reductone structure could be identified as the crucial structural feature for their antioxidant properties. The reaction of different oxidizers with selected <b>reductones</b> resulted mainly in short-chained compounds typically derived from dicarbonyl cleavage reactions. Based on the product range an according reaction mechanism was postulated. In model incubations of maltose and different amino acids under aqueous as well as dry conditions a correlation of color and antioxidant activity could be found. However, there was no connection between both properties and the concentration of heterocyclic intermediates. The dominating compound in all systems was hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) – a furan derivative that did not show reducing or complexing abilities. Additionally, the formation of color and the changes in antioxidant properties of the <b>reductones</b> maltol, furaneol, DHHM, and isomaltol as well as of HMF were analyzed in aqueous systems. The strongest color formation and the fastest degradation were shown by isomaltol. The concentration of HMF was nearly unaffected by the heat treatment, but its reaction mixtures exhibited the second strongest color. The remaining concentrations of Furaneol and DHHM corresponded to their color formation. Maltol was the most stable intermediate and did not undergo a browning reaction. The <b>reductones</b> showed decreasing antioxidant ativities with increasing color, whereas HMF formed antioxidative compounds. The prepared model systems were based on roasting and cooking processes comparable to the production of beer. In order to transfer the results to a real food matrix different beer samples were analyzed. Beers brewed with barley malt showed a correlation between color and antioxidant activity. The range of α-dicarbonyl compounds corresponded to the degradation of maltose and D-glucose known from the model incubations. The HMF content relative to the concentration of 3 -deoxyosones was lower than in the model experiments with maltose and other heterocyclic compounds could only be found in small amounts. The ratio of metal reducing substances in comparison to radical scavenging substances was considerably lower in beer...|$|E

The polyphenolic compounds exhibit antioxidant activity by forming a metal ion complex, thus inhibiting the free metal ion induced radical generation [17]. The reducing power measures the ability of the antioxidant to donate electron to reduce Fe 3 + to Fe 2 +. The reports suggested that the plant extract with greater TPC was associated with their reducing power [18]. The reducing power of NATE is suggested to be due to the presence of flavonoids and phenolic acids, capable of reducing Fe 3 + to Fe 2 +.

When Soy-sauce is stored, its color is getting deeper and change of its taste and flavor is getting larger. Similar phenomenon is observed in Mirin. Therefore, browning phenomenon is occuring in Soy-sauce and Mirin. This phenomenon is seemed to affect on their qualities profoundly. This browning phenomenon of Soy-sauce and Mirin was studied spectroscopically and chromatographically. Following results were obtained. I.

Their color was expressed by the C. I. E method. [table] Soy-sauce has stronger absorption in the shorter wave length and weak one in the longer wave length in the visible spectrum. The form of its transmittance curve remains unchanged even when the process of its preparation is varied. The degree of color deepness dependes upon the kind of Soy-sauce. If compared on the basis of total nitrogen content reduced to 1 %, color deepness may be arranged in the following order: [table] II. On the factors causing the browning reaction during storage. The browning reaction of Soy-sauce and of Mirin is not due to the enzymatic reaction. On the Soy-sauce, the action of Air is the most effective and action of Temperature and Ray is unremarkable. This shows that Air-oxidation is the principal cause. When the color of Soy-sauce is deepened by aeration, the form of transmittance curve differs no remarkable change. On the Amino acid condiment, similar phenomenon is observed. On the Mirin, the action of Air, Ray and Temperature is very effective. III. On the substances affecting the browning reaction A.

Carbonyl compounds promote to darkening of Soy-sauce, Amino acid condiment and Mirin. On the Soy-sauce, these carbonyl compounds were composed of 13 aldehydes and 4 ketonic acids. Acetaldehydes was recognized, Crotonaldehyde, Diacetyl and Levulinic acid were presumed, still unknown 10 aldehydes and 3 ketonic acids were gained. On the Amino acid condiment, 16 carbonyl compounds were separated. (13 aldehydes and ketones, 3 ketonic acids). Of these compounds, Benzaldehyde, Formaldehyde, Levulinic acid and Acetoacetic acid were recognized. Other 12 carbonyl compounds were unknown. On the Mirin, many saturated and a few unsaturated carbonyl compounds were separated. Known compounds of them were Acetaldehyde, Crotonaldehyde, Diacetyl, Acetoin and Hydroxymethylfurfural. Ketonic acid was not formed. 4 carbonyl compounds produced during storage for 3 months were separated, but their structure was not determined. The number and amount of the carbonyl compounds were affected by the condition of storage. As the mechanism of carbonyl compounds formation during storage, the Strecker Degradation was suggested, namely, Alanine+Diacetyl=Acetaldehyde+CO_ 2 +Amino-keto acid many unknown carbonyl compounds was produced by the Strecker Degradation during storage.

40|$|Kinetic {{models for}} {{describing}} the Maillard reaction {{have been developed}} extensively but a versatile model has not been obtained because this reaction is very complex. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop a kinetic model to describe and predict the Maillard browning reaction occurring at the surface of foods during high temperature cooking. Commercial frozen pastry dough and processed potato product were used as the model food in this study. The progress of brown colour development was determined using image analysis methods in the CIE colour space (L*a*b* scale). The lightness (L*) was found to be the best parameter to represent the browning reaction in these products. The lightness-time curve followed first order kinetics. The effects of temperature and moisture content on the Maillard browning reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars were studied. The effect of moisture content was investigated by baking pastry samples at five different initial moisture contents (44. 55, 33. 89, 22. 92, 10. 95 and 9. 18 wt% of d. b.) on a hot temperature controlled pan at 160 °C for 60 minutes. The lightness-time curve was fitted with a first order kinetic model by non linear regression using the recorded surface temperature history as an input to obtain the initial lightness (L* 0), endpoint or final lightness (L*∞) and kinetic rate constants (k). Statistical analysis (ANOVA) was used to test the effect of moisture content on these parameters. The result showed that the moisture content had no significant effect on the browning kinetics of pastry at the 95 % confidence level (P< 0. 05). The moisture content had the most influence on the initial lightness (P< 0. 005), whereas the final lightness was moderately affected (P< 0. 05). Consequently, the effect of moisture content on the lightness was not considered as a major factor for browning reaction and {{was not included in the}} model for this study. Moisture content did however influence the time-temperature history at the food surface due to evaporation. The effect of temperature was studied by baking pastry samples (44. 55 %MC; wt% d. b.) at six different temperatures (120, 130, 140, 150, 160 and 170 ˚C) for 60 minutes. The temperature dependence of the Maillard browning reaction of pastry baking was found to follow the Arrhenius law. The kinetic parameters: the activation energy (Ea), the kinetic rate constant at 150 ºC (k 150) and the initial and final lightness (L* 0 and L*∞) were obtained from the model fitting. The parameters were fitted using both isothermal and non-isothermal methods. As the baking temperature conditions were controlled to a constant temperature so an isothermal model fitting was reasonable to use for a first approximation. The minimization of the residual sum of square errors by non-linear regression with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm function lscurvefit was applied for this fitting. The activation energy (Ea) and the kinetic rate constant at 150 ºC (k 150) values were obtained at 65. 93 kJ∙mol- 1 and 0. 017 min- 1, respectively. The initial and final lightness (L* 0 and L*∞) were estimated at 91. 78 and 65. 24, respectively. The goodness of this fit (R 2) was calculated as 0. 91. However, experimentally it was found that the temperature of the pastry surface was not absolutely constant, and hence isothermal fitting was probably not justified. Therefore, the experimental data for lightness change and time-temperature histories were re-fitted to estimate the kinetic parameters. The MATLAB® function lsqnonlin was used to optimise the kinetic parameters using a non-isothermal model. The activation energy (Ea) and the kinetic rate constant at 150 ºC (k 150) values were estimated at 71. 90 kJ/mol and 0. 025 min- 1, respectively. The initial and final lightness (L* 0 and L*∞) were obtained as 91. 21 and 67. 54, respectively. The goodness of this fit (R 2) was calculated as 0. 92. Experimental trials were carried out to validate the model using the kinetic parameters obtained from the non-isothermal model fitting. The time-temperature histories for non-isothermal baking conditions were generated using several different scenarios of pan and oven baking, which provided conductive and convective heat transfer. The validation results showed the model gave good predictions with absolute relative errors (eabs), of 1. 93 % (n = 50) and 0. 38 % (n = 8) for pan and oven baking, respectively. In addition, the developed model was shown to be applicable for use in another food type, processed potato products. The same method as the pastry baking was used for fitting the model for processed potato product baking. The kinetic parameters of Ea, k 150, L* 0 and L*∞ were obtained as 55. 99 kJ∙mol- 1, 0. 025 min- 1, 82. 90 and 49. 78, respectively. They were different to the kinetics of pastry baking because of the different composition of the processed potato product. The validation of the model against separate processed potato product baking experiments gave an absolute relative error (eabs) of 1. 95 % (n = 20) which shows that the predictions were good. The key to achieving good predictions of colour change was in basing the model on the experimentally recorded surface temperature history, rather than assuming the surface is at the cooking temperature as was done in many literature studies. The model could be accurately fitted if it were possible to measure both surface temperature and colour simultaneously during cooking. To achieve this, an oven was modified by installing a thermal camera and infrared (IR) window for observing the temperature and colour values at the same time during the cooking process. It was found that the surface of the pastry rose up during the cooking process as water evaporation created a bubble inside the pastry. This causes some variation in colour between samples. Moreover, the kinetics of the browning reaction were affected by the cooking condition, which changed the mechanism of the reaction. More than one browning kinetic was found when the different cooking conditions were applied. From the results of this study, it was hypothesied that the heating rate of the cooking had an influence on the pathway of the reaction mechanism. The fission pathway appears to be dominant when the pastry sample was baked under high temperature conditions, which produced a fast rate of the browning reaction with higher brown colour intensity than the alternatives. A lower intensity of brown colour was found on the pastry sample when baked under a slower heating rate suggesting that many intermediate compounds, such as aroma and volatile compounds, were generated in the <b>reductones</b> mechanism pathway. Following this, it was suggested that to develop a powerful kinetic model, the real cooking conditions for each food need to be indentified and used to characterise the reaction rate...|$|E
