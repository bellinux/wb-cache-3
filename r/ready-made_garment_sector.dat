40|$|This article {{studies the}} case of a workers’ strike in Myanmar's <b>ready-made</b> <b>garment</b> <b>sector</b> to {{illustrate}} how differently-situated actors have engaged at multiple scales to influence emerging forms of labour regulation in the country. The analysis is drawn out through the historicization of domestic regulatory transformation. As a hegemonic project targeting industrial peace for purposes of capital accumulation, Myanmar's labour regime has been shaped by various actors outside of government circles, including International Labour Organization (ILO) personnel, Myanmar trade unionists, foreign governments, transnational corporations, domestic capitalists and Myanmar workers. Proposing a multi-scalar reading of labour regime transformation attentive to constitutive processes of contestation, the study analyses ways in which varied, and at times unofficial, relations coalesce to shape labour regulation...|$|E
40|$|On April 24 th, 2013 Rana Plaza, {{an eight}} story garment factory in Bangladesh {{collapsed}} killing one thousand {{one hundred and}} twenty nine workers and injuring many more. To date, the collapse of Rana Plaza is the worst industrial accident {{to take place in}} Bangladesh's <b>ready-made</b> <b>garment</b> <b>sector.</b> Factory collapses and factory fires are not an uncommon occurrence within the country's growing industry; the last decade alone has seen a number of fatalities and injuries to garment workers. Man-made/technological disasters are the result of human error, negligence, or failure of a human-made system which causes damage to property and the environment as well as injuries and/or loss of life. Yet environmental disasters are caused by more than one factor. They are the result of many events and interactions over a period of time. Therefore, in order to fully understand what caused a disaster such as the collapse of Rana Plaza the broader context of the disaster requires examination. In recognizing the importance of the broader context of a disaster, this major research paper aims to investigate the causes of the collapse of Rana Plaza. Using a sociological lens and primary and secondary documents this paper examines the political, economic, social, and corporate contexts which created the conditions for the collapse. This paper highlights weaknesses in the political, economic, corporate, and social structures involved and in doing so will provide recommendations for changes to remedy discrepancies that allow disasters to occur within Bangladesh's ready-made garment industry. Ideally learning from this disaster will help in preventing similar disasters from occurring; something garment industry workers in Bangladesh need and deserve...|$|E

40|$|Women {{entering}} the industrial labour force in Bangladesh generally {{find themselves in}} low skill/low wage jobs. In fact, {{the success of the}} country's flagship export-oriented industry - the <b>ready-made</b> <b>garments</b> <b>sector</b> - is built on a large supply of cheap and flexible female labour. Nevertheless, increasing liberalization of the global textiles market creates new challenges for countries and industries that rely on a low skill/low wage strategy. They eventually find it difficult to increase productivity, and thus to retain their place in increasingly competitive markets. A second incentive for change is provided by the phasing out of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, which limited inputs of domestic origin in clothing production. In the current situation, Bangladesh has a unique opportunity to restructure its domestic apparel sector, introducing new technologies and fostering domestic production linkages. Thus the paper argues for public sector allocations combined with private sector training of the female labour force, which can stimulate women's engagement in the apparel sector, raise their productivity and ultimately improve their livelihoods...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{explores the}} gender aspects of policy reforms in Bangladesh in a sequential dynamic computational general equilibrium (CGE) framework. This research uses the most updated SAM of Bangladesh {{and is the}} first attempt to build a gendered sequential dynamic CGE model for the Bangladesh economy. A ‘home production’ version of the gendered CGE model for the Bangladesh economy is developed. The study tries to understand how gender interests are affected by greater exposure to trade and other policy reforms. The short-run and long-run impacts of policy reforms in the labour market and in the household in a gendered framework are also explored. The research performs two simulations to {{examine the impact of}} (1) domestic trade liberalisation in Bangladesh, and (2) the phasing-out of the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) on textile and garments. This research builds a gendered social accounting matrix (SAM) for the year 2000 and uses it in a sequential dynamic computable general equilibrium framework, following the representative household approach. It is found that domestic trade liberalisation leads to a significant expansion of the <b>ready-made</b> <b>garments</b> <b>sector</b> in the economy, which then leads to an increase in the labour market supply share of unskilled female labour. However, this results in a fall in the shares of domestic labour supply and leisure of unskilled female members of the households. The fall in the share of leisure time may have significant negative implications for the time spent on education by this labour category. It is also observed that the long-run impacts are different from the short-run impacts with respect to the magnitude of the effects. In the case of the second simulation, it can be noted that the MFA phase-out works in completely the opposite direction. The share of market labour supply of unskilled female members of the households decreases, and the shares of domestic work and leisure increase for most of the households both in the short and long run.

50|$|Many {{new jobs}} - mostly for women - {{have been created}} by the country's dynamic private <b>ready-made</b> <b>garment</b> industry, which grew at double-digit rates {{through most of the}} 1990s.

40|$|Bangladesh, being a labor-abundant country, {{benefits}} from {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) as it is considered {{as a supplement to}} domestic investment for this capital-scarce economy. We examine how the benefits of increased FDI in the <b>ready-made</b> <b>garments</b> (RMG) <b>sector</b> are transmitted and shared among households with different characteristics, and the appropriate government policies to mitigate adverse distributional problems, if any, created from the increased FDI. To address these issues, we develop a computable general equilibrium model for Bangladesh that describes competition between local firms and multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the RMG sector and the distributional impacts of FDI among households. Our simulation results demonstrate that an increase in FDI promotes both output and exports in the RMG sector. However, because of the competition between MNEs and domestic firms, the output of domestic firms would fall slightly. Scrutinizing the welfare effects among household groups, we find that the benefits of FDI-induced growth would affect all household groups unevenly. We also demonstrate that the benefits could be shared equitably among household groups with skill development programs targeted at the adversely affected household groups.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{explosive}} growth in the Bangladeshi <b>ready-made</b> <b>garments</b> industry on the lives on Bangladeshi women. We compare the marriage, childbearing, school enrollment and employment decisions of women who gain greater access to <b>garment</b> <b>sector</b> jobs to women living further away from factories, to years before the factories arrive close to some villages, and to the marriage and enrollment decisions of their male siblings. Girls exposed to the <b>garment</b> <b>sector</b> delay marriage and childbirth. This stems from (a) young girls becoming more likely to be enrolled in school after garment jobs (which reward literacy and numeracy) arrive, and (b) older girls becoming more likely to be employed outside the home in garment-proximate villages. The demand for education generated through manufacturing growth appears to have a much larger effect on female educational attainment compared to a large-scale government conditional cash transfer program to encourage female schooling...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, the <b>ready–made</b> <b>garments</b> (RMG) <b>sector</b> {{has opened}} up the door that allowed poor people, {{particularly}} women, to potentially lead a better life in Bangladesh. Economic globalisation {{has led to the}} growth of more employment opportunities for those women who are from the most disadvantaged sector of the society and the greatest beneficiaries of employment in the RMG sector as they have gained the power to earn. However, these women workers are also the most vulnerable to the weak legal provisions and compliance enforcement of this sector. Given the situation, the intention of the study is to highlight a bridge between group theories and institutional models through an advanced policy model-process to uphold the rights and enhance empowerment of women labourers in the RMG sector of Bangladesh. Using group theories, the study shows that decision making in the RMG sector has given high concentration to a few policy actors who are economic elites, such as entrepreneurs, and has given highest priority to achieving monetary returns. Evidence from research proves that the trade unions are virtually absent and therefore, women workers’ collective bargaining activities for addressing their grievances is limited (Mahmud 2 ̆ 6 Kabeer, 2003, p. 33). Moreover, literature suggests that the factory owners are vigilant to the threat of stakeholders like unions or employees’ associations and are largely responsible for causing unhealthy management-labour relations in RMG (Afsar, 2004, p. 142; Khan, 2004, p. 173). This has led to the violation of Bangladeshi women workers’ basic rights, including equal pay, job security and trade unionism, and labour standards such as health and safety issues. The study argues that, inadequate legislative enforcement, ‘for ensuring labour rights as well as codes of conduct’ largely ignore women workers’ voice and rights in the elite-led RMG sector of Bangladesh...|$|R

40|$|For {{the last}} two decades, <b>Ready-Made</b> <b>Garment</b> (RMG) Industry has been the life-blood of the economy of Bangladesh.
