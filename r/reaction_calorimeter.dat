40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to model the <b>reaction</b> <b>calorimeter</b> in order to {{calculate}} the heat of absorption {{which is the most}} important parameter in this work. <b>Reaction</b> <b>calorimeter</b> is an apparatus which is used in measuring the heat of absorption of CO 2 as well as the total pressure in vapor phase based on vapor-liquid equilibrium state. Mixture of monoethanolamine (MEA) and water was used as a solvent to absorb the CO 2. Project was divided in to three parts {{in order to make the}} programming procedure easier. Also, the entire programming in this project was implemented in MATLB©. These parts are: vapor-liquid equilibrium calculation, loading calculation and calculation of heat of absorption. Vapor-liquid equilibrium calculation was based on the eNRTL model. Total pressure and partial pressure of CO 2 which were calculated by this part for 30 % MEA solution at 40 oC, 80 oC and 120 oC were plotted against loading and the results are fairly close to the experimental data and validated vapor-liquid equilibrium model to be used for the rest of the project. Loading calculation was the next part of the project, the new loadings were calculated based on the injected amount of CO 2 in to the <b>reaction</b> <b>calorimeter.</b> Total pressure and partial pressure of CO 2 were computed based on the new loading and the results were plotted against the calculated loadings for 30 % MEA solution at 40 oC, 80 oC and 120 oC. For these three temperatures, results from the written model and experimental data had the same trend. The last objective of this project was to calculate the heat of absorption, which is the main concern in chemical industries, to provide enough energy to separate CO 2 from solvent solution in the solvent recovery unit. Developed model for this part could predict overall heat of absorption. Comparison between the obtained results from this model and the model developed by Kim et al.

40|$|Microstructured {{reactors}} {{are well}} known to provide far better heat exchange characteristics than attainable in macroscopic batch or flow-through reactors due to their high surface-to-volume ratios. In the last decade, {{a large number of}} studies have impressively demonstrated that the accumulation of strong reaction heats and hot spots, which result in unwanted side, subsequent and decomposition reactions, can be successfully surpressed in microreactors. Consequently, the use of microreactors greatly reduces the hazardous potential associated with reactions that are highly exothermic or potentially explosive. Greater safety is also attained with toxic substances due to the small hold-up of microfluidic devices. Here we report on the use of microreactors for the safe processing of strong exothermic reactions in the liquid and liquid/liquid regime, such as nitrations, oxidations, esterifications, etc. The hazardous potential of such reactions often arises from the huge reaction enthalpy and/or the thermolability of the reaction products or intermediates. Microreactors have been particularly used in our studies to systematically investigate strong exothermic reactions under unusual process conditions such as higher temperatures, higher concentrations or varied stoichiometries which are not possible to apply on a macroscopic scale. Such parameter screenings provide valuable routes for process intensification in terms of yield and selectivity but also with respect to energy savings and improved safety. Hence, microreactors have been deliberately used as tools for safety analyses to investigate experimentally worst case scenarios at the threshold of decomposition and runaway reactions. Moreover, we use microreactors also as measurement tools to quantify the heat release under strong exothermic process conditions. For this purpose, we have developed a continuous microL-flowthrough calorimeter which consists of a microreactor embedded between thermoelectric modules (Seebeck and Peltier elements). This new mirol-calorimeter has a very small time constant of about 2 s which is by a factor of 20 - 30 smaller than that of conventional <b>reaction</b> <b>calorimeters.</b> Hence, it is ideally suited to measure enthalpies of fast and highly exothermic reactions under both isothermal and continuous process conditions...|$|R

Provisions {{have to be made}} for a periodic examination of all acquired research results to safeguard Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and to determine whether patent applications are indicated. Patent research is particularly important for evaluation of the feasibility of taking up R&D for new APIs-for-generics.Process Research has to design new synthetic routes and sequences. Two approaches are feasible. For simple molecules, the “bottom-up” approach is the method of choice. The researcher converts a commercially available starting material and sequentially adds more reagents until the target molecule is synthesized. For more complex molecules, a “top-down” approach, also known as retro synthesis, or de-construction, is chosen. Key fragments of the target molecule are first identified, then synthesized individually, and finally combined to form the desired molecule through convergent synthesis.Process Development focuses on the design of new, efficient, stable, safe, and scalable synthetic routes to a target fine chemical. It represents an essential link between process research and commercial production. The resulting “base process” description provides the necessary data for the determination of preliminary raw material and product specifications, the manufacture of semi commercial quantities in the pilot plant, the assessment of the ecological impact, the regulatory submissions and technology transfer to manufacture at industrial scale, and an estimate of the manufacturing costs in an industrial-scale plant. If the base process is provided by the customer as part of the technology transfer, process, research has to optimize it {{so that it can be}} transferred to the bench-scale laboratory or pilot plant. Furthermore, it has to be adapted to the specific characteristics of available production trains. Bench-scale Laboratory, kg-lab and Pilot Plant Development. Depending on the volume requirements, three different types of equipment are used for process research, development and optimization, namely bench-scale laboratories for gram to 100 gram, kilo-labs for kg to 10 kg and pilot plants for 100 kg to ton quantities. Particularities of laboratory processes that have to be eliminated include the use of large numbers of unit operations, dilute reaction mixtures, vast quantities of solvents for extraction, evaporation to dryness, drying of solutions with hygroscopic salts. Although modern <b>reaction</b> <b>calorimeters</b> consent to foresee the effects of these different conditions to a certain extent, a direct transfer of a process from the laboratory to the industrial scale is not recommended, because of the inherent safety, environmental, and economic risks. In development, the viability of the process on a semi commercial scale has to be demonstrated. Trial quantities of the new fine chemical have to be manufactured for market development, clinical tests, and other requirements. The necessary data have to be generated to enable the engineering department to plan the modifications of the industrial-scale plant and in order to calculate production costs for the expected large-volume requirements. Both equipment and plant layout of the pilot plant reflect those of an industrial multipurpose plant, except for the size of reaction vessels (bench-scale laboratory ~10-60 liters; pilot plant ~100-2500 liters) and the degree of process automation. Before the process is ready for transfer to the industrial-scale plant, the following activities have to be completed: Adaptation of the laboratory process to the constraints of a pilot plant, hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, execution of demonstration batches. The main differences between laboratory synthesis and industrial scale production are shown in Table 4.|$|R
