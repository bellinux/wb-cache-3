5000|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} of {{a carrier}} wave works by varying {{the strength of}} the transmitted signal in proportion to the information being sent. For example, changes in the signal strength can be used to reflect the sounds to be reproduced by a speaker, or to specify the light intensity of television pixels. It was the method used for the first audio radio transmissions, and remains in use today. [...] "AM" [...] is often used to refer to the medium wave broadcast band (see AM radio), but it is used in various <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>services</b> such as the Citizen Band, amateur radio and especially in aviation, due to its ability to be received under very weak signal conditions and its immunity to capture effect, allowing more than one signal to be heard simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. A modern {{methods of}} digital signal {{processing}} are capable to embed imperceptibly an additional information into audio signals using so called digital watermarks (DWM). DWM are characterized by the main parameters: payload, fidelity and robustness. One {{of the most important}} methods for DWM is based on quantization of certain signal parameters. But quantization methods are very sensitive to amplitude scaling and doesn?t proved appropriate fidelity and robustness. The main part. The designed embedding algorithm is based on quantization of correlation coefficient between signal vector generally in a complex L-dimensional space and real random vector. Algorithm keeps signal norm that allows signal normalization in modulation and demodulation processes and minimizes the embedding distortions. Variants of correlation coefficient quantization in the forms of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation and Amplitude Modulation in the frequency domain of discrete Fourier transform are considered. The proposed multichannel algorithm provides robustness against intersymbol interference (ISI). It is proved advantages of data embedding in the frequency domain versus time domain and row-wise forming of signal vector for ISI resistance. It is shown by computer simulation the ability of flexible regulation of watermark performances by means of appropriate choosing of algorithm parameters. Practical implementation of the proposed algorithm is based on sliding processing in the whole and comparison of received and calculated hash functions. Conclusion. The proposed algorithm demonstrates watermarks inaudibility because of preserving signal power before and after data embedding and proportional watermarking according to instantaneous carrier signal power. Watermark payload ? fidelity ? robustness compromise is provided by appropriate parameters choosing N, L, K, ? in watermarking algorithm. The designed algorithms are applicable in mobile maritime and aeronautical <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>services</b> and resolving "analog hole" problem in the digital rights management for copy control of audio files. ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ? ???????? ??????? ? ??????????? ????? ???????. ? ???????? ????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ? ????????? ??????????????????. ??????????? ??? ? ?? ???????? ???? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ??????????? ?????????????? ????? ??? ??????? ? ?????????? ????? ??????????? ????? ? ?????????????? ???????????...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} equipment weighed 80 lb, {{and there were}} initially only 3 channels for all the users in the metropolitan area. Later, more licenses were added, bringing the total to 32 channels across 3 bands (See IMTS frequencies). This service was used at least into the 1980s in large portions of North America. On October 2, 1946, Motorola communications equipment carried the first calls on Illinois Bell Telephone Company's new car <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>service</b> in Chicago.

5000|$|Autotel (also called PALM, or Public Automated Land Mobile) is a <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>service</b> {{which was}} the [...] "missing link" [...] between earlier MTS/IMTS and later {{cellular}} telephone services. It used digital signaling for supervisory messages (call setup, ringing, channel assignment, etc.), except the voice channel was analog (as was the original NMT and AMPS cellular systems). This system was not cellular, as it used existent high-power (35 watt) VHF channels. This system was developed for rural British Columbia, Canada, where building a network of low-power cellular terminals to cover a forest would have been prohibitively expensive.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the radio-telegraph, the system also provided other services to the general public. From 1938 until 1942, under an agreement with Alberta Government Telephones, a <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>service</b> was provided at the following RC Signals stations: Edmonton, McMurray, Fort Smith, Yellowknife and Goldfields. Repeater equipment was installed in the Edmonton Radio Station with connections to {{the offices of the}} Alberta Government Telephones from where local or long distance connections were made in the normal manner. At the northern stations, telephone booths were installed and tied in with the HF transmitting and receiving equipment. It was greeted and used enthusiastically by mining and transportation companies particularly as well as the general public, for both business and social calls.|$|E
50|$|In 1922, the Australian Government, {{requiring}} a direct radio service with the UK - {{in lieu of}} submarine cables - commissioned AWA to create a service. The government boosted the new company's capital and became its majority shareholder. In 1926, the company established two large beam wireless stations on 180 hectare sites; a receiver site in Victoria at Rockbank near Melbourne and a transmitter site at Ballan near Ballarat which eventually become known as Fiskville. A shortwave beam radiotelegraph service between Australia and Britain, undercutting the cable companies, was inaugurated on 8 April 1927 and terminated on 31 May 1969. In 1928, it established a similar service between Australia and Canada. In April 1930 the Empire <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>service</b> commenced.|$|E
50|$|The Altai mobile {{telephone}} {{system is the}} pre-cellular 0G <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>service</b> that was first introduced in the Soviet Union in 1963, and became available in the most large cities by 1965. It is a fully automated UHF/VHF network that allows a mobile node to connect to a landline phones, and was originally conceived to serve government officials and emergency services, but has since spread into general use, and is still in use in some places, where its advantages outweigh those of conventional cellular networks.Work on the system of automatic duplex mobile communication started in 1958 in Voronezh Research Institute of Communications (VNIIS, now concern Sozvezdie). It was established subscriber stations and base stations for communicating with them.|$|E
50|$|Airfone was an air-ground <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>service</b> {{developed}} by MCI founder John D. Goeken, and operated under the names Airfone, GTE Airfone and Verizon. Airfone allowed passengers to make telephone calls (later including data modem service) in-flight. Airfone handsets were often {{located in the}} middle airliner seatbacks, with two handsets per row for 6-wide coach seating configurations, and more or less depending on the aircraft layout and fare class. First class cabins typically had one handset per seat. Some planes had one or more bulkhead mounted phone stations with cordless handsets that the passengers could use, instead of the multiple wired handsets. Airfone phone calls were usually quite expensive compared to ground-based telephone calls, costing $3.99 per call and $4.99 per minute in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|A U.S. air-ground {{radiotelephone}} transmits a {{radio signal}} in the 849 to 851 megahertz range; this signal {{is sent to}} either a receiving ground station or a communications satellite depending {{on the design of}} the particular system. [...] "Commercial aviation air-ground <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>service</b> licensees operate in the 800 MHz band and can provide communication services to all aviation markets, including commercial, governmental, and private aircraft." [...] If it is a call from a commercial airline passenger radiotelephone, the call is then forwarded to a verification center to process credit card or calling card information. The verification center will then route the call to the public switched telephone network, which completes the call. For the return signal, ground stations and satellites use a radio signal in the 894 to 896 megahertz range.|$|E
