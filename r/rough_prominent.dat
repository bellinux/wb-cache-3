40|$|The {{morphology}} and permeability to {{horseradish peroxidase}} {{of the rat}} aortic intima have been investigated in three experimental models of hypertension having different values of plasma renin content and plasma aldosterone level. During hypertension the aortic endothelium shows three main changes: 1) increased arithmetic mean thickness, with <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic reticulum and polyribosomes; 2) the appearance of actin microfilament bundles; and 3) increased permeability to horseradish peroxidase. These changes are not present in all models, {{do not appear to}} depend on hypertension per se, and are independent of each other. The subendothelial layer of hypertensive animals shows an increased thickness that appears to be correlated with an increase of endothelial cell volume. Our results suggest that: 1) the aortic intima reacts differently to different types of hypertension, and 2) factors other than hypertension per se {{play a role in the}} development of vascular changes observed in animals with elevated blood pressure...|$|R

A short duct connects the gland with a single separate cement reservoir. The duct appears to lack a lumen and is seen as an electron dense compact structure. Many microtubules of approximately 150 nm in outer diameter are located through the cytoplasm of the duct. It is proposed that in N. rutili the microtubules are responsible for the transport of cement granules from the gland to the reservoir.

40|$|An odontogenic myxoma of a maxilla {{has been}} examined. Histochemistry of the mucosubstance {{indicated}} that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate were present. On ultrastructural examination {{many of the}} cells in the myxomatous tissue were seen with <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a secretory function, and possibly the myxomatous ground substance was produced by these cells. Cells containing collagen fibrils were found. Epithelial islands with intercellular spaces producing an arrangement similar to the stellate reticulum of the enamel organ were found, and possibly had developed from odontogenic epithelial rests. These islands were surrounded by a clear zone, outside which were cells with an increased prominence of adenosine-triphosphatase, nucleoside-diphosphatase, thiamine-pyrophosphatase, and often arylamidase reaction products. This probably represents a reaction of the mesodermal tissue to the epithelial islands. Possibly the epithelium exerts an inductive effect on the mesodermal tissue, and the myxomatous appearance {{may be the result}} of an aberrant development of mesodermal cells into `myxoblasts' which secrete the myxomatous ground substance...|$|R

50|$|The Aerial Wheel was {{the brainchild}} of George Sturgess of Mablethorpe, Lancashire. It was a novel idea for the {{undercarriage}} of an aircraft, which Flight magazine had thought interesting enough to publish. Sturgess's explanation, accompanied by a photograph of a model appears in the issue dated 10 Dec 1910. His idea was in effect a wheel where only the rim revolves, using a pair of twelve-foot diameter hoops each of which would be free to rotate while being held in place by bearings mounted on a cradle of struts. The wing passed through the middle of the wheels. The intention was to produce a wheel that, having a large diameter, would easily roll over the rough grass surfaces that aircraft operated from at the time: ease of take off and landing from <b>rough</b> ground were <b>prominent</b> among the War Office requirements. Whatever the merits of the idea, it was far beyond the manufacturing and material technologies of the day.|$|R

Osteoblasts in PTH-treated rats had <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatuses and large mitochondria. The plasma membranes were extensively convoluted and associated with initial loci of mineralization in osteoid. Osteocytes contained increased rough endoplasmic reticulum, well-developed Golgi apparatuses and large mitochondria. Lacunar walls were roughened, but osteocytic osteolysis was not observed. Osteoclasts were encountered {{more frequently in}} PTH-treated rats, but their ultrastructural features {{were similar to those}} of controls. Osteoblasts and osteocytes in controls appeared to be inactive cells lining quiescent mineral surfaces. Parathyroid hormone treatment increased serum calcium levels and urinary hydroxyproline excretion, indicating enhanced resorption of bone mineral and matrix. Bone alkaline phosphatase and calcium-adenosine triphosphatase activities were elevated after PTH treatment and may be related to increased calcium transport by bone cells. These findings were interpreted to suggest that PTH mobilizes bone mineral by osteoclasis and increases metabolic activity of the osteocyte-osteoblast pump...|$|R
40|$|The teleost gill is {{considered}} to be of significant immunological importance, as {{it is one of the}} first tissues exposed to environmental or pathogenic challenge and thus should be well equipped to mount an effective immune response. This study characterizes ultrastructurally and immunocytochemically a tissue granulocyte (eosinophilic granular cell) from the winter flounder gill that was previously determined to be involved in the gene expression and synthesis of a known antimicrobial peptide (pleurocidin). The cell is irregular in shape with a cytoplasm characterized by numerous large, electron-dense, membrane-bounded granules. The nucleus is euchromatic and closely associated with a <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic reticulum. The cytoplasm typically contains two to three mitochondria and a centralized Golgi apparatus surrounded by numerous electron-lucent vesicles. Immunogold staining of the cells with an antipleurocidin antibody shows large number of gold particles in direct association with the electron-dense granules.

40|$|We found a {{malignant}} mesenchymal tumor with myofibrogenic differentiation {{in the liver}} of a 110 -week-old female B 6 C 3 F 1 mouse used for a carcinogenicity study. Sclerous white patches (maximum size: 20 14 mm) were observed mainly in the median lobe of the liver at necropsy. Histologically, the tumor was composed of interlacing fascicles of spindle-shaped cells with oval or elongated nuclei and lightly eosinophilic cyto-plasm. Tumor cells metastasized to the lung, parapancreatic lymph node, and spleen. Special staining revealed individual tumor cells surrounded by reticulin fibers and an abundant collagenous matrix. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for vimentin, a-smooth muscle actin, and desmin, but were negative for von Willebrand factor, Mac- 2, S- 100, and cytokeratin. Electron microscopic examination revealed that the tumor cells contained <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic reticulum and thin filaments in the cytoplasm, although they lacked basal lamina, focal densities, or lipid droplets.

40|$|Daily {{phenobarbital}} (PB) injections, on 3 - 7 consecutive days, induce {{an intense}} proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) {{associated with a}} decrease of the glucose- 6 -phosphatase activity. This situation first affects the centrolobular hepatocytes, enhancing the degree of liver lobule heterogeneity. This experimental model was used for isolation and further subfractionation of hepatocytes on Ficoll density gradients, {{as described in the}} preceding paper. Profiles of protein, DNA, RNA, glycogen, phosphorylase, and glucose- 6 -phosphatase were determined all along the gradient. Two liver cell populations were distinguished: (a) light hepatocytes (mean density 1. 10) present the same morphological characteristics as centrolobular cells, i. e., an abundant smooth ER composed of tubular elements, numerous small mitochondria, and few glycogen particles; (b) heavy hepatocytes (mean density 1. 14) are characterized by large and compact glycogen areas and <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic cisternae, as are the perilobular cells. After incubation in the Wachstein-Meisel medium, Centrolobular hepatocytes exhibit dispersed reaction sites of glucose- 6 -phosphatase activity, whereas perilobular cells present a continuous and intense reaction. Morphometric determinations were carried out for both cell populations. Centrolobular PB hepatocytes are considerably enlarged (mean diameter: 23. 7 mum); perilobular hepatocytes have a significantly smaller mean diameter of 19. 2 mum, which is close to the values of control liver cells...|$|R

Continuous cell culture (in vitro) systems have several technical advantages over in vivo systems and became widely used tools for discovering physiological/ pathophysiological mechanisms in muscle. In particular, myoblast cell lines are suitable model systems to study complex biochemical adaptations occurring in skeletal muscle and cellular responses to altered genetic/ environmental conditions. Whereas most in vitro studies use extensively characterized murine C 2 C 12 cells, a comprehensive description of an equivalent human cell line, not genetically manipulated for immortalization, is lacking. Therefore, we characterized human immortal myoblastic RCMH cells using scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and proteomics. Among more than 6200 identified proteins we confirm the known expression of proteins important for muscle function. Comparing the RCMH proteome with two well-defined nonskeletal muscle cells lines (HeLa, U 2 OS) revealed a considerable enrichment of proteins important for muscle function. SEM/TEM confirmed the presence of agglomerates of cytoskeletal components/intermediate filaments and a <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> ER. In conclusion, our results indicate RMCH as a suitable in vitro model for investigating muscle function-related processes such as mechanical stress burden and mechanotransduction, EC coupling, cytoskeleton, muscle cell metabolism and development, and (ER-associated) myopathic disorders.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the morphological and histological characteristics of healthy animal peritoneum, with special references to its microvasculature. Biopsies of parietal peritoneum from the front abdominal wall were collected from 5 healthy rabbits (2 male and 3 female) and 8 persons (2 males and 6 females) mean age 52, 50 ± 5, 18 years. Semithin sections were fixed in Sorensen's phosphate buffer and stained with toluidin blue for light microscopy with Opton Photomicroskope III. Ultrathin sections for transmission electron microscopy were fixed in glutaraldehyde, postfixed in osmium tetroxyde, contrasted with uranyl acetate and viewed with EM Philips M 208 S transmission electron microscope. Normal rabbit and human parietal peritoneum is composed of a sheet of flat mesothelial cells separated by a continuous basement membrane of connective tissue containing collagen and elastin fibers, fibroblasts, mononuclear phagocytes lymphocytes, adipose tissue, small blood vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerves. Only continuous capillaries were observed. Preponderance of euchromatin over heterochromatin was found in the nuclei of endothelial cells. Endothelial citoplasm shows <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic reticulum well-developed Golgi apparatus, numerous mitochondria and ribosomes.

40|$|Hepatic lipocytes were {{isolated}} from normal rat liver and established in culture. A virtually pure isolate {{was obtained by}} fractionating enzymatically digested liver on a discontinuous gradient of arabinogalactan. Isolated cells displayed <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic reticulum and typical cytoplasmic droplets containing vitamin A. Lipocytes in primary culture were shown by immunofluorescence to secrete collagen types I, III, and IV and also laminin. Immunoassay of culture media showed that lipocytes {{during the first week}} in culture secrete type I (72. 1 - 86. 2 % of total measured soluble collagen), type III (2. 6 - 7. 2 %), and type IV (11. 2 - 29. 7 %) collagens. Five percent of total secreted protein was collagen compared with 0. 2 % in similarly cultured hepatocytes and 1. 7 % in sinusoidal endothelial cells, as measured by the production of peptide-bound [3 H]hydroxyproline in cells incubated with [3 H]proline. The calculated amount of collagen synthesized by lipocytes per microgram of cellular DNA was 10 -fold greater than that produced by hepatocytes and over 20 -fold greater than that produced by endothelial cells. The findings indicate that collagen synthesis and secretion are specialized functions of hepatic lipocytes, and that, in cells from normal liver, this represents production primarily of type I collagen. The phenotypic resemblance of these cells to fibroblasts supports the hypothesis that lipocytes are a major source of collagen in pathologic fibrosis and may be precursors of the fibroblast-like cells observed in liver injury...|$|R
40|$|We have {{reported}} that neurokinin A (NKA) can contract isolated mucosal strips from porcine bladder, with dense smooth muscle actin staining on the suburothelial myofibroblasts – these may mediate the contraction to NKA (Sadananda et al., Br J Pharmacol 2008; 153, 1465 - 73). Our aim {{was to examine the}} ultrastructure of the porcine bladder mucosa and characterize the relationship of the suburothelial myofibroblasts with adjacent cells. Pig bladders obtained from an abbatoir were processed for electron microscopy. The suburothelial population of myofibroblasts were morphologically similar to the deep myofibroblasts of human detrusor, in that they have <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic reticulum and elongated processes. Extensive nerve bundles with varicosities were located below the urothelium and in close proximity to myofibroblasts. These nerve bundles contained individual varicosities with discrete regions (bare of Schwann cells) containing synaptic vesicles, facing the potential neuroeffector cell. This is in accordance with the definition of neuroeffector junctions, as neurotransmitter release sites. These dense-cored synaptic vesicles were 100 - 250 nm in diameter, consistent with a primarily peptidergic content. In low resolution studies (n = 4), synaptophysin and tachykinin immunoreactivity localised nerve fibres containing tachykinins within the suburothelial nerve plexus and in association with myofibroblasts. In conclusion, the strategic location of suburothelial myofibroblasts between the urothelium and afferent nerve plexus suggests that they are involved in sensory processing and cross talk between cell layers. We hypothesise that peptides such as NKA are released from these dense-cored synaptic vesicle-containing varicosities, to act directly on suburothelial myofibroblasts, resulting in contraction of the porcine bladder mucosa...|$|R
40|$|Myofibroblastic {{conversion}} of mesothelial cells. BackgroundThe continuous chemical, physical, and inflammatory insults of prolonged continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) incite mesothelial cell responses, which {{may result in}} peritoneal fibrosis. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), especially the isoform TGF-β 1, {{has long been known}} to play crucial role in the fibrogenic process. Although several studies have implicated TGF-β in peritoneal fibrosis, the underlying mechanism has not been completely elucidated. MethodsTo test the effects of exogenous TGF-β 1 on mesothelial cells, we assessed cytoarchitectural changes of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC) in in vitro culture by light, immunofluorescent, electron and immunoelectron microscopy, and differential gene expression analysis using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cDNA expression array assays. ResultsThe TGF-β 1 –induced myofibroblastic conversion was a transdifferentiation process resulting in characteristic myofibroblastic phenotype that included <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic reticuli (rER) with dilated cisternas, conspicuous smooth muscle actin (SMA) myofilaments, frequent intercellular intermediate and gap junctions, and active deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and formation of fibronexus. The gene expression array analysis revealed complex modulation of gene expression involving cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, ECM production, cell proliferation, innate immunity, cytokine/growth factor signaling, cytoprotection, stress response, and many other essential metabolic processes in mesothelial cells. ConclusionThis report describes myofibroblastic {{conversion of}} mesothelial cells, a previously undefined, yet frequently speculated, cell adaptive or pathogenic process. Our study helps to elucidate the complex molecular and cellular events involved in myofibroblastic conversion of mesothelial cells. We propose that differentiated epithelial cells of mesothelium convert or transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, which implies the recruitment of fibrogenic cells from mesothelium during serosal inflammation and wound healing...|$|R
40|$|The ultrastructural {{characteristics}} of euspermatogenesis and mature euspermatozoa of Cerithidea cingulata are described. Euspermatogonia possesses a large round concentric nucleus {{with one or}} two nucleoli. The spermatocyte is characterized by the abundant cytoplasmic organelles and eccentric nucleus with chromatin distributed throughout as small granules. In the early spermatid, euspermiogenesis begins with the condensation of nucleus, the granular nuclear chromatin changes to fibrillar, lamellar and finally a homogenous and highly electron dense nucleus. The cytoplasm of the early spermatid contains a well developed Golgi complex with many vesicles and a <b>prominent</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic reticulum located between the connection of the two daughter cells. Acrosome formation starts with proacrosomal vesicle which usually appears close to the well developed Golgi complex. This proacrosomal vesicle differentiates into a pre-attachment acrosome which then moves anteriorly towards the nucleus and finally attaches to the nuclear apex. The features of euspermiogenesis and of the mature eusperm observed in Cerithidea cingulata are similar to many of those in Cerithioideans. The mature acrosome composes of a tapering acrosomal cone, an axial rod and a basal plate. The middle piece of the mature eusperm comprises four equal and non-helical mitochondrial elements around the axonemal microtubules. A dense ring structure separates the middle piece from the glycogen piece. The glycogen piece is the proximal part of the tail which consists of an axoneme surrounded by nine tracts of dense glycogen granules, while the end piece of the tail lacks glycogen. Euspermatozoa and euspermatogenesis of Cerithidea cingulata, though showing some differences between species, do share a number of basic structure features which distinguish potamidid snails from other relatively close families...|$|R
