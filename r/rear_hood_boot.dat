25|$|Dry suits with {{adequate}} thermal undergarments are standard environmental protection for ice diving, though {{in some cases}} thick wetsuits may suffice. <b>Hoods,</b> <b>boots</b> and gloves are also worn. Full-face masks can provide more protection for the divers' facial skin.|$|R
5000|$|SPRINT by Fitch emblem (small): Replaces large SPRINT by Fitch emblems. Smaller emblem {{designed}} to fit and work correctly on new Venttop offered for late models. Larger emblem was still used on the <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> in place of HP emblem until supplies ran out and was replaced with the small emblem (i.e. both small and large SPRINT emblems may be found on <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> on late models). Also, smaller SPRINT emblems were used as replacements on early models. 13-inch Hands aluminum mag wheels: 5-lug, 8-slot mags w/3-prong spinner for 65 and later (few were so equipped due to the scarcity of these wheels. Fitch himself could not locate a set for his Phoenix).|$|R
5000|$|After {{the second}} race, the CSI rule makers {{insisted that the}} [...] "whale tail" [...] hood of the road-going 930 must fit on the race car. The air-to-air {{intercooler}} setup under the <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> had to be altered to a more compact air-to-water layout, which cost Porsche several weeks of testing and half a million Deutsche marks.|$|R
50|$|Brazilian {{rosewood}} {{gear shift}} knob: Attractive rosewood shift knob with three dimensional embossed Sprint checkerboard insignia. Racing stripe (painted): Stripe runs {{front to back}} along top of fender but not on front or <b>rear</b> <b>hood.</b> Optional paint to fill in entire area between headlights. Optional rear cove painted to match stripe (in acrylic lacquer). Available at John Fitch and Co. only.|$|R
50|$|Located {{underneath}} the front hood is the traction assembly - a K 6 S 310 DR diesel engine and a TD 802 traction generator - and auxiliary machinery {{powered by the}} diesel engine via a hydrodynamic transmission. Chillers and ventilators are located here as well. TE 006 traction motors are axle-mounted on the wheel sets. Located {{underneath the}} <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> are batteries and a supply of sand.|$|R
50|$|IZh-412 {{practically}} {{similar to}} M-412, with slight {{changes in the}} frontal grille, most notably retaining twin round headlights. The car was still marketed as Moskvich 412 and had such name on a <b>rear</b> <b>hood,</b> while IZh-412 was a factory designation. After a facelift in 1982 it received a black grille with indicators on outer sides of headlights, and hollow door handles (factory code IZh-412-028), and remained in production until 1997.|$|R
50|$|The {{heavy duty}} K6 and larger use a center hinged {{butterfly}} hood {{rather than the}} <b>rear</b> hinged <b>hood</b> of the smaller trucks.|$|R
2500|$|Semi-dry {{suits are}} {{effectively}} a thick wetsuit with nearly watertight seals at wrist, neck and ankles and zip. They are typically used {{where the water}} temperature is between [...] The seals limit the volume of water entering and leaving the suit, and a close fit minimises pumping action caused by limb motion. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and does not readily leave the suit, so the wearer remains warm. The trapped layer of water does not add to the suit's insulating ability, and any water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss, but semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits, and do not fail catastrophically. They are made from thick Neoprene, which provides good thermal protection, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the trapped gas bubbles in the neoprene foam compress at depth. Semi-dry suits are usually made as a one piece full suit with slick inside surface neoprene wrist, cuff and neck seals [...] Two-piece sets {{tend to be a}} one piece full length suit, sometimes described as [...] "long johns", plus accessories to be worn over, under or with the one-piece suit, such as a shortie tunic, which may be worn separately in warm water, but has no flush-limiting seals at the openings. Semi dry suits do not usually include <b>hoods,</b> <b>boots</b> or gloves, so separate insulating <b>hoods,</b> <b>boots</b> and gloves are worn.|$|R
50|$|The central hood {{is made up}} of two screw-mounted {{side panels}} and a two-piece roof, with hatches for engine access, bolted to the sides. In the space {{just in front of the}} cab is a fan cooling the {{traction}} motors of the rear bogie, the exciter and a belt-driven charging dynamo, and the muffler. The short <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> contains the electrical panel and batteries. Electrical devices, the battery master switch, circuit breakers and other switches are directly accessible from the driver's cab.|$|R
5000|$|The GP40-2 can be {{distinguished}} from the earlier GP40 by the oval-shaped water-level sight glass at the right rear of the long hood; bolted (rather than hinged) battery boxes ahead of the cab; lengthened walkway blower duct; and various minor cosmetic differences in the front air intake and <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> doors. [...] A number of GP40-2s also came with the new Blomberg M-type trucks, with single-clasp brakes, rubber pads replacing the central leaf springs and a shock strut over each axle.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{the obvious}} danger of heat, firefighters are exposed to toxic fumes, sharp objects, uneven ground, {{slippery}} surfaces, biological fluids, spilt chemicals and electricity. Due to these hazards, firefighting uniforms need {{to provide the best}} possible protection. Firefighting ensembles are known as Personal Protective Clothing (PPC) and generally consists of tunic, flash <b>hoods,</b> <b>boots,</b> helmet, gloves, breathing apparatus, overtrousers and other assorted items such as bushfire jackets, high-visibility safety vests, cold and extreme climate clothing, and wet weather clothing. In mid-2013, FRNSW issued new firefighting PPC ensembles to bring the organisation in line with the Australian Standard. This new PPC features a Nomex and Kevlar blend called Titan for the outer layer, and a moisture barrier to prevent steam burns.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] LS-4 {{big-block}} V8 {{engine was}} offered delivering [...] and 15% {{of the cars}} were ordered so equipped. “454” emblems adorned the hood of big-block equipped Corvettes. All models featured a new cowl induction domed hood, which pulled air in through a <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> intake into the engine compartment under full throttle, increasing power (but didn't {{show up in the}} horsepower ratings). 0-60 times were reduced by a second while keeping the engine compartment cooler. The new tire size was GR70-15 with white stripes or raised white letters optional. An aluminum wheel option was seen on 1973 and 1974 pilot cars, and a few 1973s were so equipped, but withheld for quality issues, and wouldn't be available until 1976.|$|R
50|$|Robbins shoots and {{apparently}} kills the demon, and steals its <b>hood</b> and <b>boots</b> rather than leave empty-handed. Disposing {{of the gun}} in a dumpster, Robbins encounters a gang who wants the boots he had stolen off a HYDRA agent {{before going to the}} warehouse. Throwing the boots at the gang, he flees and puts on the demon's boots, learning of their levitation powers.|$|R

5000|$|Galion {{introduced}} its modern -looking articulated grader line in 1979. It featured a distinctively sloped <b>rear</b> engine <b>hood</b> and {{was identified as}} the A-series for [...] "Articulated". Initially three models were introduced, the A-500, A-550, and A-600, weighing up to 30,000 pounds. These models joined the rigid-frame models, which continued in the Galion line until the mid-1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The model 244 {{diesel engine}} {{used in the}} RSC-24 program saw their {{horsepower}} derated to [...] In {{order to make the}} locomotive suitable for weight-restricted light rail branch lines, MLW built the locomotives using a switcher frame as a start, resulting in the [...] "squashed" [...] appearance of a road switcher. This was largely the result of a very short <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> housing the electrical cabinet, whereas electrical cabinets were normally located in the long hood on most road switcher designs. In order to make the locomotive suitable for weight-restricted light rail branch lines, MLW spread the weight over the rail surface using A1A-A1A trucks (2 powered axles, 1 unpowered axle) which were manufactured by Dominion Foundries and Steel (DOFASCO); this same truck was also adopted for the MLW RSC-13. This resulted in less traction, hence the need to de-rate the engine horsepower to avoid wheel slippage.|$|R
50|$|There were no 1996 {{model year}} Jeep Wranglers. YJs {{produced}} in early 1996 were sold as 1995 model years, but featured {{a few new}} parts not seen on any earlier YJ. This included the new TJ bumpstops on the <b>hood</b> (rubber <b>boots</b> vs the traditional U-bars), reinforced tailgate hinges, and some even had rear TJ bumpers. Some also got the newly tuned I6 {{that was designed to}} run quieter in preparation for the TJ.|$|R

50|$|In 1968 the RPB Piraya was introduced. It was a low, two seated kit {{car with}} gullwing-doors {{inspired}} by the Ford GT40 and made for a Volkswagen Beetle chassis. It sold 40 kits {{in less than a}} year, but some customers found it difficult to assemble the cars. In 1969 the RPB-GT was introduced. Prices started at 3800 SEK. The design was similar to the Piraya, but had normal front hinged doors. The kit was made easier to assemble for the customer. The GT sold well, most as kits, but some as completed cars. It used a fuel tank from Renault 10, hinges to the front and <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> came from Renault 4, door handles and locks from Renault 16, door hinges and side windows (cut to size) from the Mini, the front screen from a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette, rear and front lights were Hella universal (although the same headlight units was also used in Saab 96, Saab 99 and Renault 16).|$|R

5|$|Soleil's {{squadron}} departed Rochefort on {{the evening}} of 24 September, aiming to bypass Hood's squadron in the dark. However at 01:00 on 25 September, with the wind coming from the northeast, lookouts on HMS Monarch spotted sails to the east. Hood's squadron was spread out, tacking southeast towards the Chassiron Lighthouse at Saint-Denis-d'Oléron with HMS Centaur in the centre, HMS Revenge to the east (or windward) and Monarch to the west. HMS Mars was also close by, {{with the rest of the}} squadron spread out in the <b>rear.</b> <b>Hood's</b> immediate reaction was that the sails must belong to a squadron of French ships of the line, and ordered his ships to form a line of battle in anticipation. Even as the signal was raised however, lookouts on Monarch identified the strangers as frigates and Hood abandoned his previous orders and raised a new signal ordering a general chase, confident that his ships could destroy the convoy even without the power and defensive capability of a line of battle.|$|R

2500|$|The first postwar Pontiac {{available}} (September 13, 1945) was the Streamliner coupe, which {{remained the}} sole product for a time. The Chieftain trim level of 1942 was renamed the Deluxe trim level in 1946. Styling highlights of Pontiacs were wraparound bumpers, a massive 14 blade grille, new nameplates and concealed safe-light parking lamps. Streamliners {{could be identified}} by straight back Indian moldings on the <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> ornament chrome beltline moldings and bright moldings on the [...] "speedline" [...] fender ribs. They also had longer front fender crown moldings and were generally larger in size. Lettering on hood emblems and badges placed forward of the [...] "speedlines" [...] identified Eights. Interior trim on passenger cars were in gray striped cloth. Station wagons had three seats in standard trim, two seats in Deluxe trim and used imitation leather upholstery and passenger car style interior hardware. Ranging in price from $1942 for a standard Six to $2047 for a Deluxe Eight, Streamliner station wagons continued {{to be the most}} expensive Pontiac model. A total of 92,731 Streamliners were sold in 1946, accounting for over two thirds of all Pontiacs.|$|R

25|$|A new front-drive {{platform}} underpinned the car, {{although the}} wheelbase remained unchanged and overall length grew by a lone centimetre. Weight-saving aluminum was {{employed in the}} <b>hood,</b> <b>rear</b> hatch, front axle and brake calipers (disc brakes were finally assigned to all four wheels).|$|R
5000|$|The XK140 was {{introduced}} in late 1954 and sold as a 1955 model. Exterior changes that distinguished it from the XK120 included more substantial front and rear bumpers with overriders, and flashing turn signals (operated by a switch on the dash) above the front bumper.The grille remained the same size but became a one-piece cast unit with fewer, and broader, vertical bars. The Jaguar badge was incorporated into the grille surround. A chrome trim strip ran along {{the centre of the}} bonnet (<b>hood)</b> and <b>boot</b> (trunk) lid. An emblem on the boot lid contained the words [...] "Winner Le Mans 1951-3".|$|R
