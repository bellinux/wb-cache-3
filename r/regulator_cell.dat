40|$|A {{population}} of thymus-derived lymphocytes {{has been identified}} that, upon activation by the nonspecific plant mitogen concanavalin A, suppresses the development of plaque-forming cell responses in fresh or 48 -h antigen-stimulated cultures of mouse spleen cells. Suppressor cells can inhibit both primary and secondary IgM and IgG responses in vitro. X-irradiation before activation of peripheral thymus-derived cells by concanavalin A abrogates generation of suppressor cells. After a 48 h activation period, however, the function of concanavalin A-activated suppressor cells is radioresistant. As yet uncertain is whether these suppressor cells are a {{population of}} cells distinct from thymus-derived "helper" cells. In certain important regards, the cells mediating these two opposing functions share similar characteristics; the effect observed may {{be determined by the}} circumstances of activation or the numbers of activated cells, and may consequently represent different functions of a single thymus-derived <b>regulator</b> <b>cell</b> population...|$|E
40|$|The cell {{polarity}} protein SCRIB is {{a critical}} regulator of polarization, cell migration and tumourigenesis. Whereas SCRIB is known to regulate early stages of mouse mammary gland development, its function in the adult gland is not known. Using an inducible RNAi mouse model for downregulating SCRIB expression, we report an unexpected role for SCRIB as a positive regulator of cell proliferation during pregnancy associated mammary alveologenesis. SCRIB was required in the epithelial cell compartment of the mammary gland. Lack of SCRIB attenuated prolactin-induced activation of the JAK 2 /STAT 5 signaling pathway. In addition, loss of SCRIB resulted in the downregulation of PRLR at cell surface and accumulation in intracellular structures that express markers of the Golgi apparatus and the recycling endosome.

40|$|Helper and {{suppressor}} {{cells have}} been identified in lymph nodes of multiparous pregnant mice using one-way mixed lymphocyte reactions. Primiparous C 57 Bl and C 57 Bl/ 10 ScSn females during pregnancy and immediately post-partum gave unaltered MLR reactivity compared to virgin controls when stimulated with paternal or third-party alloantigens. In contrast, multiparity produced strain-dependent alterations in responsiveness: C 57 Bl females being hyporesponsive while C 57 Bl/ 10 ScSn mice were hyper-responsive to these antigens. To evaluate <b>regulator</b> activity, the <b>cells</b> were treated with mitomycin C and mixed with normal syngeneic MLR responder populations. Results showed that mixtures of para-aortic and inguinal lymph node cells from pregnant C 57 Bl females suppressed while those from pregnant C 57 Bl/ 10 ScSn increased normal virgin MLR responses. Treatment of the <b>regulator</b> <b>cells</b> with anti-Thy- 1. 2 plus complement showed that suppressor activity was predominantly non-T cell in nature while C 57 Bl/ 10 ScSn helper activity was wholly T cell-dependent.

The interest surrounding the physiology of AT is primarily {{the result of}} the epidemic outburst of obesity in various contemporary societies. Briefly, the two primary metabolic activities of white AT include lipogenesis and lipolysis. Throughout the last two decades, a new model of AT physiology has emerged. Although AT was considered to be primarily an abundant energy source, it is currently considered to be a prolific producer of biologically active substances, and, consequently, is now recognized as an endocrine organ. In addition to leptin, other biologically active substances secreted by AT, generally classified as cytokines, include adiponectin, interleukin- 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, resistin, vaspin, visfatin, and many others now collectively referred to as adipokines.

40|$|Hyperproliferation of {{bile duct}} {{epithelial}} cells due to cell-cycle dysregulation {{is a key}} feature of cystogenesis in polycystic liver diseases (PCLDs). Recent evidence suggests a regulatory role for microRNAs (miRNAs) {{in a variety of}} biological processes, including cell proliferation. We therefore hypothesized that miRNAs may be involved in the regulation of selected components of the cell cycle and might contribute to hepatic cystogenesis. We found that the cholangiocyte cell line PCK-CCL, which is derived from the PCK rat, a model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), displayed global changes in miRNA expression compared with normal rat cholangiocytes (NRCs). More specific analysis revealed decreased levels of 1 miRNA, miR 15 a, both in PCK-CCL cells and in liver tissue from PCK rats and patients with a PCLD. The decrease in miR 15 a expression was associated with upregulation of its target, the cell-cycle <b>regulator</b> <b>cell</b> division cycle 25 A (Cdc 25 A). Overexpression of miR 15 a in PCK-CCL cells decreased Cdc 25 A levels, inhibited cell proliferation, and reduced cyst growth. In contrast, suppression of miR 15 a in NRCs accelerated cell proliferation, increased Cdc 25 A expression, and promoted cyst growth. Taken together, these results suggest that suppression of miR 15 a contributes to hepatic cystogenesis through dysregulation of Cdc 25 A...|$|E

Methods: We investigated the expression of Sox 11 in 132 diffuse astrocytomas in relation to the <b>regulator</b> <b>cell</b> marker nestin, c-Met and IDH 1 -R 132 H, which have shown to be differentially expressed among the molecular subgroups of malignant gliomas, as well as to an inducer of astrocytic differentiation, that is, signal transducer and activator of transcription (p-STAT- 3), clinicopathological features and survival. Results: Sox 11 immunoreactivity was identified in all tumours irrespective of grade, but being correlated with p-STAT- 3. Three out of seven cases showed partial Sox 11 promoter methylation. In > 50 % of our cases neoplastic cells coexpressed Sox 11 and nestin, a finding further confirmed in primary glioblastoma cell cultures. Furthermore, nestin, c-Met and IDH 1 -R 132 H expression differed among grade categories. Cluster analysis identified four groups of patients according to c-Met, nestin and IDH 1 -R 132 H expression. The c-Met/nestin high-expressor group displayed a higher Sox 11 expression. Sox 11 expression was an indicator of favourable prognosis in glioblastomas, which remained in multivariate analysis and validated in an independent set of 72 cases. The c-Met/nestin high-expressor group was marginally with shorter survival in univariate analysis. Conclusions: We highlight the importance of Sox 11 expression as a favourable prognosticator in glioblastomas. c-Met/nestin/IDH 1 -R 132 H expression phenotypes recapitulate the molecular subgroups of malignant glioma...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose PDE 4 {{inhibition}} suppresses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), {{an animal}} model of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, side effects hinder PDE 4 inhibitors clinical use. PDE 7 inhibition might constitute an alternative therapeutic strategy, but few {{data about the}} anti-inflammatory potential of PDE 7 inhibitors are currently available. We have used the EAE model to perform a comparative evaluation of PDE 4 and PDE 7 inhibition as strategies for MS treatment. Experimental Approach Two PDE 7 inhibitors, the sulfonamide derivative BRL 50481 and the recently described quinazoline compound TC 3. 6, were assayed to modulate EAE in SJL mice, {{in comparison with the}} well-known PDE 4 inhibitor Rolipram. We evaluated clinical signs, presence of inflammatory infiltrates in CNS and anti-inflammatory markers. We also analysed the effect of these inhibitors on the inflammatory profile of spleen cells in vitro. Key Results TC 3. 6 prevented EAE with efficacy similar to Rolipram, while BRL 50481 had no effect on the disease. Differences between both PDE 7 inhibitors are discussed. Data from Rolipram and TC 3. 6 showed that PDE 4 and PDE 7 inhibition work through both common and distinct pathways. Rolipram administration caused an increase in IL- 10 and IL- 27 expression which was not found after TC 3. 6 treatment. On the other hand, both inhibitors reduced IL- 17 levels, prevented infiltration in CNS and increased the expression of the T <b>regulator</b> <b>cell</b> marker Foxp 3. Conclusions and Implications These results provide new information about the effects of Rolipram on EAE, underline PDE 7 inhibition as a new therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases and show the value of TC 3. 6 to prevent EAE, with possible consequences for new therapeutic tools in MS. © 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{identify}} microRNAs (miRNAs) {{regulated by}} Fuzheng Huayu prescription (FZHY) and analyze their biological functions, and to partially reveal the antifibrotic mechanism of FZHY in liver fibrosis. MethodsThe mouse model of liver fibrosis {{was developed by}} subcutaneous injection of CCl 4. The mice were divided into normal group, model group, and FZHY group. The mice received FZHY once a day at 3 days before model establishment, and the treatment lasted for 8 weeks. Collagen deposition in liver tissue was evaluated by Sirius Red staining and determination of hydroxyproline (Hyp) content. The expression profile of miRNAs in mouse liver was determined by miRNA microarray. According to the expression profile, miRNAs regulated by FZHY were identified by looking for miRNAs showing the same trends in the normal group and the FZHY group compared with the model group. The results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. The miRNA targets were predicted using TargetScan program and PITA database. The DAVID database was used to analyze and identify the substantial functions and signaling pathways of those miRNA targets. Comparison between multiple groups was made by analysis of variance. ResultsFZHY substantially reduced Hyp content and inhibited collagen deposition in the fibrotic liver tissue. The miRNA microarray identified mmu-miR- 322, mmu-miR- 342 - 3 p, and mmu-miR- 296 - 5 p as miRNAs regulated by FZHY. According {{to the analysis of}} signaling pathway, the three miRNAs might regulate 32 signaling pathways, including chemokine signaling pathway, focal adhesion, MAPK signaling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, gap junction, ECM-receptor interaction, Wnt signaling pathway, and Jak-STAT signaling pathway, which were closely related to liver fibrosis; the functional enrichment analysis predicted 32 substantial functions of the three miRNAs, including GTPase <b>regulator,</b> <b>cell</b> junction, regulation of apoptosis, regulation of Ras signal transduction, and small GTPase regulator, which were closely related to liver fibrosis. ConclusionThe antifibrotic effect of FZHY in the liver might be achieved by down-regulation of the expression of miR- 322, miR- 342 - 3 p, and miR- 296 - 5 p, which regulates their specific functions, such as MAPK signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, regulation of apoptosis, and regulation of Ras signal transduction.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether this restoration of <b>regulator</b> <b>cell</b> function is the only mechanism in the prevention of diabetes by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. We tested therefore if 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 could prevent cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes, since diabetes occurring after cyclophosphamide injection is believed to be due to an elimination of suppresser cells. NOD mice treated with 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 (5 microg/kg every 2 days) from the time of weaning were clearly protected against diabetes induced by cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg body wt at 70 days old) (2 / 12 (17 %) versus 36 / 53 (68 %) in control mice, P < 0. 005). By co-transfer experiments it was demonstrated that cyclophosphamide had indeed eliminated the suppresser cells present in 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -treated mice. Since cyclophosphamide injection did not break the protection offered by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, it was clear that diabetogenic effector cells were affected by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 treatment as well. This was confirmed by the finding that splenocytes from 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -treated mice were less capable of transferring diabetes in young, irradiated NOD mice, and by the demonstration of lower Th 1 cytokine levels in the pancreases of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -treated, cyclophosphamide-injected mice. This better elimination of effector cells in 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -treated mice could be explained by a restoration of the sensitivity to cyclophosphamide-induced apoptosis in both thymocytes and splenocytes, in normally apoptosis-resistant NOD mice. Altogether, these data indicate that the protection against diabetes offered by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 may be independent of the presence of suppresser cells, and may involve increased apoptosis of Th 1 autoimmune effector cells. status: publishe...|$|E

Subsequent experiments were carried out on 20 Balb/c mice to estimate the effects of AGE and AFB 1 on the number of Treg cell in 4 groups: 10 μl/kg/day of AFB 1 and AGE diluents were administered for 4 consecutive days to group 1. AFB 1, 2. control, 3. AGE + AFB 1 and 4. AGE via intraperitoneal (IP) route, respectively. Mice were sacrificed and splenocytes harvested and the percentage of splenic Treg cells was measured by flow cytometry analysis. The ELISA method was utilized to measure Cytokine production. Results: The findings reveal that AGE increased the level of IFN-γ and IL- 4 cytokines produced by splenocytes stimulated by specific tumor antigen and decreased the number of Treg cells in the spleen (p< 0. 05). AFB 1 increased the number Treg cells in the spleen and decreased cytokine production (p< 0. 05). In groups 2 (control) and 4 (AGE) the number of Treg cells decreased (p value< 0. 05) whereas in groups 1 and 3 the number of Treg cells increased (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: This study indicated that AGE is able to alter the cytokine production in normal mice into a Th 1 protective pattern which is beneficial to the immune system in general and anti-tumor immunity in particular. AFB 1 is able to alter the cytokine production into a Th 2 protective pattern.

40|$|Pigment Epithelium-derived Factor (PEDF), {{a natural}} protein {{possessing}} both neuroprotective and anti-angiogenic properties, {{is a very}} unique and attractive candidate as a therapeutic agent {{in the management of}} pathological neovascular diseases, such as tumours, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy. While it is well-known that PEDF can exert powerful effects on various tissues and cells, the underlying mechanism of PEDF's action is not well understood. This study investigated the relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) /PEDF and VEGFR- 1 /VEGFR- 2 by exploring Presenilin-l (PS-l) dependent regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). Work on this non-classical pathway was initiated by Cai et al., (2006) using in vitro models of bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cells (BRMECs). Current study used BRMECs and human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cells. In this study, BRMECs and HRPE cells were isolated and cultured. BRMECs were used as an angiogenic cell type while HRPE cells were used as an angiogenic <b>regulator</b> <b>cell</b> type. The characteristics of endothelial and epithelial cells and the localisation of VEGFR- 1, VEGFR- 2 and PS in BRMECs and HRPE cells were determined using immunocytochemistry techniques. The effects of VEGF and PEDF on VEGFR- 1, VEGFR- 2 and PS were assessed using immunocytochemistry and Western blotting, y-secretase activity in BRMECs and HRPE cells treated with various growth factors were analysed using a y-secretase activity kit. The role of VEGF on the production of PEDF and the expression of VEGFR- 1, VEGFR- 2 and PS in HRPE cells was investigated at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The techniques, VEGF-small interfering ribonucleic acid (VEGF-siRNA), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used for the investigation. Results obtained from the project showed that PEDF had a regulatory role in the counterbalance of VEGFR- 1 and VEGFR- 2 expression in cultured BRMECs. PEDF upregulated y-secretase activity and PS- 1 expression in BRMECs while VEGF acted as an antagonist of the effect of PEDF. In contrast, in HRPE cells, VEGF upregulated y-secretase activity and PEDF acted as an antagonist of the effect of VEGF. VEGF-siRNA induced a reduction of PEDF at both transcriptional and protein levels and a reduction of VEGFR- 1 at the protein level. The effects of VEGF and PEDF on VEGFR- 1 and VEGFR- 2 may be cell type dependent. This study strengthens the view that PEDF can exert different regulatory effects on the same molecule (s) in different cell types. PEDF acts either antagonistically to VEGF or synergistically dependent upon the target molecule. Deciphering the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions will not only contribute to our understanding of PEDF's action but also provide the foundation to maximise the therapeutic potential of this protein.

40|$|The endoreplication {{programme}} {{consists of}} multiple rounds of full genome replication {{in the absence}} of any intervening mitosis. This leads to an increase in nuclear ploidy that has been linked to the initiation of cell differentiation and growth. Recent work (Breuer et al, 2012) has identified the GTL 1 transcription factor as a master <b>regulator</b> of <b>cell</b> growth through two different mechanisms: one, endoreplication dependent where GTL 1 acts as a repressor of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), and another as a <b>regulator</b> of endoreplication-independent <b>cell</b> growth.
