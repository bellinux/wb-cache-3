500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} written on acoustic guitar {{in the key}} of C major. The recorded version is approximately in B major; owing to manipulation of the <b>recording</b> <b>speed,</b> the finished version is not in standard pitch (some, for instance, consider that the tonic is A). The introduction was played by McCartney on a Mellotron, and involves a I–ii–I–VII–IV progression. The vocals enter with the chorus instead of a verse. In fact we are not [...] "taken down" [...] to the tonic key, but to [...] "non-diatonic chords and secondary dominants" [...] combining with [...] "chromatic melodic tension intensified through outrageous harmonisation and root movement". The phrase [...] "to Strawberry" [...] for example begins with a somewhat dissonant G melody note against a prevailing F minor key, then uses the semi-tone dissonance B and B notes (the natural and sharpened 11th degrees against the Fm chord) until the consonant F note is reached on [...] "Fields". The same series of mostly dissonant melody notes cover the phrase [...] "nothing is real" [...] against the prevailing F7 chord (in A key).|$|E

They altered the apparent key of her performances (sometimes raised or lowered by as much as a semitone).

2500|$|In August 2005, China Central Television (CCTV) aired {{a two-part}} {{documentary}} about flying rods in China. [...] It reported the events from May to June {{of the same}} year at Tonghua Zhenguo Pharmaceutical Company in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, which debunked the flying rods. Surveillance cameras in the facility's compound captured video footage of flying rods identical to those shown in Jose Escamilla's video. Getting no satisfactory answer to the phenomenon, curious scientists at the facility decided that they would try to solve the mystery by attempting to catch these airborne creatures. Huge nets were set up and the same surveillance cameras then captured images of rods flying into the trap. When the nets were inspected, the [...] "rods" [...] were no more than regular moths and other ordinary flying insects. Subsequent investigations proved that the appearance of flying rods on video was an optical illusion created by the slower <b>recording</b> <b>speed</b> of the camera.|$|E
