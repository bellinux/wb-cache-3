40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{details of}} CRC Mining’s work with waterjet assisted blasthole drilling. The {{objective of this}} work was to investigate techniques that reduce the cost and increase the productivity of blasthole drilling. The focus is on a technology that uses a high pressure waterjet to assist the conventional <b>rotary</b> rock <b>cutting</b> action of a tricone drill bit. The potential benefits of this technique are increased productivity, reduced drill bit wear and reduced hole deviation and hence improved quality of drilling. This paper describes {{the results of a}} laboratory based experimental program comparing conventional tri-cone drilling performance to the proposed waterjet assisted approach. Additionally, work has been completed looking at the more practical issues around the collection and sampling of drill cuttings and water recovery (recycling) when drilling with a waterjet. These studies have demonstrated that waterjet assisted drilling can significantly increase the rate of penetration over conventional rotary drilling. For the best-case experimental result, the relative improvement was over 40 per cent. More importantly, it is a starting point for examining alternative uses of the additional drill productivity obtained from waterjet assisted drilling. For example, increased drill productivity could be used to improve rock fragmentation by drilling a tighter blasthole pattern in the same time period. an existing drill fleet, then the drill fleet size could be reduced, or improved rock fragmentation could be achieved by drilling a tighter blasthole pattern within the same time period...|$|R

Piezoelectric actuators were integrated into an adapter to produce ultrasonic percussion; augmenting rotary drilling. The drill is capable of operating at low power, low applied force and, with proper tuning, low noise. These characteristics are of great interest for future NASA missions and the construction/remodeling industry. The developed augmenter connects a commercially available drill and bit and was tested to demonstrate its capability. Input power to the drill was read using a multimeter and the augmenter received a separate input voltage. The drive frequency of the piezoelectric actuator was controlled by a hill climb algorithm that optimizes and records average power usage to operate the drill at resonating frequency. Testing the rotary drill and augmenter {{across a range of}} combinations with total power constant at 160 Watts has shown results in concrete and limestone samples that are as good as or better than the commercial drill.

40|$|The chip {{formation}} process in machining {{is accompanied by}} heat generation. The heat generated influences both the workpiece physical properties {{as well as the}} cutting tool. High temperatures accelerate tool wear and thermal softening which are not desirable because they alter the accuracy of the machined surface and tool life. Many studies have been done to lower the heat generated in cutting. A first approach is to use a cutting fluid but its effectiveness is limited by its ability to penetrate between the tool and the chip. A second approach is to remove the heat generated through a cooling cycle as in interrupted cutting. The idea is either to translate a wide tool to the side as it moves forward relative to the workpiece, which allows the dissipation throughout the body of the tool or to use a cutting edge {{in the form of a}} disk that rotates about its principal axis. The latter, known as a rotary tool, provides a rest period for the cutting edge, thus enabling the edge to be cooled and a continuously fresh portion of the edge to be engaged with the workpiece. The rotary tool can be either driven by an external power source or self-propelled. This thesis focuses on the self-propelled rotary tool (SPRT) process for machining of difficult-to-machine material such as bearing steels, where tool life is of particular concern. Since the cutting temperatures are known to influence tool life significantly, the first task in this investigation involved developing a model to analyze heat transfer and temperature distribution in the cutting tool during SPRT turning of the hardened 52100 steel (58 HRC). Both rotary and equivalent fixed tool processes are compared in terms of cutting tool temperatures generated. The model is based on the moving heat source theory of conduction and employs the Finite Element Method (FEM) for its solution. The model is experimentally verified through measurement of the cutting temperature distribution using an Infra-Red imaging camera under different cutting conditions. Predicted and measured temperatures show good overall agreement when they are measured along the cutting edge and measured temperatures are up to 50 ??ower in <b>rotary</b> tool <b>cutting</b> than in fixed tool cutting under the same conditions.

50|$|Milling is {{a cutting}} process {{that uses a}} milling cutter to remove {{material}} {{from the surface of}} a workpiece. The milling cutter is a <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> tool, often with multiple cutting points. As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter. As the milling cutter enters the workpiece, the cutting edges (flutes or teeth) of the tool repeatedly cut into and exit from the material, shaving off chips (swarf) from the workpiece with each pass. The cutting action is shear deformation; material is pushed off the workpiece in tiny clumps that hang together {{to a greater or lesser}} extent (depending on the material) to form chips. This makes metal cutting somewhat different (in its mechanics) from slicing softer materials with a blade.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, as many Swiss lathes {{incorporate}} a secondary spindle, or 'sub-spindle', they also incorporate 'live tooling'. Live tools are <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> tools that are {{powered by a}} small motor independently of the spindle motor(s). Live tools increase the intricacy of components that can be manufactured by the Swiss lathe. For instance, automatically producing a part with a hole drilled perpendicular to the main axis (the axis of rotation of the spindles) is very economical with live tooling, and similarly uneconomical if done as a secondary operation after machining by the Swiss lathe is complete. A 'secondary operation' is a machining operation requiring a partially completed part to be secured in a second machine to complete the manufacturing process. Generally, advanced CAD/CAM software uses live tools {{in addition to the}} main spindles so that most parts that can be drawn by a CAD system can actually be manufactured by the machines that the CAD/CAM software support.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{analytical}} model that could be used by the designers of a <b>rotary</b> feeding and <b>cutting</b> system (RFCS) to identify the power demand of the RFCS with limited or no required field or laboratory data. Two separate RFCS were investigated, incorporated with either a low-speed cutting process (LSCP) or a high-speed cutting process (HSCP). The results from the laboratory and field trials were used to create and validate the analytical model. Laboratory tests were completed with the LSCP RFCS and these concluded that counter-knife sharpness, serrations and bevel angle all had significant effects on the specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS when processing cereal straw and alfalfa. The specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS, while processing cereal straw, increased by 0. 35 kW∙h/tonne (or 96 %) when the sharpness of the counter-knives decreased from 0. 13 to 0. 63 mm (where the sharpness was recorded by the leading-edge-width of the counter-knives). With the same decrease in sharpness, the specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS while processing alfalfa increased by 0. 04 kW∙h/tonne (or 32 %). The specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS while processing cereal straw with sharp counter-knives (counter-knives with a leading edge width of 0. 13 mm) increased by 0. 11 kW∙h/tonne (or 51 %) when serrated counter-knives were used instead of un-serrated counter-knives. However, counter-knife serrations did not have a significant effect on the specific energy demand of the LSCP RFCS when sharp counter-knives were used to process alfalfa. The increase in bevel angle from 15 to 90 ° caused the specific energy required to process cereal straw and alfalfa to approximately triple. The moisture content of alfalfa also had a significant effect on the specific energy required to process alfalfa with the LSCP RFCS. The specific energy demand of the LSCP RFCS was at a maximum when alfalfa at a moisture content of 53 % on a wet basis (w. b.) was processed and decreased slightly (approximately 0. 04 kW∙h/tonne or 10 %) when dryer and wetter alfalfa was processed. Field tests were completed with the HSCP RFCS and it was concluded that in general, there was a direct relationship between the specific energy required by the HSCP RFCS and the moisture content of the straw, counter-knife engagement and throughput. Further, it was also concluded that the specific energy requirements of the HSCP RFCS were more sensitive to counter-knife engagement when higher moisture content straw was processed. Depending on the type of chopper used, the specific energy required by the HSCP RFCS increased anywhere from 0. 15 to 0. 77 kW∙h/tonne (or 22 to 61 %) when the counter-knife engagement was increased from 0 to 100 % (or fully removed to fully engaged). Again, depending on the type of chopper used, when the moisture content of the straw processed by the chopper increased from approximately 7 to 25 % w. b. the specific energy required by the chopper increased by 0. 14 to 0. 96 kW∙h/tonne (or 28 to 84 %). The effect of throughput on the specific energy demand of the HSCP RFCS was dependent on the type of chopper used. For one of the choppers, an increase in throughput from 10. 5 to 13. 5 tonne/h caused the specific energy required by the HSCP RFCS to increase by 0. 24 kW∙h/tonne (or 35 %); however for a different chopper, an increase in throughput from 12 to 13 tonne/h caused the specific energy demand of the HSCP RFCS to decrease by 0. 16 kW∙h/tonne (or 19 %). The analytical model was validated using a subset of the data that were collected while employing each cutting device under field conditions and the data collected with the use of a custom-designed material properties test stand. The output of the analytical model fell within the 95 % confidence interval of the measured power demand for each of the <b>rotary</b> feeding and <b>cutting</b> systems, and the analytical model was therefore deemed sufficiently accurate. Based on the analytical model, the total power demand of both the LSCP and HSCP <b>rotary</b> feeding and <b>cutting</b> systems was largely attributed to the power required to transport plant material. Further, the power required to transport the plant material along the sides of the counter-knives was much greater than the power required to transport the plant material along the rotor bed and along the leading edge of the tines. Because of the excessive power required to transport plant material along the sides of the counter-knives, three techniques were identified as potential strategies to decrease the power demand of the RFCS. The first technique involved removing half of the tines from the RFCS, and modifying the remaining tines to decrease the amount of plant material that is entrapped between sides of the counter-knives and the tines. The second technique involved coating the inside surface of the tines with a baked Teflon, to decrease the coefficient of friction between the plant material and the RFCS. The third technique involved reshaping the counter-knives, to decrease the surface area over which plant material was transported along the side of the counter-knives. According to the analytical model, employing any of the three techniques would result in the total power demand of the RFCS to decrease by 15 to 26 %. For the HSCP RFCS, a stochastic model was developed to identify which of the four choppers tested during field trials would have the best performance when subjected to the same operating conditions. The chopper with the best performance was the WR chopper as its use resulted in the minimum geometric mean length of material exiting the combine harvester while also consuming the least amount of specific energy...|$|R
40|$|By {{changing}} from 3 -axis to 5 -axis machining, cutting efficiency and machining quality could be enhanced a lot. The two more <b>rotary</b> axes make <b>cutting</b> flexible and efficient, {{but they also}} bring some troubles for controlling. More and more complex machining environment and complicated freeform surface challenge users to define more accurate and appropriate tool paths and tool orientations. Traditionally, for the flat-end cutter, due to the intertwined dependence relationship between its axis and reference point, most 5 -axis tool-path generation methods take a decoupled two-stage strategy: first, the so-called cutter contact (CC) curves are placed on the part surface; then, for each CC curve, tool orientations are decided that will accommodate local and/or global constraints such as minimum local gouging and global interference avoidance. For the former stage, usually simplistic “offset” methods are adopted to determine the cutter contact curves, such as the iso-parametric or iso-plane methods; whereas for the latter, the common practice is to assign fixed tilt and yaw angle to the tool axis regardless the local curvature information and, {{in the case of}} considering global interference, the tool orientation is decided solely based on avoiding global collision but ignoring important local machining efficiency issues. This independence between the placement of CC curves and the determination of tool orientations, as well as the rigid way in which the tilt and yaw angles get assigned, incurs many undesired problems, such as the abrupt change of tool orientations, the reduced efficiency in machining, the reduced finishing surface quality, the unnecessary dynamic loading on the machine, etc. In our work, we present a system that aims at alleviating these problems and thus to improve the machining efficiency and accuracy. Iso-conic method and visibility map(VMap) are proposed to support the system. The former is to generate a series of tool paths on which the tool orientations have some special properties to guarantee large machining strip width and smooth changing in part coordinate system and machine coordinate system. And the later, VMap, is to collect all the information about the complex environments, including machining components and machining parts, to help to avoid global interference and guarantee the angular-velocity compliance. Delicate computation and manipulation of visibility maps and their derivative data ensure that the proposed algorithm is computationally feasible with acceptable computing time and memory requirement. Finally, test examples are given to simulate experiments of the proposed algorithm. Comparisons with a leading commercial CAM software toolbox are also provided that demonstrate the claimed advantages...|$|R

The simulated test consisted of 10 diamond instruments each making 90 passes through a float glass substrate. The testing apparatus comprised a computer-interfaced device that controlled the contact force between the cutting diamond and the substrate. Air rotor performance was based on the time required to cut a standardized path through the substrate. The performance change that occurred from diamond instrument to instrument during the simulated test was attributed to air rotor degradation. Multiple regression analyses showed significant differences between replicate samples of the same type and between regression intercepts for different air rotor types.

It is obvious that tools, cutting processesand cutting models has to be devel-oped parallel to materialsscience. In this thesis <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> tools are tested as analternative toexpensive diamond or cubic bore nitridetools. Metal matrix composites mostly consist of a light metalalloy (such as aluminium or titanium) reinforced with hard andabrasive ceramic parti-cles or fibres. On machining, thereinforcement results in {{a high rate of}} tool wear. This is themain problem for the machining of MMCs. Many factors affect thelife length of a tool, i. e. matrix alloy, type, size andfraction of the reinforcement, heat treatment, cuttingconditions and tool properties. In tests, the Al-SiC MMC formed a deformation layer duringmilling, probably affected by lack of cooling. The dominatingfactor for tool life was the cutting speed. Water jet or CO 2 cooling of turning did not provide dramatic increase in toollife. With PCD, cutting speeds up to 2000 m/min were usedwithout machining problems and BUE formation. Tool flank wearwas abrasive and crater wear created an "orange-peel type" wearsurface. PCD inserts did not show the typical increase in flankwear rate {{at the end of its}} lifetime. The use of self-propelled rotary tools seems to be apromising way to increase tool life. No BUE was formed on therotary tool at high cutting data. The measurements indicatethat the rotary tool creates twice as good surface as PCDtools. The longest tool life was gained with an inclinationangle of 10 degrees. Tool costs per component will beapproximately the same, but <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> tool allows higherfeeds and therefore a higher production rate and thus a lowerproduction cost. The <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> operation might have a potential toincrease productiv-ity in bar peeling. The lack of BUE withrotary cutting gives hope on higher tool life. The test resultsshow that tool wear was 27 % lower with <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> tools. Increase of cutting speed from 22 to 44 m/min did not affectcutting forces.

Existing industrial cutting theory is of limited help in understanding dental cutting in view {{of the differences between the}} control of relevant variables in the two cases. Consideration is given to the ways in which the important variables have (or have not) been controlled in past studies of dental cutting and thus the clinical relevance of available methods evaluated. Serious problems such as the lack of suitable test workpiece materials, as well as deficiencies in current knowledge of operator behaviour, handpiece characteristics and effects of coolant/lubricant application are noted. It is concluded that before improved, clinically relevant tests can be developed, further fundamental research in these areas is essential and that until this is done, further work under arbitrary experimental conditions would be of little value. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
