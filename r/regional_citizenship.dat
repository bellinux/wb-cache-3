40|$|Focusing our {{attention}} on the phenomena, places and rules that {{can be viewed as}} lying at the margins often reveals much of the functioning of core elements and systemic trends. The overseas territories of EU Member States, with their specific status and history and with the peculiar situation of their inhabitants, represent in this sense an intriguing illustration of the above. Indeed, they are the outermost extremities of Europe, from historical, geographical and juridical points of view. These regions are particularly revealing  of the mechanisms of restructuring of the main features ofmodern statehood – such as membership, territory and authority – as they are occurring in Europe today, fromthe national to the local level, fromthe continental scale to the global. This also implies the redefinition of the ties that link the former imperial territories to European nation states, as well as their integration, in some cases partial, to the j uridical, political and commercial order of the European Union. The situation of the Overseas is truly paradigmatic of these transformations, which is for two sets of reasons. First, Overseas territories are a privileged observatory of the interrelation between the different <b>citizenship</b> statuses – <b>regional,</b> 8 national and supranational – and the reshaping of modern territoriality. Second, Overseas citizenships, despite substantial differences fromone case to another, developed ‘at themargins’ of nationality. The impact of European integration on these regions has produced, on the one hand, a progressive homogeneization of the status of their citizens with respect to the homeland and, on the other hand, <b>regional</b> <b>citizenships</b> which have been acting  as a factor of differentiation within national citizenship. Therefore, it is possible to say that European citizenship has had an integrating impact on <b>regional</b> <b>citizenships</b> and that these have in turn also worked as elements of reverse discrimination.   This chapter aims to define and interpret the dialectic between citizenship, nationality and territoriality that is at play in the interaction between Overseas regions, Member States and EU law...|$|R

Ultimately, the new Constitution of Ukraine adopted neither extreme and reiterated the autonomous status of the republic, while downgrading some of its powers (such as the regional Supreme Council's powers to enact legislation in form of laws ("zakoni")).

40|$|This book {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of political discourse in governance processes. Our starting point is Searle’s key argument—that some rules do not just regulate, but also create {{the possibility of the}} very behavior that they regulate (2010). Specifically, this book demonstrates the process in which political discourses become normative mechanisms, first marking socially constructed realities in politics, second playing a role in delineating subsequent policy frames, and third influencing the public sphere. The book traces such discursive processes within a set of key policy contexts, such as European integration, <b>regional</b> development, <b>citizenship,</b> migration, health care, family, gender, and sexuality. It shows how ideas acquire roles in effect to politics and policy-making, and then reverberate in the public sphere. In this effort, our book draws upon frameworks from different empirical and theoretical fields such as policy research, social representations theory, party politics, and citizenship...|$|R
40|$|In the {{consolidation}} of the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), social policies {{are still in the}} embryonic stage. However, since {{the latter half of the}} 1990 s there has been a speedup in the creation of institutions dedicated to such policies with the Common Market's framework. This article focuses on health policy and the broader social policy system in order to identify the reasons for the imbalance, through three movements: reconstitution of the history of the institutional construction of social policies in MERCOSUR; identification and comparison of the successive strategies for the formulation and implementation of the social integration agenda; and reflection on the current dilemmas and challenges faced by the process. According to the study, MERCOSUR operates with strategies that are difficult to mutually reconcile. On the institutional level, it follows a minimalist strategy, while on the conceptual/ discursive level it adopts a maximalist strategy for supranational unification of social policies. The fact is that it operates a minimalist social policy strategy, since it fails to bring to the field of social integration the debate and proposals on economic and social development models that could sustain the effective construction of <b>regional</b> social <b>citizenship...</b>|$|R

In 60 - 70 -ies of XXth century, heritage was usually describing a historic monument, or archeological site; second-ly in the 80 -ies it started to discribe a monument with its surrounding, and in the 90 -es it described even a landscaped, called cultural landscape. Nowadays it also refers to intangilbe objects such as dances, songs, myths, etc. and even places of memory. The concept of heritage from conversation-al areas has moved to economy, tourism industry and it also should serve public relations.

40|$|Citizenship {{education}} {{has been the subject}} of growing attention in policy and academic circles over the past 20 years.

40|$|Discourses on autochthony, {{citizenship}} and exclusion have become popular in Cameroon {{as well as}} in other parts of Africa, and lately even in Europe. This article considers the case of the Mbororo (agro-pastoral Fulbe) in north-west Cameroon (also known as the Western Grassfields) and their recent claims to <b>regional</b> <b>citizenship</b> and minority status. The Mbororo are a minority in the region. They are perceived as strangers and migrants by local Grassfields groups who consider themselves their hosts and landlords. The Mbororo have long entertained host–guest and patron–client relations with their Grassfields neighbours. However, in the context of Cameroon's democratization and the constitutional changes of the 1990 s, they have changed their political strategies, aiming at direct representation to the state. In 1992 MBOSCUDA (the Mbororo Social and Cultural Development Association) was founded and gradually developed into a nationally influential ethnic elite association. While confirming the Mbororo as regional citizens, it successfully portrayed them as an ‘indigenous people’ both nationally and internationally. Moreover, many Mbororo of the younger generation have gradually developed emotional bonds with their home areas. Neighbouring groups have mixed feelings about these developments, as they may generate new conflicts...|$|E
30|$|As I {{have already}} {{explained}} above, {{in a world}} of independent states, free movement can be solidly built on the bedrock of citizens’ right to return. No matter whether free movement is based on dual <b>citizenship,</b> <b>regional</b> integration regimes or reciprocal agreements between distant countries, it is always granted to those who bear particular passports and is thus not a universal human right. Authors who support an ideal of global free movement, as I do, may find a strategy of expanding citizenship-based mobility rights disappointing, because it does not address the injustice of the global birthright lottery (Shachar, 2009) and promises only a slow path towards the ideal, with the speed of travel depending on progress of economic and democratic development in the global South. This raises the question of what ethical principles should guide the admission of unconnected migrants who are not yet citizens within a free movement regime.|$|R

40|$|The Øresund Region of Eastern Denmark and Southern Sweden is {{an ambitious}} {{cross-border}} integration project, aiming {{to make the}} region “The Human Capital of Scandinavia”. Integration has deepened to include cross-border social rights, with regional proponents heralding the emergence of “Øresund citizens”. Yet the two welfare states, despite their common attributes, have developed dissimilar attitudes towards {{the rise of a}} multicultural society in recent years, establishing divergent national citizenship policies in response. This thesis uses the Øresund region as a critical case study, which contributes to wider European debates about the tension between regional freedom of movement and national determination over citizenship. To explore this regional integration — national citizenship nexus, this thesis asks; to what extent do divergent national citizenship models inhibit deeper cross-border integration and prospects for <b>regional</b> <b>citizenship?</b> Drawing on a range of primary and secondary information sources, including interviews with regional political actors, this thesis reveals how divergent national citizenship policies rouse political debate about belonging and entitlement of foreigners in the cross-border region. Discordant national citizenship policies have reinforced organisation and conceptual borders along national lines, revealing that the cultural proximity of these Nordic neighbours is no guarantee of seamless cross-border movement and integration. This thesis demonstrates that citizenship policies not only have a domestic impact but can also become a point of tension between member states, with implications for regional integration and citizenship...|$|E
40|$|Departing {{from the}} ongoing {{regionalization}} processes in Europe {{and other parts}} of the world, this thesis aims to study the premises and conditions of <b>regional</b> <b>citizenship</b> in contemporary state restructuring. As globalization is viewed to challenge the sovereignty and capacity of nation states, subnational regions have gained authority and interest as key actors to compete on globalized markets of capital in order to ensure future development. This alteration in the balance between the regional and the national raises questions on how aspects of citizenship become negotiated in relation to regions as emphasized political communities. The study therefore develops and applies a productive analysis of <b>regional</b> <b>citizenship</b> based on citizenship theory and poststructuralist discourse theory. The attempts to reform the administrative region of Värmland, Sweden, between the years 2007 and 2011 functions as a case study in the dissertation.  In relation to this process a variety of materials has been collected in order to shed light on articulatory practices related to the reform: media material, public documents and assessment reports, observations of public dialog meetings and focus groups. Through a discourse analysis of the material the study focuses on the discursive production of regional communities and regional citizens in relation to regional reform. Three different but related articulations of the region emerge in the analysis: the region as a cultural landscape, as a welfare system and as a growth machine.   The study shows how the understanding of the region as a growth machine holds a hegemonic position in relation to the other articulations. The growth machine is based on a neoliberal notion of development, where competiveness and commodification function as premises to the intrinsic understanding of regional citizens – as well as welfare and culture - as capital that can, and should, be used to facilitate economic growth.         Runt om i världen byggs större och starkare regioner. Regioner betraktas som i delar en arvtagare till uppgifter som nationalstaterna inte längre anses kunna hantera i en globaliserad värld. Därför har regionerna fått större grad av självständighet från de nationella staterna, frisläppta för att på bästa sätt hitta sätt att locka till sig olika former av globalt rörligt kapital. Kapital som anses utgöra grunden för att kunna bygga ett gott samhälle.    I den här avhandlingen studeras samtida regionalisering ur ett medborgarskapsperspektiv. Vad innebär det för relationen mellan människor och gemenskap att regionen intar en framskjuten position i samhällsbyggandet? Vilka band knyts mellan regionen och regionmedborgaren i en tid som kännetecknas av globalisering och konkurrens? Hur fördelas rättigheter och skyldigheter mellan regionen och medborgarna, och vad innebär det att vara en god regionmedborgare? Genom en svensk fallstudie analyseras hur regionen och regionala medborgare görs meningsfulla i anslutning till att regionens framtid förhandlas. Materialet består av pressmaterial, utredningsmaterial, observerade offentliga möten samt fokusgrupper med regionmedborgare. Studien visar hur myten om regionen som en tillväxtmaskin intar en dominerande ställning och hur globala marknadslogiker fungerar som villkor för det regionala medborgarskapet. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is aimed {{to study the}} labor migration effects over the social and territorial regionness, after the political crisis and the war conflicts, a period between the years 1990 to 2005. Regionalism is understood {{as a process of}} the social-economic, political, and organizational cohesion of region building. The regionness provides an understanding about the states or phases of the regionalization within the trans-border region comprised by the geographic isthmus of Central America. This study unfolds in four dimensions: firstly, the relation between intra-regional migrations and the regional integration are studied. Secondly, it explores the formation of a regional labor supply-system produced by the articulation between intra-regional labor migration and other types of mobility -internal and extra-regional. A third dimension addresses to the territorial interdependency woven by the effects of migration. Finally, the last dimension looks at the territorial and social cohesiveness that rises as a new arena for a <b>regional</b> <b>citizenship.</b> As a result of the migratory interactions, three spatial realities are studied: (a) the rise of migrant workforce enclaves. (b) trans-border spaces and (c) the urban space, all three parts of a territorial division and fragmentation in both economic and labor enclaves. The variety of types of migration have been linked together through a flexible labor-supply system created for diversified labor markets -sectorally and territorially-, segmented by the economic competition, the regularization mechanisms and the cultural stigmas over immigrant labor jobs. These linkages are notorious according to a number of territorial interactions at different scales which produce spatial fragmentation, competition between localities and deterioration of the territorial cohesion. Despite of the centrality of migration, its existence poses a breaking point in the legal order and in other forms of social life regulation. It reveals new contradictions and conflicts in the sphere of citizenship as well. In addition to the limitations on the virtues of justice, equality and liberty, this rupture is expressed by the implementation of immigration policies, based on national security criteria, and setting distances from the international norms of protection for migrant people. This is the juridical expression of the fracture of the regionness: between democracy, (understood as a government mechanism) and the implemented system of rights...|$|E
30|$|We use {{a set of}} {{socioeconomic}} determinants as explanatory variables. We focus on age and gender aspects {{and the influence of}} children on labor supply. Additionally, we control for household income, education, state of health, German <b>citizenship,</b> <b>regional</b> unemployment rate, years, and federal states. We use five age groups (18  to 25  years as reference, 26 – 35, 36 – 45, 46 – 55, 56 – 65) to allow for nonlinear age effects. In regressions for the complete sample of men and women, we also include a dummy variable for being female. Another dummy variable accounts for the presence of {{children under the age of}} 16 in a household. The household income is used as the log of the adjusted monthly net household income. It includes labor and non-labor income of all household members. Hence, it is a proxy for non-labor income of non-employed individuals and wealth in general. In order to control for differences in education we include secondary school certificates as well as vocational and college degrees. The subjective state of health is measured in three categories: good, normal, and bad. The regressions further take into account German citizenship. In the regressions concerning satisfaction with leisure and work, we control additionally for overall life satisfaction in order to reduce potential omitted variable bias stemming from unobserved heterogeneity.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} thousands of Anglo-Americans who immigrated to Mexican Texas during the years following its independence from Spain. Long assumed to be the forbears of Manifest Destiny, it argues instead that these immigrants demonstrated a sincere desire to become Mexican citizens, that they were attracted to that country as much for its political promise as for its natural resources, and that they in fact shared more with their northern Mexican neighbors than with their compatriots in the northeastern United States. Drawing chiefly from the personal papers, diplomatic correspondence, and newspapers of Anglo settlers and their Mexican allies, this dissertation exposes a political irony {{at the heart of}} the United States’ imperial rise - that it had to do with that country’s early political weakness, rather than Mexico’s, and that the people most responsible for it were in fact trying to escape US dominion, not perpetuate it. It argues that Mexico offered a viable and attractive alternative to the US. Rather than seeing Mexico’s commitment to regional sovereignty and local autonomy as its chief failure, this project argues that it was precisely what attracted these immigrants to Mexico and formed the basis of their loyalty. Yet, if Mexico’s weak central government was its strength in the 1820 ’s, it would be the source of conflict and secession by the 1830 ’s and 1840 ’s. But Mexico was not unique in this regard. Indeed, this project recasts the US Civil War as part of a longer and more expansive experiment in extreme federalism by arguing that Texans seceded from Mexico for many of the same reasons that they and the rest of the South would ultimately secede from the United States. Thus, throughout the early part of the nineteenth century, the dominant geopolitical arrangement of the northwestern hemisphere was not primarily national. Rather, the southern United States and northern Mexico formed a semi-autonomous region united by its inhabitants’ shared commitment to <b>regional</b> sovereignty, martial <b>citizenship,</b> forced labor, and free trade; and one that presented the possibility of a geopolitical arrangement very different from that which ultimately emerged. ...|$|R
40|$|The International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) {{focused on}} {{the ways in which}} young people are {{prepared}} to undertake their roles as citizens. Preparing students for citizenship involves developing relevant knowledge and understanding as well as encouraging the formation of positive attitudes toward being a citizen. Descriptions of the conceptual background for and the design of ICCS appear in the publication detailing the ICCS assessment framework (Schulz, Fraillon, Ainley, Losito, 2 ̆ 6 Kerr, 2008). Regional contexts are important for civic and citizenship education because they shape how people undertake their roles as citizens. ICCS included, in addition to the core international survey, regional modules in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. This report from ICCS focuses on the six countries that participated in the study’s Latin American regional module. It is based on a regional student survey and an assessment of knowledge specific to the region as well as on data from the international student and school instruments. We recommend viewing this Latin American report {{within the context of the}} international reports on the findings from ICCS (Schulz, Ainley, Fraillon, Kerr 2 ̆ 6 Losito, 2010 a, 2010 b). The results reported in this publication are based on data gathered from random samples of almost 30, 000 students in their eighth year of schooling in more than 1, 000 schools from the six ICCS Latin American countries. The regional module for Latin America was connected to a broader initiative known as the Regional System for the Development and Evaluation of Citizenship Competencies (SREDECC), the aim of which is to establish a common <b>regional</b> framework for <b>citizenship</b> competencies, basic criteria for effective citizenship education, and a system for evaluating the outcomes of this area of education. The Latin American module of ICCS investigated variations in civic knowledge across the ICCS Latin American countries as well as region-specific aspects of civic knowledge. It generated information about students’ perceptions of public institutions, forms of government, corrupt practices, and obedience to the law. The data gathered also gave insight into students’ dispositions with respect to peaceful coexistence. This body of data included information on students’ attitudes toward their country and the Latin American region, sense of empathy, tolerance toward minorities, and attitudes toward use of violence. Data also allowed exploration of the contexts for learning about citizenship, namely, home, school, and community. The report also profiles the particular context for civic and citizenship education evident in each of the six countries. Common themes across all six ICCS Latin American countries in relation to the curricular agenda for citizenship included the following: violent conflict, democracy, general interest in sustainable development and the environment, issues related to globalization, tolerance, and plurality, and the social and political inclusion of large, formerly excluded segments of society. The countries deemed civic and citizenship education important. In three of the six countries, this area of education had been the focus of public debate. Most of the countries had seen a broadening of civic and citizenship education toward the inclusion of democratic values and participatory skills. However, the data also show that evaluation and assessment of civic and citizenship content were not common practice. The countries participating in this study were: Mexico, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Columbia, Paraguay and Chile...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{different}} {{expressions of}} regionalism(s) and regionalization processes in a Swedish and a westernized context. The case {{studies in the}} study conducted are represented by two different kinds of regions, Värmland and The Eight Million City. Värmland is a rather typical administrative and political bordered region at the subnational level in the Midwest of Sweden. The Eight Million City in turn exemplifies an imaginary cross border region, stretching from Oslo in the north, to Gothenburg, Malmö and Copenhagen in the south, connected in a network by a larger infrastructure corridor. It is also {{an example of how}} new planning practices stretching over already institutionalized national as well as local and regional borders, can be seen as challenging earlier planning and policy structures connected to the state. It is possible to see how different kinds of strategies related to strategic spatial planning practices are used to enhance the competitiveness of each region. In both cases this produce and reproduce different perceptions about what represents and constitute a competitive region. The empirical material analyzed in the study has been generated by interviews, participant observations, and document analysis based on discourse theory and discourse analysis. Different imaginaries are institutionalized in each region by different means and practices. In Värmland new perceptions about <b>regional</b> <b>citizenship,</b> regional identity and the idea of what constitutes a modern region are being institutionalized into the regional context by building a brand for the region. In The Eight Million City the project idea is based on an enlarged labor market connecting the larger cities in the region together in a network. As well as in Värmland, the knowledge produced in the project contributes to institutionalize different perceptions of citizenship and what makes up a competitive and attractive region. Den här avhandlingen tar sin utgångspunkt i olika uttryck av samtida regionaliseringsprocesser och regionalism(er). Studien belyser två olika regionaliseringskontexter i form av Värmland och Åttamiljonerstaden. Två i grund och botten mycket olika regioner. Värmland utgör en subnationell administrativ region och därigenom ett exempel och ett uttryck för en decentralisering av statliga uppgifter rörande regional utveckling och tillväxt till den regionala nivån. Åttamiljonerstaden är en imaginär gränsöverskridande region som sträcker sig från Oslo i norr, över Göteborg och Malmö till Köpehamn i söder, där målet är att skapa en sammanhängande och funktionell arbetsmarknadsregion. Trots de båda regionernas olikheter, så kan de båda studerade regionerna ses som ett uttryck för en alltmer normativ policyagenda som grundas på begrepp som globalisering, internationalisering och en konkurrensutsatt marknad. Detta har lett fram till olika former av rumslig strategisk planering som ska stärka respektive regions konkurrenskraft med olika medel. I sin tur leder detta till att olika diskursiva kunskapsrationaliteter om vad som utgör den ”attraktiva regionen” i form av nya styrningsformer, regional organisering och den gode regionmedborgaren implementeras och institutionaliseras i respektive regional kontext. ...|$|E
40|$|Background/Context: For centuries, {{the notions}} of {{citizenship}} and citizenship education {{have been associated with}} the nation-state and civic elements. However, since the late 20 th century, these traditional notions have been challenged by globalization. In the discourse of globalization, citizenship, and citizenship education, some scholars suggest a simplistic replacement or shift from national citizenship to global citizenship, <b>regional</b> <b>citizenship,</b> or local and group identities. Against these simplistic, single-leveled approaches is the argument for both the continuing importance of nation-specific characteristics of citizenship and the strong need to diversify the nation-state-oriented and civic-specific framework to form multileveled and multidimensional ones. They accommodate individuals' engagement in the various domains of human activities and their memberships at various levels, ranging from individual to community, heal, national, and international or global ones. Some scholars have advocated a multidimensional model of citizenship education by regrouping human relationships and activities into four major dimensions-personal, social, spatial, and temporal-which can intersect with various levels in the multilevel polity. However, these general, static frameworks are not backed by strong empirical evidence and do not explain the complexity of interplay among different actors at the same level and/or between levels. Purpose: The purpose of the article is twofold. First, it aims to provide empirical evidence for the general framework of multileveled and multidimensional citizenship education by assessing students'views of citizenship in a multileveled polity with reference to Hong Kong and Shanghai in China. Second, xrith the help of the comparative study, the article is intended to supplement the general framework by proposing a theoretical framework that explains the complex interplay of different actors in their choices of citizenship elements from a multileveled polity. Setting: The study took place in three public junior secondary schools in Shanghai and three aided secondary schools in Hong Kong and assessed their students' views of the global, national, local, and personal-social domains of multiple identities in a multileveled polity. Research Design: The study adopted a mixed methodology of observations, questionnaires, and interview surveys to collect data. Data Collection and Analysis: Data are drawn from questionnaires completed by 1, 402 students attending Grades 7 - 9, and 38 interviews with principals, teachers, and students from both societies between 2002 and 2003. Conclusions/Recommendations: The study shows that although students of Hong Kong and Shanghai were aware of having multiple citizenships, some of their views of the relative importance of, and the interrelationships among, four dimensions of citizenship differed. The patterns of their perceptions of multiple citizenships reflect similarities and differences in the organization of citizenship education between schools in Hong Kong and Shanghai, the nation-state's influences on local citizenship curricula, and local governments' development considerations in remaking collective identity. With the help of the comparative study, the article supplements the general framework by proposing a theoretical framework for interpreting citizenship and citizenship education as dynamic, context-bounded, and multi-leveled social constructions reinvented through the intertwined interactions of different actors in response to social changes, including globalization.

O objetivo central reside em identificar como se constitui a proteção ao trabalhador fronteiriço no campo da saúde nas cidades-gêmeas do Brasil com os Estados-membros do bloco. A metodologia utilizada no desenvolvimento do estudo foi a pesquisa documental nas legislações que aportam elementos sobre os temas sociais e sobre a configuração da proteção à saúde entre os Estados-membros, e nas informações contidas no Banco de Dados do COLSAT-Mercosul relacionadas às entrevistas semi-estruturadas {{realizadas}} com gestores municipais, profissionais de saúde e trabalhadores usuários dos sistemas públicos de saúde brasileiro e estrangeiro. A coleta das informações ocorreu em nove cidades-gêmeas do Brasil e oito cidades-gêmeas do lado estrangeiro das fronteiras. Examinou-se: 1) o perfil da demanda dos trabalhadores fronteiriços usuários dos sistemas públicos de saúde; 2) a rede de atendimento local de saúde; 3) as articulações entre as cidades-gêmeas visando o atendimento destes trabalhadores fronteiriços que buscam atendimento de saúde; e 4) a legislação bilateral estabelecida entre o Brasil e os países do Mercosul para as áreas das fronteiras. Entre os principais resultados, identificou-se a diferenciação, em termos do fluxo da população fronteiriça, em busca de atendimento de saúde entre as três fronteiras estudadas, com destaque para o fluxo interfronteira mais intenso entre o Brasil e o Paraguai. O atendimento em saúde dispensado aos trabalhadores fronteiriços nas cidades-gêmeas ocorre dentro da capacidade instalada de saúde e dentro dos limites territoriais das municipalidades. Os casos que exigem maior complexidade no atendimento são encaminhados aos serviços de média e alta complexidade em regiões referenciadas dos estados, departamentos ou províncias. No caso do sistema brasileiro, não foram mencionadas referências à estrutura específica de atendimento na área de saúde do trabalhador. Constatou-se também que a legislação bilateral, estabelecida por atos internacionais entre o Brasil e os países do Mercosul, não trata diretamente da saúde dos trabalhadores fronteiriços, mas de aspectos relacionados às políticas socais como educação, saúde, seguridade social, integração regional e questões de cidadania que influenciam sobremaneira na configuração do direito à saúde e do trabalho nas áreas das três fronteiras. This study condensates {{the discussions}} {{related to the}} health rights in the Brazilian border areas with the Mercosur countries (Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay). The main objective consists on identificating how the protection to the borderland worker is established {{in the field of}} health in the twin-cities of Brazil with the State-members of the bloc. The utilized methodology {{on the development of the}} study was documental research on the legislations that lead elements about the social themes and the protection configuration of health between the State-members, and on the information on the COLSAT-Mercosur Database related to the semi-structured interviews made with municipal managers, health care professionals and workers that utilize the Brazilian and foreign public health care systems. The information gathering occurred in nine Brazilian twin-cities and in eight twin-cities of the foreign side of the border. It was examined 1) the demand profile of the borderland users of the public health systems, 2) the local health care attention, 3) the articulations between twin-cities aiming the care attention of these borderland workers that seek the health care attention and 4) the bilateral legislation established between the Brazil and the Mercosur countries for the border areas. Among the main results, it has been identified the differentiation, in terms of the borderland population flow in search of health care attention among the three studied borders, with highlight for the more intensive inter-border flow between Brazil and Paraguay. The health care attention spared to the borderland workers on the twin-cities occurred within the installed capacity of health care and within the territorial limits of the cities. The cases that require more complexity on the health attention are forwarded to the medium and high complexity services on the referred regions of the states, departments or provinces. In the Brazilian system case, it was not mentioned references to the specific structure of attendance on the worker health care area. It was also established that the bilateral legislation, established for international acts between Brazil and Mercosur countries doesn’t directly handle the health care of the borderland workers, but the related aspects to the social politics, such as education, health care, social security, <b>regional</b> integration and <b>citizenship</b> questions that greatly influence the configuration of health rights and the work on the three border areas...|$|R
