40|$|This paper investigates whether {{disparity}} in team member quality impacts team production using NCAA 4 x 400 m <b>relay</b> <b>teams.</b> The net peer effects {{are estimated to}} have both an absolute and relative {{negative effect on the}} team performance. Because NCAA <b>relay</b> <b>teams</b> are comprised of unpaid amateurs, we utilize a direct measure of team-member quality rather than indirect measures such as wages. The evidence suggests that a greater {{disparity in}} team member quality reduces team performance, that is, it increases a <b>relay</b> <b>team’s</b> running time. This suggests that net negative peer effects exist and support the “team cohesiveness hypothesis ” for NCAA <b>relay</b> <b>teams...</b>|$|R

The U.S. women's medley <b>relay</b> <b>team</b> was fraught with last-minute drama, as several previously selected swimmers dropped out to focus on individual events, or were replaced because they had performed below expectations, only hours before the event final. In the event final, the U.S. medley <b>relay</b> <b>team</b> included women with no history of competing together, no relay exchange practice, and no coach; the East German favorites taunted the Americans before the race. Wayte would later characterize the race {{as one of her}} proudest moments. She also captured a bronze medal with the third-place U.S. women's 4×100-meter freestyle <b>relay</b> <b>team</b> that included Mitzi Kremer, Dara Torres and Laura Walker. Individually, she finished fourth in the women's 200-meter freestyle; she was also a medal contender in the women's 200-meter individual medley, but was disqualified when the judges ruled she used an illegal butterfly kick on the breaststroke leg of the medley.|$|E
