5|$|Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use {{of heavy}} sauces and leaned toward lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose {{function}} is {{to add to the}} flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal <b>recipes</b> <b>in</b> addition to recipes from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd-century-BCE {{tomb of the}} Lady Dai {{contained}} {{not only}} decayed remnants of actual food, such as rice, wheat, barley, two varieties of millet, and soybeans, but also a grave inventory with recipes on it. This included vegetable and meat stews cooked in pots, which had combinations such as beef and rice stew, dog meat and celery stew, and even deer, fish, and bamboo shoot stew. Seasonings mentioned in the recipes include sugar, honey, soy sauce, and salt. <b>Recipes</b> <b>in</b> the Han usually called for meat stuffed in cereals, cakes, and other wrappings.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the <b>recipes</b> <b>in</b> Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. The sandwich made with peanut butter and marshmallow fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed <b>recipes.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E
5|$|The book's author, Jayne Rockmill, is a {{literary}} agent based in New York City whose clients include Tony Caputo, François Halard, {{and the professional}} photographer and storm chaser, Jim Reed. Rockmill had also become involved in producing charity food and wine events, and is a longtime supporter of the New York City Food Bank and Share Our Strength, which focuses on ending childhood hunger. She conceived the book {{as a way to}} help raise money for their work, and a portion of the proceeds from I Love Bacon will be donated to the two charities. Rockmill began by asking chefs she knew personally to donate bacon recipes, and then contacted others across the United States. In some cases, she adapted the original <b>recipes</b> <b>in</b> collaboration with the chefs.|$|E
25|$|Another medieval {{emphasis}} foreshadowed in Marcellus is {{a concern}} for locating ingredients in their native environment, replacing the exotic flora and fauna prescribed in texts from antiquity with indigenous species. <b>Recipes</b> <b>in</b> both Marcellus and the medieval writers tend toward “polypharmacy,” {{or the use of}} a great number of ingredients in a single preparation. Many <b>recipes</b> <b>in</b> De medicamentis contain at least ten ingredients, and one, the antidotus Cosmiana (29.11), is compounded of 73.|$|E

25|$|Rice is {{the staple}} food of Korea. Having been an almost {{exclusively}} agricultural country until recently, the essential <b>recipes</b> <b>in</b> Korea {{are shaped by}} this experience.

25|$|As Carter's cooking became {{increasingly}} well-known and popular, she published her <b>recipes</b> <b>in</b> book form - initially, in 1918, {{as a collection}} of 400 recipes entitled The National Cookery Book.

All royalties from this book were donated by Carter to St Mark's Church School in Wellington.|$|E

If one takes the median of 17 of these 22 compositions for rockets (75% nitrates, 9.06% sulfur, and 15.94% charcoal), it is nearly identical to the modern reported ideal gunpowder recipe of 75% potassium nitrate, 10% sulfur, and 15% charcoal.|$|E

25|$|Basil is most {{commonly}} used fresh in <b>recipes.</b> <b>In</b> general, it is added at the last moment, as cooking quickly destroys the flavor. The fresh herb can be kept {{for a short time}} in plastic bags in the refrigerator, or for a longer period in the freezer, after being blanched quickly in boiling water. The dried herb also loses most of its flavor, and what little flavor remains tastes very different, with a weak coumarin flavor, like hay.|$|E

Iuzzini teamed with noted cookbook editor, cooking teacher, food stylist and James Beard Award winner Roy Finamore to produce a cookbook that pushes the limits well beyond traditional desserts, challenging experienced chefs {{while at the same time}} providing suggestions for alternative techniques for less experienced chefs. The cookbook met with rave editorial reviews from such famous chefs as Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Daniel Boulud, Wylie Dufresne, Francois Payard and Paula Deen.|$|E

Most of the Prices' cook books were kept in print throughout the 1970s. After being out of print for several decades, two of Mary and Vincent's books have been reprinted; A Treasury of Great <b>Recipes</b> (<b>in</b> August 2015 by Calla Editions) and Mary and Vincent Price's Come into the Kitchen Cook Book (in November 2016 by Calla Editions), both featuring new forewords by their daughter Victoria Price.

The first completed dish based on a historic recipe was Quaking Pudding, which {{is now on the}} menu at the Hinds Head. This was followed by Beef Royal and Chocolate Wine, which featured on the Fat Duck menu. The opening of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal presented him with far greater scope for historical cooking, and its menu is composed solely of dishes inspired by the recipes of the past. His 2013 book Historic Heston is a collection of historical recipes that have appeared on the menus of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, the Fat Duck and the Hinds Head.|$|E
