2500|$|Whittle {{had already}} studied {{the problem of}} turning the massive W.U. into a flyable design, with what he {{described}} as very optimisitic targets, to power a little aeroplane weighing 2,000 lb with a static thrust of 1,389 lb. With the new contract work started in earnest on the [...] "Whittle Supercharger Type W.1". It featured a <b>reverse-flow</b> design; [...] air from the compressor was fed rearwards into the combustion chambers, then back towards the front of the engine, then finally reversing again into the turbine. This design reduced the length of the engine, and the length of the drive shaft connecting the compressor and turbine, thus reducing weight.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1992 model year, the [...] LT1 {{engine was}} introduced, an {{increase}} of [...] over 1991's L98 engine. This engine featured <b>reverse-flow</b> cooling (the heads were cooled before the block), which allowed for a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1. A new distributor was also debuted. Called [...] "Optispark", the distributor was driven directly off {{the front of the}} camshaft and mounted in front of the timing cover, just above the crankshaft and harmonic balancer. Also new for 1992 was Acceleration Slip Regulation (ASR), a form of traction control which utilized the Corvette's brakes, spark retard, and throttle close-down to prevent excessive rear wheel spin and possible loss of control. The traction control device could be switched off if desired.|$|E

50|$|The {{reverse flow}} head was {{ideally suited to}} a {{production}} carbureted engine due to its low rpm performance and ease of manufacture. The design could be modified for high performance by porting (in particular siamese) and isolating the inlet manifold from the exhaust header. The configuration is also perfect for carbureted non-intercooled turbo-charging. However, the advent of fuel injection and electronic ignition has made most of the <b>reverse-flow</b> head's advantages redundant in a modern engine {{and as a result}} the design has lost its popularity. The <b>reverse-flow</b> head still enjoys immense popularity among enthusiasts including Leyland Mini, Chrysler Slant-6, Holden and Ford Inline 6 fans. In fact some Australian Ford enthusiasts consider the 250 2V <b>reverse-flow</b> head to be superior to the Honda designed cross-flow head that replaced it. The <b>reverse-flow</b> head is a great example of the progress of modern engineering and the influence of trends on engineering design.|$|E

50|$|The mid-sized six {{carries over}} the 1951 190SL's four-cylinder SOHC general design, with non-cross-flow (<b>reverse-flow)</b> ports all located {{on one side}} of the head casting.|$|E
50|$|When forced {{induction}} is used, large port flow is not {{as important}} as it is when an engine is naturally aspirated. This means that the generally inferior flow of a <b>reverse-flow</b> head is less of a disadvantage. In the early days of turbo charging a <b>reverse-flow</b> head allowed the compressor outlet of a turbocharger to blow directly into the inlet manifold with either a blow-through or draw-through carburettor and no intercooler. This allowed the use of shorter inlet plumbing which decreased turbo lag and lowered flow restriction. Modern turbocharged configurations utilizing intercoolers and fuel injection are more difficult to plumb up to a <b>reverse-flow</b> head and are ideally suited to a cross flow head where the turbo is on the exhaust side of the engine, the charge crosses through an intercooler in front of the engine and into the inlet manifold on the other side.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} now {{referred}} to as the pre-crossflow Kent, in <b>reverse-flow</b> cylinder head configuration with both the inlet and exhaust being {{on the same side of}} the head.|$|E

5000|$|... “Among {{the several}} {{techniques}} of FUSO, special {{attention has been}} devoted to the periodic alternation of feed introduction between the ends of the packed-bed catalytic reactor, denominated by <b>reverse-flow</b> operation (RFO), whose advantages were enumerated by Matros (1990).” ...|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the <b>reverse-flow</b> cylinder head is that both the entering inlet charge and the exiting exhaust gas cause a tendency to swirl {{in the same direction}} in the combustion chamber. In a crossflow head the inlet and exhaust gases promote swirl in opposite directions so that during overlap the swirl changes directions. The constant swirl during overlap which results in a <b>reverse-flow</b> cylinder head promotes better mixing and hence better scavenging of the end gas. The fact that the inlet charge must change direction before going out the exhaust makes it less likely that fresh mixture will make it out the exhaust before mixing during overlap. Overall this improves volumetric efficiency and reduces emissions.|$|E
5000|$|A {{crossflow}} {{cylinder head}} is a cylinder head that features the {{intake and exhaust}} ports on opposite sides. The gases can be thought to flow across the head. This {{is in contrast to}} <b>reverse-flow</b> cylinder head designs that have the ports on the same side.|$|E
5000|$|Like the LT1, it {{features}} sequential fuel injection, <b>reverse-flow</b> cooling, and an optical ignition pickup. Output is [...] and 245 lbft Nm. Due to its smaller displacement, it provides better fuel economy than the 5.7 L LT1, but at reduced horsepower & torque levels.|$|E
5000|$|The Power Jets W.2 was a British {{turbojet}} engine designed by Frank Whittle and Power Jets (Research and Development) Ltd. Like the earlier Power Jets W.1, the [...] "trombone" [...] configuration featured a simple double-sided centrifugal compressor, <b>reverse-flow</b> combustion chambers and an air-cooled axial-flow turbine section.|$|E
50|$|The <b>reverse-flow</b> single-annular {{combustor}} {{resembles the}} GE-Honda HF120 design. The two-stage single-crystal high pressure turbine {{will be the}} first in this class of engines to be fully cooled. The three-stage low-pressure turbine is contra-rotating. A FADEC integrated propulsion control system will govern both engine and propeller pitch as an entire system.|$|E
5000|$|In engine technology, a <b>reverse-flow</b> or non-crossflow {{cylinder}} head {{is one that}} locates the intake and exhaust ports {{on the same side}} of the engine. The gases can be thought to enter the {{cylinder head}} and then change direction in order to exit the head. This is in contrast to the crossflow cylinder head design.|$|E
50|$|In {{carbureted}} engines, poorly atomized fuel reduces {{efficiency and}} power at lower rpm (at higher rpm the large air speed keeps the mixture in suspension). The inlet manifold of a <b>reverse-flow</b> cylinder head may {{be connected to}} the exhaust by a heat riser to transfer further heat, improving low rpm response and emissions as a result.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hemispherical}} {{combustion chamber}} {{is a type}} of combustion chamber in a reciprocating internal combustion engine with a domed cylinder head. The hemispherical shape provides a number of advantages over a <b>reverse-flow</b> cylinder head but comes up short in others, particularly in carbureted engines. An engine featuring this type of hemispherical chamber is known as a hemi engine.|$|E
50|$|The IIG {{included}} the Astafan's characteristic variable-pitch fan, installed {{in front of}} an Astazou XVI core (comprising two axial compressor stages preceding a centrifugal compressor on a common shaft). The design also included an annular <b>reverse-flow</b> combustor and a three-stage turbine section. The resulting configuration yielded a bypass ratio of 8.8 and a pressure ratio of 9.1.|$|E
50|$|The Phoebus {{made its}} first flight in February 1949. An Avro Lincoln, RA643, was used, with the engine {{installed}} in the bomb bay. Two air inlet elbows were provided {{at the sides of}} the bomb bay, with the jet exhaust angled steeply downwards. As the Phoebus used the same <b>reverse-flow</b> layout as the first Proteus, inlets from the side were appropriate.|$|E
50|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Fiat SOHC engine its massively over-square proportions. This over-square design allows large (within the constrains of a <b>reverse-flow</b> configuration) valve sizes relative to engine capacity. A secondary benefit is the short crank throw reduces the accelerative forces on the con-rod allowing the engine to operate at significantly increased engine-speeds. The original engine's limit was only reached at 8000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{portable}} ceramic filters, {{such as the}} MSR Miniworks, which work via manual pumping, and in-line ceramic filters, which filters drinking water that comes through household plumbing. Cleaning these filters {{is the same as}} with the clay pot filter but also allows for <b>reverse-flow</b> cleaning, wherein clean water is forced through the filter backwards, pushing any contaminants out of the ceramic pores.|$|E
5000|$|The L99 {{featured}} updated Generation II block {{architecture and}} is visually {{identical to the}} larger 5.7 L LT1 Generation II V8. Like the LT1, it features sequential fuel injection, <b>reverse-flow</b> cooling, and an optical ignition pickup. Output is [...] and 245 lbft Nm. Due to its smaller displacement, the L99 provided higher EPA fuel economy ratings than the 5.7 L LT1. The L99 was produced for the 1994-1996 model years.|$|E
50|$|A {{handful of}} {{experimental}} locomotives from the 1930s and 1940s used gas turbines as prime movers. These turbines {{were based on}} stationary practice, with single large <b>reverse-flow</b> combustors, heat exchangers and using low-cost heavy oil bunker fuel. In the 1960s the idea re-emerged, using developments in light weight engines developed for helicopters and using lighter kerosene fuels. As these turbines were compact and lightweight, the vehicles were produced as railcars rather than separate locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Significant {{changes were}} also {{introduced}} in the third model. It had ten <b>reverse-flow</b> combustion chambers giving a similar configuration {{to that of the}} later Power Jets W.1 and Power Jets W.2 turbojet engines. This configuration was also adopted for the Rolls-Royce Welland and General Electric J31 jet engines. One advantage of using 10 combustion chambers, smaller by a factor of (1/sqrt10), was they could be more easily be tested on a combustion rig.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, GM {{created a}} new-generation small-block engine called the [...] "LT1 350", {{not to be}} {{confused}} with the high-output Generation I LT-1 of the 1970s. It displaced 350 cuin L, and was a 2-valve pushrod design. The LT1 used a <b>reverse-flow</b> cooling system which cooled the cylinder heads first, maintaining lower combustion chamber temperatures and allowing the engine to run at a higher compression than its immediate predecessors. This engine was used in: ...|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} I-16, GE also started {{work on an}} {{enlarged}} version, known as the I-40. As the name implied, the engine was designed to provide 4000 lbf kN. Apart from size, {{the main difference between}} I-16 and the I-40 was the combustion system: the I-16 had ten <b>reverse-flow</b> cans, whereas the I-40 had 14 straight-through combustors. The development cycle was remarkably rapid. Design work started in mid-1943 and the first prototype underwent static testing on January 13, 1944.|$|E
50|$|Of axial-flow {{design with}} 15-stage {{compressor}} and 7-stage turbine, it incorporated many modern features. These included a rigid compressor-turbine rotor assembly carried on {{front and rear}} bearings. There was a single annular combustion chamber, of <b>reverse-flow</b> configuration to shorten the engine, air cooling of the turbine discs and turbine blades with extended roots to reduce heat transfer to the disc. The annular air intake surrounded a reduction gear for propeller drive takeoff, and the exhaust duct was also annular.|$|E
50|$|The first Cosworth-designed {{cylinder}} head was for SCA series; {{with a single}} overhead camshaft (SOHC) <b>reverse-flow</b> configuration, similar to the Coventry Climax FWE engine. A real success was achieved with the next gear-driven double overhead camshaft (DOHC) four-valve FVA in 1966, when Cosworth, with a help from Chapman, convinced Ford to purchase {{the rights to the}} design, and sign a development contract - including an eight-cylinder version. This resulted in the DFV, which dominated Formula One for many years.|$|E
5000|$|... “Switching of flow {{direction}} was proposed {{a decade ago}} by Matros for the oxidation of SO2 (Matros, 1986). <b>Reverse-flow</b> reactors have been increasingly used in practice, especially in catalytic oxidation of the various compounds that produce too little heat to sustain autothermicity in a traditional stationary reactor, and also, in processes in which the efficient recovery of the heat of exothermal reactions is of crucial importance. The relevant literature is abundant; we shall mention here the fundamental monograph of Matros (1989), which provides both the description, and theoretical background {{of the concept of}} flow-reversal reactors.” ...|$|E
50|$|A {{significantly}} different design, which was symmetric, was adopted {{for the second}} model. Ten spiral ducts connected the compressor outlet to a single, large, <b>reverse-flow</b> combustion chamber, the outlet of which discharged forward through the turbine before turning rearwards to exhaust through ten jet pipes. Some heat exchange was expected from the exhaust pipes to the ten ducts delivering air to the combustion chamber as they were all enclosed by the outer casing. Testing began at the premises of the BTH's redundant Ladywood foundry at nearby Lutterworth in Leicestershire in March, 1938 and continued until the turbine was damaged on 6 May 1938.|$|E
