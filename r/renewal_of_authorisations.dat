The future Swedish defence will use multiple systems connected with high-speed networks for information sharing. Within this environment, the issue <b>of</b> administration <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> is crucial. SaabTech Systems and SICS have in collaboration developed a model and a prototype for decentralised administration <b>of</b> <b>authorisations.</b> The model is based on delegation <b>of</b> <b>authorisations</b> extended with a component to define constraints on delegations. This enables efficient decentralised administration that reflects the management structure of an organization in a natural way, {{at the same time}} as it maintains centralised control on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>authorisations.</b> All authorisations must fulfil constraints defined by their sources of authority. The source of authority may, for instance, define in advance how a certain authorisation can be distributed and used, in terms of whom and when it can be delegated. The model supports several schemes for revocation of authorization...|$|R

We identify two main {{issues related to}} the administration <b>of</b> <b>authorisations</b> in dynamic coalitions. The first issue concerns /decentralisation of administration/, and we show how an existing framework developed at SICS addresses this issue. The second issue concerns /decentralisation <b>of</b> enforcement/ <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> and we describe a new approach to address this issue by extending the current access control models with the notion of entitlement. The idea is that both authorisations and entitlements are specified in access contracts that coalition partners agree upon. These contracts can be used for automating access decision making by those controlling access to coalition resources...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Trust Management is an {{approach}} to construct and interpret the trust relationships among public-keys {{that are used to}} mediate security-critical actions. Cryptographic credentials are used to specify delegation <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> among public keys. Existing trust management schemes are operational in nature, defining security in terms of specific controls such as delegation chains, threshold schemes, and so forth. However, they tend not to consider whether a particular authorisation policy is well designed in the sense that a principle cannot somehow bypass the intent of a complex series <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> delegations via some unexpected circuitous route. In this paper we consider the problem <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> subterfuge, whereby, in a poorly designed system, delegation chains that are used by principals to prove authorisation may not actually reflect the original intention of all {{of the participants in the}} chain. A logic is proposed that provides a systematic way of determining whether a particular delegation scheme using particular authorisation is sufficiently robust to be able to withstand attempts at subterfuge. This logic provides a new characterisation of certificate reduction that, we argue, is more appropriate to open systems. ...|$|R
