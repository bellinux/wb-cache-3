The loss was merely a bump in the road, however, as Tennessee won all four <b>regular-season</b> <b>games</b> that followed, ending the regular season with a 650 drubbing of in-state rival Vanderbilt. In response to Fulmer's success at turning the team around from a slow start, he was awarded with a one-year contract extension by the university.|$|E

A loss to No.3 Miami followed, but a victory over Maryland in the game that followed gave Tech a 31 record, already better than its 1992 win total. After a close loss at No.14 West Virginia that was determined by a missed last-second field goal by Tech placekicker Ryan Williams, the Hokies won five of their last six <b>regular-season</b> <b>games.</b> These wins included victories over Big East opponent Syracuse and No.23 , Tech's traditional rival.

Veteran coach Fred Schaus retired, and Butch Van Breda Kolff took over; under his reign, the Lakers won 52 games in the 1967–68 NBA season in their first season in The Forum.

5|$|The 1998–99 season, {{which began}} on February 5, 1999, was {{shortened}} to 50 games per team, {{as opposed to}} the normal 82. As a result of the 204-day lockout, 464 <b>regular-season</b> <b>games</b> were lost. In addition to the lockout, the NBA's popularity was affected by the second retirement of Michael Jordan, who had been largely responsible for an increase in fan interest during his career. The average attendance during the shortened season was 16,738 fans per game, down 2.2percent from the 1997–98 average of 17,117 spectators per contest.

The second- and third-place teams faced in each other in a best-of-three series hosted by the second-place team. The winner of that series then faced the first-place team for a best-of-three series. South Australia hosted the New South Wales Patriots at Norwood Oval, Adelaide, while the Victoria Aces hosted the championship series at La Trobe University, Melbourne. In the finals, the home team and away team alternated during each of the series.

5|$|Following the Cincinnati loss, the Hokies had {{one week}} {{to prepare for}} a matchup against No. 17 Miami, the team {{predicted}} to win the Big East in preseason polls. The Hokies had not beaten Miami in 12 previous matchups, but they managed an upset 137 victory on September 23. At the time, the one-week turnaround from embarrassing defeat to unexpected triumph caused some commentators to declare the win the biggest in Virginia Tech football history. Following the Miami win, Virginia Tech started a winning streak that continued {{for the remainder of the}} regular season. In total, Tech won its final nine <b>regular-season</b> <b>games,</b> including two wins over ranked opponents: No. 20 Syracuse and at No. 13 Virginia. The 3629 defeat of Virginia was Tech's closest victory during the span and elevated Tech to No. 13 in the nation.|$|E
5|$|In 2002–03, Parker {{played in}} all 82 <b>regular-season</b> <b>games</b> as San Antonio's {{starting}} point guard {{on a team}} that was largely revamped from previous years.

Parker's role as the team's playmaker was reflected in his leading the team in assists on 49 occasions. During the 2003 NBA All-Star Weekend, Parker represented the Sophomores in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge, and also participated in the inaugural 989 Sports Skills Challenge. In the post season, the Spurs, led by Tim Duncan, defeated the New Jersey Nets 4–2 in the finals, and Parker earned his first NBA championship ring. Despite the victory, Parker struggled with inconsistent play throughout the playoffs, and was often substituted for the more experienced guards Steve Kerr and Speedy Claxton late in the games.|$|E
