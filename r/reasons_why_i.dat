500|$|As a show, Torchwood {{is highly}} intertextual. The {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} many sides of Jack are shown across various media. One commentator feels that this emphasises Jack's pivotal place in the development and change of modern science fiction heroes. The character's unexpected popularity with a multitude of audiences, would later shape his appearances both as a traditional [...] "action hero" [...] and as a positive role model for younger viewers. Barrowman also remarks that [...] "The beauty of Captain Jack, and one of the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> think, as an actor, I've landed on my feet, is that he's popular with one audience in Torchwood and with another in Doctor Who." ...|$|E

[...] Stuff.co.nz described the lyrics as [...] "happy ending" [...] and [...] "patch things up", when specifically singing the lines, [...] "I don't recall the <b>reasons</b> <b>why,</b> <b>I</b> must have meant them at the time, is this the sound of sweet surrender?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Survivor" [...] is writer James Schmerer's only {{credit in}} the Star Trek franchise, whose other genre work {{consisted}} of two episodes of the television series Wonder Woman {{as well as a}} single episode of Buck Rodgers. He was better known for his work on soap operas such as General Hospital and Another World. He pitched stories for [...] on the basis that the show targeted an adult audience similar to [...] and not children. He {{knew it was going to}} be broadcast on Saturday mornings, but would be unhampered by restrictions on live-action television. He later said [...] "that was one of the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> took it, because I'm not an animated writer... I had written a couple of animated shows through the years, and it was like pulling teeth." [...] He explained that he wrote the script for [...] "The Survivor" [...] as if it was a live-action story; it was originally known as [...] "The Chameleon". The title was eventually changed in order to preserve the plot point as a surprise for the viewer.|$|E
500|$|Hedren gave Spoto {{an account}} of the {{director}} as a sexual predator for his 1983 book, The Dark Side of a Genius (1983). Spoto wrote that Hitchcock made [...] "an overt sexual proposition that she could neither ignore nor answer casually." [...] Hedren alleged in Spoto's 2009 book, Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies, that Hitchcock actually asked her to [...] "make myself sexually available and accessible to him – however and whenever and wherever he wanted." [...] Spoto was the first person Hedren told her story to. She said: [...] "It was embarrassing and insulting—there were a lot of <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> didn’t want to tell the story. I didn’t want it to be taken advantage of, twisted, turned and made into an even uglier situation than it was. It wasn’t until years later that I told Donald the story. (...) He is absolutely true and honest in this book." [...] She previously said, in 1973, while Hitchcock was still alive, that a major life-style difference caused a split in their relationship. [...] "He was too possessive and too demanding. I cannot be possessed by anyone. But, then, that's my own hangup." ...|$|E

Bana {{had read}} the book Lone Survivor prior to production, and was willing {{to appear in the}} film, {{regardless}} of which role was offered to him. Upon being cast as Kristensen, Bana researched the fallen serviceman and his family. On joining the production of Lone Survivor, Bana stated, [...] "There are two factors that make this story special, and they are the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> jumped on board. One is the story itself, and two is who chooses to direct a project like this. I knew how involved [...] would be and that he would know how to portray SEAL teammates. That was what I {{wanted to be a part}} of. The greatest way to honor these guys is to make a great film and have it stand the test of time." [...] Bana did not physically prepare for the role. [...] "My responsibility was really to understand the role of the mission commander and the relevant information with respect with the chain of command and what it means to go in the QRF and the processes involved", he explained. [...] "It was far more important to be the person that was responsible for that part of the story and understand that completely.

In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one of the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> took 2001 off is I didn't even know what I {{was going to do}} with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't know if I was going to make my own record." [...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years."

I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore.
