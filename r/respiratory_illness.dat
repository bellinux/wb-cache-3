5|$|Braille {{had always}} been a sickly child, and his {{condition}} worsened in adulthood. A persistent <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness,</b> long believed to be tuberculosis, dogged him, and by the age of forty, he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher. Despite the lack of a cure at the time, Braille lived with the illness for 16 years. When his condition reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after he had reached the age of forty-three.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, {{eighteen}} {{years after the}} rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone was too weak with heart problems and <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness</b> to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton {{was president of the}} new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, {{historian}} Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland {{stated that}} newly unearthed records confirmed {{that one of}} the side stories of the war, the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, might have been the source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness</b> that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. However, a report published in 2016 in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers. In fact, it found evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to ozone {{has been shown}} to increase risk of death from <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness.</b> A study of 450,000 people living in United States cities saw a significant correlation between ozone levels and <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness</b> over the 18-year follow-up period. The study revealed that people living in cities with high ozone levels, such as Houston or Los Angeles, had an over 30% increased risk of dying from lung disease.|$|E

He died from an acute, serious <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness</b> in a London hospital.

40|$|Early {{recognition}} and rapid initiation of infection control precautions are currently {{the most important}} strategies for controlling {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS). No rapid diagnostic tests currently exist that can rule out SARS among patients with febrile <b>respiratory</b> <b>illnesses.</b> Clinical features alone cannot with certainty distinguish SARS from other <b>respiratory</b> <b>illnesses</b> rapidly enough to inform early management decisions. A balanced approach to screening that allows early recognition of SARS without unnecessary isolation of patients with other <b>respiratory</b> <b>illnesses</b> will require clinicians not only to look for suggestive clinical features but also to routinely seek epidemiologic clues suggestive of SARS coronavirus exposure. Key epidemiologic risk factors include 1) exposure to settings where SARS activity is suspected or documented, or 2) in the absence of such exposure, epidemiologic linkage to other persons with pneumonia (i. e., pneumonia clusters), or 3) exposure to healthcare settings. When combined with clinical findings, these epidemiologic features provide a possible strategic framework for early recognition of SARS...|$|R
