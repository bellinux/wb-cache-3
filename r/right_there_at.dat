30|$|Given the {{importance}} of foreign residency rights, {{we are interested in}} exploring which factors explain entrepreneurs’ possession of foreign residency rights. We introduce some potential explanatory variables in our regression. First, we include firm fundamental variables at IPO, including firm size, ROA, financial leverage and firm age to explore their association with entrepreneurs’ choices of obtaining foreign residency rights. We infer that entrepreneurs in firms that are larger, seasoned, and better performer {{are more likely to have}} foreign residency <b>rights.</b> <b>There</b> are <b>at</b> least two reasons to argue for that. The first one is that entrepreneurs in firms that are larger, seasoned, and better performer have a higher business risk and thus are more inclined to own foreign residency statuses. The second one is that because obtaining foreign residency statuses needs certain financial resources, entrepreneurs in firms that are larger, seasoned, and better performer are more capable to undertake it.|$|R
