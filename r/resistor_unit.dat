This is because the points system used this resistor to reduce the voltage to the coil to around 9 volts while the ignition switch is in the [...] "run" [...] position to prevent overheating the points. The points system has a [...] "bypass" [...] wire from the ignition switch or the starter solenoid to deliver full battery voltage to the coil during cranking. The HEI system needs the full battery voltage at all times to work its best. One common hookup method is to replace the ballast resistor or wire with a normal copper wire and attach both wires to the HEI's power input terminal. This ensures the HEI receives full power while running.|$|E

40|$|View an n-vertex, m-edge {{undirected graph}} as an {{electrical}} network with <b>unit</b> <b>resistors</b> as edges. We extend known relations between random walks and electrical networks {{by showing that}} resistance in this network is intimately connected with the lengths of random walks on the graph. For example, the commute time between two vertices s and t (the expected length of a random walk from s to t and back) is precisely characterized by the e ective resistance Rst between s and t: commute time = 2 mRst. As a corollary, the cover time (the expected length of a random walk visiting all vertices) {{is characterized by the}} maximum resistance R in the graph to within a factor of log n: mR cover time O(mR log n). For many graphs, the bounds on cover time obtained in this manner are better than those obtained from previous techniques such as the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. In particular, we improve known bounds on cover times for high-degree graphs and expanders, and give new proofs of known results for multidimensional meshes. Moreover, resistance seems to provide an intuitively appealing and tractable approach to these problems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} design of a tactile sensor patch to cover large areas of robots and {{machines}} that interact with human beings. Many devices have been proposed to meet such a demand. These realizations are mostly custom-built or developed in the lab. The sensor of this paper is implemented with commercial force sensors. This has the benefit of a more foreseeable response of the sensor if its behavior is understood as the aggregation of readings from all the individual force sensors in the array. A few reported large area tactile sensors are also based on commercial sensors. However, the one in this paper is the first of this kind based on the use of polymeric commercial force sensing <b>resistors</b> (FSR) as <b>unit</b> elements of the array or tactels, which results in a robust sensor. The paper discusses design issues related to some necessary modifications of the force sensor, its assembly in an array, and the signal conditioning. The patch has 16 × 9 force sensors mounted on a flexible printed circuit board with a spatial resolution of 18. 5 mm. The force range of a tactel is 6 N and its sensitivity is 0. 6 V/N. The array is read at a rate of 78 frames per second. Finally, two simple application examples are also carried out with the sensor mounted on the forearm of a rescue robot that communicates with the sensor through a CAN bus.

40|$|The work {{reported}} here {{has focused on}} the influence of substrate dissolution during the high temperature firing on the electrical properties of ruthenium dioxide-lead borosilicate thick film resistors. A resistor 25 (mu) m thick that is fired for 10 minutes at 840 (DEGREES) C will dissolve 4 (mu) m of the substrate surface. The presence of the alumina in the glass phase retards the growth of the resistor microstructure or chains of conducting particles by increasing the glass viscosity and slightly decreasing the solubility of RuO(, 2). These physical changes brought about measurable changes in the electrical properties. ^ Four glasses were made: a standard glass with 63 w/o PbO: 25 w/o B(, 2) O(, 3) : 12 w/o SiO(, 2); 4 w/o 614 AlSiMag substrate and 96 w/o standard glass; 6 w/o substrate and 94 w/o standard glass; 10 w/o substrate and 90 w/o standard glass. These glasses were powdered and mixed with 5 w/o RuO(, 2) powder then blended with screening agents. Four terminal resistors were fired onto 614 AlSiMag substrates under various conditions of time and temperature. The sheet resistance, hot (+ 125 (DEGREES) C) and cold (- 55 (DEGREES) C) temperature coefficients of resistance, normalized resistance versus temperature (- 55 to + 125 (DEGREES) C), and noise index were measured. As predicted, resistors with increasing amounts of substrate in the glass phase demonstrated slower development of electrical properties. It took about 14 minutes at 800 (DEGREES) C for a 10 w/o substrate resistor to reach its minimum sheet resistance compared to only 8 minutes for the standard glass resistor. ^ The hot and cold TCR 2 ̆ 7 s increased from large negative values (3 ̆c - 400 ppm/(DEGREES) C) for short firing times or low firing temperatures to near-zero values at longer firing times or higher firing temperatures. The noise index, in general, decreased with increasing firing time or temperature from about 40 dB down to 5 dB. With increasing weight percent substrate, the noise index increased. ^ A second group of experiments was performed to determine conduction mechanisms in thin films of the standard and 10 w/o substrate glasses. The glass was rf sputtered onto gold-coated, oxidized silicon wafers, then counter-electrodes of gold were evaporated on these films. Both ac and dc measurements were made. The parallel capacitance was a slowly decreasing function of frequency from 10 (2 ̆ 72) to 10 (2 ̆ 75) Hz. The conductivity increased linearly with frequency while the dissipation factor often showed a broad maximum implying the presence of an ionic impurity relaxation. The dielectric constants were found to be 11. 5 and 11. 2 for the standard and 10 w/o substrate glasses, respectively. The dielectric breakdown voltages were 2. 6 x 10 (2 ̆ 76) V/cm for the standard glass and 5. 5 x 10 (2 ̆ 76) V/cm for the 10 w/o substrate glass. The dc measurements indicate the conduction mechanism in the glass films is Schottky emission with an activation energy of approximately 0. 38 eV. ^ Using the normalized resistance versus temperature data for the thick film <b>resistors,</b> a <b>unit</b> model consisting of sintered particles of RuO(, 2) and non-sintered contacts with RuO(, 2) particles separated by a thin layer of the glass phase has been proposed. The temperature dependence of the theoretical unit has been derived and related to the experimental data by a curve-fitting process. ...|$|R
