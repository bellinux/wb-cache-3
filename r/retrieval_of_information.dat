25|$|According to Corner, Kinichi, and Keats, {{strategic}} {{decision making in}} organizations occurs at two levels: individual and aggregate. They developed a model of parallel {{strategic decision}} making. The model identifies two parallel processes that involve getting attention, encoding information, storage and <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> strategic choice, strategic outcome and feedback. The individual and organizational processes interact at each stage. For instance, competition-oriented objectives {{are based on the}} knowledge of competing firms, such as their market share.|$|E

25|$|More recent {{research}} has extended established findings of age related decline in executive functioning, by examining related cognitive processes that underlie healthy older adults’ sequential performance. Sequential performance refers to the execution of a series steps needed to complete a routine, such as the steps required to make {{a cup of coffee}} or drive a car. An important part of healthy aging involves older adults’ use of memory and inhibitory processes to carry out daily activities in a fixed order without forgetting the sequence of steps that were just completed while remembering {{the next step in the}} sequence. A recent study examined how young and older adults differ in the underlying representation of a sequence of tasks and their efficiency at retrieving the information needed to complete their routine. Findings from this study revealed that when older and young adults had to remember a sequence of 8 animal images arranged in a fixed order, both age groups spontaneously used the organizational strategy of chunking to facilitate <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> However, older adults were slower at accessing each chunk compared to younger adults, and were better able to benefit from the use of memory aids, such as verbal rehearsal to remember the order of the fixed sequence. Results from this study suggest that there are age differences in memory and inhibitory processes that affect people’s sequence of actions and the use of memory aids could facilitate the <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in older age.|$|E
25|$|An {{application}} layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions {{and access to}} databases. It requires less resources and often accompanies network layer attacks. An attack is disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets. The attack on the {{application layer}} can disrupt services such as the <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> or search function as well as web browser function, email services and photo applications. In order to be deemed a distributed denial of service attack, more than around 3–5 nodes on different networks should be used; using fewer than 3–5 nodes qualifies as a Denial-of-service attack and not a DDoS.|$|E
25|$|Considered to be {{a mental}} {{workspace}} enabling temporary storage and <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> working memory {{is crucial to}} problem-solving and analysis of different situations. Working memory capacity {{is a measure of}} the number of mental processing functions one is able to perform consecutively. Increases in one's working memory capacity can be accomplished with a strategy known as chunking. Aritake et al. conducted a finger sequence tapping experiment in which the subjects were shown coloured dots in sequence on a monitor corresponding to buttons on their keyboard. When a colour was shown the subject had to react by pressing the right colour on the keyboard. The subjects were separated into three groups. Group one continually trained with no periods of sleep. Group two was trained and retested over ten hours of wakefulness followed by eight hours of sleep and final testing. The third group was trained at ten pm, followed by an eight-hour sleep. This group was then tested the following morning and again later in the same day. Results displayed that wakefulness was an insignificant predictor of performance improvement, unless followed by a period of sleep. Groups that were allowed a post training sleep period, regardless of its time in reference to training, was beneficial to the improvement on the finger tapping sequences. The initial working memory capacity of the groups averaged three to four units. In groups two and three the working memory capacity was increased to an average of 5–6 units. It was proposed that sleep-dependent improvements may contribute to overall improvement in working memory capacity leading to improved fluid intelligence.|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to the <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> autobiographical memories is widely accepted. Results of former patient studies and functional imaging studies suggest different involvement of the MTL during the <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> autobiographical context <b>information</b> and the remoteness of these. Varying recency, the MTL contribution during chronological and locational autobiographical context information processing was investigated in this study. Thirteen males (mean = 25 years) judged the event’s place or time in a two-choice recognition task. Subjects made significantly more errors on chronological judgments. <b>Retrieval</b> <b>of</b> chronological <b>information</b> activated the left MTL, while <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> locational <b>information</b> activated the MTL bilaterally. <b>Retrieval</b> <b>of</b> more recent than remote context information activated especially the right MTL. Our results underline different MTL contributions on the <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> autobiographical context <b>information,</b> depending on the content and on the remoteness of the event that took place...|$|R

The current functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} study explored the hypothesis that the left posterior temporal gyrus supports the <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> lexical-syntactic <b>information,</b> whereas left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) contributes to syntactic unification. Twenty-eight subjects read sentences and word sequences containing word-category (noun [...] verb) ambiguous words at critical positions. Regions contributing to the syntactic unification process should show enhanced activation for sentences compared to words, and only within sentences display a larger signal for ambiguous than unambiguous conditions. The posterior LIFG showed exactly this predicted pattern, confirming our hypothesis that LIFG contributes to syntactic unification. The left posterior middle temporal gyrus was activated more for ambiguous than unambiguous conditions (main effect over both sentences and word sequences), as predicted for regions subserving the <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> lexical-syntactic <b>information</b> from memory. We conclude that understanding language involves the dynamic interplay between left inferior frontal and left posterior temporal regions...|$|R
