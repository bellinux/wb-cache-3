LCA model is developed by SimaPro software by considering Ecoindicator 99 method. Landfill, Incineration, Pyrolysis-Gasification and Anaerobic Digestion are analyzed by considering emission {{to the atmosphere}} per unit electricity generation. Results show that, Landfill and Incineration have the highest climate change impact among the four WTE options. Incineration and P-G has the significant impact on <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics</b> and acidification categories. AD has the lowest impacts on <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics</b> and acidification. AD and P-G have found as least environmental impact causing technology for waste-to-energy options. therefore, P-G and AD are more favorable waste-to-energy options for municipal solid waste management.

However there are concerns {{about the impact of}} biodiesel when its life cycle is considered. The potential impact of using biodiesel rather than conventional diesel was investigated using a life cycle assessment (LCA) of rapeseed biodiesel. Biodiesel leads to reduced fossil fuel use and is likely to reduce the impact of transport on climate change. However {{it was found that the}} impact of biodiesel towards other categories, i. e. land use and <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics,</b> was greater than petroleum diesel. Therefore biodiesel production should be carefully managed to mitigate its impact on the environment. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{life cycle}} impact is {{measured}} in four categories: human health, ecosystem quality, climate change and resource depletion. All four categories are {{used to evaluate the}} processes {{in order to get a}} good understanding of the life cycle impact of the nanoparticle production routes. The human health category takes into consideration effects from carcinogens, non-carcinogens, <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics,</b> ionizing radiation, ozone layer depletion and respiratory organics emitted as a result of the studied process. Ecosystem quality in turn takes into account aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, terrestrial acidification and nutrient enrichment and land occupation. The climate change category takes into consideration greenhouse gas emissions, while the resource depletion category the depletion of non-renewable minerals and fossil fuels.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the most {{dominating}} damage category is the resource category followed by the <b>respiratory</b> (<b>inorganic)</b> category. The damage in the acidification and eutrophication category is negligible (less than 1  % across different plant configurations). Moreover, the impact in the climate change category is also low due to which the effect of CCS is not so profound.|$|R
30|$|In the hierarchist perspective, {{resources}} and the <b>respiratory</b> (<b>inorganic)</b> category {{are the two most}} important damage categories, occupying between 74  % and 95  % of the total damage for various configurations. The total proportion of damage in the acidification category is more than that in the egalitarian perspective but still the lowest. Climate change also becomes a more important damage category accounting for more than 16  % damage in the base plant case and 25  % damage in the FGD + SCR configuration.|$|R

40|$|MSc (Eng), School of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of the WitwatersrandThis study utilises the Life Cycle Environmental Management tool, Life cycle Assessment (LCA) {{to compare}} the overall {{environmental}} impact of the life cycles of three manufactured emulsions. The emulsions - Aquapel, Hi-phase/composite (liquid/solid rosin) - fulfil a specific function as a sizing agent in the cardboard box industry {{within the confines of}} South Africa. As the origins and use of these emulsions are different, the impact assessments of each were evaluated. Using the Simapro Impact 2002 + assessment method, the mid-point impact categories show the most significant impacts in descending order to be Toxicity Impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Inorganics,</b> Climate Change and Non Renewable Energy resources. It would appear that toxicity impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, is the most significant impact. Emission of <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics</b> followed by effluent treatment, then electricity used in the emulsion process itself has the next highest contribution in all three processes. The higher contribution to <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics</b> by the process using liquid rosin is due to a relatively high contribution from the production of tall oil, a relatively energy intensive process. Climate change is the third most significant contribution. Non renewable energy resources for the Aquapel process shows the highest impact because of its raw material, wax. It is also based on a non-renewable energy resource, crude-oil, whilst the raw material for the Hi-phase/composite process, rosin, is bio-based. When comparing the three emulsion processes according to the Impact 2002 + damage or end point impact categories the relative contributions of the processes shows the relatively close performance of the three processes. The liquid rosin process shows slightly higher potential damages in three out of the four damage categories. The explanation for the differences between the systems follows from the explanations given for the mid-point impact categories. The sensitivity analysis for the Aquapel emulsion process shows negative impacts are produced in descending order for liquid effluent in the ecosystem and human health damage categories. For electricity and paraffin wax negative impacts in the human health and climate change damage categories. The best interventions to reduce life cycle damages is to reduce water and electricity consumption and if possible to find a substitute for paraffin wax. For the Hi-phase/composite liquid / solid rosin emulsion process shows negative impacts are produced in descending order for liquid effluent in the ecosystem and human health / climate change and resources damage categories respectively. The electricity and steam used in both the liquid / solid process produce negative impacts in the human health and climate change damage categories. The best interventions to reduce life cycle damages for the rosin emulsion process are to reduce water, electricity and steam consumption...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the results of}} a comprehensive life cycle study of the production of energy, in the form of biogas, using a small scale farm based cattle waste fed anaerobic digestion (AD) plant. The life cycle assessment (LCA) shows that in terms of environmental and energy impact the plant manufacture contributes very little to the whole life cycle impacts. The results show that compared with alternative energy supply the production and use of biogas is beneficial in terms of greenhouse gases and fossil fuel use. This is mainly due to the replacement of the alternative, kerosene, and from fertiliser production from the AD process. However, these benefits come at a cost to ecosystem health and the production of <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics.</b> These were found to be a result of ammonia emissions during the production phase of the biogas.

40|$|Petroleum {{products}} such as petrol and diesel are fossil fuels and have a high environmental impact. There is a demand to minimize these impacts especially in the upstream and midstream oil operations, i. e. exploration, production and refining processes, due to current and upcoming environmental regulations/policies and increased environmental consumer awareness. Thus, integration of the tools, methods and techniques for sustainability into products is becoming essential to comply with environmental regulations. The Libyan petroleum industry appears to be very slow in approaching modern concepts of approaches of sustainability including Life Cycle Assessment and studies. Therefore, this paper presents a novel environmental Life Cycle assessment of Libyan petroleum refining processes conducted {{with the support of}} Life Cycle Assessment methods and related tools including Software SimaPro. The refining processes from the Azzawya Oil refinery, are analyzed and used in the assessment and the data for the assessments was collected through fieldwork conducted in Feb 2013 in both El-Sharara oil field (Repsol Oil Company) and Azzawya Oil refinery in Libya.

40|$|In this study, an {{environmental}} impact assessment was conducted on three wood-based panel products namely particleboard, MDF and plywood. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine and assess the environmental impacts of wood-based panel products and to compare the environmental impacts between these panel products and between three different subsystem which are panel preparation, panel shaping and panel finishing, th e scope of this study covers the whole process of particleboard, MDF and plywood manufacturing from the raw material preparation until board finishing (gate-to-gate LCA). Input and output data were collected through survey questionnaire that was developed for easy understanding and distributed to industries. The results from SimaPro 7. 2 Software showed that the among three products i. e particleboard, MDF and plywood, the environmental impact on each of the ten categories is greatest for the particleboard followed by plywood and MDF. This could be explained by logs, resin and energy consumption in the particleboard production was higher compared to MDF and plywood. However, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed {{no significant difference between the}} three different products in terms of their effects on environmental impacts. For the most part, the highest impact categories for three wood-based panel products were being <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganic,</b> climate change and fossil fuel. Meanwhile, the results for different production subsystems indicated that board shaping subsystem was the highest contributor for all wood-based panel products.

Concern for its environmental impact was growing among regulators, classification societies, ship operators, ship owners, and other stakeholders. By applying life cycle assessment, this article aimed {{to assess the}} impact of a new-build hybrid system (i. e. an electric power system which incorporated lithium ion batteries, photovoltaic systems and cold-ironing) designed for Roll-on/Roll-off cargo ships. The study was carried out based on a bottom-up integrated system approach using the optimised operational profile and background information for manufacturing processes, mass breakdown and end of life management plans. Resources such as metallic and non-metallic materials and energy required for manufacture, operation, maintenance, dismantling and scrap handling were estimated. During operation, 1. 76 × 108 kg of marine diesel oil was burned, releasing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide which ranged 5 – 8 orders of magnitude. The operation of diesel gensets was the primary cause of impact categories that were relevant to particulate matter or <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganic</b> health issues, photochemical ozone creation, eutrophication, acidification, global warming and human toxicity. Disposing metallic scrap was accountable for the most significant impact category, ecotoxicity potential. The environmental benefits of the hybrid power system in most impact categories were verified in comparison with a conventional power system onboard cargo ships. The estimated results for individual impact categories were verified using scenario analysis. The study concluded that the life cycle of a new-build hybrid power system would result in significant impact on the environment, human beings and natural reserves, and therefore proper management of such a system was imperative...|$|R

40|$|The energy fuels {{used for}} in the Greek {{transport}} sector {{are made up of}} gasoline consumed by automobiles, diesel oil consumed by taxis, trucks, maritime transport and railroads, and jet fuel used in the aircrafts. All these fuels are hydrocarbons that emit great amounts of CO 2 which has a major impact in the global warming phenomenon. The issues relating to climate change, the soaring energy prices, and the uncertainty of future oil supplies, have created a strong interest in alternative transportation fuels. During the past decade biofuels in the form of blended gasoline and biodiesel have begun to find place in energy economy. The Greek car market shows a remarkably low rate in the penetration of biodiesel compared to the average European Union market. This work compares the environmental impacts of the use of gasoline, diesel and biodiesel in Greece using as a tool for the comparison the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The environmental impacts taken into consideration include: organic <b>respiratory</b> effects, <b>inorganic</b> <b>respiratory</b> effects, fossil fuels, acidification - eutrophication, greenhouse effect, ecotoxicity and carginogenic effects. From the environmental point of view, biodiesel appears attractive since its use results in significant reductions of GHG emissions in comparison to gasoline and diesel. It also has lower well-to-wheel emissions of methane. However, the use of biodiesel as transportation fuel increases emissions of PM 10, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx) as well as nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous; the latter are the main agents for eutrophication. This study can be considered as an opportunity for further research and evaluate the available options for a sustainable transportation system planning in Greece. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The world {{climate change}} is a {{phenomenon}} that is widely discussed in recent times. It causes a huge impact to {{the population of the}} world. Global warming causes the world's rainfall pattern to change including Malaysia. Today wet and dry season is very hard to be accurately predicted. Rainy season is getting more frequent and causing destruction to properties and halting economic growth of a nation. Evidence shows that climate change and global warming is caused by human's own lifestyle and activities. Man's savage way is the main caused for global climate change. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool {{that could be used to}} assess a product or service from cradle-to-grave. This tool is capable of proving that every human invention has weaknesses and is threatening human life. In water treatment process, chemicals and electricity is needed. A sudden increase in water level in river caused by heavy rain resulted in higher usage of chemicals to treat water. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) which uses ecoindicator 99 evaluation method to assess the chemicals and electricity, shows that the production of Polyaluminium chloride (PAC) causes damage to human health (<b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganic)</b> while electricity generation is fast depleting the natural resource of fossil fuel such as natural gas. These situation show that the irregular rate of rainfall resulted from the world's climate change not only affect human (eg. Inorganic respitory) but also indirectly causing destruction to the environment (depletion of natural gas) during the treatment of water. To overcome this problem the use of PAC as coagulant can be substituted with Alum. From the impact analysis, it is found that by replacing PAC with Alum, damage is reduced to more than 90 in damage to human health and ecosystem quality. This the same if electricity generation using natural gas is replaced with the combination of natural gas and renewable energy technologies such as solar panels and hydroelectric. Impact analysis also shows that there is 50 reduction in damage to resources when 50 natural gas and 50 renewable energy (solar panel and hydroelectric) without affecting human health and the environment.

The scenario in Malaysia shows {{that the number of}} rivers in class I and II categories which is of high quality is falling fast but those in class IV and V categories are rising. This development is expected to be in line with the rapid progress experienced by this country along with the lack of awareness of the community in the efforts of preservation and conservation of the environment. The goal {{of this study is to}} see the extent of environmental impact form the water treatment processes which uses chemicals and electricity in varying quantum due to varying quality of the source water resulted from anthropogenic activities. To get the depiction of the damages, LCA method is used. Three different river classes is chosen, namely class I, class II and class III, as classified by Department of Environment, Malaysia. This study uses the ISO standards and Ecoindicator 99. In Ecoindicator 99, environmental damages are categorized into 3 types, namely, damage to Human Health, Ecosystem Quality and resources. This study is a streamlined LCA where only foreground data is needed namely the quantity of chemicals used during water treatment and electricity consumption. While the background data for the chemicals and electricity is acquired from Simapro and Jemai-LCA Pro software databases. LCI methodology was used for quantification of the impacts of portable water production at the different river classes. The data inventory is then classified and characterized with Ecoindicator 99 to identify the weaknesses of the system. Treatment of class III rivers contribute higher impact to the environment followed by class II rivers and the lowest impact is from class I river. The use of high quantity of chlorine was identified as the contributor to environmental impact.

On {{the basis of the}} data collected, assumptions made, and system boundary defined, results show that sub-processes of LFE that provide most burdens on human health and ecosystem quality are biological reactions at landfill cells and sludge collection and treatment system, respectively. Meanwhile, stack discharge system in the AIF has highest impact on human health and ecosystem quality. Overall, the LFE performs more poorly than the AIF in view of human health but vice versa for ecosystem quality. The comparison of the LFE and AIF, with and without energy recovery systems, indicates quantitatively that the energy recovery systems provide benefits in regard to climate change, <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics</b> and acidification/eutrophication. Energy recovery in the waste sector could be enhanced through technological improvement and economic incentives. The environmental performances by applying Hong Kong's target emission levels for the stack discharge system in the AIF are also more favorable with respect to human health and ecosystem quality than those of Mainland China's and U.

This research evaluates and compares the environmental impacts of crushing and grinding processes, based on electricity consumption. About 50 to 65 % of total electricity in milling was used for crushing and grinding processes. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was used as a tool to evaluate the environmental burdens of electricity usage in converting ore and electronic waste to gold bars. The Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) of this process was interpreted by using Eco-indicator 99 assessment methods in SimaPro software. The impact categories included in this study were carcinogens, respiratory organics, <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics,</b> radiation, climate change, ozone layer, ecotoxicity, acidification or eutrophication, land use and minerals. The results showed that crushing and grinding from traditional mining gave the largest impact to the environment with single score of 399 Pt compared to the urban mining with only 1. 81 Pt score. The highest impact in both types of mining is to human health...|$|E
40|$|An Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) {{provides}} information on a product's environmental performance along its life cycle. This paper aims {{to contribute to the}} development of Product Category Rules (PCR) specific for ceramic bricks in order to support the establishment of a “cradle to grave” EPD. The methodology for developing the PCR takes into account ISO 14025, ISO 21930 and EN 15804, and the environmental profile is based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. In this context, some core issues like product category definition, impact categories, indicators, cut-off criteria and allocation criteria are addressed. The selected impact categories for this study were: global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidation, acidification, eutrophication, depletion of abiotic resources and <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics.</b> Indicators of energy and water consumption were also considered, as well as particle emissions to air. The results obtained from an LCA study on ceramic bricks produced in Portugal, to support the development of the PCR, show that the use of different fuels in the brick manufacturing stage has a significant effect in some impact categories. The use of petroleum coke generates higher impacts than natural gas or biomass. In general, the major environmental impacts occur in the brick manufacturing stage, mainly due to fuel usage in the firing operation. Particle emissions to air should be considered as an additional parameter in the EPD, being especially important when solid fuels are used. A sensitivity analysis of the cut-off criteria options was also conducted, which concluded that a 0. 5 % decrease in mass proved to be adequate for adoption, with a significant reduction in the effort required for data collection...|$|E
40|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} Many recent studies on waste {{management}} have {{described in detail}} the potential impacts of recycling and final treatment of municipal waste. In public debates the attention has also {{been focused on the}} choice of final disposal technologies (e. g., landfilling vs. incineration). However, a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of waste collection and transport was still lacking. In the present study we use LCA to evaluate the potential impact of the provincial waste management plan of Varese (northern Italy). A particular attention is devoted to the estimation of environmental impacts generated during waste transport. Materials and methods A detailed Life Cycle Inventory was built for the transportation phase, based on primary data collected by interviewing the agencies involved in waste collection. To model the recycling and final disposal phase we relied on the BUWAL 250 database. Impacts were evaluated with the Eco-Indicator 99 method in its egalitarian formulation. Results The results of our analysis reveal that the major potential impacts of the plan are associated with waste collection and transport. These impacts are partially compensated by reduced resource consumption through recycling and energy recovery through incineration. Discussion The outputs of the LCIA were compared with those obtained by using other ecoindicators (Eco-Indicator 99 hierarchist and individualist, CML 2, EPS 2000). Although not comparable on a quantitative basis, they are qualitatively consistent. Conclusions Neglecting the effects of collection and transport might result in a severe underestimation of the environmental impacts of a waste management system, especially as refers to depletion of fossil fuels, emission of <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics</b> and climate change. To reduce the environmental impact of waste management systems an accurate optimisation of waste transport is required. Recommendations and perspectives Effective waste management planning requires the explicit inclusion of waste collection and transport when comparing alternative management policies.

40|$|Purpose Ceramic tiles play a {{strategic}} {{role in the}} Italian market; currently, the Italian production is of 367. 2 million m 2 (Confindustria Ceramica 2012). In 2009, Italy was positioned as the world’s fourth largest producer of ceramic tiles, producing 368 million m 2 of the world’s total production of 1, 735 million m 2 Giacomini (Ceram World Rev 88 : 52 – 68, 2010). Therefore, there is an ongoing effort to create innovations in the products offered and their manufacturing processes, {{in order to better}} compete on the market and to create eco-friendly products. Recently, the Italian Ceramic District has increased its focus on environmental issues with the aim of protecting natural resources and reducing the energy and material consumption. For this reason, a new product was born in the Italian Ceramic District, namely, a large thin ceramic tile (dimensions 1, 000 mm[*]×[*] 3, 000 mm[*]×[*] 3. 5 mm) reinforced with a fibreglass backing, which gives the product excellent resistance and flexibility properties. The aim was to manufacture a new product with lower environmental impact than the traditional one. The production of a large thin ceramic tile requires, in fact, a lower quantity of materials, transports and energy consumptions comparing to the same metres square of traditional ceramic tile. At the present, no comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have been performed between traditional and innovative ceramic stoneware tiles. This study analyses, for the first time, a life cycle of the innovative ceramic product (porcelain stoneware) developed by a company of the Italian Ceramic District. Methods The analysis is performed using the LCA methodology, in order to identify environmental impacts, energy consumption and CO 2 equivalent emissions that occur during extraction of raw materials, transportation, production, material handling, distribution and end-of-life stages within a cradle to grave perspective. Results and conclusions LCA analysis indicates that the highest environmental impact mainly affects the <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics</b> impact category due to base slip production (27. 62...|$|E
40|$|China {{has built}} the world’s longest network of High Speed Rail (HSR) systems {{in less than}} 5 years. However, {{there are very few}} studies on the life cycle impact of China’s HSR systems {{compared}} to studies around the world. Environmental impacts of China’s HSR could be very significant due to dependence on dirty coal-fired power and material and energy intensive bridges. Thus, a life cycle assessment of China’s HSR systems is necessary. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to investigate environmental impacts of China’s HSR system between Beijing and Shanghai, assessing life cycle stages including: (1) vehicle manufacture, maintenance, and disposal; (2) infrastructure construction; (3) operation. Data from Chinese Ministry of Railway, Ecoinvent database, and Chinese Core Life Cycle Database (CLCD), are compiled to build the HSR’s life cycle inventory. LCA software eBalance is used to conduct the analysis. Additional scenarios are developed by varying infrastructure composition, electricity mix, HSR development, travel length of cross-line vehicles, vehicle utilization, occupancy rate, and use of fly ash in concrete, in order to help identify major drivers of environmental impact and propose recommendations for improvement. It is discovered that operation stage contributes to 72 - 91 % of the impacts in Acidification Potential (AP), Primary Energy Demand (PED), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Global Warming Potential (GWP), and <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Inorganics</b> (RI). Vehicle stage contributes to 43 % of impact in Chinese Abiotic Depletion Potential (CADP). Infrastructure construction accounts for 54 % of impact in Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and 38 % of impact in CADP. Scenario analysis identified several key drivers of impact, including proportion of bridge, tunnel, and reinforced subgrade, electricity mix, various factors that lead to different demands of HSR vehicle and transportation, and fly ash use in concrete. Several suggestions are proposed to improve life cycle environmental performance of HSR projects. It is also discovered that China’s HSR systems have higher impact in RI than Germany’s HSR and conventional rail systems, and lower impact in RI than Switzerland’s road and air systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{consequences}} {{of climate change}} and lack of sustainability of current energy models are debated at international level. The scientific community, to support the development of sustainable policies in this area, has for years invested {{in the development of}} so-called renewable energy sources and in assessing the impacts that this technologies generate along their lifecycle. In literature there are several studies on the application of these technologies based on the life cycle approach. However, research published to date are limited to submit only two indicators of environmental impact of these technologies: Carbon Footprint and the Energy Payback Time. Therefore a complete environmental assessment of these technologies is missing. This study, conducted in 2010, presents the results of a life cycle assessment of a mono-crystalline silicon solar panel of 1 kWp. The objective of this research was to conduct a complete environmental impacts assessment according to the standards ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 in order to verify the existence of any other significant impact categories beyond those already considered in literature. The study takes into account all the stages of the life cycle of the solar panel except from the transport from place of production to the installation site and end of life treatment. The results of the impact assessment are presented in different categories of assessment; the methods considered are the Eco-Indicator 99, the Cumulative Energy Demand and the IPCC 2007. The greater part of the data relative to the product were primary data; they were supplied by a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels of the northern Italy. The application of these methods of evaluation showed that there are other significant categories of impact (<b>Respiratory</b> <b>Inorganics)</b> than those commonly considered in literature. The results demonstrate that, to support the choices and decisions in the field of renewable energy, is not sufficient to limit the impact assessment to individual indicators but it is necessary to extend the evaluation to other impact categories and to conduct a full life cycle assessmen...|$|E
40|$|Within the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Handbook, 14 {{methods were}} {{recommended}} for impact assessment in LCA. The Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) builds on these recommendations. The ILCD analysis, evaluation and selection of recommended methods refers to methods available by 2008. Several impact categories {{have experienced a}} significant development and {{should be subject to}} updates in ILCD. Thus, there is the clear need for an update of the recommendations both from a harmonisation perspectives as well as for scientific credibility. In the context of the PEF, the EC-JRC {{is in the process of}} updating ILCD recommendations, focusing mainly on 4 impact categories, namely: water depletion (WD), resource depletion (RD), land use (LU) and <b>respiratory</b> <b>inorganics</b> (RI). In order to support an update of the ILCD and PEF recommendations a three-step evaluation procedure has been put in place: i) qualitative screening for newly developed methods, ii) benchmark among the available methods; iii) applicability analysis wit reference to life-cycle inventory data and elementary flows. This approach will ensure identifying not only the (theoretically/scientifically) best LCIA method but also whether there any significant gaps in LCI data availability to feed the LCIA models or issues regarding unexpected results and anomalies that need further attention. The limits of the LCIA methods related to day-to-day applicability will be carefully evaluated and some results of the screening are provided. As regards the LU, it seems reasonable to expand the LCIA method, at least at mid-point level, accounting more than one impact category, considering the multi-functionality of land. The selection of method(s) was also based on the availability of scientific literature and case-studies, and in order to facilitate the applicability with the currently available datasets containing inventory data on LU. Concerning WU, special attention is given to aspects such as consumptive use only vs. overall withdrawals, spatial differentiation, temporal scale environmental water requirements, as well as the applicability of the methods to currently available datasets. In case of RD, the three-step evaluation procedure is preceded by a careful consideration of what should be assessed in terms of impact on the Area of Protection Natural Resources (AoP), given the poor substantiation of this AoP in the LCA community so far.

40|$|Purpose Achieving {{sustainability}} by rethinking products, {{services and}} strategies {{is an enormous}} challenge currently laid upon the economic sector, in which materials selection plays a critical role. In this context, the present work describes an environmental and economic life cycle analysis of a structural product, comparing two possible material alternatives. The product chosen is a storage tank, presently manufactured in stainless steel (SST) or in a glass fibre reinforced polymer composite (CST). The overall goal {{of the study is}} to identify environmental and economic strong and weak points related to the life cycle of the two material alternatives. The consequential win-win or trade-off situations will be identified via a Life Cycle Assessment/Life Cycle Costing (LCA/LCC) integrated model. Methods The LCA/LCC integrated model used consists in applying the LCA methodology to the product system, incorporating, in parallel, its results into the LCC study, namely those of the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) and the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). Results In both the SST and CST systems the most significant life cycle phase is the raw materials production, in which the most significant environmental burdens correspond to the Fossil fuels and <b>Respiratory</b> <b>inorganics</b> categories. The LCA/LCC integrated analysis shows that the CST has globally a preferable environmental and economic profile, as its impacts are lower than those of the SST in all life cycle stages. Both the internal and external costs are lower, the former resulting mainly from the composite material being significantly less expensive than stainless steel. This therefore represents a full win-win situation. As a consequence, the study clearly indicates that using a thermoset composite material to manufacture storage tanks is environmentally and economically desirable. However, it was also evident that the environmental performance of the CST could be improved by altering its End-of-Life stage. Conclusions The results of the present work provide enlightening insights into the synergies between the environmental and the economic performance of a structural product made with alternative materials. Further, they provide conclusive evidence to support the integration of environmental and economic life cycle analysis in the product development processes of a manufacturing company, or in some cases even in its procurement practices.
