40|$|As {{gathered}} from the respondents, the following are {{the constraints of the}} <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>Authorities</b> in developing their host communities:-Inadequate funding and untimely release of budgetary allocations from government to enable the authorities to meet its commitments to its customers is fundamental problems of the <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>Authorities.</b> The privatization and commercialization Decree No. 28 of 1988 has affected the RBRDAs. The RBDAs as they are cannot be commercially viable. Government has to inject funds to complete ongoing viable capital projects before the organizations can then be commercially viable. Vast farmlands with potentials for viable irrigation development / crop production are left lying waste because of lack of funds for maintenance, high inflation, inadequate project staff, and ageing of plants and machinery that are very expensive to maintain. Staff retrenchment coupled with removal of materials left the immovable assets such as buildings and irrigation structures to the mercy of thieves, vandals and bush fire. It was also discovered that the Upper Benue Basin has developed its host communities more than the Lower Benue Basin in infrastructural facilities. The data on table three augment this position. However, in the area of land clearing and preparation, the Lower Benue Basin has achieved more than the Upper Benue Basin. The information on table four of the paper collaborate this position. 4. 1 CONCLUSION The survival of the Lower and Upper Benue <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>Authorities,</b> just like the other <b>River</b> <b>Basins</b> in the nation entirely depend on the commitment of the states and the National Government. The creation as well as proliferation of rural development programmes/project by successive government in the nation explains why little or no attention is given to the <b>River</b> <b>Basins</b> to effectively discharge their responsibility of developing the rural areas of Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{evaluating}} and authorising new hydraulic projects {{is critical in}} the context of <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> management. Until now, evaluations have in many cases failed to account for sustainability concerns. Several projects have been approved and financed whose economic, social and especially, environmental costs and benefits were highly contested. The new Water Framework Directive establishes the <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> as the geographical unit upon which resource governance may achieve its sustainability objectives, and asks for the prior evaluation and authorisation of all new <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> interventions. However, this Directive does not provide any guidance to the <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>authorities</b> on how to carry such evaluations. Unless the evaluation procedure of new projects evolves into a new, multi-dimensional and multi-stakeholder participatory approach, <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> objectives as expressed in the new Water Framework Directive will be at stake.
