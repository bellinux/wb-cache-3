We examined seasonal variations in the δ 18 Owc and δ 13 Cwc of three common species (Eschweilera coriacea, Iryanthera coriacea, and Protium hebetatum) in Manaus, Brazil (Central Amazon). E. coriacea was also sampled in two other regions to determine the synchronicity of the isotopic signals among different regions. The annual cyclicity of δ 18 Owc variation was cross-checked by 14 C dating. The δ 18 Owc showed distinct seasonal variations that matched the amplitude observed in the δ 18 O of precipitation, whereas seasonal δ 13 Cwc variations were less distinct in most cases. The δ 18 Owc variation patterns were similar within and between some individual trees in Manaus. However, the δ 18 Owc patterns of E. coriacea differed by region. The ages of some samples estimated from the δ 18 Owc cycles were offset from the ages estimated by 14 C dating. In the case of E. coriacea, this phenomenon suggested that missing or wedging rings may occur frequently even in well-grown individuals. Successful cross-dating may be facilitated by establishing δ 18 Owc master chronologies at both seasonal and inter-annual scales for tree species with distinct annual rings in each region...|$|R

40|$|Vapor {{pressure}} deficit (VPD), controlled {{mostly by}} temperature, drives evapotranspiration {{and in turn}} governs both agricultural and urban landscape irrigation. Most tree species are sensitive to VPD, closing stomata to reduce transpiration at vapor deficits above 1 - 2 kPa. At some point temperature-VPD increase affects photosynthesis and tree growth is reduced. Stomatal sensitivity to VPD increases, and photosynthesis and growth reduced, with low precipitation, greater soil water depletion and more water stress. Tree ring growth is widely used {{as a proxy for}} hydroclimate, but the role of VPD has been overlooked, particularly as it interacts with low precipitation. We correlated tree ring growth of lower elevation (1700 - 2100 meter) Rocky Mountain (Juniper scopularum-RMJ) and Utah (J. osteosperma-UJ) junipers from four sites (two sites each species) in the Bear-Wasatch ranges with seasonal VPD and yearly precipitation measured at the USU campus from 1900 to 2010. At two sites, one each RMJ and UJ, soil (precipitation) and atmospheric (VPD) water deficits interacted to limit growth (tree ring indices; r=~ 0. 6 and ~ 0. 5, respectively). At the other two sites dry air/high VPD better explained changes in tree ring index (r= 0. 45 - 0. 5) than yearly precipitation (~r= 0. 2), meaning that high summer temperature was the major constraint on growth. RMJ and UJ trees at the driest sites also had 4 - 10 -fold more missing <b>rings,</b> another <b>indicator</b> of greater water stress. Rocky Mountain and Utah juniper species are not commonly used in dendrochronology studies, but these results suggest a direct climate—precipitation/VPD—impact on growth rather than a proxy relationship. Further, this direct relationship illuminates the potential to reconstruct paleo growing season evapotranspiration (ET) and seasonal water deficit (precipitation minus ET) for northern Utah back approximately half a millennia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Carbon, {{oxygen and}} {{hydrogen}} stable isotopes in tree <b>rings</b> are sensitive <b>indicators</b> of climate changes. We have measured carbon, oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios in α-cel-lulose extracted from annual rings of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and oak (Quercus robur L.) {{growing in the}} Niepoomice Forest, Southern Poland. The presented isotope records cover the period 1900 - 2003. In this paper we compare the values of δ 13 C, δ 18 O and δ 2 H observed in the wholewood of pine and in the latewood of oak with meteorological data (temperature, precipitation and sunshine). The highest significant values of correlation coefficients calcu-lated between δ 13 C and the meteorological data are:- 0. 26 for temperature, 0. 25 for precipita-tion and 0. 41 for sunshine. On {{the basis of our}} investigations we deduced that pine is a more sensitive indicator of environmental changes than oak. Our investigation proves that the best indicators are: hydrogen for summer temperature and oxygen for summer precipitation.

40|$|The {{planarity}} {{of small}} boron-based clusters {{is the result}} of an interplay between geometry, electron delocalization, covalent bonding and stability. These compounds contain two different bonding patterns involving both sigma and pi delocalized bonds, and up to now, their aromaticity has been assigned mainly using the classical (4 N + 2) electron count for both types of electrons. In the present study, we reexplored the aromatic feature of different types of planar boron-based clusters making use of the ring current approach. B 3 (+/-), B- 4 (2 -), B- 5 (+/-), B- 6, B- 7 (-), B- 8 (2 -), B- 9 (-), B- 10 (2 -), B- 11 (-), B- 12, B- 13 (+), B- 14 (2 -) and B- 16 (2 -) are characterized by magnetic responses to be doubly sigma and pi aromatic species in which the pi aromaticity can be predicted using the (4 N + 2) electron count. The triply aromatic character of B- 12 and B- 13 (+) is confirmed. The pi electrons of B- 18 (2 -), B- 19 (-) and B- 20 (2 -) obey the disk aromaticity rule with an electronic configuration of [1 sigma(2) 1 pi(4) 1 delta(4) 2 sigma(2) ] rather than the (4 N + 2) count. The double aromaticity feature is observed for boron hydride cycles including B@B 5 H 5 +, Li 7 B 5 H 5 and M@BnHnq clusters from both the (4 N + 2) rule and ring current maps. The double pi and sigma aromaticity in carbon-boron planar cycles B 7 C-, B 8 C, B 6 C 2, B 9 C-, B 8 C 2 and B 7 C 3 - is in conflict with the Huckel electron count. This is also the case for the ions B 11 C 5 +/- whose <b>ring</b> current <b>indicators</b> suggest that they belong to the class of double aromaticity, in which the pi electrons obey the disk aromaticity characteristics. In many clusters, the classical electron count cannot be applied, and the magnetic responses of the electron density expressed in terms of the ring current provide us with a more consistent criterion for determining their aromatic character...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the hypothesis that the}} plantations of Pinus pinaster Ait. growing on the unconfined Gnangara aquifer do so independently of groundwater availability. To test the hypothesis we related annual growth (tree-ring widths and basal area increment (BAI)) with physiological attributes associated with water (water use efficiency (WUE) from δ 13 C natural abundance values) and nutrient availability (δ 15 N natural abundance values) of trees with shallow (20 mbgl) access to ground-water. Annual growth responses were also related to annual climatic variability (growth season rainfall) and silvicultural treatments (thinning, fertilisation and forest floor fuel reduction burning) to assess the relative importance of each on annual tree-ring growth. There is a strong influence of P. pinaster tree age on ring widths and BAI during the establishment phase. Thereafter the effects of the various management treatments (stand thinning, P fertilisation and forest floor burning) all interact to various degrees on ring width and BAI ranges. Stand thinning appears to have the greatest effect on ring growth which is clearly evident for at least 3 - 4 years after the treatment. The stable isotope composition of the tree rings also showed a clear effect of stand thinning at both the shallow and deep groundwater sites and thinning dominates any small effects on water-use efficiency (WUE) caused by forest floor burning and P fertilisation. Thinning also had a major impact leading to increases in ring δ 15 N values of 2 ‰ or more. Multiple regression models developed for P. pinaster tree-ring width growth and BAI had a high predictive power and they always included rainfall as the main factor. Models developed for <b>ring</b> isotopic <b>indicators</b> were more variable and less predictive than those for the ring growth and BAI with no significant models emerging for the shallow depth to groundwater site. Our results show that by using tree-ring growth responses together with climate proxies, such as ring isotope chemistry, we are able to separate the relative influence of climate and other factors which control growth. The overriding effect of rainfall in the models at both depths to groundwater suggests that the pine plantations growing on the Gnangara aquifer do not rely on the direct use of the groundwater resource for growth but rather that they reduce recharge of the superficial Gnangara aquifer through their efficient use of rainfall derived soil water...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} chronic air {{pollution}} such as increased CO 2 and NOx emissions on forest ecosystems in the Athabasca oil sands region in Alberta, Canada, {{was investigated in}} Pinus banksiana (jack pine) and Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen, aspen) stands in two watersheds (NE 7 and SM 8) located at different distances from the main emission sources of oil sands mining and upgrading facilities, using δ 13 C, δ 15 N, and Ca/Al of soil and tree <b>ring</b> samples as <b>indicators.</b> Watershed NE 7 was exposed to greater amounts of acid deposition due to its closeness to the mining and upgrading area. The δ 15 N in the forest floor was lower (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in NE 7 (ranged from − 1. 42 to − 0. 87 ‰) than in SM 8 (− 0. 54 to 1. 43 ‰), implying a greater amount of recent deposition of 15 N-depleted N in NE 7. Tree ring δ 13 C gradually decreased over time for both tree species/watersheds, indicating the influence of 13 C-depleted CO 2 emitted from industrial sources. Tree ring N concentration and δ 15 N were not different between watersheds and did not significantly change with time. Interestingly, however, the difference between watersheds (NE 7 –SM 8) that is expressed as Diff_N (for N) increased with concomitant decreases in Diff_δ 15 N over time, implying greater increases in 15 N-depleted N input in NE 7 than in SM 8. Such trends were stronger in aspen stands (R 2 = 0. 64 and p 3 ̆c 0. 001 for Diff_N andR 2 = 0. 44 and p 3 ̆c 0. 01 for Diff_δ 15 N between 1964 and 2009) than in jack pine stands. We conclude that δ 15 N in the forest floor and differences in N and δ 15 N of tree rings between watersheds are useful indicators reflecting the impact of spatial variations of air pollution on forest stands in the Athabasca oil sands region in western Canada...|$|R
40|$|Increasing our {{knowledge}} about the global climate system will help society to mitigate anthropogenically induced global climate change and its impacts on the environment. Information on past climates from before the instrumental data era comes from proxies (i. e. marine and lake sediments, corals, tree <b>rings),</b> or <b>indicators</b> of past climate. The research contained in this thesis focuses {{on the use of}} organic biomarkers in the form of fossilized sedimentary lipids as proxies. The preserved distribution of fossilized sedimentary lipids in the sediments can reflect past environmental conditions (i. e. temperature). The proxies examined within this thesis are based on two different types of sedimentary lipids that are biomarkers for temperature, long-chain alkenones and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs). Most of the research contributing to this thesis was performed on sediments from the Baltic Sea, where sedimentary long-chain alkenones, isoprenoid GDGTs (isoGDGTs), hydroxylated GDGTs (OH-GDGTs), and branched GDGTs (brGDGTs), were applied to examine environmental changes in the region as well as the success and limitations of these proxies under the changing environmental conditions that occurred in the Baltic Sea over the Holocene. In this thesis, sea surface temperature (SST), indicators for anoxia and biomarkers for cyanobacteria (bloom forming microorganisms that when they die and sink to the bottom their decomposition consumes oxygen in the bottom waters) from the Baltic Sea were compared and showed that climate is the main controller of low-oxygen conditions in the basin. Also, SST estimates were compared to a reconstruction of human population from northern Europe and the relationship demonstrated the impact climate had on human population size and economy from 7, 500 - 3, 500 BP in the Baltic Sea region. Next, several OH-GDGT based indices were applied to sedimentary records in the central and southern regions of the basin and revealing that OH-GDGTs are a promising proxy for estimating SST in the Baltic Sea. Another study in this thesis demonstrated that the distribution of long-chain alkenones co-vary with salinity changes in the Baltic Sea, both regionally and in the past, suggesting the distribution of long-chain alkenones could be used for paleosalinity studies. The last study on Baltic Sea sediments in this thesis examines the provenance of brGDGTs in two different regions (the central and southern regions) in the basin and showed that the provenance changed when the basin was reconnected to the North Sea transforming from a freshwater lake to a brackish body of water. Despite the changes in brGDGT provenance over the Holocene, continental temperatures were reconstructed by applying appropriate calibrations during the different phases in the Baltic Sea history. In the Tagus River basin on the Iberian Peninsula, a re-examination of the provenance and distribution of brGDGTs from a previous study was performed using enhanced chromatography methods to determine if a new calibration could improve temperature estimates in the area. The distribution of brGDGTs in past sediments were also examined by analyzing four sediment cores in a transect from the river to off the continental shelf to determine if present day trends held true over the Holocene...|$|R
