50|$|A {{loan from}} an IRA is prohibited. It is {{considered}} a prohibited transaction and the IRS may disqualify your plan and tax you on the assets. Some use the 60-day rollover {{as a way to}} temporarily take funds from an IRA. A participant will take a distribution and, in turn, all or some of the distribution that the participant takes may be rolled back into the same IRA plan within the allowed period to retain its tax deferred status. One 60-day rollover is allowed every rolling 12 months, per IRA. For instance, if you withdraw any amount from IRA-1 and deposit it into IRA-2 (as a tax-free rollover), you cannot make another tax-free <b>rollover</b> <b>of</b> any <b>funds</b> from IRA-1 or IRA-2 for 365 days. However, this would not prevent you from making a tax-free rollover from another IRA.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a statistical {{assessment of the}} effect of occupancy on the <b>rollover</b> propensity <b>of</b> passenger vehicles such as cars, SUVs, minivans, pickup trucks and 15 -passenger vans. A logistic regression model has been built to predict the probability <b>of</b> <b>rollover</b> as an outcome of a single vehicle crash, based on occupancy as well as various other vehicle, crash and driver-related factors. The model uses all police-reported crash data from selected states over the period from 1994 to 2001 from NHTSA’s State Data System (SDS). The metric used to compare the relative risk <b>of</b> <b>rollover</b> among the vehicles is the probability <b>of</b> <b>rollover</b> conditional on a single vehicle crash having occurred. A binary logit model is estimated using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach. The resulting parameter estimates and test-statistics are used to assess significance of the explanatory variables and to estimate the probability <b>of</b> <b>rollover</b> for plausible scenarios. The analysis has shown that occupancy, along with speed and road geometry, has significant effect on rollover propensity. While the overall pattern points to an increasing risk <b>of</b> <b>rollover</b> with increasing occupancy in all passenger vehicle categories, the magnitude of increase varies significantly among the vehicle classes. In fact, the increase in the modeled risk <b>of</b> <b>rollover</b> from nominal (driver only) occupancy to full occupancy is most pronounced for 15 -passenger vans followed by Minivans, SUVs, Pickup Trucks and Cars. Apart from the relative risks at nominal and full payloads, there is also a wide disparity in the predicted probabilities <b>of</b> <b>rollover</b> at various occupancies between the vehicles. In fact, on high-speed roads at full occupancy, 15 -passenger vans depict the highest risk <b>of</b> <b>rollover,</b> followed by SUVs, Pickup Trucks, Minivans and Passenger Cars, in that order. Charts depicting predicted probabilities by occupancy for various hypothetical scenarios of crash factors are presented for each vehicle class...|$|R
