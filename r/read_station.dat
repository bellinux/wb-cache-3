50|$|The {{operation}} of the 407 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a carriage tape. Exit hubs (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to entry hubs (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment).

50|$|Cartridges {{were moved}} {{into and out}} of read {{stations}} by two motorized accessor arms, electrically connected via flat cable on a drum.

50|$|Assembler source {{starts with}} column 21 of the card, not column one. In systems without a disk drive, the {{assembler}} would punch code into {{the start of}} the card just read (the card reader was actually a reader-punch, with the punch station after the <b>read</b> <b>station)</b> and then read the next card. To handle forward branches and the like, the assembler's second pass literally involved a second pass of the cards through the reader/punch. If source changes were needed the programmer would duplicate the cards to obtain a deck with columns 1-20 blank ready for the next run through the assembler.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>read</b> <b>station,</b> {{a set of}} 80 {{spring wire}} brushes pressed against the card, one for each column (the 407 <b>read</b> <b>station,</b> {{constructed}} without brushes, held the card stationary and could read a card multiple times, each time generating the same impulses as would be generated by an 80 spring wire station). When a hole passed under the brush, the brush would make contact with a conductive surface beneath the card that was connected to an electrical power source and an electrical pulse, an impulse in IBM terminology, would be generated. Each brush was connected to an individual hub on the control panel, from which it could be wired to another hub, as needed. The action caused by an impulse on a wire depended on when in the cycle it occurred, a simple form of time division multiplexing. Thus an impulse that occurred during 7-time on a wire connected to the column 26 punch magnet would punch a hole in row 7 of column 26. An impulse on the same wire that occurred at 4-time would punch a 4 in column 26. Impulses timed in this way often came from read brushes that detected holes punched in cards as they passed under the brushes, but such pulses were also emitted by other circuits, such as counter outputs. Zone impulses and digit impulses were both needed for alphanumeric printing. They could both be sent on a single wire, then separated out by relay circuits based on the time within a cycle.|$|E

50|$|Each {{input card}} was read at two {{successive}} reading stations. Thus, for example, fields in a card {{could be compared}} with the following card and, should a change be detected, say in invoice number, totals could be printed. Unlike earlier IBM tabulating machines, which had 80 read brushes at each <b>read</b> <b>station,</b> one for each column, the 407 had 960 brushes at each station, one for each possible hole in a punched card. Cards were held in position during each read cycle and the per digit pulses needed were generated using commutators, one for each column. This allowed the card to be read more than once at each station, for greater flexibility.|$|E
5000|$|A typical {{hardware}} configuration {{consisted of a}} panel with toggle switches and lights to enter the boot loader, and a Teletype writer to input operating system commands, a punched card reader that gravity feed the cards (they dropped into the <b>read</b> <b>station,</b> and were ejected and turned 180 degrees and then placed in the exit hopper), 2 655 disc drives, and a printer that printed about 600 lines per minutes. The boot loader and peripherals were usually on punched cards, which notified the operating system which devices to use via a PAL (Peripheral Availability List) entry cards. The [...] "go" [...] command to the operating system was infamous: [...] "EE" [...] control-G (bell).|$|E

In 1975, McClean began leasing airtime from WWNO and renting studio space from New Orleans’ Lighthouse for the Blind.

40|$|We {{propose to}} develop a new method of {{information}} storage to replace magnetic hard disk drives and other instruments of secondary/backup data storage. The proposed method stores petabytes of user-data in a sugar cube (1 cm 3), and can read/write that information at hundreds of megabits/sec. Digital information is recorded and stored {{in the form of a}} long macromolecule consisting of at least two bases, A and B. (This would be similar to DNA strands constructed from the four nucleic acids G,C,A,T.) The macromolecules initially enter the system as blank slates. A macromolecule with, say, 10, 000 identical bases in the form of AAAAA [...] AAA may be used to record a kilobyte block of user-data (including modulation and error-correction coding), although, in this blank state, it can only represent the null sequence 00000 [...] 000. Suppose this blank string of A's is dragged before an atomically-sharp needle of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). When electric pulses are applied to the needle in accordance with the sequence of 0 s and 1 s of a 1 kB block of user-data, selected A molecules will be transformed into B molecules (e. g., a fraction of A will be broken off and discarded). The resulting string now encodes the user-data in the form of AABABBA [...] . BAB. The same STM needle can subsequently read the recorded information, as A and B would produce different electric signals when the strand passes under the needle. The macromolecule now represents a data block to be stored in a "parking lot" within the sugar cube, and later brought to a <b>read</b> <b>station</b> on demand. Millions of parking spots and thousands of Read/Write stations may be integrated within the micro-fabricated sugar cube, thus providing access to petabytes of user-data in a scheme that benefits from the massive parallelism of thousands of Read/Write stations within the same three-dimensionally micro-structured device.

30|$|The actual {{process for}} {{determining}} epicenters (trilateration) also differed between conditions. The embedded class used calibrated dry-lines that were anchored {{at each of}} the seismograph <b>reading</b> <b>stations.</b> To determine the distance each <b>reading</b> <b>station</b> was from the event epicenter, students had to measure the length of the primary wave. The length of this wave was then used to calculate the length of the dry-line. One quarter of an inch (6.35 mm) was equal to 1 pre-determined unit of dry-line (approximately 1 foot; 304.8 mm) so, if the wave measured 2 inches (50.8 mm) the students needed to measure out 8 units of dry-line. Once each group determined the appropriate length of dry-line for the event, the group would sweep out circles with their bodies, which reflected the possible loci of solutions from the individual stations until they found the place where all four dry-lines (and bodies) coincided. The place where students converged represented the epicenter of the event. The non-embedded class used calibrated dry-lines that were pinned to a large map of Southern California (see Fig.  1). Again, one quarter of an inch (6.35 mm) of length for the primary wave was equal to 1 pre-measured unit of dry-line; however, in this condition 1 unit of dry-line was approximately 1 inch (25.4 mm) in length. Despite the relative difference in scale across the two conditions (whole classroom trilateration versus wall map trilateration), the entire process of measuring, locating, and recording an earthquake event took approximately 12 to 15 minutes in both conditions. This suggests that the difference in scale did not {{have an impact on the}} difficultly of completing the trilateration activities.|$|R
40|$|In many circles, the {{justification}} for purchasing a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) has already been settled because of the proliferation of image data. A PACS is used to acquire medical images digitally from the various modalities, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, ultrasound, nu-clear medicine, and digital radiography (1). The need to manage, transfer, and transport thousands of images effec-tively has led to medical and legal arguments for storing such data electronically rather than producing each image on film. Moreover, with the dissemination of imaging centers—as well as one’s referral base, which may extend beyond state or country boundaries—a PACS becomes {{an integral part of}} running an efficient department.
