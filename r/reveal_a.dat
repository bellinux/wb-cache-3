5|$|Hyperoxic myopia has {{occurred}} in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This is due {{to an increase in}} the refractive power of the lens, since axial length and keratometry readings do not <b>reveal</b> <b>a</b> corneal or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually reversible with time.|$|E

The game features traditional aspects of the platform genre while integrating various powers of time-manipulation. Using these abilities, the player progresses by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces.|$|E

5|$|A world map is {{available}} and, at the beginning, the player is allocated {{one of the}} twenty regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As the player progresses through these regions, each representing a level, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. The goals for each level are straightforward: they generally fall {{along the lines of}} eliminating the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers. The first few levels are tutorials, teaching the player the basics. Special items are hidden throughout certain levels. Such items perform actions such as increasing the player's creatures' experience level, or revealing the map. They can <b>reveal</b> <b>a</b> hidden level, where the player must perform a specific task, and is rewarded upon completion.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation <b>reveal</b> <b>a</b> trend towards fracture.|$|E

5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations <b>reveal</b> <b>a</b> large disk of dust and gas orbiting the star, {{which was the first}} debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} <b>reveal</b> <b>a</b> phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages {{from a common}} ancestor.

Wolf genetic sequencing has found the Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian gray wolf and Himalayan wolf, and the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, {{includes}} {{an homage to}} the gold body paint death scene by having a female character dead on a bed nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use of his hat as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to <b>reveal</b> <b>a</b> tuxedo underneath and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such as True Lies, The Simpsons, and the Austin Powers series.

5|$|Lochner {{seems to}} have {{prepared}} on paper before approaching his underdrawings; {{there is little evidence}} of reworking, even when positioning large groups of figures. Infrared reflectography of the underdrawings for the Last Judgment panels show letters used to denote the final colour to be applied, for example g for gelb (yellow) or w for weiss (white), and there are few deviations in the finished work. He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective, enlarged or diminished the size of figures. The underdrawings <b>reveal</b> <b>a</b> draughtsman of skill, dynamism and confidence; the figures appear fully formed with little evidence of reworking. Many are extremely detailed and precisely modelled, for example St Ursula's brooch in the Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints, which contains closely detailed garlands and diadems.|$|E
