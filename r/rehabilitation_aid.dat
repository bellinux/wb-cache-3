40|$|The {{bachelor}} degree thesis ?Availability of <b>rehabilitation</b> and compensation <b>aids</b> {{for persons with}} rheumatoid arthritis? has a research character. The thesis is divided into theoretical and practical parts. The theoretical part deals with a comprehensive characterization of rheumatoid arthritis. Further, it presents methods of diagnostics and treatment of the disease. It also outlines issues relating {{to the needs of}} patients afflicted by the disease. It also includes a chapter dealing with compensation and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>aids</b> that improve quality of life and integration of the patients into the society. The practical part deals with availability of compensation and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>aids</b> on the current market, along with a financial participation of the patients. Three objectives have been set relating to the topic. The first objective was to map the offer of compensation and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>aids</b> in connection with the demand on the side of persons suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The second objective was to find out which compensation and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>aids</b> have been used most frequently. The last objective was to investigate whether persons suffering from rheumatoid arthritis are willing to financially participate on purchase of the compensation aids. I am convinced that the set-up objectives of the {{bachelor degree}} thesis have been met. The method selected to deal with the issues and to achieve the mentioned objectives was quantitative research. We used inquiring by means of a questionnaire. The research has confirmed both the following hypotheses: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis most frequently use compensation aids for walking and The financial participation of rheumatoid arthritis patients on purchase of compensation aids depends on each patient´s working activity. Findings and results of the thesis may be beneficial for students of the following years in specializations dealing with rehabilitation and psycho-social care of children, adults and seniors with special needs. Moreover, the thesis may serve as an impulse for companies distributing compensation aids to take into account requirements of persons with rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{evaluation}} and teaching of motor skills {{in relation to}} patients are two important aspects of motor skill training. These two points or problems must be resolved {{in order to make}} such training effective. To address the issues simultaneously within a single system, this study proposes a Cybernetic <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Aid</b> (CRA) under the concept of direct teaching using tactile feedback with an EMG-based motor skill evaluation function. The CRA involves a human–machine– human (physiotherapist–rehabilitation robot–patient) interface known as a Cybernetic Interface Platform using biological signals not only to monitor patients ’ motor skills but also to directly teach such skills to them. The CIP can also be used as a human–human (physiotherapist–patient) system as well as a human–machine (physiotherapist–rehabilitation robot) system. In order to evaluate motor skills, the motions of the physiotherapist (T) and the patient (P) were analyzed using a log-linearized Gaussian mixture model that can classify motion patterns via electromyography (EMG) signals. Tactile stimulators were used to convey the instructions of the therapist or the system to the patients. A rehabilitation robot known as the Biodex System was integrated into the developed setup for a number of rehabilitation tasks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes the cybernetic <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>aid</b> (CRA) {{based on}} the concept of direct {{teaching}} using tactile feed-back with electromyography (EMG) -based motor skill evaluation. Evaluation and teaching of motor skills are two important aspects of rehabilitation training, and the CRA provides novel and effec-tive solutions to potentially solve the difficulties inherent in these two processes within a single system. In order to evaluate motor skills, EMG signals measured from a patient are analyzed using a log-linearized Gaussian mixture network that can classify motion patterns and compute the degree of similarity between the patient’s measured EMG patterns and the desired pattern provided by the therapist. Tactile stimulators are used to convey motion instruc-tions from the therapist or the system to the patient, and a rehabil-itation robot can also be integrated into the developed prototype to increase its rehabilitation capacity. A series of experiments per-formed using the developed prototype demonstrated that the CRA can work as a human–human, human–computer and human–ma-chine system. The experimental results indicated that the healthy (able-bodied) subjects were able to follow the desired muscular contraction levels instructed by the therapist or the system and per-form proper joint motion without relying on visual feedback.

40|$|EMG signal among five {{different}} age groups of adolescent's muscle. Fifteen healthy adolescents {{participated in this}} study and they were divided into five age groups (13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 years). Subjects were performed dynamic contraction during lifting a standard weight (3 -kg dumbbell) and EMG signals were recorded from their Biceps Brachii (BB) muscle. Two common EMG analysis techniques namely root mean square (RMS) and mean absolute values (MAV) were used to find the differences. The statistical analysis was included: linear regression to examine the relationships between EMG amplitude and age, repeated measures ANOVA to assess differences among the variables, and finally Coefficient of Variation (CoV) for signal steadiness among the groups of subjects during contraction. The result from RMS and MAV analysis shows that the 17 -years age groups exhibited higher activity (0. 28 and 0. 19 mV respectively) compare to other groups (13 -Years: 0. 26 and 0. 17 mV, 14 -years: 0. 25 and 0. 23 mV, 15 -Years: 0. 23 and 0. 16 mV, 16 -years: 0. 23 and 0. 16 mV respectively). Also, this study shows modest correlation between age and signal activities among all age group's muscle. The experiential results can play a pivotal role for developing EMG prosthetic hand controller, neuromuscular system, EMG based <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>aid</b> and movement biomechanics, which may help to separate age groups among the adolescents...|$|E
40|$|Acid mine {{drainage}} (AMD) is {{a global}} problem leading to the acidification of freshwaters, as well as contamination by heavy metals. The ability of humic substances (HS) such as humic acid (HA) to decrease toxicity of heavy metals is widely known, whereas limited {{studies have examined the}} ability of HS to decrease toxicity linked with multiple stressors such as those associated with AMD. This study investigated the ability of HA to decrease acute toxicity defined as morbidity and ventilation frequency (measured via the time elapsed for 10 operculum movements) in eastern rainbowfish (Melanotaenia splendida splendida) exposed to the multiple stressors of AMD-driven heavy metal concentrations, together with low pH. Water from the Mount Morgan open pit (a now closed gold and copper mine site), located at Mount Morgan, Central Queensland, Australia, was used as the AMD source. Fish were exposed to 0 % (pH 7. 3), 2 % (pH 6. 7), 3 % (pH 5. 7) and 4 % (pH 4. 6) AMD in the presence of 0, 10 and 20 mg/L Aldrich Humic Acid (AHA) over 96 hours. HA was shown to significantly decrease the acute toxicity of AMD and its adverse effects on ventilation frequency. These results are important in showing that HA can influence toxicity of metal mixtures and low pH, thus indicating a potential role for HA in decreasing toxicity of multiple environmental stressors more widely, and possible value as a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>aid...</b>|$|E
