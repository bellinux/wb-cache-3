500|$|On 22 April {{representatives of}} the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy signed a {{memorandum}} of understanding stating that the Coast Guard would supply 17 Point-class cutters and their crews and the Navy would provide transport to South Vietnam and logistical support with two tank landing ships (LST) that had been converted to repair ships. Ten of the cutters were sourced from stations on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and seven were sourced from Pacific coast stations. After removal of the Oerlikon 20–mm cannon on the bow, in place of which each cutter was fitted with a combination mount consisting of a 81mm mortar which could be either drop-fired or trigger-fired, above which was mounted a [...]50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun. The mortar could be fired in both indirect and direct modes, and was equipped with a <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The cutters were loaded on merchant ships for shipment to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay in the Philippines. On 29 April President Lyndon B.

50|$|As {{with the}} Centurion, Contentious was later up-gunned; first tested with the 84 mm 20 pounder, the Bovington example later gained a L7 105 mm gun, {{derived from the}} 20 pounder. The {{replacement}} was relatively easy, as the 105 mm is largely a rebarrelled version of the 84 mm and has a similar breech. Photographs of the prototype do show some change to the <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinders</b> between the two.|$|R
50|$|Paccar {{received}} the M107 and M110 design contracts and initial manufacturing single source bid from Detroit Arsenal. This {{was based on}} patented key features of the M55: the gas equalibrator 2911209 balance of the barrel that hydraulically trimmed with terrain fall line sensing pendulum 2857815, no back pawl limits on aiming, parabolic taper hydraulic <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinders</b> patentable, and hydraulic lock out of suspension when shooting 3117800. Two other firms also produced the M107: FMC, between 1965 and 1980, and Bowen-McLaughlin-York.|$|R
50|$|It was W.G.K. Kilbourn, a Vickers {{engineer}} {{working for}} the DTD at the time, who transformed their idea into {{the reality of the}} prototype of the tank that would serve the British forces from D-day onwards. The first thing Kilbourn had to fix was the lack of a workable recoil system for the 17-pounder. The 17-pounder travelled 40 in back as it absorbed the recoil of the blast. This was too long for the Sherman's turret. Kilbourn solved this problem by redesigning the recoil system completely rather than modifying it. The <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinders</b> were shortened and placed {{on both sides of the}} gun to take advantage of the width of the turret.|$|R
50|$|It {{is unusual}} among American-designed field {{artillery}} weapons {{in that it}} has the <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder</b> situated above the barrel. The 4.7-inch howitzer M1908/M1912 shared this feature. The 75 mm Gun M1917 also had this, but {{is based on the}} British Ordnance QF 18-pounder.|$|E
50|$|The Chuch'e-Po is an {{improvement}} over the Tŏkch'ŏn artillery piece, which was mounted on an ATS-59 chassis. There are at least four M1991 versions of the Chuch'e-Po, each mounting a different gun; the D-30 122mm, D-74 122 mm, the M-46 130 mm and the ML-20 152 mm howitzer. A fifth M1992 version is armed with the SM-4-1 130mm howitzer. These artillery pieces can be identified by their six road wheels, {{as compared to the}} Tok-Ch'on's five, and a prominent <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder</b> which protrudes from the turret. Another major difference {{is the fact that the}} Chuch'e-Po has a fully encased rounded turret, as opposed to the older open-topped self-propelled artillery pieces used previously.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1894, Deport {{was passed}} over for promotion, and {{resigned}} to join [...] "Chatillon-Commentry", a private armaments firm. Two young military engineers from Ecole Polytechnique, Captains Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville and Emile Rimailho, continued development and introduced an improved version in 1896. Their contribution was a leakproof hydro-pneumatic long-recoil mechanism which they named [...] "Frein II" [...] ( [...] Brake # II [...] ). A major improvement was the placement of improved silver-alloy rings on the freely moving piston which separated the compressed air and the hydraulic fluid inside the main hydro-pneumatic <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder.</b> These and other modifications achieved the desired result: the long-term retention of hydraulic fluid and compressed air inside the recoil system, even under the worst field conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve the recoil system problems, hydro-pneumatic <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinders</b> (using {{compressed}} air instead of springs) were designed by a French officer who had previously done this for Schneider-Creusot. In the US these were called the [...] "St. Chamond" [...] recuperator (touching off a flap in France over the US [...] "stealing" [...] military secrets), but only 60 of these were delivered {{by the end of}} 1919. Field trials in France showed that there was excessive play in the elevation and traverse mechanisms, making the gun very inaccurate, along with poor durability in cross-country movement. However, production continued postwar; eventually 810 barrels and 362 field carriages were delivered. The surplus of barrels led to the weapon's use for other purposes.|$|R
50|$|Several revolvers use recoil to cock {{the hammer}} and advance the {{cylinder}}. In these designs, the barrel and cylinder are affixed to an upper frame which recoils atop a sub-frame. As to upper receiver <b>recoils,</b> the <b>cylinder</b> is advanced and hammer cocked, functions {{that are usually}} done manually. Notable examples are the Webley-Fosbery and Mateba.|$|R
5000|$|This piece {{appears to}} have almost {{completely}} replaced the Type 14 10 cm Cannon. It has all the standard features of the 1930-36 period of Japanese gun design. Its long barrel, short cradle, long trails, and relatively low silhouette gives it the most graceful appearance of any Japanese artillery piece. In traveling position the tube is retracted {{by means of a}} winch and locked to the cradle. The most remarkable fact about the Type 92, aside from its appearance, is the great range that it attains with a 35-pound shell in proportion to its unusually low weight. It has been reported that the weapon is rarely fired at extreme ranges, which require the use of a supercharge, because of malfunctions in the recoil system caused thereby. Some years ago troubles with the recoil system were so frequent that extra glands and packing for the <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinders</b> were carried in the firing battery, and replacing them was equivalent to first-echelon maintenance in U. S. practice. Difficulties were also reported when the weapon was fired at or near the limits of traverse. Whether this was due to a unique [...] "bug" [...] {{in the design of the}} Type 92 or was inherent in the use of spade-plate stabilization is not known. The Model 92 is stabilized by three spade plates for each trail. Both spade plates and trail blocks are demountable.|$|R
5000|$|... == Construction == The Škoda 7 cm {{guns were}} {{developed}} and {{built at the}} Pilsen works between 1892 through 1918. The barrel was made of steel with a horizontal sliding wedge breech, they used fixed quick fire ammunition and most ranged in length between 26 and 45 calibers. There was a single hydraulic <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder</b> beneath the barrel and most were aimed by shoulder pads. The G. L/18 was a landing gun which could be taken ashore to provide support for a landing party. Initially these guns were deployed as anti-torpedo boat guns and had an elevation of -10° to +20°. Škoda engineers later developed anti-aircraft mounts which could elevate from -10° to +90°, but the ballistic performance for the guns remained the same.|$|E
5000|$|Juche-Po - Self-propelled {{artillery}} gun on {{a modified}} Ch'ŏnma-ho chassis. The Juche-Po is {{an improvement over}} the Tok-Ch'ŏn artillery piece, which was mounted on an ATS-59 chassis. There are at least four M1991 versions of the Juche-Po, each mounting a different gun: the D-30 122 mm, D-74 122 mm, the M-46 130 mm and the ML-20 152 mm howitzer.

50|$|The M/16 was a {{relatively}} simple design. It was intended for static emplacement, and was mounted on a pedestal, allowing for 360° sideways movement. The mount allowed for an angle of elevation of between -1° and 75°. The gun barrel was 45 calibres long, and had 28 grooves (rifling) twisting to the right. The breech block was a semi-automatic horizontal wedge - the gunner had to manually open it to remove the case from the previous shot, but it closed automatically on the insertion of a new round. There was a hydro-pneumatic <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder</b> under the barrel, with a heavy spring to aid the forward motion of the gun at high elevation. It was originally designed to fire under local command, but was later equipped to receive gun-laying information from a central sight.|$|E
50|$|The rail fence cipher {{was used}} by the ancient Greeks in the scytale, a {{mechanical}} system of producing a transposition cipher. The system consisted of a cylinder and a ribbon that was wrapped around the cylinder. The message to be encrypted was written on the coiled ribbon. The letters of the original message would be rearranged when the ribbon was uncoiled from the cylinder. However, the message was easily decrypted when the ribbon was <b>recoiled</b> on a <b>cylinder</b> of the same diameter as the encrypting cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The Type 99 is {{a smooth}} bore, muzzle-loading weapon of the Stokes-Brandt type. The Type 99 81 mm mortar {{differs from the}} Type 97 81 mm {{infantry}} mortar in the shortness of its tube, which is only 21.75 inches as compared with 45.34 inches of the Type 97. The mortar can be disassembled into three units: the tube, the bipod, and the base plate. The legs of the bipod, made of tubular steel, are mounted on the elevating screw housing by a clevis joint. They terminate in thin steel plates which have single-pointed spikes on the underside. The spread of the legs is limited by a chain which has a spring attached to one end to relieve the shock of firing. A buffer system incorporated in the bipod gives a recuperation of 2 inches. The <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinders</b> are filled with light grease or heavy oil. The base plate, made of pressed steel, has a series of ribs and braces welded on the underside {{to allow it to}} dig into the ground when the piece is fired. On the top side of the plate, in the center, is a circular depression into which the base-cap knob fits when the mortar is mounted in firing position. A carrying handle is attached to the rear edge of the plate. Also, two small hooks are welded to the rear edge to permit the attachment of a carrying strap. Around {{the outer edge of the}} plate is a one-inch ridge, and on the lower front edge a hook is attached through which a small rod can be thrust and used for slight changes in base plate alignment. A stability test of the Type 99 mortar, in which a total of 14 rounds were fired, produced no visible evidence of cracking or deformation of either base plate or bipod. The plate sank about 2 inches into the ground with the firing of seven rounds at alternate elevations of 45 to 75 degrees. Stability was very satisfactory when firing zone charges I to IV, but zones V to VI produced noticeable hop of the mortar and a sinking of the base plate. The reported range of the weapon of about 2,200 yards has not been conclusively confirmed.|$|R
50|$|The Cannone da 90/50 Ansaldo Model 1938 and OTO Model 1939 had an autofretted {{monobloc}} barrel with a screwed-on breech ring {{containing the}} horizontal sliding breech block and seatings for the <b>recoil</b> and run-out <b>cylinders.</b> The most interesting {{part of the}} weapon was the single quadriaxal mounting designed for it: those were pre-stabilized, with a complex system controlled by 11 gyros, with two electric motors providing the necessary RPC; the whole complex was enclosed in an oval shielded turret, mainly {{to protect it from}} the blast effects from the battleship's main caliber guns. The turret weighed some 20 tons, and the practical rate of fire was 12 rounds per minute. After testing on the armoured cruiser San Giorgio, the 90/50 was fitted on the new Littorio-class battleships and the two Andrea Doria-class battleships being rebuilt, for a respective total of 12 and 10 mountings.|$|R
5000|$|The early Pattern 1914/15 {{guns were}} a {{built-up}} design, {{but in the}} 1930s production was switched to a barrel with a removable liner. [...] The Pattern 1914/15 was mounted on a central pivot with a hydraulic <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder</b> underneath the barrel. The Pattern 1914/15 was the first gun to be equipped with a semi-automatic, vertical inertial wedge breech and fired 76.2 × 385 mm R, fixed quick fire ammunition. Pattern 1914/15 guns were able to fire all of the rounds of the Army's M1902 field gun, plus time fuzed AA rounds. At the end of 1914, four prototype guns were installed on trucks and in February of 1915 they successfully passed their tests at the St. Petersburg test site. The guns were mounted on either American White Motor Company or Russian Russo-Balt truck chassis.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{armament}} was a Škoda ÚV vz. 34 (A3) {{gun with}} a pepperpot muzzle brake and a prominent armored <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder</b> above the barrel. It fired a [...]815 kg armor-piercing shell at 690 m/s. It {{was credited with}} penetrating a plate inclined at 30° from the vertical 37 mm thick at 100 m, 31 mm thick at 500 m, 26 mm thick at 1000 m, and 22 mm thick at 1500 m. Another source quotes penetration of a vertical plate 45 mm thick at 500 m. The machine gun's ball mount could be coupled to the main gun or used independently. Both weapons could elevate 25° and depress 10°. They both used 1.25x power sights with a 25° field of view. The tank used Zbrojovka Brno ZB vz. 35 heavy machine guns in both ball mounts.|$|E
50|$|The gun {{carriage}} {{consists of a}} pedestal, bolted rigidly to the concrete emplacement, and of a gun-supporting structure, which rests on the pedestal and is capable of traversing upon it. The pedestal is the foundation piece of the {{gun carriage}}. On the M1903 carriage the pivot yoke is mounted in the pedestal and rests upon a ring of ball bearings {{on the base of}} the pedestal. The entire weight of the gun and top part of the carriage rests upon this ring of ball bearings. The bushings for the pivot yoke form two supports against the thrust of firing. At {{the upper end of the}} pivot yoke, on either side, trunnion bearings are provided for the cradle trunnions. The shield and shield supports are bolted to the pivot yoke. The opening for the gun in the shield is prolonged underneath to allow for the removal of the piston and springs from the <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 12cm Kanone M 80 {{was a light}} siege gun used by Austria-Hungary during World War I.

Shortly after these guns were adopted a hydraulic <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder</b> was adapted to absorb the recoil forces. It was attached to the underside of the carriage and the firing platform.

50|$|In 1932 {{a new and}} {{innovative}} anti-aircraft gun was designed. Partly based on the M/16, it was mounted on a low-slung trailer with three outriggers. Two of them folded together for transportation, and two rubber wheels could be mounted. The outriggers could be adjusted in elevation to a limited extent to help place the mount in a horizontal position. The mount allowed for a 360° traverse and an elevation between 0° and 85°. The gun had a muzzle brake to reduce recoil, a hydro-pneumatic <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder</b> and a gas cylinder to aid the forward movement of the barrel at high elevations. In addition the mount had two heavy springs to counterbalance the barrel, as the entire barrel was mounted ahead of the pivots. It (the barrel), was 45 calibres long and had 28 grooves (rifling) twisting to the right - like the M/16's barrel. The breech block was also similar to the M/16: a semi-automatic horizontal wedge that the gunner had to open manually to remove the case from the previous shot, but which closed automatically on insertion of a new round.|$|E

5000|$|Early cannons were muzzle-loading, {{but were}} {{replaced}} later with breech-loading models. These {{are used in}} modern whaling, {{with the exception of}} many Norwegian cannons which utilize an improved muzzle-loading design, with a breech firing system. In the early 20th century, almost all cannons were similar to the Kongsberg 90 mm design. With a trigger mounted {{on the back of a}} steel handle which would lever a thin rod up to the firing device in the horizontally sliding breechblock. To load, the rear cover plate would be rotated, exposing the back of the rectangular breechblock. The breechblock would be opened by rotating a handle on the top of the breech, and the spent cartridge case removed, to be reloaded with powder and wadding. A new cartridge would be prepared and slid up into the firing chamber, the breechblock would be closed by rotating the handle counterclockwise, the rear cover would be rotated back to cover the rear chamber, a harpoon would be prepared, inserted into the muzzle, and tied on. Then another rotating handle on the side of the breechblock would be pulled back to cock the firing pin. This handle was directly adjacent to the firing trigger on the block. The gun was solid steel, and had a glycerin <b>recoil</b> <b>cylinder</b> mounted under the barrel. The inner barrel and breech would bounce back on the recoil, while the handle and swivel in the deck would be mounted on a stationary outer cylinder.|$|E
