25|$|Florida's Turnpike Enterprise is {{operating}} with an intelligent transportation systems (ITS), {{used to detect}} and manage incidents on the Enterprise's roadways. The ITS are managed by two traffic management centers (TMC), one located in Pompano Beach, and the other located in Ocoee, operated by Florida's Turnpike Enterprise 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The system, consisting of closed-circuit television (CCTV) traffic cameras, dynamic message signs (DMS), highway advisory radio (HAR), and <b>radar</b> <b>vehicle</b> detection system (RVDS), allow the TMC to see anything from congestion to crashes, to disabled vehicles that may {{pose a threat to}} the Turnpike's motorists. When necessary, the TMC will activate the dynamic message signs (DMS) and highway advisory radio stations (HAR) to alert motorists of the potential situation, as well as AMBER/Silver Alerts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{performance}} of clutter-cancellation GMTI (Ground Moving Target Indication) radar can suffer when observing uneven terrain when the array phase centers are not {{aligned with the}} <b>radar</b> <b>vehicle's</b> velocity vector. This type of phase center misalignment is present {{in a number of}} existing and proposed GMTI systems. A method for mitigating this problem using a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) for the terrain is described and demonstrated in this paper. The DEM is incorporated into the radar data {{in such a way that}} the nonstationarity caused by hilly terrain is greatly reduced, thus allowing reduced-order STAP (Space-Time Adaptive Processing) to be applied...|$|R
50|$|The Akash system {{meant for}} the Army uses the T-72 tank chassis for its {{launcher}} and <b>radar</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The Rajendra derivative for the Army is called the Battery Level Radar-III. The Air Force version uses an Ashok Leyland truck platform to tow the missile launcher, while the Radar is on a BMP-2 chassis and is called the Battery Level Radar-II. In either case, the launchers carry three ready-to-fire Akash missiles each. The launchers are automated, autonomous and networked to a command post and the guidance radar. They are slewable in azimuth and elevation. The Akash system can be deployed by rail, road or air.|$|R
