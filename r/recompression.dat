5|$|<b>Recompression</b> on air {{was shown}} to be an {{effective}} treatment for minor DCS symptoms by Keays in 1909. Evidence of the effectiveness of <b>recompression</b> therapy utilizing oxygen was first shown by Yarbrough and Behnke, and has since become the standard of care for treatment of DCS. <b>Recompression</b> is normally carried out in a <b>recompression</b> chamber. At a dive site, a riskier alternative is in-water <b>recompression.</b>|$|E

5|$|In-water <b>recompression</b> (IWR) is the {{emergency}} treatment of decompression sickness (DCS) by sending the diver back underwater {{to allow the}} gas bubbles in the tissues, which are causing the symptoms, to resolve. It is a risky procedure that should only be used {{when it is not}} practicable to travel to the nearest <b>recompression</b> chamber in time to save the victim's life.|$|E
500|$|The {{incidence}} of decompression sickness is rare, estimated at 2.8 cases per 10,000 dives, with the risk 2.6 times greater for males than females. DCS affects approximately 1,000 U.S. scuba divers per year. In 1999, the Divers Alert Network (DAN) created [...] "Project Dive Exploration" [...] {{to collect data}} on dive profiles and incidents. From 1998 to 2002, they recorded 50,150 dives, from which 28 <b>recompressions</b> were required — although these will almost certainly contain incidents of arterial gas embolism (AGE) — a rate of about 0.05%.|$|R
40|$|A device {{elaborated}} to soft recover brittle specimens {{loaded with}} a gas gun is presented. The target arrangement {{has been designed}} {{in order to minimize}} radial release waves in the specimen. A new design of projectile is proposed to avoid parasite <b>recompressions</b> due to further impacts. The optimization of the whole system has been achieved by means of an iterative approach based on both 2 D-calculations and experimentation. The efficiency of the system is demonstrated with the soft recovery of quartzite samples for projectile velocities up to 825 m/s...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of neutron bubble detectors (type BD- 100 R) {{have been investigated}} with fast neutrons from D-T and Am-Be sources. The experimentally determined responses of the bubble detectors have shown considerable fluctuations (up to 50 %). The response after repeated <b>recompressions</b> has been examined. The detectors proved to be insensitive to gammas. Measurements at various dose rates have been performed in comparison with TE chambers. Since the bubble detectors are easy to use without any power supply they may be suited for detection and location of fissionable material...|$|R
5|$|Oxygen {{first aid}} {{has been used}} as an {{emergency}} treatment for diving injuries for years. If given within the first four hours of surfacing, it increases the success of <b>recompression</b> therapy as well as decreasing the number of <b>recompression</b> treatments required. Most fully closed-circuit rebreathers can deliver sustained high concentrations of oxygen-rich breathing gas and {{could be used as a}} means of supplying oxygen if dedicated equipment is not available.|$|E

5|$|Bubbles do not redissolve {{immediately}} on <b>recompression,</b> {{and rates of}} gas uptake will alter from initial dive to repetitive dives, so repetitive dives must be handled differently in the mathematical model to predict safe decompression.|$|E
40|$|Part I: The role of bubble {{chambers}} in photoproduction {{studies is}} {{considered in the}} light of experimental problems, and arguments for use of heavy liquid chambers are presented. Successful operation of a small WF 6 chamber in conjunction with the C. I. T. electron synchrotron is described and experimental results are given. Design, construction and operation of a 12 inch hydrostatically supported bubble chamber for use with hydrocarbons, Freons, or WF 6 is described. The chamber is operated with a unique "resonant" expansion system employing large valves of a special design, resulting in a very fast operating cycle with small energy input. Part II: The mechanism of formation and growth of bubbles in a bubble chamber is investigated, and the results of calculations concerning growth and collapse in propane are given. Mechanisms which have been proposed dealing with the nucleation of bubbles by charged particles are examined with the intention of determining their probable validity, and the influence of some additional processes is discussed. A technique is suggested which may allow construction of large bubble chambers, particularly of the heavy liquid variety, with very fast expansions and <b>recompressions,</b> or very rapid cycling rates...|$|R
40|$|Gasoline {{partially}} premixed combustion (PPC) has {{the potential}} of high efficiency and simultaneous low soot and NOx emissions. Running the engine in PPC mode with high octane number fuels has the advantage of a longer premix period of fuel and air which reduces soot emissions. The problem is the ignitability at low load and idle operating conditions. In a previous study it was shown {{that it is possible to}} use NVO to improve combustion stability and combustion efficiency at operating conditions where available boosted air is assumed to be limited. NVO has the disadvantage of low net indicated efficiency due to heat losses from <b>recompressions</b> of the hot residual gases. An alternative to NVO is the rebreathing valve strategy where the exhaust valves are reopened during the intake stroke. The net indicated efficiency is expected to be higher with the rebreathing strategy but the question is if similar improvements in combustion stability can be achieved with rebreathing as with NVO. The results show that the rebreathing valve strategy has similar improvements on combustion stability as NVO when the same fuel injection strategy is used. This work also includes results with the NVO valve strategy where a fuel injection is added during the NVO. When a fuel injection is added during the NVO, an additional improvement on combustion stability can be seen which is unmatched by the rebreathing valve strategy...|$|R
40|$|In {{this this}} work, {{supersonic}} hydrogen combustion in the Hyshot II scramjet engine is investigated. In particular, fundamental physics of mixing, combustion and vorticity generation {{as well as}} the interaction between shock waves, boundary layer and heat release are analyzed by means of 3 D Large Eddy Simulations (LES) using detailed chemistry. Results show very complex structures due to the interaction between the four sonic H(2) crossflow injections and the airstream flowing at M = 2. 79. A bow shock forms ahead of each H(2) injector: the interaction between bow shocks and boundary layers leads to separation zones where H(2) recirculates. In these recirculation zones, OH radicals are produced, indicating that a flame already starts upstream of the injectors and downstream of the flow separation. The formation of barrel shocks due to the H(2) expansion and <b>recompressions</b> is also predicted. Comparison of pressure distribution along the wall centreline at 1. 3 ms shows agreement with experimental results, mostly {{in the first part of}} the combustor, where the grid is very fine. The combustion is very fast and efficient: only 12. 35 % of hydrogen is found unburned at the combustor exit. This confirms that burning hydrogen is efficient and feasible also in supersonic flows and therefore it is a good candidate for hypersonic airbreathing applications.

5|$|Therapeutic <b>recompression</b> is {{a medical}} {{procedure}} for treatment of decompression sickness, and is followed by decompression, usually to a relatively conservative schedule.|$|E
5|$|If a {{decompression}} chamber is available, omitted decompression may {{be managed}} by chamber <b>recompression</b> to an appropriate pressure, and decompression following either a surface decompression schedule or a treatment table. If the diver develops symptoms in the chamber, treatment can be started without further delay.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation of the performance of the Chemical Kinetics Shock tube at the Indian Institute of Science. The one-dimensional Lagrangian code L 1 d of Jacobs (1998) has been used to simulate the tube at several operating conditions. The conditions have different shock tube filling pressures, resulting in different shock speeds and different tube lengths, resulting in different dwell times. The simulations have been performed both with and without viscous effects simulated in the tubes. At the lowest shock tube filling pressure condition, the shock tube operates in an overtailored mode and it is undertailored at the higher filling pressure conditions. The results show that viscous effects, which lead to attenuation of the primary shock and heat loss from the test gas to the tube walls, result in an increasing p 5 pressure during the test time. The viscous effects are more dominant at the condition with the lowest filling pressure (highest primary shock speed). A simulation run for 50 ms after diaphragm rupture or the configuration with a long driver tube shows that the test gas is periodically re-compressed by reflections of waves along the driver and shock tubes. The <b>recompressions</b> become sequentially weaker and thus the test gas temperature and pressure are never raised to as high levels as for the primary compression...|$|R
5|$|The medical {{aspects of}} diving and {{hyperbaric}} exposure include examination of divers to establish medical fitness to dive, {{diagnosis and treatment}} of diving disorders, treatment by <b>recompression</b> and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, toxic effects of gases in a hyperbaric environment, and treatment of injuries incurred while diving which are not directly associated with depth or pressure.|$|E
5|$|Historically, in-water <b>recompression</b> was {{the usual}} method of {{treating}} decompression sickness in remote areas. Procedures were often informal and based on operator experience, and used air as the breathing gas as it {{was all that was}} available. The divers generally used standard diving gear, which was relatively safe for this procedure, as the diver was at low risk of drowning if he lost consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Immediate {{treatment}} with 100% oxygen, followed by <b>recompression</b> in a hyperbaric chamber, will {{in most cases}} result in no long-term effects. However, permanent long-term injury from DCS is possible. Three-month follow-ups on diving accidents reported to DAN in 1987 showed 14.3% of the 268 divers surveyed had ongoing symptoms of Type II DCS, and 7% from Type I DCS. Long-term follow-ups showed similar results, with 16% having permanent neurological sequelae.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{medicine}} is the diagnosis, treatment {{and prevention of}} conditions caused by exposing divers to the underwater environment. It includes the effects {{on the body of}} pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how fitness to dive affects a diver's safety. Hyperbaric {{medicine is}} another field associated with diving, since <b>recompression</b> in a hyperbaric chamber with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, DCS and arterial gas embolism.|$|E
5|$|M.P. Spencer {{showed that}} Doppler {{ultrasonic}} methods can detect venous bubbles in asymptomatic divers, and Dr Andrew Pilmanis showed that safety stops reduced bubble formation. In 1981 D.E. Yount described the Varying Permeability Model, proposing a mechanism of bubble formation. Several other bubble models followed. The pathophysiology of DCS {{is not yet}} fully understood, but decompression practice has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by therapeutic <b>recompression</b> and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Mixed breathing gases are used to reduce {{the effects of the}} hyperbaric environment on ambient pressure divers.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{decompression}} sickness after diving {{can be managed}} through effective decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon, though it remains to some degree unpredictable. Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers almost universally use decompression tables or dive computers to limit or monitor their exposure and to control their ascent speed and decompression procedures. If DCS is contracted, it is usually treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a <b>recompression</b> chamber. If treated early, there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} in the North Sea {{have shown that the}} overall incidence of decompression sickness for in-water and surface decompression is similar, but surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II (neurological) DCS than in-water decompression. A possible explanation is that during the final stage of ascent, bubbles are produced that are stopped in the lung capillaries. During <b>recompression</b> of the diver in the deck chamber, the diameter of some of these bubbles is reduced sufficiently that they pass through the pulmonary capillaries and reach the systemic circulation on the arterial side, later lodging in systemic capillaries and causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth profile diving or multiple repetitive diving.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected {{if any of}} the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. The diagnosis is confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by <b>recompression.</b> Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that <b>recompression</b> could relieve the symptoms, further work showed {{that it was possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|A second {{scenario}} considers pressure increases during decompression {{that reduce}} bubble diameters. This can allow bubbles {{trapped in the}} lung during a normal decompression to suddenly pass through the capillaries and become responsible for Type II DCS symptoms. This could explain the difference in outcomes of in-water decompression versus surface decompression. Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall incidence rate of the two diving methods is about the same, that surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II DCS than in-water decompression. It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface, bubbles are produced that are trapped by the lung capillaries, and on <b>recompression</b> of the diver in the deck chamber, these bubbles are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side, later causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{underwater}} {{requires that}} the diver {{be brought to the}} surface as soon as practicable. Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to the danger of arterial gas embolism (AGE), {{there is some evidence that}} the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway. This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society that a diver should be raised during the seizure's clonic (convulsive) phase if the regulator is not in the diver's mouth– as the danger of drowning is then greater than that of AGE– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the clonic phase otherwise. Rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure that where the victim's air supply is established it is maintained, and carry out a controlled buoyant lift. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most diver training agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention. The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a <b>recompression</b> chamber is not immediately available.|$|E
25|$|Six IWR {{treatment}} tables {{have been}} published in the scientific literature. Each of these methods have several commonalities including the use of a full face mask, a tender to supervise the diver during treatment, a weighted <b>recompression</b> line and a means of communication. The history of the three older methods for providing oxygen at 9msw (30fsw) was described in great detail by Drs. Pyle and Youngblood. The fourth method for providing oxygen at 7.5msw (25fsw) was described by Richard Pyle at the 48th Annual UHMS Workshop on In-water <b>Recompression</b> in 1999. The Clipperton method involves <b>recompression</b> to 9msw (30fsw) while the Clipperton(a) rebreather method involves a <b>recompression</b> to 30msw (98fsw).|$|E
25|$|The Australian IWR Tables were {{developed}} by the Royal Australian Navy in the 1960s in response to their need for treatment in remote locations far away from <b>recompression</b> chambers. It was the shallow portion of the table developed for <b>recompression</b> chamber use.|$|E
25|$|A <b>recompression</b> chamber may be {{included}} in the system so that divers can be given treatment for decompression sickness without inconveniencing the rest of the occupants. The <b>recompression</b> chamber may also be used as an entry lock, and to decompress occupants who may need to leave before scheduled.|$|E

Their decompression lasted five hours leaving Nohl with a mild case of decompression sickness that resolved with <b>recompression.</b>|$|E

Their decompression lasted five hours leaving Nohl with a mild case of decompression sickness that resolved with <b>recompression.</b>|$|E
25|$|Therapeutic <b>recompression</b> {{is usually}} also {{provided}} in a hyperbaric chamber. It is the definitive treatment for decompression sickness {{and may also}} be used to treat arterial gas embolism caused by pulmonary barotrauma of ascent. In emergencies divers may sometimes be treated by in-water <b>recompression</b> if a chamber is not available and suitable diving equipment to reasonably secure the airway is available.|$|E

25|$|The active {{ingredient}} sodium sulfate is commonly utilized {{in the manufacture}} of household cleaners and detergents. Sodium sulfate is a product of ethanol evaporation and crystallization. Crystallization is a separation process where mass transfer and heat remove solids from a solution (such as an ethanol mixture) resulting in high-purity crystalline structures. There are many methods of evaporation to achieve this desired effect: multiple effect evaporation, thermal vapor <b>recompression</b> and mechanical vapor <b>recompression</b> evaporation.|$|E
