5000|$|Although {{there are}} {{contemporary}} reports confirming that Herrold was making experimental audio transmissions {{as early as}} 1909, the best evidence is that it wasn't until July 1912 when he began making <b>regular</b> <b>broadcasts.</b> These weekly programs are generally accepted as being the first <b>regular</b> entertainment <b>broadcasts</b> made by radio.

25|$|Rather than {{give in to}} NBC's demands, Young {{decided not}} to renew channel 4's {{affiliation}} contract, which was set to expire {{at the beginning of}} 2002. San Jose-based KNTV (channel 11)—which joined The WB (in conjunction with that network's existing Bay Area affiliate, then co-owned KBWB channel 20, now KOFY-TV) in 1999, after it agreed to drop its ABC affiliation at the behest of network-owned KGO-TV—later approached NBC with a proposal to pay $37 million annually for the rights to broadcast its programming. The network accepted the deal in February 2000, though as late as 2001, NBC was attempting to purchase KRON from Young. Young's asking price for the station was $735 million, which NBC deemed too high and would not accept. Young's refusal to lower the price led to the deal's collapse. In December 2001, NBC purchased KNTV from Granite Broadcasting for a fraction of KRON's sale price—$230 million—making NBC the only major broadcast network to have switched from one Bay Area station to another. The last NBC program to be broadcast by channel 4 was a repeat episode of Crossing Jordan, at 10:00p.m. on December 31, 2001. KNTV officially joined NBC later that evening at 11:35p.m (the <b>regular</b> <b>broadcast</b> of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno), ending KRON-TV's 52-year affiliation with the network.|$|E
