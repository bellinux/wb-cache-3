40|$|This Comment {{analyzes}} Wisconsin’s {{application of}} the business <b>records</b> <b>exception</b> when a litigant seeks the admission of third-party records. In 2010, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, in Palisades Collection LLC v. Kalal, applied a narrow interpretation of the exception’s requirements that stands in contrast to manner in which federal jurisdictions apply the exception in the same context. This Comment addresses {{the question of whether}} Wisconsin’s narrower construction of the exception is the best approach to the evidentiary rule. In doing so, this Comment first reviews the federal business <b>record</b> <b>exception,</b> its requirements, and federal courts’ treatment of the foundational requirement for third-party records. This Comment then does the same for the Wisconsin exception, discussing the challenges and harms created by Wisconsin’s narrow approach. Finally, it suggests that Wisconsin adopt an approach similar to that {{of a growing number of}} federal courts...|$|R

2500|$|The Court {{rejected}} Massachusetts' {{claim that}} the forensic affidavits met the business <b>records</b> <b>exception</b> to the hearsay rule. [...] A business document will be inadmissible under the exception when [...] "calculated for use essentially in the court, not in the business." [...] The Court analyzed the narrow exception of a clerk certificate authenticating official records. [...] This certificate was limited in that it could only claim {{the authenticity of the}} record as official, but speak nothing of its contents. [...] The Court drew a distinction between this exception and the case before it. [...] The forensic analyst was creating a record whereas the clerk was authenticating a record already in existence. [...] Finally, it explained the relationship between the Confrontation Clause and the Business <b>Records</b> <b>Exception.</b> [...] Citing Crawford, the court stated that most business records will escape Sixth Amendment scrutiny not because they meet the exception to the hearsay rule, but because they are non-testimonial in nature. [...] A record prepared in the ordinary course of business will necessarily not have been created for the purpose of proving a fact at trial.|$|R

Drafted as a 17-year-old cantonist, he became an officer in 1873.

25|$|Business records exception: {{business}} records created during the {{ordinary course of business}} are considered reliable and {{can usually be}} brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone with knowledge of the records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as substantive evidence against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the Business <b>Records</b> <b>exception.</b> Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is admissible under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John's speed with radar, records the speed in an incident report. He also calibrates and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be admissible as it pertained to the facts of the case. However, the officer's daily log in which he records his calibration and the daily diagnostics of his radar unit would be admissible under the business <b>records</b> <b>exception.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{business}} records have specified retention periods based on legal requirements and / or internal company policies. This {{is important because}} in many countries (including the United States) many documents may be {{required by law to}} be disclosed to government regulatory agencies or to the general public. Likewise, they may be discoverable if the business is sued. Under the business <b>records</b> <b>exception</b> in the Federal Rules of Evidence, certain types of {{business records}}, particularly those made and kept with regularity, may be considered admissible in court despite containing hearsay.|$|R

40|$|The Consumer Protection Clinic of the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, filed a Motion to Participate and an Amicus Brief in {{the case}} of Townsend v. Midland Funding, LLC. The case {{presents}} the question of whether documents created by third party predecessors in interest—usually a bank—may be admitted into evidence when a debt buyer plaintiff does not demonstrate personal knowledge regarding any of the foundational elements which would be required to admit the documents under the business <b>records</b> <b>exception</b> to the hearsay rule. Amici urge the Court to overturn the lower court, and hold that a debt buyer’s documents may not be admitted into evidence without the debt buyer first laying the proper foundation for the business <b>records</b> <b>exception</b> to the hearsay rule. The Clinic was joined by AARP, the National Consumer Law Center, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, and by the Maryland Legal Aid Bureau and Maryland 2 ̆ 7 s Public Justice Center. The Brief deals with the problems of data integrity and the lack of competent, reliable evidence in lawsuits filed purchasers of charged off credit card debt, known as 2 ̆ 2 debt buyers. 2 ̆ 2 The Consumer Protection Clinic and other amici examine due process and professionalism concerns which arise when our courts (primarily Maryland 2 ̆ 7 s District Court) do not strictly apply the special evidentiary and procedural rules which exist for small claims actions...|$|R

50|$|The phalanx {{formed the}} core of ancient Greek militaries. Because hoplites were all {{protected}} by their own shield and others’ shields and spears, they were relatively safe {{as long as the}} formation didn't break. When advancing towards an enemy, the phalanx would break into a run that was sufficient to create momentum but not too much as to lose cohesion. The opposing sides would collide viciously, possibly terrifying many of the hoplites of the front row. The battle would then rely on the valour {{of the men in the}} front line, while those in the rear maintained forward pressure on the front ranks with their shields. When in combat, the whole formation would consistently press forward trying to break the enemy formation; thus, when two phalanx formations engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match, in which, as a rule, the deeper phalanx would almost always win, with few <b>recorded</b> <b>exceptions.</b>|$|R

40|$|To be {{admissible}} {{under the}} hearsay rule's business <b>records</b> <b>exception</b> {{set out in}} Federal Rule of Evidence 803 (6), the record in question must have been “kept in the ordinary course of a regularly conducted business activity. ” Many electronic records, however, remain in a company's files only because the company had a duty to preserve them once it reasonably anticipated litigation or a government subpoena. The company otherwise typically would have deleted those electronically stored data in the regular operation of its business to make room on its burdened servers. This Article argues that such presumptive deletion undermines the trustworthiness and reliability of a business record, and thus the rationale of Rule 803 (6). Courts should therefore focus on the unique elements of the creation and preservation of electronic evidence, and consider whether a company truly kept the record at issue {{in the course of}} business, or simply because a duty to preserve required it...|$|R

Villaviencio-Garayzar (1996) described a 3.6 m (11.8 ft) female from the Gulf of California that contained [...] "hundreds of ova" [...] in her right ovary, which would support the embryos being oophagous.

With a few <b>recorded</b> <b>exceptions,</b> juveniles are found in deep water and only adults are present above a depth of 200 m (660 ft); this may serve to reduce predation on young individuals by large, shallow-water predators such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Males mature at a length of 2.0 - 2.5 m (6.6 - 8.2 ft) and females at a length of 3.0 - 3.5 m (9.4 - 11.5 ft). Faint scars seen on some individuals may be related to courtship.|$|R
