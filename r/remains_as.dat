5|$|Four bronze {{tables are}} located outside The Exchange on Corn Street, {{probably}} modelled after mobile tables which {{were taken to}} trade fairs and markets. Before the Corn Exchange {{was built in the}} 18th century, the tables—called nails—were located in the Tolzey Walk. This covered area was along the south wall of All Saints Church, which <b>remains</b> <b>as</b> a narrow lane giving access to commercial premises.|$|E

The village government and school eventually reached a compromise.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt <b>remains</b> <b>as</b> to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it <b>remains</b> <b>as</b> a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E

5|$|Before {{developing}} the route west of Aspen, the state turned its attention the other way. In 1927 it rebuilt the old stage road over Independence Pass to Twin Lakes and designated {{it part of}} Highway 82, closing it in winters to avoid the maintenance costs. Most of it followed the original route; however in some places it deviated. The largest section of the original remains three miles (5km) below the pass on the east approach. The foundation of the gatekeeper's house <b>remains,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as some of}} the original toll gate.|$|E
5|$|Bivalve fossils {{are formed}} when the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by the valves <b>remains</b> <b>as</b> the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.|$|E

5|$|Erythranthe, the monkey-flowers and musk-flowers, is {{a diverse}} plant genus {{with at least}} 111 members (as of 2017) in the family Phrymaceae.

Diplacus was segregated from Mimulus as a separate genus at the same time. Mimulus <b>remains</b> <b>as</b> a small genus of eastern North America and the Southern Hemisphere. Molecular data show Erythranthe and Diplacus to be distinct evolutionary lines that are distinct from Mimulus as strictly defined.|$|E

Favre started every Green Bay Packers game from September 20, 1992 to January 20, 2008, a streak of 297 games, which <b>remains</b> <b>as</b> the all-time record for consecutive starts in the NFL.|$|E
5|$|From 1902 to 1929 Real won the Copa del Rey {{five times}} and the {{regional}} championship 15 times. Real Madrid had a successful start in La Liga, finishing second in the competition's first season, and winning the league in 1932 for the first time. In the 1947–48 season, Real Madrid finished eleventh, which <b>remains,</b> <b>as</b> of 2014, the club's lowest finishing position. Real Madrid won La Liga four {{times and the}} European Cup five times during the 1950s. However, the most successful period for the club in terms of domestic titles was the 1960s, when Real Madrid won eight league championships. It is also the only Spanish football team to win five consecutive titles, a feat which it has achieved on two occasions (1960–65 and 1985–90).|$|E

5|$|In {{identifying}} the <b>remains</b> <b>as</b> those of Palaeoscincus, Broom initially classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement {{backed by the}} research of Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a more recent 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E
5|$|K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' died between AD435 and AD437. In 1995 a tomb {{underneath}} the talud-tablero Hunal temple {{was discovered by}} a team of archaeologists led by Robert Sharer and David Sedat. The tomb contained the skeleton of an elderly man with rich offerings and evidence of battle wounds. The remains have been identified as those of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' due to their location underneath a sequence of seven buildings erected in his honor. Bone analysis has identified the <b>remains</b> <b>as</b> being those of someone foreign to Copán.|$|E
