40|$|The {{processing}} of cassava becoming tapioca flour will produce solid fiber waste called as onggok. Onggok {{can be used}} as raw material for making onggok flour. One of the processing steps on the producing of onggok flour is drying. In common practice, solar dryer is used but it takes long time and strongly depends on weather. The hybrid dryer (solar electrical energy), solar <b>radiation</b> <b>dryer,</b> and electrical dryer would be used in this research. The aims of this study were to determine and to compare whiteness degree, the degree of acidity (pH), and the characteristics of onggok flour (color and aroma) and its organoleptic justification of onggok flour dryed by the three different drying methods. The results showed that drying process under solar <b>radiation</b> <b>dryer</b> produced onggok flour at better color compared with the others, drying process using electrical dryer produced onggok flour at better aroma compared with the others, the best product based on organoleptic tests was onggok flour dried by electrical dryer with color criteria a little white, the aroma criteria slightly cassava aromaed, and overall acceptance a bit like...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{researched}} {{the best possible}} operating conditions of a test dryer and the mild drying technique for preserving fresh tomato flavour. Fresh flavour is the one with more green notes and less heat-induced notes. Three different type of test dryers, namely a convective dryer (Heat Pump Dehumidifier, HPD), a conduction and infra-red <b>radiation</b> <b>dryer</b> (Refractance Window Dryer, RWD), and a microwave <b>radiation</b> <b>dryer</b> (Microwave Vacuum Dryer, MWVD) were chosen {{as a representative of}} differing principles of heat transfer. Control dryers based on commercial tomato products were also chosen, the freeze dryer (FD), spray dryer (SPD) as a basis for comparison of the flavour quality. A thin layer model was developed to predict the drying behaviour of tomato pulp and energy modelling was used with the RWD. For the RWD, conduction and evaporation were proved to be the dominant mechanisms of heat gain and heat loss from the product, respectively. The radiation effect was found to be negligible, so disproving the concept of RWD. With the HPD, a preliminary lipoxygenase inactivation model was employed to understand the low temperature drying effect on the flavour producing enzyme. Volatile and non-volatile flavour measurements were carried out for all the test dried samples. FD and HPD- dried tomatoes of the same cultivar were not significantly different from each other. Generally, acid concentration increased while sugar concentration decreased with increased thermal processing. Microwave vacuum drying operated under high vacuum of 0. 1 mbar (also called as microwave freeze drying) produced the best flavour quality, followed by HPD. An integrated approach of instrumental and sensory analysis was adopted to investigate the drying impact on the stability of flavour compounds and their associated sensory attributes. The volatile and sensory profiles of HPD- and FD-dried tomatoes were comparable, whereas loss of compounds contributing to fresh green aroma and presence of heat-induced compounds contributing to a cooked aroma were detected in the SPD-dried tomatoes and paste. Volatiles were found to be a good marker than non-volatiles. They were highly significant for discriminating the sensory attributes of processed tomatoes, allowing a better insight into the development of mild drying techniques...|$|E
40|$|Infrared (IR) dryers {{are widely}} used in the paper {{industry}} for drying coated paper grades. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the efficiency of IR dryers. This study was undertaken to investigate the radiation efficiency and the total efficiency of electric IR <b>dryers.</b> <b>Radiation</b> efficiency was measured in the laboratory and on an industrial machine. The results indicate that radiation efficiency increases with increasing power and is just above 60 % at full power. Total efficiency—the fraction of supplied power that {{ends up in the}} paper web—was measured on a small off-machine coater. The results indicate a total efficiency of approximately 40 %. Problems and experimental techniques are discussed, and recommendations for future evaluations are presented...|$|R
40|$|Efficiency of a far-infrared <b>radiation</b> (FIR) <b>dryer</b> for drying {{of citrus}} {{by-products}} (CBPs) was evaluated through their antioxidant activities. The CBPs dried through FIR were enzymatically digested by six carbohydrases (AMG, Celluclast, Pectinase, Termamyl, Ultraflo and Viscozyme) to prepare digests {{for evaluation of}} the activities. The total polyphenolic and total flavonoid contents of the digests were determined by colorimetric assays. The AMG digest was selected for the further experiments. The antioxidant potential of the digests were evaluated by DPPH, superoxide, hydroxyl and alkyl radical scavenging activities, H 2 O 2 scavenging activity, metal chelating, lipid perox-idation inhibition and the reduction of DNA damage. The AMG digest from CBPs dried through FIR at 50 oC showed strong antioxidant activities in DPPH, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, alkyl and metal chelating assays while all the digests showed strong lipid peroxidation activities. Further, enzymatic digests showed remarkable inhibitory activities against H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage. Hence, the data obtained using different in vitro models clearly established the antioxidant potential of enzymatic digests from CBPs dried through FIR. Furthermore, {{they can be used}} as a source of natural antioxidants; hence, far-infrared radiation drying is a viable method for trans-forming wet CBPs into a dried form without destroying the bioactive components...|$|R
