In a multi-project context within enterprise networks, reaching feasible {{solutions to the}} multi-project (re) scheduling problem represents a major challenge, where autonomy and decentralization of the environment favor agent-based simulation This work presents and validates a simulation-based multi-agent model using the fractal company concept to solve the complex multi-project (re) scheduling problem in enterprise networks. The proposed agent-based model is tested trough a set of project instances that vary in project structure, project parameters, number of resources shared, unplanned events that affect them, etc. Results obtained are assessed through different scheduling goals, such project total duration, project total cost, <b>leveling</b> <b>resource</b> usage, among others to show that decoupled learning rules allows finding a solution which {{can be understood as}} a Nash equilibrium for the interacting agents and it is far better compared to the ones obtained with existing approaches.

40|$|In this study, the Single Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (SRCPSP) is considered. This problem {{involves}} scheduling {{the project}} activities by <b>leveling</b> <b>resource</b> utilization with constraints: limited resource availability and project due date. We {{would like to}} provide an efficient searching methodology for solving SRCPSP. A Tabu Search (TS) based procedure was proposed as an intelligent search technique for this problem. TS is used in combination with some heuristic rules {{in order to find}} the "best" solution within a limited number of search steps. Since our goal is searching an "as good as possible" solution instead of an optimal solution, {{there is no guarantee that}} the "best" solution here is indeed the optimal solution. The heuristics that used in the model are serial heuristics. They are the different combinations of MAXSLK (maximum slack), LRD (least resource demand) and RANDOM (random). Six problems, which were also used by Boctor (1990), with different resource constraints were tested by the proposed procedure. In general, the proposed model successfully produced quick, high-quality solutions...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{allocation}} is {{the process}} of assigning resources to tasks throughout the life of a project. Despite sophisticated software packages devoted to keeping track of tasks, resources and resource assignments, it is often the case that project managers find some resources over-allocated and therefore unable to complete the assigned work in the allotted amount of time. Most scheduling software has provisions for <b>leveling</b> <b>resources,</b> but the techniques for doing so simply add time to the schedule and may cause delays in tasks that are critical to the project in meeting deadlines. This paper presents a software application that ensures that resources are properly balanced {{at the beginning of the}} project and eliminates the situation in which resources become over-allocated. It can be used in a multi-project environment and reused throughout the project as tasks, resource assignments and availability, and the project scope change. The application utilizes the bounded enumeration technique to formulate an optimal schedule for which both the task sequence and resource availability are taken into account. It is run on a database server to reduce the running time and make it a viable application for practitioners.

40|$|Many {{construction}} projects, such as highways, pipelines, tunnels, and high-rise buildings, contains {{activities that}} repeated at different locations. Research {{has shown that}} the Critical Path Method (CPM) is not efficient in scheduling linear construction projects that involve repetitive tasks. Since the early 1960 s many other techniques have been developed to schedule linear construction projects, such as the Line of Balance Method, the Vertical Production Method (VPM), and the Linear Scheduling Method (LSM). Although LSM has been regarded as a technique that provides significant advantages over CPM in linear construction projects, it has been mainly viewed as a graphical complement to CPM. There are two limitations that prohibit LSM being adopted and widely used in linear construction projects: (1) it is not as computational-ready as traditional network methods; and (2) studies with resource constraints are limited. This research addresses these two issues. ^ To overcome these limits, this research models the linear scheduling problems restricted by multiple resource constraints. It provides a quantitative analysis mechanism to the Linear Schedule Model. Two objective functions of the model, minimizing project duration and resource usage flucturation, achieves the goal of considering <b>resource</b> allocation and <b>leveling</b> simultaneously. A two-stage solution-finding procedure is established to solve the proposed problem. The first stage utilizes a heuristic multiple resource allocation algorithm to generate a feasible initial solution. The second stage incorporates the Simulated Annealing search technique with the heuristic resource allocation algorithm for improving the initial solution. Two example projects, a housing project and a highway pavement project, are studied and are both improved by shortening the project durations. ...|$|R
40|$|Reducing Emergency Department (ED) {{overcrowding}} in {{the hope}} of improving the ED's operational efficiency and health care delivery ranks high on every health care decision maker's wish list. The current study concentrates on developing efficient work shift schedules that make the best use of current resource capacity with the objectives of reducing patient waiting time and <b>leveling</b> <b>resource</b> utilization as much as possible. The study introduces two iterative heuristic algorithms, which combine simulation and optimization models for scheduling the work shifts of the ED resources: physicians, nurses and technicians. The algorithms are distinctive because they account for patients being treated by multiple care providers, possibly {{over the course of several}} hours, often with interspersed waiting. In such instances, patient arrival time is not a good indicator of when the various care providers are needed. The algorithms were tested using a detailed simulation based on data from five general hospital EDs. A patient's Length of Stay (LOS) is measured as the time a patient spends in the ED until being admitted to the hospital or discharged. The first algorithm achieved an average reduction of between 20 and 45 % in the total patient waiting time, which led to a reduction of between 7 and 17 % in the combined average patient LOS. By allowing a restructure of the ED resource capacities, the second algorithm achieved an average reduction of between 20 and 64 % in the total patient waiting time, leading to an 11 to 29 % reduction in the combined average patient LOS.

50|$|When using {{specially}} designed project software, leveling typically means resolving conflicts or over allocations {{in the project}} plan by allowing the software to calculate delays and update tasks automatically. Project management software leveling requires delaying tasks until resources are available. In more complex environments, resources could be allocated across multiple, concurrent projects thus requiring the process of <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> to be performed at company level.|$|E
5000|$|When {{performing}} {{project planning}} activities, the manager {{will attempt to}} schedule certain tasks simultaneously.

Project planning <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> is the process of resolving these conflicts. It {{can also be used to}} balance the workload of primary resources over the course of the projects, usually at the expense of one of the traditional triple constraints (time, cost, scope).|$|E
5000|$|Originally, the {{critical}} path method considered only logical dependencies between terminal elements. Since then, it has been expanded {{to allow for the}} inclusion of resources related to each activity, through processes called activity-based resource assignments and <b>resource</b> <b>leveling.</b> A resource-leveled schedule may include delays due to resource bottlenecks (i.e., unavailability of a resource at the required time), and may cause a previously shorter path to become the longest or most [...] "resource critical" [...] path. A related concept is called {{the critical}} chain, which attempts to protect activity and project durations from unforeseen delays due to resource constraints.|$|E
50|$|There are {{differences}} between Open Workbench and Microsoft Project. Chief {{among them is}} that Open Workbench schedules based on effort whereas MS Projects default scheduling method is based on duration, although the user can change the method to work (effort). In other words, in an Open Workbench plan, task schedule {{is driven by the}} number of hours each resource will work per week to cover the total number of hours required for the tasks; whereas Microsoft Project does the reverse by generating estimates for the resources based on the task duration rather than their work availability. For this reason, <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> is also different: Open Workbench will do it based on resource availability whereas MS Project will do it based on the next available block of time that fits the task.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Resource</b> <b>leveling</b> is {{also useful}} {{in the world of}} {{maintenance}} management. Many organizations have maintenance backlogs. These backlogs consist of work orders. In a [...] "planned state" [...] these work orders have estimates such as 2 electricians for 8 hours. These work orders have other attributes such as report date, priority, asset operational requirements, and safety concerns. These same organizations have a need to create weekly schedules. Resource-leveling can take the [...] "work demand" [...] and balance it against the resource pool availability for the given week. The goal is to create this weekly schedule in advance of performing the work. Without resource-leveling the organization (planner, scheduler, supervisor) is most likely performing subjective selection. For the most part, when it comes to maintenance scheduling, there is less, if any, task interdependence, and therefore less need to calculate critical path and total float.|$|E

30|$|These {{scheduling}} tools largely rely on heuristics in leveling {{resource in}} forward-pass scheduling; thus, in general, {{they do not}} yield the optimum solution {{in terms of the}} shortest project duration. In addition, the proposed <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> methods, though, do not necessarily optimize the allocation of resources so as to minimize the project duration. For example, a <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> may leave the project schedule unchanged even if a different resource allocation may result in a shorter or longer project schedule. Therefore, it is essential to use a more appropriate method, which considers project time, for leveling resources. In other words, both of the objectives, project time minimization and <b>resource</b> <b>leveling,</b> should be considered. To this purpose, a <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> index should be used in project scheduling, and in addition to project time, the mentioned index should be optimized.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{quantitative}} approach for construction pollution control {{that is based}} on construction <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> is presented. The parameters of construction pollution index (CPI), hazard magnitude (ih) are treated as a pseudo resource and integrated with a project’s construction schedule. When the level of pollution for site operations exceeds the permissible limit identified by a regulatory body, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) enhanced leveling technique is used to re-schedule project activities so that the level of pollution can be re-distributed and thus reduced. The GA enhanced <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> technique is demonstrated using 20 on-site construction activities in a project. Experimental results indicate that proposed GA enhanced <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> method performs better than the traditional <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> method used in MS Project©.

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} {{an extended}} <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> model that abstracts real life projects that consider specific work ranges for each resource. Contrary to traditional <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> problems this model considers scarce resources and multiple objectives: the minimization {{of the project}} makespan and the leveling of each resource usage over time. We formulate this model as a multiobjective optimization problem and we propose a multiobjective genetic algorithm-based solver to optimize it. This solver consists in a two-stage process: a main stage where we obtain non-dominated solutions for all the objectives, and a post processing stage where we seek to specifically improve the <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> of these solutions. We propose an intelligent encoding for the solver that allows including domain specific knowledge in the solving mechanism. The chosen encoding proves to be effective to solve leveling problems with scarce resources and multiple objectives. The outcome of the proposed solvers represent optimized trade-offs (alternatives) that can be later evaluated by a decision maker, this multi-solution approach represents an advantage over the traditional single solution approach. We compare the proposed solver with state-of-art <b>resource</b> <b>leveling</b> methods and we report competitive and performing results.
