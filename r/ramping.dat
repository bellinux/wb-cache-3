5|$|MiG-3 {{production}} at Zavod Nr. 1 {{had already been}} planned to be reduced from a NKAP order of 27 August that required the factory to produce 420 fighters in September, declining to 100 in December with Il-2 production <b>ramping</b> up to 250 in December while the former aircraft repair plant at Khodynka Aerodrome was {{to be transferred to}} the NKAP, redesignated as Zavod Nr. 165, and begin production of MiG-3s. The German advance disrupted these plans for Zavod 165 and it never produced a single MiG-3.|$|E
5|$|Hodgsen sold to Carling O'Keefe in 1979, who {{had been}} {{minority}} owners since 1976. The brewing company's total investment in the team was $5.8 million. At {{the time it was}} rapidly <b>ramping</b> up its sports sponsorship (it also owned the Quebec Nordiques before they moved from the World Hockey Association to the NHL) and would become a huge benefactor to the CFL itself, inking television rights deals that would reach $11 million annually by 1984. Reports at the time suggest the league became spoiled by the partnership and that when the money dried up in 1987, the transition was difficult. For the Argos, the Carling O'Keefe years were marked by their first modern-era Grey Cup in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The line {{begins at}} the four-tracked Jay Street–MetroTech station, where the IND Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue lines {{interchange}} and continue as the Culver and Fulton Street lines respectively. Running under Smith Street south of the station, the Culver tracks split into local and express tracks, with the two express tracks <b>ramping</b> down to the lower level of Bergen Street, while the local tracks merge with the IND Crosstown Line tracks from Hoyt-Schermerhorn Street before entering the upper level. Between Jay Street and Bergen Street, the line passes under both the IRT Eastern Parkway Line and the Fulton Line tracks curving east into Hoyt-Schermerhorn Street, requiring a deeper tunnel and extensive ventilation systems.|$|E

50|$|A yard <b>ramp,</b> {{sometimes}} called mobile yard <b>ramp</b> or container <b>ramp,</b> is a movable metal <b>ramp</b> for {{loading and unloading}} of shipping containers and vehicle trailers, {{without the need for}} permanent docking bays. A yard <b>ramp</b> is placed at the back of a vehicle to provide access for forklifts to ascend the <b>ramp,</b> quickly and safely into the container or truck body.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ramping</b> – <b>Ramping</b> is {{a feature}} of many {{electronic}} markers, where after {{a certain number of}} rapid shots or upon a threshold rate-of-fire being achieved by the player, the gun will begin firing faster than the trigger is being pulled. <b>Ramping</b> of rate of fire is prohibited or sharply limited at most paintball fields, however it is allowed in various tournament formats with specific rules governing when and how the marker may ramp.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} focuses {{primarily on}} the analysis of exit <b>ramp</b> performance related to safety and operations. The safety analysis focuses on the impacts of different exit <b>ramp</b> types for freeway diverge areas and different factors contributing to the crashes that occur on the exit <b>ramp</b> sections. The operational analysis is based mainly on simulations by TSIS-CORSIM. Different <b>ramp</b> effects and guidance for selecting optimal exit <b>ramp</b> type are concluded. Issues related to <b>ramp</b> sections and crossroad sections are also demonstrated. Minimum <b>ramp</b> length and minimum distance between <b>ramp</b> terminal and downstream or upstream intersections are calculated. The operational analysis was conducted to determine different <b>ramp</b> effects and to provide guidance for selecting optimal exit <b>ramp</b> type. Comparisons of the operational performance {{of different types of}} exit <b>ramps</b> are made to present a method for choosing the optimal one. Some methods of evaluation (MOEs) are used to approach this objective, such as number of lane changes, average speed, delay time, etc. Data collection at 24 sites in Florida was conducted, and traffic simulations by TSIS-CORSIM were applied for analysis. Mathematical models were built to evaluate different impacts of these <b>ramps</b> based on simulations. All impact analysis is concluded to summarize a model for optimal exit <b>ramp</b> selection. In addition to <b>ramp</b> type evaluation and selection, issues related to <b>ramp</b> section and crossroad section are demonstrated. Minimum <b>ramp</b> length and minimum distance between <b>ramp</b> terminal and downstream or upstream intersections are calculated...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ramps</b> — There are two types: US and UK <b>ramps.</b> The UK {{or short}} <b>ramps</b> are 264 lb and the US or long <b>ramps</b> are 400 lb. Each type {{provides}} {{an approach to}} the bridge, 7 are required at each end. UK <b>ramps</b> are used for single storey only.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>ramps</b> {{serve to}} correct these {{problems}} of <b>ramp</b> size, yet either run into critiques of functionality and limited archaeological evidence. There are zig-zagging <b>ramps,</b> straight <b>ramps</b> utilizing the incomplete {{part of the}} superstructure (Arnold 1991), spiraling <b>ramps</b> supported by the superstructure and spiraling <b>ramps</b> leaning on the monument as a large accretion are proposed. Mark Lehner speculated that a spiraling <b>ramp,</b> beginning in the stone quarry to the southeast and continuing around {{the exterior of the}} pyramid, may have been used. The stone blocks may have been drawn on sleds along the <b>ramps</b> lubricated by water or milk.|$|R

25|$|Using {{standard}} IC {{packaging and}} test facilities (called subcons in the IC industry) gives MEMS oscillators production scalability. These facilities {{are capable of}} large production volumes, often {{hundreds of millions of}} ICs per day. This capacity is shared across many IC companies, so <b>ramping</b> production volumes of specific ICs, or in this case specific MEMS oscillators, is a function of allocating standard production equipment. Conversely, quartz oscillator factories are single-function in nature, so that <b>ramping</b> production requires installing custom equipment, which is more costly and time consuming than allocating standard equipment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ramp</b> {{shooters}} are robots {{that use}} {{the height of the}} <b>ramp</b> to greatly reduce the distance that they must propel the ball. <b>Ramp</b> shooters drive up to their wall and fire balls through a high-mounted shooting mechanism that is statically aimed directly at the goal. <b>Ramp</b> shooters have a disadvantage from floor shooters as they must traverse the <b>ramp,</b> risking tipping, and can only shoot from one location {{directly in front of the}} goal. Defense against a <b>ramp</b> shooter is simply to sit in position on top of the <b>ramp,</b> or keep them from getting up the <b>ramp.</b>|$|R

5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both {{highways}} {{had crossed}} over themselves {{so that all}} through traffic was {{on the left side}} of the road with left-hand entrance/exit <b>ramps</b> connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover <b>ramp</b> interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn <b>ramps</b> and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several <b>ramps</b> have been completed, with the <b>ramp</b> from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 completed in September 2008, the <b>ramp</b> from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 completed in October 2008, the <b>ramp</b> from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the <b>ramp</b> from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The <b>ramps</b> from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the <b>ramp</b> from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the <b>ramp</b> from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these <b>ramps,</b> the project will also add four <b>ramps</b> to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|R

40|$|<b>Ramp</b> meters {{are special}} traffic signals {{at the end}} of a freeway on-ramp that {{regulate}} the flow of traffic onto the mainline. The main purpose of <b>ramp</b> meters is to keep the mainline of the freeway from becoming overly congested, and to maximize the efficient use of freeway capacity. The first use of <b>ramp</b> metering was in Chicago, in 1963, and today <b>ramp</b> meters are becoming more popular in both the US and in Europe. Although the original <b>ramp</b> metering controllers used pre-timed <b>ramp</b> meters, nearly all modern <b>ramp</b> metering algorithms are traffic responsive. Traffic responsive <b>ramp</b> meters can be divided into two categories: local or coordinated. Local <b>ramp</b> metering algorithms only take into account traffic conditions near a single <b>ramp,</b> while coordinated algorithms try to optimize traffic over an area. Four algorithms are evaluated in this thesis...|$|R

25|$|Other new {{technologies}} include 1 cycle throughput (2 cycles previously) of all 128-bit SSE instructions {{and a new}} power saving design. All components will run at minimum speed, <b>ramping</b> up speed dynamically as needed (similar to AMD's Cool'n'Quiet power-saving technology, as well as Intel's own SpeedStep technology from earlier mobile processors). This allows the chip to produce less heat, and consume as little power as possible.|$|E
25|$|When Baldwin {{emerged from}} {{bankruptcy}} in 1938 it underwent a drastic change in management. The new management revived their development efforts with diesel power {{but the company}} was already too far behind. In 1939 Baldwin offered its first standard line of diesel locomotives, all designed for yard service. By this time, GM-EMD was already <b>ramping</b> up production of diesel passenger locomotives and developing its first diesel road freight locomotive.|$|E

50|$|HOV lanes {{have also}} been added to highway onramps to bypass <b>ramp</b> meters, {{allowing}} HOV vehicles and buses to access the highway without queuing for the <b>ramp</b> meter. Such <b>ramp</b> lanes are known as HOV bypass <b>ramps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Parclo A2 and B2 {{configurations}} contain four <b>ramps.</b> On {{each side}} of the freeway there is a loop <b>ramp</b> and a directional <b>ramp.</b> In Parclo A2, the loop <b>ramps</b> serve as on-ramps and the directional <b>ramps</b> serve as off-ramps. In Parclo B2 the roles are reversed. Both on- and off-ramps require controlled intersections at the arterial road (sometimes loop and directional <b>ramps</b> from {{the same side of the}} freeway will utilize the same intersection).|$|R
25|$|More significantly, bit {{shifting}} {{allows one}} to compute the square (shift left by 1) or take the square root (shift right by 1). This leads to approximate computations of the square root; combined with the previous technique for taking the inverse, this allows the fast inverse square root computation, which was important in graphics processing in the late 1980s and 1990s. This can be exploited in some other applications, such as volume <b>ramping</b> in digital sound processing.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} money or {{materials}} in the universe is not fixed and, as such, the economy operates under supply and demand. Market manipulation is possible on a large scale, particular examples being <b>ramping</b> and bear raids. CCP does not issue refunds on in-game purchases. Hence, {{there is always the}} risk of certain types of confidence tricks or other scams. The economy is balanced by the automatic introduction of extra materials in underpopulated areas. This encourages a more even spread of players.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, TSMC {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the foundry industry for high-performance, low-power applications, leading major smartphone chip companies such as Qualcomm, Mediatek and Apple to place an increasing amount of orders. While the competitors in the foundry industry (primarily GlobalFoundries and United Microelectronics Corporation) have encountered difficulties <b>ramping</b> leading-edge 28nm capacity, the leading Integrated Device Manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications.|$|E
30|$|According to the {{difference}} of <b>ramp</b> directions, <b>ramp</b> events can be generally divided into two basic types: up-ramp and down-ramp [6]. The characteristic of the up-ramps is sharply increasing. Strong low pressure air systems (or cyclones), low-level jets, thunderstorms, wind gusts or similar atmospheric phenomena will induce up-ramps [7]. Likewise when the wind power suddenly drops or high speed gusts of wind make wind turbines reach cut-out limits (usually 22 ~ 25 m/s), wind turbines would be shut down for protecting themselves from damages. All this phenomena could induce down-ramps [8]. Down-ramps are the reverse physical process of up-ramps [9]. Based on the property of each <b>ramp</b> event, <b>ramp</b> events are parameterized by the following variables: <b>ramp</b> start time, <b>ramp</b> duration, <b>ramp</b> rate, <b>ramp</b> swing, and <b>ramp</b> end time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ramps</b> {{come in two}} styles—fold-up or in-floor—and two {{operating}} modes—manual or motorized. Fold-up <b>ramps</b> fold in {{half and}} stow upright next to the side passenger door in a side-entry configuration or inside the rear access doors in a rear-entry configuration. Fold-up <b>ramps</b> present a lower <b>ramp</b> angle than in-floor ramps; however, in side-entry configurations, {{they are in the}} way of the passenger entrance when stowed. In-floor <b>ramps</b> slide into a pocket underneath the vehicle's floor and are only available for side-entry configurations. Folding <b>ramps</b> are available in manual or motorized versions for both entry configurations. However, in-floor <b>ramps</b> are only available as motorized. Power applications may also have a “kneeling feature” that reduces the angle of the <b>ramp</b> by compressing the suspension of the van on the <b>ramp</b> side.|$|R
40|$|Devices for {{generating}} streamwise vorticity in a boundary includes {{various forms of}} vortex generators.

A flow channel is between the first <b>ramp</b> element and the second <b>ramp</b> element. The back ends of the <b>ramp</b> elements have a height greater than a height of the front ends, and the front ends of the <b>ramp</b> elements have a width greater than a width of the back ends...|$|R
