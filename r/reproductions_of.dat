Hollyer sold the reproductions both via printsellers around the country and directly via catalogue, and the print proved extremely popular.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to treat the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> {{manpower}} resources as a multiphase process occuring within a more general process <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> social productive forces. The <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> manpower resources consists of three phases: 1) production of manpower resources being composed of: a) bioäogical <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> able-bodied population and b) its social preparation for work; 2) distaibution and redistribution of these resources among different sectors of human activity; 3) their utilization in production of goods and services as well as in process of forming the manpower. The structure of and factors acting in each phase are analysed in following parts of the paper in order to indicate the crucial problems <b>of</b> planning the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> manpower resources. Potential structural imbalances between manpower needs and supply which can emerge on the stage of national plan elaboration and ways to overcome them are considered. Special attention is paid to interdependencies between the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> manpower resources and the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> means of production.

By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion.
