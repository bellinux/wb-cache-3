40|$|AbstractThe optimum loading for rotors has {{previously}} been found for hover, climb and wind turbine conditions; but, up to now, no one has determined the optimum <b>rotor</b> <b>loading</b> in descent. This could be an important design consideration for rotary-wing parachutes and low-speed descents. In this paper, the optimal loading for a powered rotor in descent is found from momentum theory based on a variational principle.

40|$|The {{research}} {{accomplished in}} the area of <b>rotor</b> <b>loads</b> over the last 13 to 14 years is reviewed. The start of the period examined is defined by the 1973 AGARD Milan conference and the 1974 hypothetical rotor comparison. The major emphasis of the review is research performed by the U. S. Army and NASA at their laboratories and/or by the industry under government contract. For the purpose of this review, two main topics are addressed: <b>rotor</b> <b>loads</b> prediction and means of <b>rotor</b> <b>loads</b> reduction. A limited discussion of research in gust loads and maneuver loads is included. In the area of <b>rotor</b> <b>loads</b> predictions, the major problem areas are reviewed including dynamic stall, wake induced flows, blade tip effects, fuselage induced effects, blade structural modeling, hub impedance, and solution methods. It is concluded that the capability to predict <b>rotor</b> <b>loads</b> has not significantly improved in this time frame. Future progress will require more extensive correlation of measurements and predictions to better understand the causes of the problems, and a recognition that differences between theory and measurement have multiple sources, yet must be treated as a whole. There is a need for high-quality data to support future research in <b>rotor</b> <b>loads,</b> but the resulting data base must not be seen as an end in itself. It will be useful only if it is integrated into firm long-range plans {{for the use of the}} data...|$|R

40|$|Control {{algorithms}} for <b>rotor</b> <b>load</b> mitigation {{are today}} generally adopted by industry. Most {{of them are}} based on the Coleman transformation, which is easy to implement and bears satisfactory results when the rotor is balanced. A multitude of causes, e. g., blade erosion, dirt, and especially pitch misalignment, may create significant imbalances. This gives birth to undesirable vibrations and reduced control performance in terms of load mitigation. In this paper, an alternative transformation is introduced, able to detect and quantify the <b>rotor</b> <b>load</b> harmonics due to aerodynamic imbalance. Next, a control algorithm, capable of targeting rotor imbalance itself and simultaneously lowering <b>rotor</b> <b>loads,</b> is presented.

The paper describes the design of a system controlling retreating blade stall, and the testing of the system on a model rotor in the wind tunnel. The control inputs considered are higher harmonic blade pitch changes at 2 P and 3 P, of amplitude and phase such that <b>rotor</b> <b>loading</b> is increased in the fore and aft portions of the rotor disk while <b>rotor</b> <b>loading</b> is reduced on the lateral portions.

40|$|The {{need of a}} {{continuous}} improvement in gas turbine efficiency for propulsion and power generation, {{as well as the}} more demanding operating conditions and power control required to these machines, still ask for great efforts in the design and analysis of the high pressure section of the turbo-expander. To get detailed insights and improve the comprehension of the flow physics, a wide experimental campaign has been performed {{in the last ten years}} at Politecnico di Milano on the unsteady aerodynamics of a high-pressure turbine stage considering several operating conditions. This paper presents and discusses the experimental results obtained for the stage operating with different expansion ratios and <b>rotor</b> <b>loading.</b> The turbine stage under study is representative of a modern high-pressure turbine and can be operated in both subsonic and transonic conditions. The experimental tools applied for the current research represents the state of the art when unsteady investigations are foreseen. The detailed flow field, the blade-rows interaction and the overall performance are described and discussed; efforts have been devoted to the discussion of the various contribution to the overall stage efficiency. The direct effects of the expansion ratio, affecting the Reynolds and the Mach numbers, have been highlighted and quantified; similarly, the indirect effects, accounting for a change in the <b>rotor</b> <b>loading,</b> have been commented and quantified as well, thanks to a dedicated set of experiments where different rotor loadings at the same expansion ratio have been prescribed...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} of blade-vortex interaction noise is highly {{sensitive to the}} blade-vortex missdistance and thus requires {{the knowledge of the}} vortex position relative to the blade interacting with it. The generally accepted solution to the problem is to apply either free-wake codes (vortex lattice methods) or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes, both of which are very time consuming, especially CFD. Prescribed wake codes are computationally faster in comparison, since they are based on steady rotor operational conditions only, but they are considered to be not accurate enough due to the prescription of the geometry based on a few general parameters. First, they lack any wake geometry response due to variations in <b>rotor</b> <b>loading</b> distributions at constant thrust caused by, e. g., non-uniformity of the aerodynamic environment in forward flight, elastic blade motion, or by any means of active control. Second, wake deflections due to the presence of the fuselage are ignored. This paper provides an approximate solution to both problems, based on simple momentum theory considerations for the first problem, and based on the displacement flow of the fuselage for the second. This provides extensions for any existing prescribed wake model to account for <b>rotor</b> <b>loading</b> distribution and fuselage effects on the prescribed wake geometry to a first order of accuracy, sufficient for the investigations of the sensitivity analysis of noise radiation due to variations of blade design or due to applications of active control...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to find and demonstrate a means of performing efficient finite-difference computations of <b>rotor</b> <b>loading</b> for a trimmed rotor in high-speed, advancing flight. The essence of the scheme that was developed is a loose-coupled iteration procedure between a finite difference and a comprehensive integral rotor code. The coupling involves a transfer of appropriate load and inflow data between the two codes such that consistency is maintained. Sample computations, including a limited comparison with model rotor data, are presented. The scheme converges rapidly. The finite-difference computation of one rotor revolution with this scheme may provide sufficient accuracy for many purposes...|$|E

40|$|Projection Moire Interferometry (PMI) {{has been}} used during wind tunnel tests to obtain azimuthally {{dependent}} blade bending and twist measurements for a 4 -bladed Active Twist Rotor (ATR) system in simulated forward flight. The ATR concept offers a means to reduce <b>rotor</b> vibratory <b>loads</b> and noise by using piezoelectric active fiber composite actuators embedded in the blade structure to twist each blade as they rotate throughout the rotor azimuth. The twist imparted on the blades for blade control causes significant changes in blade loading, resulting in complex blade deformation consisting of coupled bending and twist. Measurement of this blade deformation is critical in understanding the overall behavior of the ATR system and the physical mechanisms causing the reduction in <b>rotor</b> <b>loads</b> and noise. PMI is a non-contacting, video-based optical measurement technique capable of obtaining spatially continuous structural deformation measurements over the entire object surface within the PMI system field-of-view. When applied to rotorcraft testing, PMI {{can be used to}} measure the azimuth-dependent blade bending and twist along the full span of the rotor blade. This paper presents the PMI technique as applied to rotorcraft testing, and provides results obtained during the ATR tests demonstrating the PMI system performance. PMI measurements acquired at select blade actuation conditions generating minimum and maximum <b>rotor</b> <b>loads</b> are provided to explore the interrelationship between <b>rotor</b> <b>loads,</b> blade bending, and twist...|$|R
40|$|Deficits in <b>rotor</b> <b>load</b> {{prediction}} {{are often}} caused by inadequate modeling of structural blade dynamics. The elastic blade behavior {{needs to be}} validated as accurately as possible to predict <b>rotor</b> <b>loads</b> precisely. The structural blade dynamics of 1 -D and 3 -D finite element models in a multibody environment are investigated in terms of frequencies and aeroelastic behavior. Eigenfrequencies of the 1 st torsion mode and the 4 th flap mode of the reduced 3 -D blade model exhibit a stronger coupling than the 1 -D analysis prediction. The tightly coupled simulation with the advanced 1 -D beam chain modeling approach is used to investigate the aeroelastic behavior of the 7 A rotor in high-speed Forward flight. The potential of advanced rotor blade modeling in the multibody software SIMPACK in terms of <b>rotor</b> <b>loads</b> prediction is evaluated. In comparison to experimental data and the loose-coupling environment of ONERA (HOST-elsA), aerodynamical and structural loads are in good agreement. The characteristic 5 /rev elastic torsion behavior of the 7 A rotor blade has been captured leading to an improvement of the lift force prediction.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{interference}} {{between the}} main and tail rotor {{can have a}} strong negative influence on the flight mechanics of a conventional helicopter. Significant unsteadiness in the tail <b>rotor</b> <b>loading</b> is encountered under certain flight conditions, but {{the character of the}} unsteadiness can depend on the direction of rotation of the tail rotor. Numerical simulations, using Brown’s vorticity transport model, of the aerodynamic interaction between the main and tail rotors of a helicopter are presented for a range of forward and lateral flight trajectories. Distinct differences are predicted in the behavior of the system in left and right sideward flight that are consistent with flight experience that the greatest fluctuations in loading or control input are required in left sideways flight (for a counterclockwise rotating main rotor). These fluctuations are generally more extreme for a system with tail rotor rotating top-forward than top-aft. Differences are also exposed in the character of the lateral excitation of the system as forward flight speed is varied. The observed behavior appears to originate in the disruption of the tail rotor wake that is induced by its entrainment into the wake of the main rotor. The extent of the disruption is dependent on flight condition, and the unsteadiness of the process depends on the direction of rotation of the tail rotor. In intermediate-speed forward flight and right sideward flight, the free stream delays the entrainment of the tail rotor wake far enough downstream for the perturbations to the <b>rotor</b> <b>loading</b> to be slight. Conversely, in left sideward and quartering flight, the free stream confines the entrainment process close to the rotors, where it causes significant unsteadiness in the loads produced by the system...|$|E

A range of right angled ducts, which have a rim for a 90 ° exit angle, were modelled. As a result, the performance of right angled ducts has been characterised in inviscid flow. It was concluded that right angled ducts cannot match the performance of their associated ideal diffuser and that the optimum <b>rotor</b> <b>loading</b> for these turbines varies with the duct dimensions...|$|E
