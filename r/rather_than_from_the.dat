5|$|By {{the period}} of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian astronomers were making {{systematic}} observations of the positions and behavior of the planets. For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose above the horizon, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus {{was first}} {{described}} under its current binomial name by English ornithologist Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 work Ornithologia Britannica. The scientific name Falco peregrinus is a Medieval Latin phrase {{that was used}} by Albertus Magnus in 1225. The specific name taken {{from the fact that}} juvenile birds were taken while journeying to their breeding location <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nest, as falcon nests were difficult to get at. The Latin term for falcon, falco, is related to falx, the Latin word meaning sickle, in reference to the silhouette of the falcon's long, pointed wings in flight.|$|E
5|$|Since then, most criticisms and denials of {{evolution}} {{have come from}} religious groups, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scientific community. Although many religious groups have found reconciliation of their beliefs with evolution, such as through theistic evolution, other religious groups continue to reject evolutionary explanations in favor of creationism, {{the belief that the}} universe and life were created by supernatural forces. The U.S.-centered creation–evolution controversy has become a focal point of perceived conflict between religion and science.|$|E

5|$|That night, Black is {{kidnapped by}} the group of natives. He is taken to the sewers and forced to consume snake venom; he sees visions, but insists they are from his psychic gift <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> venom. He predicts that the native tribes will reunite and that the buffalo will return to New York. However, he is soon rescued by Michaels {{and a group of}} police, who place Reynard and his tribe under arrest. As the tribe—now reunited in police custody—are led away, a {{travelling}} rodeo loses track of four buffalo, which run free through the city streets.|$|E
5|$|The Rivers Agency {{concluded}} that the flooding was an extreme event, caused by weather that resulted in widespread flooding across Northern Ireland. The amount {{of water in the}} rivers exceeded the capacity of the flood defences and the natural river banks. They further {{concluded that}} the flooding was a result of overflow of the Shimna River into the Burren River catchment area through Islands Park, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Burren River itself.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa {{now turned}} to a more {{conventional}} story with Rhapsody in August—the director's first film fully produced in Japan since Dodeskaden over twenty years before—which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki {{at the very end}} of World War II. It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel, but the film's references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on 25 May that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United States, where the director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti-American sentiments, though Kurosawa rejected these accusations.|$|E

5|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{an excellent}} method for structure determination, {{although it has been}} difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X-ray diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September the frigate HMS Africaine {{arrived from}} Rodriguez, {{commanded}} by Captain Robert Corbet {{who had served}} in the raid on Saint Paul in 1809. Corbet was a deeply unpopular commander and when his frigate was attacked and captured by Bouvet's frigates at the Action of 13 September 1810, rumours spread that his death was the result or suicide or even murder, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battle. Rowley was able to recapture Africaine the following day, but the danger that Hamelin's ships posed to British frigates sailing independently was further emphasised at the Action of 18 September 1810, when HMS Ceylon was captured by Hamelin's flagship Vénus. Again, Rowley was able to recapture the British frigate and on this occasion the damage done to Vénus was so severe that she was unable to outrun Boadicea and she too was captured, with Hamelin on board.|$|E
5|$|Two {{terms are}} used in {{referring}} to a quark's mass: current quark mass refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while constituent quark mass refers to the current quark mass plus {{the mass of the}} gluon particle field surrounding the quark. These masses typically have very different values. Most of a hadron's mass comes from the gluons that bind the constituent quarks together, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy – more specifically, quantum chromodynamics binding energy (QCBE) – and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the hadron (see mass in special relativity). For example, a proton has a mass of approximately 938MeV/c2, of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks only contributes about 9MeV/c2; much of the remainder {{can be attributed to the}} field energy of the gluons. See Chiral symmetry breaking.|$|E

5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black {{was probably one of the}} first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> carbon itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} a sacramental rather than {{educational}} purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel {{would have been}} left on the high altar {{of the church and}} removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. It is significant that the Chronicles of Ulster state the book was stolen from the sacristy, where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> monastic library. Its design seems to take this purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above. The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page: aesthetics were given priority over utility.|$|E

25|$|King Sweyn enlisted {{priests and}} bishops from England <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Archbishopric of Bremen.
