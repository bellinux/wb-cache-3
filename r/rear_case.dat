The Volvo version {{kept the same}} package size as the J-type but with the updated 18 element freewheel and stronger splines through the planet carrier. The Gear Vendors U.S. version uses a larger 1.375 outer diameter output shaft for higher capacity and a longer <b>rear</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
50|$|One further upgrade made by Apple {{replaced}} the logic {{board and the}} <b>rear</b> <b>case</b> (to accommodate the different port configuration) {{with those of the}} Macintosh Plus, which change added built-in SCSI functionality and up to 4MB RAM. Because Apple's official upgrades were costly, many third-party manufacturers offered add-on SCSI cards, as well as RAM upgrades, to achieve the same functionality. The new ROM allowed the computer to run much newer system and application software, and, though it loaded more data into RAM, it only slightly decreased the amount of available memory - by 1.5K, leaving well over 370K available for applications.|$|E

50|$|Around 3 {{minutes and}} 45 seconds after {{taking off from}} Irkutsk, at an {{altitude}} of 4.000 ft, the engine no 2 suddenly failed. A destruction occurred on the engines air starter that did not shut down after the engine was started and continued to operate at high revs (over 40,000 rpm) with open air bleed valves from the engines. The rotating disk of the turbine then flew from the starter's compartment and entered the engine and compartment area. This ultimately led to the destruction of the left engine's fuel lines. The hydraulic system elements, broke through the <b>rear</b> <b>case</b> of the combustion chamber and left the engine. The fuel supply for the fuel injectors stopped, which led to the ignition of flames on the engine no 2. The engine no 2 burst into flames.|$|E
50|$|An {{updated version}} {{replaced}} the Mac 512K and debuted as the Macintosh 512K enhanced in April 1986. It {{differed from the}} original 512K in that it had an 800 kB floppy disk drive and the same improved ROM as the Macintosh Plus. With {{the exception of the}} new model number (M0001E), they were otherwise cosmetically identical. The stock 512K could also use an 800 kB floppy disk drive as well as the Hard Disk 20, the first hard disk manufactured by Apple exclusively for use with the 512K, but required a special system file (not required by the 512Ke) that loaded the improved ROM code into RAM, thus reducing the available RAM for other uses. Apple offered an upgrade kit which replaced the floppy disk drive and ROMs essentially turning it into a 512Ke. One further OEM upgrade replaced the logicboard and the <b>rear</b> <b>case</b> entirely with that of the Macintosh Plus.|$|E

50|$|The organ {{was built}} by Martin Goetze and Dominic Gwynn, and {{was based on the}} 18th-century organs of English {{builders}} such as Bernard Smith. The design of the case was based in part on the case of an organ formerly in Lincoln Cathedral and dating from 1662. It has carved details by Nick Hunter, based on the organ at Framlingham, Suffolk, and other Renaissance examples. A gallery was built at the west end of the nave to accommodate the organ, and is constructed of steel girders with a wooden gallery front like the 17th-century galleries to either side of it. The organ case is of oak, with pine for the <b>rear</b> <b>case,</b> swell and wooden pipes. The keyboards are by Verners Kalacis of Latvia. The single-fold bellows for the great and swell are arranged vertically with a pressure of 63mm. The bellows for the pedal have a pressure of 75mm. The temperament is mildly unequal and the voicing is derived from the later instruments of Father Smith.|$|E
5000|$|The Israel Heritage Classroom {{reflects}} {{the simplicity of}} a 1st-century Galilean stone dwelling or house of assembly, this room's benches are patterned after those in the 2nd-3rd-century synagogue of Capernaum. The Ten Commandments, carved in Hebrew, grace the oak entrance door. Grapes, pomegranates, and dates on the stone frieze, copied from Capernaum, represent crops grown in the Galilee. On the window wall, an inscription discovered in the 6th-century Rehob synagogue cites the Talmudic laws governing the growing of crops each seventh year. A scroll fragment in the <b>rear</b> <b>case</b> replicates the Dead Sea Isaiah Scroll segment which contains the prophecy [...] "They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks..." [...] Ancient wine jars flank the scroll. The professor's table, based on one found in Jerusalem's 1st-century burnt house, stands before {{a copy of the}} only existing stone Menorah which served as a functional candelabrum. The quotation on the chair reads: [...] "I learned much from my teachers, more from my colleagues, and most of all from my pupils." [...] Three segments from the 6th-century Dura Europos murals grace the chalkboard doors, Ezra the Scribe, reads the law; Moses brings forth water for the 12 tribes; and the sons of Aaron consecrate the Temple. Oak benches bear the names of the 12 tribes of Israel. The floor mosaic replicates one in the 6th century Galilean synagogue of Beth Alpha.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the NASA Energy Efficient Engine program is to identify and verify the technology required to achieve significant reductions in fuel consumption and operating cost for future commercial gas turbine engines. The design and analysis is documented of the high pressure compressor which was tested {{as part of the}} Pratt and Whitney effort under the Energy Efficient Engine program. This compressor was designed to produce a 14 : 1 pressure ratio in ten stages with an adiabatic efficiency of 88. 2 percent in the flight propulsion system. The corresponding expected efficiency for the compressor component test rig is 86. 5 percent. Other performance goals are a surge margin of 20 percent, a corrected flow rate of 35. 2 kg/sec (77. 5 lb/sec), and a life of 20, 000 missions and 30, 000 hours. Low loss, highly loaded airfoils are used to increase efficiency while reducing the parts count. Active clearance control and case trenches in abradable strips over the blade tips are included in the compressor component design to further increase the efficiency potential. The test rig incorporates variable geometry stator vanes in all stages to permit maximum flexibility in developing stage-to-stage matching. This provision precluded active clearance control on the <b>rear</b> <b>case</b> of the test rig. Both the component and rig designs meet or exceed design requirements with the exception of life goals, which will be achievable with planned advances in materials technology...|$|E

40|$|The {{means of}} {{communication}} underwent a fast development in the twenty-first century, largely contributing to creating the society which gets a characteristic of a mass society. According to the mass society of "le Bone's psychology" {{and the development of}} the means of mass communication, with all positive options that it offers, many questions and dilemmas arise. From the point of culture the two most important ones are the following: {{despite the fact that the}} {{means of communication}} represent the social need, what is the level to which they can be a direct danger to the quality and value of national culture; and what is the level to which unselective and uncritical accepting of the imported content distance people from their own culture. The expansion of the means of mass communication also carries negative and bad influences because human state in the sea of information can be confused and distorted. On account of the enlarged range of available information, entertainment shows, especially the imported ones, societies are being slowly homogenized. Also the members of societies are slowly being cut off from everyday life, under the influence of media that are interfered in their life. It is not a <b>rear</b> <b>case</b> that the influence of television has a power of breaking man's connection with cultural practice, social system of values, norms (moral and legal), behaviour and individual ambitions. Imported information and entertainment shows can radically change social order which reflects on tradition and economical and social flows. The means of communication are an inseparable part of acculturation of a social system, but can also be an instrument of manipulation with people and the means for destruction of the national identity, what is actually happening...|$|E
