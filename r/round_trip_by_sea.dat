50|$|The South Line began {{service with}} two <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> trains on September 18, 2000 with stops in Tacoma, Sumner and Auburn that {{terminated}} in Seattle. Puyallup and Kent stations were added February 5, 2001, with Tukwila being added March 12, 2001. There are currently eleven <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> on the South Line, with two {{operating in the}} reverse commute direction. Sound Transit plans to add two additional <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> <b>by</b> September 2017.|$|R
50|$|Eight of the company's ships {{took part}} in the Dunkirk evacuation. Mona’s Isle was the first to leave Dover, and the first vessel to {{complete}} a <b>round</b> <b>trip.</b> <b>By</b> the end of operations, the fleet had rescued a total of 24,699, 1 in 14 of those evacuated from Dunkirk.|$|R
50|$|The Autofähre Beckenried-Gersau, or Beckenried-Gersau {{car ferry}}, is a Swiss car ferry that {{operates}} across {{the centre of}} Lake Lucerne between the lakeside towns of Beckenried and Gersau. The 4 km, 20 minute, crossing avoids a <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> road of 50 km. It operates {{from the beginning of}} April to mid-October.|$|R
50|$|The {{price for}} a <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> a ferry from Laukontori is 10 euros for adults, 5 euros for {{children}} (4-17), 8 euros for students and pensioners and with 25 euros it's {{possible to have a}} family ticket for 2 adults and 4 kids. Tickets can be bought from the ticket kiosk at Laukontori harbour.|$|R
50|$|The Zürichsee-Fähre Horgen-Meilen, or Horgen-Meilen Lake Zurich ferry, is a Swiss {{car ferry}} that {{operates}} across Lake Zurich between the lakeside towns of Horgen and Meilen. The ferry route is situated 12 km {{south of the}} city of Zurich, and the ferry avoids a <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> road of some 30 km by road via that city.|$|R
5000|$|A 2007 {{study by}} the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) {{predicted}} that the Sprinter would reduce road <b>trips</b> <b>by</b> 5,000 a day (a <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> car would be two road trips). It also predicted over 11,000 riders (<b>trips)</b> per day <b>by</b> {{the end of the}} first year. Ridership numbers did climb after opening, reaching just under 8,000 people per day as of March 2008. [...] Average weekday ridership for 2017 was approximately 8,800.|$|R

50|$|The present-day Sentier Martel travels 15 km {{along the}} right {{bank of the}} river Verdon from its {{entrance}} into the Canyon (Point Sublime) to the Châlet de la Maline. Some experienced hikers can do the <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> foot in 12 to 13 hours; for those going one way, this section of the hike takes 7 to 8 hours with the detour via La Mescla.|$|R
40|$|We report {{experimental}} {{observation of}} bound states of soliton in passively mode-locked erbium-doped double-clad fiber laser. Operating in the anomalous dispersion regime with a double-clad fiber 10 W amplifier allows generation {{of up to}} several thousands of solitons per <b>round</b> <b>trip.</b> <b>By</b> increasing the pumping power we pass from one bound state to several separated bound states. The bound states self-organize them leading to harmonic mode-locking of soliton crystals...|$|R
50|$|The towns {{along the}} single Haverhill trip dropped funding one by one. Service to North Andover ended in November 1974, and to Shawsheen, Andover, and Ballardvale in November 1975 after Andover withdrew. The <b>round</b> <b>trip,</b> <b>by</b> then {{stopping}} just at Lawrence, Bradford and Haverhill, was ended in June 1976. The MBTA bought all B&M commuter equipment and lines on December 27, 1976, including the Western Route from Wilmington Junction to the New Hampshire border.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Livingstone {{became the}} first elected Mayor of London, and in 2008 set a target of a 400% {{increase}} in cycling between 2008 and 2025. On 9 February 2008 Livingstone announced an estimated £400 million of initiatives to improve and increase cycling and walking, including thousands of new bike parking facilities at railway and tube stations. To be co-ordinated by the TfL and London boroughs, the aims include having one in ten Londoners making a <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> bike each day and five per cent of all daily <b>trips</b> <b>by</b> bike by 2025.|$|R
25|$|There is {{an option}} {{to make it a}} <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> walking on from Lake Tahune to the Franklin River at Irenabyss, {{crossing}} the river and exiting at Victoria Pass, which is also on the Lyell Highway. The walk from Irenabyss to Victoria Pass traverses rugged country and is recommended only for highly experienced parties. Many parties visit Irenabyss as a long day walk. Lake Tahune to Irenabyss takes about 4 hours. Irenabyss to Victoria Pass takes about 12 hours.|$|R
50|$|Another {{consequence}} of {{the isolation of the}} new capital is that the costs of doing business with government have increased considerably. People and organisations (such as from business, community, and international investors and organisations) must usually travel to Naypyidaw, often from Yangon, to meet with senior government officials. Since the <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> road from Yangon to Naypyidaw takes over 10 hours, the time now spent by senior business and community leaders on travel to meet with government representatives is considerable.|$|R

25|$|Against Luidinga's argument, {{the troop}} ship Khedive Ismail survived whereas the destroyers Diamond and Wryneck were sunk. And had the convoy been 20 {{nautical}} miles further south, Vendetta, Waterhen and Wryneck could have met it at 0800 instead of 0915 hrs, increasing both its anti-aircraft fire and capacity to rescue survivors. The distance from Almyros allowed the same Stukas to make repeated attack runs, although {{on the flight}} back to base one stopped at Corinth to refuel. Increasing their <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> 40 nautical miles might have marginally reduced the aircraft's ability to attack repeatedly.|$|R
50|$|A third option, {{previously}} proposed around 2001, {{would have}} created a gondola route between the Caples Valley and the Hollyford Valley. The proposal was a cooperation between Skyline Enterprises of Queenstown and Rotorua, and the Ngāi Tahu iwi, and was to cost around NZ$ 100-110 million. With 12.6 km length, the Skytrail would have become the longest such ride in the Southern Hemisphere, and was intended to transport 900 passengers per hour. With a duration of 35 minutes for a one-way trip, the gondola was to reduce the 12-hour <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> about 3 hours.|$|R

Trefort passed his lawyer's exam with a distinguished result on 22 December 1837. He stood into a state service then, and chamber president Gábor Keglevich appointed him a free trainee at the Buda court chamber on 17 April 1838. Trefort {{became a member of}} the National Casino, where he made lot of friends and connections. Among others he got acquainted with József Eötvös here.|$|R
50|$|In July 2012, the MBTA {{announced}} plans to add additional service on the line as CSX moves freight transload operations from Beacon Park Yard in Allston to a new yard in East Worcester that does not interfere with passenger operations. Three additional weekday Boston-Worcester <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> were added on October 29, 2012 after the October 4 signing of the deed that transferred ownership of the Framingham-Worcester section to the MBTA. A rush-hour express serving Worcester was added on April 29, 2013. The ultimate goal was originally for 20 Worcester <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> <b>by</b> October 2013, up from 12.5 <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> before the service increases; however this was pushed back by delays in the rebuilding of Yawkey station and the delivery of the new MPI HSP46 locomotives and bilevel passenger cars.|$|R

Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet Official Protocol Standards " (STD 1) for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. To date, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) has used a Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) profile which always required at least one complete <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> for an authentication, as it did not support an initial client response argument. This additional <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> {{at the beginning of}} the session is undesirable, especially when round-trip costs are high. This document defines an extension to IMAP which allows clients and servers to avoid this <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> allowing an initial client response argument to the IMAP AUTHENTICATE command...|$|R
2500|$|By early 2001, ACE {{regularly}} carried {{more than}} 700 daily standees. After additional equipment was bought, the [...] "Turn-back Train" [...] was replaced <b>by</b> a nearly-full-length <b>trip</b> originating at Lathrop-Manteca on March 5, 2001; trains also began stopping at Santa Clara station. Although the third train added 560 seats in each direction, it brought an immediate increase in 380 daily riders. ACE then planned {{to add a}} fourth <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> later in the year, with fifth and sixth <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> <b>by</b> 2006. However, by late 2001, the deepening dot-com recession was severely hurting ridership, and expansion plans were put on hold. On June 30, 2003, the ACE JPA was dissolved {{in favor of a}} Cooperative Services Agreement between the three member agencies.|$|R
50|$|The Blue Comet was {{initially}} a success but {{fell victim to}} the Great Depression. Service {{was reduced to a}} single <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> April 1933. Also that year, the PRR and Reading Company (RDG) consolidated their southern New Jersey routes and formed the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines. After the merger, the PRR owned two-thirds of the trackage. Reports from travelers indicate that Blue Comet information was not readily available at the Atlantic City station. This had the Blue Comet service at a disadvantage, as PRR Atlantic City-New York information was readily available for passengers heading to points north.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s the WAGR Bus service {{included}} seasonal six-day Wildflower Study Tours from Perth and along roads {{to and from}} Geraldton through the northern wheatbelt. These had first been operated in 1948 by the Midland Railway of Western Australia. Also in the early 1970s, the King Karri Scenicruiser buses ran from Bunbury through Manjimup, Pemberton, Northcliffe and Walpole to Albany {{at the same time}} the Albany Progress overnight train was still operating, making it possible to do a <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> rail from Perth to Albany and bus from Albany to Perth via Bunbury.|$|R

50|$|Beginning in 2000, Amtrak and PennDOT spent $166 {{million to}} {{rehabilitate}} the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line. This included {{the restoration of}} fully electrified service, as well as track improvements for {{a top speed of}} 110 mph. When the project was completed and electric service began in October 2006, travel times between Harrisburg and Philadelphia were reduced from 120 minutes to 95 minutes, with further time savings for through trains by eliminating the need for an engine change at Philadelphia. Service was also increased from 11 to 14 daily <b>round</b> <b>trips.</b> <b>By</b> FY 2010, ridership was up 91% since FY 2000 and 58% since FY 2006.|$|R

5000|$|By the mid-18th century, a {{thriving}} trade sent butter to the Cork market, but the <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> horse-drawn cart from Skibbereen could take eight days. In the 1730s, Cork merchants came to Bantry every summer, primarily {{in connection with}} the pilchard trade, but also to export butter. In addition, farmers and car men faced the hazards of highwaymen. Many did not use carts. This was evidenced by Sir John Carr in 1805, who wrote [...] "peasants with horses carrying barrels of butter to Cork secured as usual with ropes of hay" [...] and Sir Richard Colt Hoare in 1806, who said [...] "numerous troops of pack horses conveying casks of salt butter from the interior to Cork".|$|R
50|$|Henshaw {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to long distance flying. After reconnaissance of the eastern and western routes in 1938, he set off from Gravesend at 0335 GMT on Sunday 5 February 1939 to fly his Mew Gull to Cape Town and back. He refuelled on the way out in Oran in Algeria, crossed the Sahara to land in the Belgian Congo and then Angola, landing at Wingfield Aerodrome Cape Town after flying 6,377 miles in 40 hours. He spent 28 hours in Cape Town, and retraced his route back to the UK, landing on 9 February after a flight of 39 hours, 36 minutes. He completed the whole 12,754-mile <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> in 4 days, 10 hours and 16 minutes, breaking the record for each leg and setting a solo record for the <b>round</b> <b>trip.</b> <b>By</b> the end, he was so tired that he had to be lifted out of the cockpit.|$|R
