25|$|Newton's laws {{of motion}} {{describe}} {{the motion of}} an object in an inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference. When Newton's laws are transformed to a rotating frame of reference, the Coriolis force and centrifugal force appear. Both forces are proportional to {{the mass of the}} object. The Coriolis force is proportional to the rotation rate and the centrifugal force is proportional to its square. The Coriolis force acts in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to the velocity of the body in the rotating frame and is proportional to the object's speed in the rotating frame (more precisely, to the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation). The centrifugal force acts outwards in the radial direction and is proportional to the distance of the body from the axis of the rotating frame. These additional forces are termed inertial forces, fictitious forces or pseudo forces. They allow the application of Newton's laws to a <b>rotating</b> <b>system.</b> They are correction factors that do not exist in a non-accelerating or inertial reference frame.|$|E

Frank Chance, {{part of the}} famous Tinker to Evers to Chance double-play combination—all of whom managed the franchise at some point—has the best winning percentage in club history (.664), led the Cubs franchise to World Series victories in 1907 and 1908.

2500|$|Achieving {{stability}} of an inverted pendulum {{has become a}} common engineering challenge for researchers. There are different variations of the inverted pendulum on a cart ranging from a rod on a cart to a multiple segmented inverted pendulum on a cart. Another variation places the inverted pendulum's rod or segmented rod {{on the end of}} a rotating assembly. In both, (the cart and <b>rotating</b> <b>system)</b> the inverted pendulum can only fall in a plane. The inverted pendulums in these projects can either be required to only maintain balance after an equilibrium position is achieved or be able to achieve equilibrium by itself. Another platform is a two-wheeled balancing inverted pendulum. The two wheeled platform has the ability to spin on the spot offering a great deal of maneuverability. Yet another variation balances on a single point. [...] A spinning top, a unicycle, or an inverted pendulum atop a spherical ball all balance on a single point. As derived above the inverted pendulum can also be achieved by having a vertically oscillating base.|$|E

2500|$|The Coriolis force {{exists only}} when one uses a {{rotating}} reference frame. In the rotating frame it behaves {{exactly like a}} real force (that is to say, it causes acceleration and has real effects). However, the Coriolis force {{is a consequence of}} inertia, and is not attributable to an identifiable originating body, as is the case for electromagnetic or nuclear forces, for example. From an analytical viewpoint, to use Newton's second law in a <b>rotating</b> <b>system,</b> the Coriolis force is mathematically necessary, but it disappears in a non-accelerating, inertial frame of reference. For example, consider two children on opposite sides of a spinning roundabout (Merry-go-round [...] ), who are throwing a ball to each other. From the children's point of view, this ball's path is curved sideways by the Coriolis force. Suppose the roundabout spins anticlockwise when viewed from above. From the thrower's perspective, the deflection is to the right. From the non-thrower's perspective, deflection is to the left. For a mathematical formulation see Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces. In meteorology, a rotating frame (the Earth) with its Coriolis force provides a more natural framework for explanation of air movements than a non-rotating, inertial frame without Coriolis forces. In long-range gunnery, sight corrections for the Earth's rotation are based upon the Coriolis force. These examples are described in more detail below.|$|E

The aim of this study was to compare day workers and shift workers of different systems in terms of rotation speed and shifts worked with regard to work–family and family–work positive and negative spillover, marital communication style, job satisfaction and health. Material and Methods: Employees (N = 168) of the maintenance workshops of transportation service working different shift systems (day shift, weekly rotating 2 and 3 ‑shift <b>system,</b> and fast <b>rotating</b> 3 -shift <b>system)</b> participated in the study. They completed the Work– Family Spillover Questionnaire, Marital Communication Questionnaire, Minnesota Job Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Physical Health Questionnaire (a part of the Standard Shiftwork Index). Results: The workers of quicker <b>rotating</b> 3 -shift <b>systems</b> reported significantly higher scores of family-to-work facilitation (F(3, 165) = 4. 175, p = 0. 007) and a higher level of constructive style of marital communication (Engagement F(3, 165) = 2. 761, p = 0. 044) than the workers of slower <b>rotating</b> 2 -shift <b>systems.</b> There were no differences between the groups of workers with regard to health and job satisfaction.
