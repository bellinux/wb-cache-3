5000|$|Three {{weeks later}} his trainer, Thomas F. Root, Sr. {{decided to take}} a shot at the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The Preakness Stakes is run at a mile and three sixteenths on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. In that race Iron Constitution was listed a 31-1 longshot in a field of ten stakes winning colts. The {{prohibitive}} odds-on favorite was the undefeated Kentucky Derby winner Seattle Slew. Iron Constitution broke from near the outside and broke poorly in ninth in front of only Run Dusty Run. The fractions that day were blistering on the lead finishing the first quarter mile in :223/5 and the half in :453/5. Just prior to Pimlico's famous [...] "Clubhouse Turn" [...] Iron Constitution's jockey Jorge Velasquez angled him in and slid between horse to reach the rail. He moved from ninth up tho seventh as he saved ground on both turns on the inside. Down the back stretch he moved up well into third behind only runner-up Seattle Slew and the front <b>running</b> <b>leader</b> Cormorant. Velasquez then took him outside {{at the top of the}} lane and he willingly picked up the pace finishing the mile in 1:344/5. Jean Cruguet applied a steady hand ride to Slew who went on to win by one and one half lengths. Iron Constitution finished second that day two lengths in front of Run Dusty Run who finished third. Iron Constitution took the 20% runner-up's share of the purse equalling $30,000. After his strong Preakness placing performance in the Preakness Stakes he went on to place in three very nice races that year including the Grade 1 Jersey Derby. It was the last Jersey Derby ever held at Garden State Park Racetrack before a fire deystroyed the property. He also placed second in the Woodlawn Stakes on the turf at Pimlico Race Course. He also showed in third place in two mile and one sixteenth races on the dirt in the Monmouth Invitational Handicap which is now called the Haskell Invitational Stakes at Monmouth Park Racetrack and the Dwyer Stakes at Belmont Park.
