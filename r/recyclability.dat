5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and <b>recyclability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since scrap copper retains much of {{its primary}} value, copper’s life cycle costs are reduced when {{accounting}} for its salvage value. For more information, see <b>Recyclability</b> section in this article.|$|E
25|$|Sustainable {{materials}} are {{key elements of}} green buildings. Some benefits of sustainable materials include durability, long life, <b>recyclability,</b> and energy and thermal efficiency. Copper ranks highly {{in all of these}} categories.|$|E
25|$|A-train is Hitachi's {{brand name}} for rail rolling stock built and {{designed}} using {{a set of}} technologies including car-bodies manufactured from friction stir welded double skin aluminium extrusions with built-in mounting rails for sub-assemblies, and self-modular construction using supporting sub-modules. The stock is designed to facilitate a number of product life-cycle improvements including ease of manufacture, increase in energy efficiency, and <b>recyclability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like other {{heterogeneous}} catalysts, MOFs {{may allow}} for easier post-reaction separation and <b>recyclability</b> than homogeneous catalysts. In some cases, they also give a highly enhanced catalyst stability. Additionally, they typically offer substrate-size selectivity. Nevertheless, while clearly important for reactions in living systems, selectivity {{on the basis}} of substrate size is of limited value in abiotic catalysis, as reasonably pure feedstocks are generally available.|$|E
25|$|Because of the <b>recyclability</b> of PET and the {{relative}} abundance of post-consumer waste {{in the form of}} bottles, PET is rapidly gaining market share as a carpet fiber. Mohawk Industries released everSTRAND in 1999, a 100% post-consumer recycled content PET fiber. Since that time, more than 17 billion bottles have been recycled into carpet fiber. Pharr Yarns, a supplier to numerous carpet manufacturers including Looptex, Dobbs Mills, and Berkshire Flooring, produces a BCF (bulk continuous filament) PET carpet fiber containing a minimum of 25% post-consumer recycled content.|$|E
25|$|In many {{synthetic}} processes using {{transition metal}} catalysts, metal nanoparticles {{play an important}} role as the actual catalyst or as a catalyst reservoir. ILs are an appealing medium for the formation and stabilization of catalytically active transition metal nanoparticles. More importantly, ILs can be made that incorporate coordinating groups, for example, with nitrile groups on either the cation or anion (CN-IL). In various C-C coupling reactions catalyzed by a palladium catalyst, it has been found that palladium nanoparticles are better stabilized in CN-IL compared to non-functionalized ionic liquids; thus enhanced catalytic activity and <b>recyclability</b> are realized.|$|E
25|$|<b>Recyclability</b> is a {{key factor}} of a {{sustainable}} material. It reduces the need to mine new resources and requires less energy than mining. Copper and its alloys are virtually 100% recyclable and can be recycled infinitely without any loss of quality (i.e., copper does not degrade (i.e., downcycle) after each recycling loop as do most non-metallic materials, if they are recyclable at all). Copper retains much of its primary metal value: premium-grade scrap normally contains at least 95% {{of the value of}} primary metal from newly mined ore. Scrap values for competing materials range from about 60% down to 0%. And copper recycling requires only around 20% of the energy needed to extract and process primary metal.|$|E
25|$|Two systems {{exist for}} the {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation of 2-substituted quinolines with isolated yields generally greater than 80% and ee values generally greater than 90%. The first is an iridium(I)/chiral phosphine/I2 system, first reported by Zhou et al. While the first chiral phosphine used in this system was MeOBiPhep, newer iterations have focused on improving the performance of this ligand. To this end, systems use phosphines (or related ligands) with improved air stability, <b>recyclability,</b> ease of preparation, lower catalyst loading and the potential role of achiral phosphine additives. As of October 2012 no mechanism {{appears to have been}} proposed, although both the necessity of I2 or a halogen surrogate and the possible role of the heteroaromatic N in assisting reactivity have been documented.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the battery}} is glued in and cannot be easily {{disassembled}} for recycling (an EPEAT requirement), Apple received criticisms about the machine's {{ability to be}} recycled. Greenpeace spokesman Casey Harrell said Apple [...] "has pitted design against the environment—and chosen design. They're making a big bet that people don't care, but recycling is a big issue." [...] Wired also criticized Apple's <b>recyclability</b> claims, stating [...] "he design may well be [...] 'highly recyclable aluminum and glass'—but my friends in the electronics recycling industry tell me they {{have no way of}} recycling aluminum that has glass glued to it like Apple did with both this machine and the recent iPad." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{goals of}} green {{computing}} {{are similar to}} green chemistry: reduce the use of hazardous materials, maximize energy efficiency during the product's lifetime, [...] the <b>recyclability</b> or biodegradability of defunct products and factory waste. Green computing is important for all classes of systems, ranging from handheld systems to large-scale data centers.|$|E
2500|$|Building {{materials}} typically {{considered to}} be 'green' include lumber from forests that have been certified to a third-party forest standard, rapidly renewable plant materials like bamboo and straw, [...] dimension stone, recycled stone, recycled metal (see: copper sustainability and <b>recyclability),</b> and other products that are non-toxic, reusable, renewable, and/or recyclable. For concrete a high performance or Roman self-healing concrete is available. [...] The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) also suggests using recycled industrial goods, such as coal combustion products, foundry sand, and demolition debris in construction projects. [...] Energy efficient building materials and appliances are promoted in the United States through energy rebate programs.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{generation}} of TGVs are being considered with specifications for the new train is due to be finalized {{by the end of}} 2017. A detailed design concept will be completed within four years with the aim of introducing the trains into commercial service by mid-2022 with the aim to increase the capacity of TGVs by 10% by replacing the central two power cars of a double TGV with passenger carriages. These carriages would have motorized bogies, as do the first and last carriage of the train, {{to make up for the}} lost power. [...] The aim is also to develop a train which reduces the cost of acquisition and operation by 20% and cuts energy consumption by at least 25% with <b>recyclability</b> of more than 90%. Another focus will be improving the passenger environment with modular interiors and improved comfort and connectivity. [...] Due to a change in the French law in 2014, French state-owned companies can now work in collaboration with private sector partners during the design phase of a project in order to minimise costs and a guarantee that it will be awarded a contract when the joint development phase has been completed.|$|E
2500|$|The 2013 European {{version has}} {{many of the}} same {{improvements}} of the Japanese and U.S. versions, including an extended range, greater <b>recyclability,</b> more interior space, better charging performance, and more equipment. Also three versions will be available: Visia, Acenta and Tekna. The Visia version has a lower starting price than the previous model, and the Tekna model has even more standard equipment than the 2011/2012 Leaf. The European version was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show, and production of the 2013 model began in March 2013 at the Sunderland plant in the UK, and sales started in June 2013. [...] The price of the 2013 Leaf produced in Sunderland is lower than the one built in Japan, and to further reduce the purchase price by , Nissan offered a battery leasing option for all trims produced at Sunderland. The leasing option is also available in several European countries, reducing the purchase price by [...] This measure, among others, helped to reduce the sales price in Germany, for instance, from roughly [...] in April 2012 (with battery) to roughly [...] in July 2013 (excluding battery lease of [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Some call {{attention}} to the conjunction of Commons-based peer production with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques. The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope, and here, society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity. Further, it is true that many issues, problems, and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production, and especially regarding the physical ones. For instance, the <b>recyclability</b> of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned; weapons manufacturing could become easier; not to mention the implications for counterfeiting and on IP. It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale, Commons-based peer production 3D printing could develop economies of scope. While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation, the economies of scope share infrastructure costs (intangible and tangible productive resources), taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools. And following Neil Gershenfeld in that [...] "some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies," [...] Commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs.|$|E
