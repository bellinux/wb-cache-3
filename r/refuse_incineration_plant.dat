40|$|Process data {{validation}} is employed for monitoring and optimising processes in nuclear power plants, combined-cycle gas turbine power plants, coal-fired power <b>plants,</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> and gas power pools, {{as well as}} in the chemical and petrochemical industries. It is a method for determining a consistent process image, taking closed mass, energy and materials balances into account. It takes the place of: • Cost-intensive acceptance and inspection measurements, • Part of the instrumentation within the processes. If it is installed online, it supplies a continuous stream of results, allowing impermissible developments during operation or in the plant to be quantitatively estimated. Data validation also yields information about operating states in non-instrumented or insufficiently instrumented parts of the plant. If {{data validation}} is integrated in the installation early on during the project planning phase, it is possible to reduce the number of measuring points compared with that considered necessary in the past. Since the saving per measuring point is approximately 15, 000 EURO, this can represent a substantial reduction in the cost for investments in the plant. Depending on the type and size of the plant, as much as 125, 000 EURO can be saved additionally every year because fewer key measuring points need to be calibrated. This work describes experience with online process data validation in CCGT and nuclear power plants (boiling water and pressurised water reactors) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In Japan, {{the largest}} source of dioxin is solid waste <b>incineration</b> <b>plants.</b> Because workers {{employed}} at these plants handle fly ash and slag contaminated by dioxins, they can take dioxins into the body during work and their health may be adversely effected. This paper describes the dioxin exposure concentration, daily dioxin intake and blood dioxin level in workers employed at municipal <b>incineration</b> <b>plants.</b> The estimated dioxin exposure concentrations were 0. 5 to 7. 2 pg TEQ/m 3 in the daily operation and 0. 2 to 92, 000 pg TEQ/m 3 in the periodic maintenance. It was also expected that the daily dioxin intake can exceed the tolerable daily intake (TDI) in <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> with fly ash of high dioxin concentration. The mean of blood dioxin concentration was 346 pg TEQ/g lipid in the highest exposed worker group of the Toyono-gun <b>incineration</b> <b>plant</b> and those were 11 to 40 pg TEQ/ g lipid in the other <b>incineration</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
50|$|SPNV {{services}} did {{not continue}} {{for much longer}} between Neumarkt-Sankt Veit and Frontenhausen-Marklkofen; the last passenger train worked the line on 27 September 1970. By contrast, the factory of car suppliers, Mann+Hummel, based in Marklkofen, provided well-laden trains for many years, before the firm transferred its operations from road to rail in the 1990s for various reasons. The only regular user of the Neumarkt-Sankt Veit-Frontenhausen-Marklkofen section since then is a joint regional refuse union that transfers household rubbish into containers in Marklkofen and dispatches it by rail to a <b>refuse</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plant</b> at Burgkirchen. A sister firm {{of the company that}} runs the plant, Max Aicher, has also been the railway infrastructure company for the aforementioned section of the line since 2008.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s two-figure {{increases}} in turnover filled the business accounting ledgers. In 1985 the company’s turnover exceeded the CHF 200 million threshold {{for the first}} time and the firm soon took over leadership on the domestic chocolate market. These good preconditions facilitated investments. Various structural and quality-related changes were implemented and the issue of environmental protection gained in importance.In line with this the company has been procuring district heating from the nearby <b>refuse</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plant</b> since 1984. Since then the company has managed virtually without heating oil. In addition, the plant was upgraded with a new SBB (Swiss Railways) rail connection. The 1980s were of great importance for international trade as well. For the first time since the Second World War foreign trade was re-established. The United Kingdom, the USA, Denmark, Austria and Japan, later also France and South East Asia, imported the chocolate of Chocolat Frey AG. However, for the time being export remained a modest secondary business. During the 1990s, the international trade was expanded and professionalised. In 1997 the company launched its new project ‘Chocolat Frey goes international’, with the aim of export contributing to Chocolat Frey AG’s profitability in the long term. A key account management system was introduced for key customer liaison and support.|$|E
40|$|The results {{obtained}} from operational tests in a <b>refuse</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plant</b> for municipal and industrial wastes serve to describe activated lignite's efficiency as a mass sorbent for dioxin {{reduction in the}} filter-bed process, with use being made of the existing infrastructure. Variations in the dosing rate, on the one hand, {{and the use of}} different grain sizes, on the other hand, identify the selection criteria for the determination of the process-engineering optimum for waste gas cleaning, with sorbent injection being integrated into the existing facility of quasi-dry waste gas cleaning. This paper demonstrates that the dioxin emission can be reduced by activated lignite to below 0. 1 ng TE/m although the available equipment was in no optimum condition...|$|E

40|$|Conductive {{adhesive}} bonding {{is one of}} the possible alternatives to soldering which need to be replaced in various fields of application by ecological and technological reasons. A comparison of the two joining methods will be presented from the ecological point of view. For the evaluation of the ecological compatibility of a product the whole lifespan must be taken into consideration. Therefore, production, use of the product, repairability and recycability are discussed. Soldered electronics are repairable. It will be shown that this is also the case for adhesively joined electronics. The possibilities to debond the joints for the purpose of repair or recycling will be pointed out. Medical aspects are to be considered in view of the evaporation and decomposition of soldering flux as well as the irritating properties of adhesives. For epoxy resins it will be shown, which are the irritating components and how to avoid contact them. Finally the influence of electrically conductive adhesives and t in/lead-solder on nature will be shown when they are disposed on a deposition area or a <b>refuse</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plant...</b>|$|E
40|$|In an {{exploding}} and fluctuating construction market, {{managers are}} facing a challenge, which is how to manage business on a wider scale and to utilize modern developments in information technology to promote productivity. The extraordinary development of telecommunications and computer technology {{makes it possible for}} people to plan, lead, control, organize and manage projects from a distance without the need to be on site on a daily basis. A modern management known as distance management (DM) or remote management is emerging. Physical distance no longer determines the boundary of management since managers can now operate projects through virtual teams that organize manpower, material and production without face-to-face communication. What organization prototype could overcome psychological and physical barriers to reengineer a successful project through information technology? What criteria distinguishes the adapted way of communication of individual activities in a teamwork and assist the integration of an efficient and effective communication between face-to-face and a physical distance?
