For epidemiological purposes, different molecular typing methods, such as {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE) or ribotyping, {{have been developed for}} this pathogen; however, these methods are mostly labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we designed and evaluated three rapid PCR typing methods for this pathogen using primers designed {{on the basis of the}} following specific sequences: conserved ribosomal gene spacer sequence (RS), <b>repetitive</b> <b>extragenic</b> <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequence</b> (REP), and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence (ERIC). Typing patterns and clustering analysis indicated that these methods apparently differentiated V. parahaemolyticus strains from reference strains of interspecific Escherichia coli, V. cholerae, and V. vulnificus and were also valuable in subspecies typing of this pathogen. Forty domestic strains of V. parahaemolyticus, representing a wide range of PFGE patterns, were grouped into 15, 27, and 27 patterns, with discrimination indexes of 0. 91, 0. 97, and 0. 98, by RS-, REP-, and ERIC-PCR, respectively.

The amino acid sequences {{of these two}} proteins, deduced from the nucleotide sequence reported here, demonstrate their homology to environmentally responsive two-component regulators that {{have been reported in}} both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In our model, RcsC acts as the sensor and RcsB acts as the receiver or effector to stimulate capsule synthesis from cps genes. In addition, RcsC shows limited homology to the other effectors in its C terminus. Fusions of rcsC to phoA that resulted in PhoA+ strains demonstrated that RcsC is a transmembrane protein with a periplasmic N-terminal domain and cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. Additional control of this regulatory network is provided by the dependence on the alternate sigma factor, RpoN, for the synthesis of RcsB.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the termination region sequence of the rrnG operon and have observed its properties in vivo using a fusion plasmid test system. Transcription of rrnG terminator fragments was also studied in vitro. We found that termination of rrnG transcription is a complex process controlled by a tandem Rho-independent and Rho-dependent terminator arrangement which we designate rrnG-tt'. Together, these two elements were 98 % efficient at terminating transcription initiated at the rrnG-P 2 promoter. When the two elements were separated, however, {{we found that the}} Rho-independent structure was only 59 % efficient while the Rho-dependent fragment alone could account for total transcriptional termination of the tandem arrangement. The rrnG termination region was resistant to rrn antitermination and, therefore, possesses some means of stopping antiterminated transcription. The distal rrnG sequence contains several additional noteworthy features; the rrnGt' fragment contains a REP (<b>repetitive</b> <b>extragenic</b> <b>palindromic)</b> <b>sequence</b> and homology with a small unidentified reading frame following rrnE.

An analysis of the amplified fragments by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) demonstrated that two major 16 S rDNA bands (bands R 2 and R 3) and two major LmPH gene bands (bands P 2 and P 3) appeared after the activated sludge became acclimated to phenol. The nucleotide sequences of these major bands were determined. In parallel, bacteria were isolated from the activated sludge by direct plating or by plating after enrichment either in batch cultures or in a chemostat culture.

However, a recent study revealed that 30 % of E. coli clinical isolates resistant to cefoxitin remained susceptible in vitro to amoxycillin–clavulanate. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the in-vivo efficacy of amoxycillin–clavulanate in the treatment of an experimental model of pneumonia, using two clonally related isolates (with identical <b>repetitive</b> <b>extragenic</b> <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequence</b> (REP) -PCR patterns) of AmpC-non-hyperproducing and OmpF-lacking E. coli (Ec 985 and Ec 571) that were resistant to cefoxitin and susceptible to cefotaxime and amoxycillin–clavulanate. MICs were determined using a microdilution technique, and in-vitro bactericidal activity was tested using time-kill assays. The in-vivo efficacy of amoxycillin, amoxycillin–clavulanate and cefotaxime against both isolates was tested in a murine pneumonia model using immunocompetent C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Ec 571 (a TEM- 1 / 2 producer) was resistant to amoxycillin, whereas Ec 985 (a TEM- 1 / 2 non-producer) was susceptible. Amoxycillin, amoxycillin–clavulanate and cefotaxime were bactericidal for Ec 985, and amoxycillin–clavulanate and cefotaxime were bactericidal for Ec 571 at different concentrations and time-points, as determined using time-kill assays. Treatment with amoxycillin, amoxycillin–clavulanate and cefotaxime reduced the bacterial lung concentration of Ec 985 compared with non-treated controls (p < 0. 05), whereas amoxycillin–clavulanate and cefotaxime showed efficacy against Ec 571 when compared with the control and amoxycillin groups (p < 0. 05).

This {{contrasts with the}} gene arrangement in other bacteria, in which catA lies several kilobases upstream from catB. Properties of Tn 5 mutants confirmed earlier suggestions that catR is a transcriptional activator and indicated that catA is activated by CatR independently of its activation of catBC. CatR binds to both a DNA fragment containing the catR-catB intergenic region and another DNA fragment containing catC. Pseudomonas strain RB 1 resembles P. putida in some respects. Divergence of the two Pseudomonas chromosomes was revealed as nucleotide substitution of about 10 % after alignment of known portions of catR,BC,A. Divergent transcriptional controls are suggested by a cluster of nucleotide sequence modifications in Pseudomonas strain RB 1 which disrupt a stem-loop structure directly upstream of catB in the P. putida chromosome.

All of the bacterial strains affiliated with the R 6 population had almost identical 16 S rDNA sequences, while the gyrB phylogenetic analysis divided these strains into two physiologically divergent groups; both of these groups of strains could grow on phenol, while one group (designated the R 6 F group) flocculated in laboratory media and the other group (the R 6 T group) did not. A competitive PCR analysis in which specific gyrB sequences were used as the primers showed that a population shift from R 6 F to R 6 T occurred following the increase in the phenol-loading rate to 1. 5 g liter− 1 day− 1. The R 10 population corresponded to nonflocculating phenol-degrading bacteria. Our results suggest that an outbreak of nonflocculating catabolic populations caused the breakdown of the activated-sludge process. This study also demonstrated the usefulness of gyrB-targeted fine population analyses in microbial ecology...|$|E

Foram utilizados para cultura de cateter o método semiquantitativo e qualitativo ou método semiquantitativo e quantitativo, e as hemoculturas cultivadas pelo sistema automatizado Bactec. Para a análise fenotípica da similaridade dos isolados de pontas de cateteres e hemoculturas foi utilizado o teste de sensibilidade às drogas antimicrobianas pela técnica da difusão da droga em ágar. Para análise genotípica do perfil de similaridade dos isolados de cateter e hemocultura concomitantes e para o delineamento do perfil clonal das amostras de S. epidermidis isoladas de hemoculturas foram utilizados as técnicas de RAPD-PCR (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA based PCR) e REP-PCR (<b>Repetitive</b> <b>Extragenic</b> <b>Palindromic</b> <b>Sequence</b> based PCR).

Catheter-related infections constitute one of {{the main}} causes of bacteremia in neonatal ICUs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze, by means of molecular typing techniques, the similarity between microorganisms isolated from catheters and blood cultures for the diagnosis of catheter-related bloodstream infection in newborns. The evaluation included 124 catheter tips and 155 concomitant blood cultures from 107 newborns in a Neonatal Unit. For the catheter culture, the semiquantitative and qualitative method or the semiquantitative and quantitative method was used, as well as blood cultures kept by the automated system Bactec. For the phenotypic analysis of similarity between isolates from catheter tips and blood cultures, the test of sensitivity to antimicrobial drugs using the technique of drug diffusion in agar was adopted. For the genotypic analyses of similarity profiles between isolates from catheter and concomitant blood culture and for the clonal profile design of S. epidermidis samples isolated from blood cultures, the techniques RAPD-PCR (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-based PCR) and REP-PCR (Repetitive Extragenic Palindromic Sequence-based PCR) were employed. Of the 107 studied newborns, 45 had the same microorganism in the catheter tip and in the blood culture concomitantly; of this total, 86. 7 % were colonized with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 4. 4 % with Staphylococcus aureus, 4. 4 % with Candida parapsilosis, 2. 2 % with Enterococcus faecalis, and 2. 2 % with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the four subspecies of the human pathogen Francisella tularensis, despite showing marked variations in their virulence for mammals and originating from different regions in the Northern Hemisphere, display a very close phylogenetic relationship. This property has hampered the development of generally applicable typing methods. To overcome this problem, we evaluated the use of PCR for discrimination of the subspecies using various forms of long arbitrary primers or primers specific for <b>repetitive</b> <b>extragenic</b> <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> (REP) or enterobacterial repetitive intragenic consensus (ERIC) sequences. Patterns generated by use of REP, ERIC, or long arbitrary primers allowed differentiation at the species level and of the four subspecies of F. tularensis. With each of these three methods, similar or identical clustering of strains was found, and groups of strains of different geographical origins or differing in virulence showed distinct patterns. The discriminatory indices of the methods varied from 0. 57 to 0. 65; thus, the patterns were not sufficiently discriminatory to distinguish individual strains. The sequence of a fragment generated by amplification with an arbitrary primer was determined, and a region showing interstrain heterogeneity was identified. Specific primers were designed, and a PCR was developed that distinguished strains of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica from strains of other F. tularensis subspecies, including strains of the highly virulent F. tularensis subsp. tularensis. Notably, one European isolate showed the genetic pattern typical of the highly virulent F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, generally believed to exist only in North America. It is proposed that a combination of the specific PCR together with one method generating subspecies-specific patterns is suitable as a rapid and relatively simple strategy for discrimination of Francisella species and subspecies...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} {{genomic sequence}} of Pseudomonas syringae pathovar syringae B 728 a (Pss B 728 a), {{has been determined}} and is {{compared with that of}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 (Pst DC 3000). The two pathovars of this economically important species of plant pathogenic bacteria differ in host range and other interactions with plants, with Pss having a more pronounced epiphytic stage of growth and higher abiotic stress tolerance and Pst DC 3000 having a more pronounced apoplastic growth habitat. The Pss B 728 a genome (6. 1 megabases) contains a circular chromosome and no plasmid, whereas the Pst DC 3000 genome is 6. 5 mbp in size, composed of a circular chromosome and two plasmids. While a high degree of similarity exists between the two sequenced Pseudomonads, 976 protein-encoding genes are unique to Pss B 728 a when compared to Pst DC 3000, including large genomic islands likely to contribute to virulence and host specificity. Over 375 <b>repetitive</b> <b>extragenic</b> <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> (REPs) unique to Pss B 728 a when compared to Pst DC 3000 are widely distributed throughout the chromosome except in 14 genomic islands, which generally had lower GC content than the genome as a whole. Content of the genomic islands vary, with one containing a prophage and another the plasmid pKLC 102 of P. aeruginosa PAO 1. Among the 976 genes of Pss B 728 a with no counterpart in Pst DC 3000 are those encoding for syringopeptin (SP), syringomycin (SR), indole acetic acid biosynthesis, arginine degradation, and production of ice nuclei. The genomic comparison suggests that several unique genes for Pss B 728 a such as ectoine synthase, DNA repair, and antibiotic production may contribute to epiphytic fitness and stress tolerance of this organism...|$|R

The isolates {{were able to}} utilize 4 -CBA as a sole source of carbon and energy. A total of 65 % of the isolates was identified to the species level by fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis, and the isolates were strains of Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Oerskovia, Cellulomonas, and Arthrobacter species. The chromosomal DNA patterns of the isolates obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of <b>repetitive</b> <b>extragenic</b> <b>palindromic</b> (REP) <b>sequences</b> were distinct from each other.

The set of REP probe-hybridizing clones was correlated {{with a set of}} clones expected to contain REP sequences on the basis of computer searches. We also show that a generic REP probe can be used in Southern hybridization to analyze genomic DNA digested with restriction enzymes to determine genetic relatedness among natural isolates of E. coli. A search for these sequences in other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae shows a consistent correlation between both the number of occurrences and the hybridization strength and genealogical relationship...|$|R

Although broad analysis of TLR 9 -mediated immunostimulatory potential of synthetic oligonucleotides has been developed, which kinds of natural bacterial DNA sequences {{are responsible for}} immunostimulation are not known. This work provides evidence that the natural DNA <b>sequences</b> named <b>repetitive</b> <b>extragenic</b> <b>palindromic</b> (REPs) <b>sequences</b> present in Gram-negative bacteria are able to produce innate immune system stimulation via TLR 9. A strong induction of IFN-α production by REPs from Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis was detected in splenocytes from 129 mice. In addition, the involvement of TLR 9 in immune stimulation by REPs was confirmed using B 6. 129 P 2 -Tlr 9 tm 1 Aki knockout mice. Considering the involvement of TLRs in Gram-negative septic shock, {{it is conceivable that}} REPs play a role in its pathogenesis.

40|$|<b>Repetitive</b> <b>extragenic</b> <b>palindromic</b> (REP) <b>sequences</b> are a {{ubiquitous}} {{feature of}} bacterial genomes. Recent work shows that REPs are {{remnants of a}} larger mobile genetic element termed a REPIN. REPINs consists of two REP sequences in inverted orientation separated by a spacer region and {{are thought to be}} non-autonomous mobile genetic elements that exploit the transposase encoded by REP-Associated tYrosine Transposases (RAYTs). Complimentarity between the two ends of the REPIN suggests that the element forms hairpin structures in single stranded DNA or RNA. In addition to REPINs, other more complex arrangements of REPs have been identified in bacterial genomes, including the genome of the model organism Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25. Here, we summarize existing knowledge and present new data concerning REPIN diversity. We also consider factors affecting the evolution of REPIN diversity, the ease with which REPINs might be co-opted by host genomes and the consequences of REPIN activity for the structure of bacterial genomes...|$|R
40|$|We have {{determined}} and analyzed the {{nucleic acid sequence}} of a 14, 855 -bp region that contains the complete gene cluster encoding the 4 -hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4 -HPA) degradative pathway of Escherichia coli W (ATCC 11105). This catabolic pathway is composed by 11 genes, i. e., 8 enzyme-encoding genes distributed in two putative operons, hpaBC (4 -HPA hydroxylase operon) and hpaGEDFHI (meta-cleavage operon); 2 regulatory genes, hpaR and hpaA; and the gene, hpaX, that encodes a protein related to the superfamily of transmembrane facilitators {{and appears to be}} cotranscribed with hpaA. Although comparisons with other aromatic catabolic pathways revealed interesting similarities, some of the genes did not present any similarity to their corresponding counterparts in other pathways, suggesting different evolutionary origins. The cluster is flanked by two genes homologous to the estA (carbon starvation protein) and tsr (serine chemoreceptor) genes of E. coli K- 12. A detailed genetic analysis of this region has provided a singular example of how E. coli becomes adapted to novel nutritional sources by the recruitment of a catabolic cassette. Furthermore, the presence of the pac gene in the proximity of the 4 -HPA cluster suggests that the penicillin G acylase was a recent acquisition to improve the ability of E. coli W to metabolize a wider range of substrates, enhancing its catabolic versatility. Five <b>repetitive</b> <b>extragenic</b> <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> that might be involved in transcriptional regulation were found within the cluster. The complete 4 -HPA cluster was cloned in plasmid and transposon cloning vectors that were used to engineer E. coli K- 12 strains able to grow on 4 -HPA. We report here also the in vitro design of new biodegradative capabilities through the construction of a transposable cassette containing the wide substrate range 4 -HPA hydroxylase, in order to expand the ortho-cleavage pathway of Pseudomonas putida KT 2442 and allow the new recombinant strain to use phenol as the only carbon source...|$|R

Molecular subtyping, using <b>repetitive</b> <b>extragenic</b> <b>palindromic</b> DNA <b>sequences</b> (BOX-PCR), has been used to discriminate among environmental E. coli and Enterococcus spp. isolates. The reproducibility of BOX-PCR patterns varies with DNA purification methods; therefore, it is important to develop a standardized, rapid, high throughput DNA purification protocol for population biology studies. I have compared the effects of DNA purification methods on the reproducibility, cost, and speed of producing BOX-PCR patterns using three methods: a commercially available Qiagen kit (Qiagen DNeasy tissue), a whole cell method requiring no pre-treatment, and a method developed in-house using the MacConnell Mini-prep 96 (mini-prep) instrument.

40|$|A {{family of}} <b>repetitive</b> <b>extragenic</b> <b>palindromic</b> (REP) <b>sequences</b> is {{composed}} of hundreds of copies distributed throughout the chromosome. Their palindromic nature and conservation suggested that they are specifically recognized by a protein(s). We have identified DNA gyrase [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing), EC 5. 99. 1. 3] {{as one of the}} REP-binding proteins. Gyrase has at least a 10 -fold higher affinity for DNA containing REP sequences than for DNA not containing REP sequences. Binding effectiveness correlates directly with the number of REP sequences in the DNA. DNase I footprinting shows that gyrase protects 205 base pairs on a REP-containing DNA fragment enclosing the REP sequences. In agreement with the above results, a comparison of the REP consensus sequence with the sequence of previously identified pBR 322 "strong" gyrase cleavage sites reveals a high degree of homology. Because REP sequences are numerous and found throughout the genome, we suggest they have physiological functions mediated through their interaction with gyrase, such as being sites of action for the maintenance of DNA supercoiling. In addition, we speculate that these interactions may be of a structural nature, such as involvement in the higher-order structure of the bacterial chromosome...|$|R
