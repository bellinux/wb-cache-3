The main objectives of the environmental legislation originating from extended producer responsibility (EPR) principle are to lead producers to undertake recovery initiatives for their end-of-use products and to promote environmentally desirable product design. It is still controversial whether current implementations of EPR principle are effective in attaining these objectives. This study seeks to answer the following questions: (1) What is the impact of EPR legislation on the product <b>recovery</b> <b>decisions</b> of producers? (2) How do the redesign opportunities (i. e., design for disassembly) affect the willingness of producers for product recovery? (3) How do the investment needs to start recovery practices and the reluctance of producers to allocate sufficient funds for this purpose affect the optimal <b>recovery</b> <b>decisions?</b> We use stylized economic models to represent the implementation in practice and solving our models we obtain closed form and numerical solutions that help us to see the impact of various parameters on the optimal decisions of a producer. Our findings indicate that redesign opportunities encourage producers for more recovery, however the reluctance of producers to cover the initial investments may substantially reduce the effectiveness of the legislation and the recovery amounts.

40|$|A {{suitable}} {{strategy for}} network intrusion tolerance—detecting intrusions and remedying them—depends on {{aspects of the}} domain being protected, such as the kinds of intrusion faced, the resources available for monitoring and remediation, and {{the level at which}} automated remediation can be carried out. The decision to remediate autonomically will have to consider the relative costs of performing a potentially disruptive remedy in the wrong circumstances and leaving it up to a slow, but more accurate, human operator. Autonomic remediation also needs to be withdrawn at some point – a phase of recovery to the normal network state. In this paper, we present a framework for deploying domain-adaptable intrusion-tolerance strategies in heterogeneous networks. Functionality is divided into that which is fixed by the domain and that which should adapt, in order to cope with heterogeneity.

40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a {{chemical}} widely {{used as a}} monomer {{in the production of}} polymers of plastics. It acts as an endocrine disrupting agent and thus its contaminations of food and beverage should be carefully monitored in order to assess consumers’ risk. In this study we propose a liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (LC-FD) validated method for the simultaneous determination of BPA and seven analogues, i. e. bisphenol AF, bisphenol B, bisphenol E, bisphenol F, BPA diglycidyl ether, bisphenol F diglycidyl ether, and Bisphenol M in soft drinks. A one-step solid phase extraction (SPE) was effective at reducing the interferences, obtaining good purification of the samples and, consequently good recoveries of all analytes.

40|$|AbstractIn {{response}} to the increased used product disposal and scarcity of natural resources, the end-of-life (EOL) management has now becoming an important research field in manufacturing systems. The recovery operations for implementation are now more complicated than the traditional manufacturing as uncertainty of numerous sources do always exist. The process of selecting an appropriate combination of used components for a manufactured product {{is known as the}} product recovery configuration. For product recovery configuration selections, there are several possible alternatives, such as those parts and/or components to be reused, rebuilt, recycled and disposed. Each of these disposition alternatives may need to undergo various manufacturing processes in the industries. Due to the complexities of recovery operations, current <b>recovery</b> <b>decision</b> models focus mainly on the assessment in terms of cost, time, waste and quality separately. This article presents an integrated model to determine an optimal recovery plan for a manufacturer, which is to maximize its recovery value when producing a remanufactured product by considering practical constraints of the manufacturing lead-time, waste and quality as a whole. In the numerical example, the optimization model was solved using genetic algorithm. The obtained results showed that the selection of different product recovery configurations might have direct impact on the achievable recovery value of a remanufactured product for the manufacturer. Finally, the future works and contributions of this study are also briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{simplified}} procedure for simultaneous quantification of ceftiofur (CEF), fluoroquinolone (FQ) and sulfonamide (SA) antibacterials in bovine milk was developed. The reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) multiclass method {{for analysis of}} eleven distinct compounds, from three antibacterial classes, was validated in line with Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. Confirmation of the analytes identities was performed by electrospray mass spectrometry detection. The analytes were extracted from milk matrix by liquid–liquid extraction with acidified ultrapure water and directly analyzed in the chromatograph. The SA compounds were pre-column derivatized with fluorescamine for fluorescence detection. The method provided good results regarding the analytical parameters of linearity, selectivity, sensitivity, precision, <b>recovery,</b> <b>decision</b> limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), stability and robustness. Analytes were extracted by liquid–liquid extraction in the fortified matrix and the compounds identity was confirmed by their precursor ion and fragments through tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Additionally, milk samples from two state capitals in the South Region of Brazil were analyzed by both the quantitative and confirmatory methods. The validation process showed correlation coefficients (r 2) greater than 0. 98 for all the analytes, with recovery rates up to 98 % for all the studied drugs. LOD and LOQ limits ranged from 8. 0 to 20. 0 ngmL− 1 and 10. 0 to 32. 0 ngmL− 1, demonstrating good specificity of the method. The intra-day and inter-day precisions for all the analytes were below or equal to 7. 40 and 10. 13, respectively. The studied antibacterials were not detected in milk samples.

The principle objective {{of this research is}} to develop an integrated framework to incorporate the related product, process and legislative information during the end-of-life management to promote sustainable practices of processing of such waste. The research contributions are divided into three major parts. The first part reviews the relevant literature in the areas of environmental concerns related to the electrical and electronic recovery sector and end-of-life product <b>recovery</b> <b>decision</b> support tools. The second part investigates the 'Recycling Process Planning' framework which incorporates product evaluation, legislative compliance monitoring, and an ecological and economical assessmentto generate bespoke eco-efficient recycling process plans for recovery and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment The third part includes the design and implementation of a novel computer aided recycling process planner that demonstrates the application of recycling process planning framework and the associated ecological and economical assessment methodology to identify the most appropriate end-of-life options for WEEE. The validity of the research concept has been demonstrated via three case studies. The results from these case studies have highlighted the impact that the proposed recycling process planning framework could have in identifying many improvements which could be made in current recovery and recycling practices through adoption of a systematical approach for generation of recycling process plans based on the most up-to-date information and knowledge on recycling processes.

This measure was not notified to the Commission in advance and, following an investigative procedure, the Commission reached a decision requiring the recovery of aid except insofar as it had been paid either to SMEs, to firms located in designated assisted areas, concerned the employment of ‘hard-to-place’ employees or to specified municipal companies. The <b>recovery</b> <b>decision</b> was contested before the General Court. The Commission claimed that the applicants lacked standing, but this was rejected by the Court which found that belonging to a closed class of actual beneficiaries of an aid scheme affected by the obligation to repay aid was sufficient to differentiate them from all other persons. On substance, the applicants argued, inter alia, that the measures were compensation for additional costs arising from their location in the Venice lagoon (not State aid), that the Commission had failed to account of the situation of undertakings other than selected municipal companies, and that the Commission had infringed Article 107 (3) (c) in relation to regional aid. The substantive claims were rejected by the General Court. The applicants also challenged the legality of the recovery order, arguing that the measure was a mere extension in time and territory of a measure dating back to the 1970 s. This was not accepted by the General Court which accordingly dismissed the actions. The applicants appealed the General Court’s judgment before the Court of Justice. For its part, the Commission, by cross appeal, sought the annulment of the General Court’s judgment insofar as it declared the applicants’ actions admissible. The Court of Justice upheld the General Court’s ruling on the standing of the applicants, though it found that the General Court had erred in law in finding that it was not for the national authorities to verify in each individual case whether the conditions for the existence of aid were met.

Airlines typically recover aircraft schedules and disruptions in passenger itineraries sequentially. However, passengers are severely affected by disruptions and <b>recovery</b> <b>decisions.</b> In this paper, we present a mathematical formulation for the integrated aircraft and passenger recovery problem that considers aircraft and passenger related costs simultaneously. Using the superimposition of aircraft and passenger itinerary networks, passengers are explicitly modeled {{in order to use}} realistic passenger related costs. In addition to the common routing recovery actions, we integrate several passenger recovery actions and cruise speed control in our solution approach. Cruise speed control is a very beneficial action for mitigating delays. On the other hand, it adds complexity to the problem due to the nonlinearity in fuel cost function. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. We show that the problem can be reformulated as conic quadratic mixed integer programming (CQMIP) problem which can be solved with commercial optimization software such as IBM ILOG CPLEX. Our computational experiments have shown that we could handle several simultaneous disruptions optimally on a four-hub network of a major U. S. airline within less than a minute on the average. We conclude that proposed approach is able to find optimal tradeoff between operating and passenger-related costs in real time. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} Tables and Figures {{detail the}} cognitive task analysis (CTA) performed {{to determine the}} information requirements needed to support a single operator located aboard the futuristic Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). This operator is responsible for controlling four underwater unmanned vehicles {{in conjunction with a}} UAV operating on a shared network. • Table 1 is a scenario task overview that breaks the overall mission into 3 phases (planning, execution, and recovery) and then details the subtasks for each of the 3 mission phases. • Figure 1 is an event flow diagram that demonstrates what events must occur in a temporal order for each of the 3 phases. There are three basic event types in Figure 1 : 1) a loop (L) that represents a process that occurs in a looping fashion until some predetermined event occurs, 2) a decision (D) that represents some decision that is required from the LCS operator, and 3) a process (P) which requires some human-computer interaction to support the required tasks. In each event block, an alphanumeric code is included which labels that particular event type (L#, D#, P#). This label is important because later information requirements will be mapped to one of these events. • Table 2, which details the situation awareness (SA) requirements for the LCS Operator for each of the 3 mission phases and associated subtasks. Each of these SA requirements is mapped directly to one or more events in Figure 1. Because the decisions in Figure 1 represent critical events that require detailed understanding of what information and knowledge is needed to support the operator’s decision-making process, decision ladders were constructed for the diamonds and loops in Figure 1 that correspond to an involved decision process to resolve the question being posed at that stage in the event flow (Figures 2 - 4). Decision ladders are modeling tools that capture the states of knowledge and information-processing activities necessary to reach a decision. Decision ladders can help identify the information that either the automation and/or the human will need to perform or monitor a task. Decision Ladders, illustrate the need not only for the same information identified by the cognitive task analysis, but the need for several other pieces of information such as the need for visual or aural alerts in contingency situations. In Figures 2 - 4, three versions are included that detail (a) the basic decision ladder, (b) the decision ladder with corresponding display requirements, and (c) the decision ladder with possible levels of automation. • Figure 2 represents the automated target recognition (ATR) decision ladder (D 3 from Event Flow) : (a) decision ladder, (b) decision ladder with corresponding display requirements, and (c) decision ladder with possible levels of automation. • Figure 3 shows the decision ladder information and knowledge requirements for the sentry handoff (L 3 from Event Flow). • Figure 4, the UUV <b>Recovery</b> <b>Decision</b> Ladder (D 7 from Event Flow), illustrates what information is nominally needed. Since this phase was not a major focus, the decision ladder is not as detailed as it could be. This should be a point of focus in Phase II.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} disturbance management in production-inventory and supply chain systems. The study focuses on generating and analysing the <b>recovery</b> <b>decision</b> after the occurrence of a disturbance on a real-time basis. In this thesis, the developed approach was divided into several steps. At first, a plan was developed without considering any disturbance. Then a mathematical model was formulated to obtain a revised plan after the occurrence of a disturbance in the system. An efficient heuristic approach was proposed for solving the mathematical model {{in order to obtain}} the recovery plan. The mathematical model and heuristic approach were also extended to consider multiple disturbances, one after another as a series, on a real-time basis. Finally, the experimentation was conducted and the heuristic results were compared with other standard solution approaches to judge and validate the results. The framework was applied for managing production disruption: (1) in a single-stage imperfect production-inventory system, (2) in a two-stage production-inventory system, (3) in a three-stage mixed production-inventory system, and (4) in a supply chain network with multiple entities in each stage. The framework was also applied to two other models: (1) for managing demand fluctuation in a supplier-retailer coordinated system, and (2) for managing supply disruption in a three-tier supply chain system. In this thesis, three different types of disturbances were explored, namely (1) production disruption, (2) raw material supply disruption, and (3) demand fluctuation. In real-life situations, multiple disturbances, as a series, can happen at any time and at any stage of the system. This thesis considered multiple disturbances, one after another in a series, {{that may or may not}} affect the plans revised after previous disturbances. If a new disturbance occurs during the recovery time window of another, a new revised plan which considers the effects of both disturbances must be derived. Accordingly, as this is a continuous process, an extended mathematical model and heuristic approach was developed to deal with a series of disturbances on a real-time basis, by incorporating a modified version of those developed for a single disturbance. The results of the experimental analysis showed that the optimal recovery plan is highly dependent on the shortage cost parameters such as, back orders and lost sales costs, and to the disturbance duration. For a certain range of disturbance duration and cost values, it was found that back orders were more attractive, and in such cases, back orders cost was less than the lost sales cost. On the other hand, when back orders cost were more than the lost sales cost, the solution had lost sales in their recovery plan. In the final work of the thesis, a simulation model was developed to analyse the effects of different types of randomly generated disturbance events that were not known in advance. The simulation model considered all three types of disturbances, namely (1) production disruption, (2) raw material supply disruption, and (3) demand fluctuation. A good number of random experiments were conducted to judge the simulation model, and to make the simulation model closer to real-world processes. The developed approaches were tested by solving a significant number of randomly generated test problems. The sensitivity analysis was carried out for the model parameters. Two of the models, developed in two-stage and three-stage production-inventory systems, were also tested using real-life cases from a pharmaceutical company. It was found that the developed approaches were more beneficial than the company’s existing practice...|$|E
40|$|Progress on {{recovery}} {{plans to}} conserve endangered species is often blocked {{due to the}} lack of an effective framework that technical experts and other knowledgeable stakeholders can use to examine areas of agreement or disagreement about the anticipated effects of management actions. Multi-party, multi-interest resource management deliberations, although increasingly common, are difficult in the context of recovery planning due to the range of potentially affected environmental, economic, and social concerns. These deliberations are further complicated by frequent disagreements among technical experts about how to identify and address various sources of biological uncertainty. We describe the development of a decision-aiding framework as part of an inter-agency plan to assist recovery of endangered Gulf of Maine Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), using a structured decision making approach that encouraged constructive deliberations based on rigorous analysis. Results are summarized in terms of developing an explicit set of management objectives, clarifying and prioritizing hypotheses concerning barriers to recovery, comparing alternative management initiatives in light of biological uncertainty, and incorporating resource constraints to generate preferred sets of actions. Overall, the use of a structured approach to making <b>recovery</b> <b>decisions</b> improved inter-agency cooperation and facilitated dialogue, understanding, and agreement among participating experts. It also helped to create a defensible basis for further internal discussions as well as for communicating with external stakeholders, including resource users and political decision makers...|$|R
40|$|Wildlife {{managers}} are often {{required to make}} important conservation and <b>recovery</b> <b>decisions</b> despite incomplete and uncertain knowledge of the species and ecosystems they manage. Conducting further research to collect more empirical data may reduce that uncertainty. However, {{a sense of urgency}} often surrounds threatened or endangered species 2 ̆ 7 management and decisions cannot wait until a definitive understanding of a species 2 ̆ 7 ecology and distribution is obtained. Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) are proving to be valuable and flexible tools for integrating available expert knowledge and empirical data, thus strengthening conservation decisions when empirical data is lacking. We developed a BBN model and linked it to a geographical information system (GIS) to map habitat suitability for the Julia Creek dunnart (Sminthopsis douglasi), an endangered ground-dwelling mammal of the Mitchell grasslands of north-west Queensland, Australia. Expert knowledge, supported by field data, was used to determine the probabilistic influence of grazing pressure, density of the invasive shrub prickly acacia (Acacia nilotica), land tenure, soil variability and seasonal variability on dunnart habitat suitability. The model was then applied in a GIS to map the likelihood of suitable dunnart habitat. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the influence of environmental conditions and management options on habitat suitability. The study provides an example of how expert knowledge and limited empirical data can be combined within a BBN model, and linked to GIS data, to assist in recovery planning of endangered fauna populations.

40|$|Severe {{supply chain}} {{disruptions}} {{have a great}} impact on the firm. They can cause loss of sales to customers and lead to changes in the design and strategy of the supply chain. This research works focuses on supply chain disruption management. It presents an overall conceptual framework and a theoretical model, highlighting the decision making process of disruption recovery. First, the literature concepts surrounding supply chain disruptions - risk management, mitigation, crisis management, supply chain resilience, supply chain security, business continuity planning, and sustainability - are defined and differentiated, since these concepts often have overlapping factors that can cause confusion. After defining each of these concepts and the latest research findings, a framework for understanding the relationships among the concepts is developed. Second, this framework reveals a gap in the literature surrounding the disruption <b>recovery</b> and <b>decision</b> making process. While an initial disruption management model can be built using factors from the literature, data are collected by conducting multiple interviews and analyzed using a structured grounded theory methodology to produce a more complete model. This also has the effect of building theory from which propositions are developed surrounding discovery of the disruption, <b>recovery</b> team composition, <b>decision</b> making, and others. These propositions can be tested empirically in future research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of the Distributed Autonomous Replication Management (DARM) framework built on top of the Spread group communication system. The objective of DARM is to improve the dependability characteristics of systems through a fault treatment mechanism. As opposed to traditional fault tolerance frameworks, DARM focuses on deployment and operational aspects, where the gain in terms of improved dependability {{is likely to be the}} greatest. Autonomous fault treatment in DARM is accomplished by mechanisms for localizing failures and system reconfiguration. Reconfiguration is handled by DARM without any human intervention, and according to application-specific dependability requirements. Hence, the cost of developing, deploying and managing highly available applications based on Spread/DARM can be significantly reduced. DARM is novel in that <b>recovery</b> <b>decisions</b> are distributed to each individual group deployed in the system, eliminating the need for a centralized manager with global information about all groups. This scheme allows groups to perform fault treatment on themselves. A group leader in each group is responsible for fault treatment by means of replacing failed group members; the approach also tolerates failure of the group leader. The advantages of the distributed approach is: (i) no need to maintain globally centralized information about all groups which is costly and limits scalability, (ii) reduced infrastructure complexity, and (iii) less communication overhead. We evaluate the approach experimentally to validate its fault handling capability; the recovery performance of a system deployed in a local area network is evaluated. The results show that applications can recover to their initial system configuration in a very short period of time. 1...|$|R
