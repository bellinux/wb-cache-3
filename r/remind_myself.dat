She also declared plans for a bigger North American tour including Canada. Gaga explained that the show {{is supposed to be}} much bigger than the previous version.

Phipps, who gave the episode a C grade, said, [...] "This wasn’t a terrible half-hour of comedy by any stretch. It drifted by easily enough. But I’m already having to scour my notes to <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> {{of the stuff that}} was funny." [...] "Canvassing" [...] was first broadcast in Australia on Channel Seven on December 8, 2009, and received a positive review from The Sydney Morning Herald writer Mark Ellis. He particularly praised Poehler and Ansari, and said of the episode, [...] "Tune in just to hear her say to her canvassing companion, who complains it's hot and wants to cool off: 'We could blow in each other's faces.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2011, {{it first}} was {{revealed}} that Lady Gaga would make a guest appearance on the show as herself. Producer James L. Brooks viewed Gaga's interview with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes, which prompted Al Jean to write a script and send her a letter of approval {{to appear on the}} show. [...] "She was really excited about the whole thing," [...] Jean recalled. [...] "After she signed on to do it, she came in to record dialogue twice, and we showed her a rough cut the second time." [...] Recording sessions for the episode took place in Los Angeles during a period of four days from August 22–26. Gaga was initially apprehensive while recording on set, which led her to review the satirical nature of the show to get a better understanding on how to perform. [...] "Their characters are so awesomely convincing and sincere and wild and funny, I had to <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> constantly of the sincerity of the humor," [...] she explained. [...] "That's what I was trying to focus on—not putting on a character too much, and really being as sincere as I could with the lines." [...] Despite such emotions, Gaga professed that working with the staff of the show was [...] "one of the coolest things that [...] has ever done".|$|E
500|$|Silent Hill 2 {{received}} {{praise from}} video game journalists {{at the time}} of its release and in retrospect. Andy Greenwald of Spin magazine praised it as a frightening but [...] "restrained" [...] game. Jon Thompson of AllGame stated: [...] "Silent Hill 2 feels a bit rushed, and although it might not live up to the dizzying horror of the first game, it packs enough of its own punch to make it a worthy sequel." [...] IGN's Doug Perry wrote: [...] "It's frightening, deep, clever, and tries to improve the genre, if just a little, and in the end, that's all I really want in a survival horror game." [...] Joe Fielder of GameSpot concluded, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is a much prettier, somewhat smarter but less a compelling game than the original." [...] In [...] (2010), Tristian Donovan described Silent Hill 2 as the [...] "high point" [...] of the series. In a retrospective article on the survival horror genre, IGN writer Jim Sterling praised the game's plot as [...] "one of the finest examples of narrative construction in gaming to this day". In another retrospective article on survival horror, fellow IGN writer Travis Fahs credited the game as a factor in the [...] "short-lived period of renewed interest in horror games". Online game critic for [...] The Escapist Magazine Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw lists this game as among his top five favourite games of all time, praising it for its thick and unsettling atmosphere creating tension and fear for players. In his review of the game he commented, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is the game I replay every now and again to <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> that for all the shiny brown, quick-time event, RPG element space marines, gaming is still worth defending," [...] and that [...] "It's a fascinating voyage of pain and despair that leaves you emotionally drained and satisfied." ...|$|E

I know Boies doesn't use email, or at least he didn't the last time I checked.

You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful.

And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E

[...] Despite claiming that she became the [...] "heroine of the newsroom" [...] for her frankness, she later told the Sunday Times journalist Stuart Wavell that she regretted describing Terre'Blanche in these terms, not realising the political veneration that would be read into them. She pointed towards the lack of knowledge she had about the Hitler personality cult [...] "It sounds farfetched, but we are only taught South African history at school." [...] Although Wavell identified that the words were not significant compared to her other material; [...] "a perusal of her interviews shows a fondness for such extravagant language."

In the end, however, no action was taken against her, possible with consideration to foreign powers. On 4 August 1756, a delegation from the Riksdag, led by the Arch Bishop and Bishop Samuel Troilius, presented Louisa Ulrika with an note, which she was made to reply with a letter of regret. The declaration stated that [...] "she had forgotten her duty to God, her consort and the Kingdom of Sweden and that she {{was responsible for the}} blood of the recently executed".

The Arch Bishop reported, that he observed [...] "tears of rage and sorrow" [...] in her eyes.
