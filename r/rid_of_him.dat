5|$|According {{to local}} legend Marko's mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), {{sister of the}} Bulgarian voivoda Momchil (who ruled {{territory}} in the Rhodope Mountains). At Marko's birth three narecnitsi (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting {{that he would be}} a hero and replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, he threw his son into the river in a basket to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> A samodiva named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the samodivas milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a Bulgarian freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia ("dappled") and a stepsister, the samodiva Gyura. Bulgarian legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among Bulgarian epic songs, songs about Krali Marko are common and pivotal.|$|E

25|$|Once in Baghdad, however, Ouranos {{was accused}} of either trying to poison or to {{negotiate}} in secret with Skleros, and was imprisoned.

By that time, Basil Lekapenos had fallen from power and had died, and Ouranos continued to enjoy the imperial favour. He was given the rank of magistros, and his influential position is evident from the fact that Saint Athanasius the Athonite appointed him as the first lay guardian (epitropos) of his monastery of the Great Lavra.|$|E

Some of the tribes {{recognised}} a Qizilbash leader, Div Sultan Rumlu, as regent (atabeg) to the shah, but others dissented and in 1526 a bloody civil war broke out among the differing factions. Div Sultan emerged victorious but his ally, Chuha Sultan Takkalu, turned against him and urged the shah to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> On 5 July 1527 as Div Sultan arrived for a meeting of the government, Tahmasp shot an arrow at him.
