Jones made his competitive debut, standing in for the injured Hallam, as Small Heath again struggled in muddy conditions and, for the fourth time this season, lost to West Bromwich Albion.|$|E

5|$|Team Canada took {{a number}} of {{questionable}} early penalties. With two Canadians (White and Peter Mahovlich) off, Yakushev scored to give the Soviets the lead 1–0. The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he was called for interference, but Parise admitted later he was guilty of cross-checking) and emotions boiled over.

This research examines the {{experiences of}} former <b>referees</b> so that managers may better understand strategies that might encourage more <b>referees</b> to be retained. Fifteen previous basketball <b>referees</b> were interviewed about their <b>refereeing</b> experience. Ten themes emerged that were related to the sport development stages of <b>referee</b> recruitment, <b>referee</b> retention, and <b>referee</b> advancement. The results indicate that issues experienced during the retention phase (Problematic Social Interaction, Training/Mentoring, and Lack of <b>Referee</b> Community) and then at the advancing stage (Lack of Administrator Consideration, Administrator Decision Making, and Sport Policies) are linked to eventual departure from the role. Interestingly, off-court factors were reported as more influential in the decision to leave. Managerial strategies and implications are discussed...|$|R
