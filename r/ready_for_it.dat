5|$|Star Trek: Enterprise {{follows the}} adventures of {{the crew of the}} {{starship}} Enterprise, designation NX-01. They are the first deep space explorers in Starfleet, using the first Warp 5 equipped vessel. At the start of the series, it is revealed that the Vulcans have withheld advanced technology from humanity since their first contact, concerned that humans were not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> This has delayed human space exploration and caused resentment in Captain Jonathan Archer, whose father developed the Warp 5 engine but did not live to see it used.|$|E

5|$|Dax helps Worf save Kor, and {{afterwards}} takes {{possession of the}} sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot be trusted with it. The three make camp and sleep through the night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it {{would do the same}} to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main types of monastics. Those {{who live in}} monasteries under a common rule are coenobitic. Each monastery may {{formulate}} its own rule, and {{although there are no}} religious orders in Orthodoxy some respected monastic centers such as Mount Athos are highly influential. Eremitic monks, or hermits, are those who live solitary lives. It is the yearning of many who enter the monastic life to eventually become solitary hermits. This most austere life is only granted to the most advanced monastics and only when their superiors feel they are <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 1899, President McKinley {{appointed}} the First Philippine Commission (the Schurman Commission), a five-person group headed by Dr. Jacob Schurman, president of Cornell University, to investigate {{conditions in the}} islands and make recommendations. In the report that they issued to the president the following year, the commissioners acknowledged Filipino aspirations for independence; they declared, however, that the Philippines was not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Specific recommendations included the establishment of civilian government {{as rapidly as possible}} (the American chief executive in the islands at that time was the military governor), including establishment of a bicameral legislature, autonomous governments on the provincial and municipal levels, and a new system of free public elementary schools.|$|E

25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to be}} <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E
25|$|Although often grouped {{with the}} Edo Confucian scholar, Ogyū Sorai, as {{a proponent of}} the ancient {{learning}} movement, Jinsai's singlemost harsh critic {{was none other than}} Sorai. In a letter written to Jinsai, Sorai early on expressed admiration for the Kyoto philosopher and an interest in his philosophy, having read a pirated edition of Jinsai's Gomō jigi published long before Jinsai was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be released in its final form. Jinsai never responded to Sorai, apparently wounding his pride deeply. Whatever Sorai might have made of Jinsai's silence, it is clear that in Sorai's later writings, in the Bendō and Benmei (1728) in particular, Sorai takes issue with Jinsai on nearly every count, often criticizing him harshly as in effect no different in philosophical doctrine than the thinker he supposedly was criticizing, Zhu Xi.|$|E
25|$|Family {{problems}} resurface due to Bianca's sexuality, {{but this}} time from her conservative former stepmother Barbara, who denounces her lifestyle, but eventually sees the error of her ways. Bianca rebuilds her friendship with Babe upon finding out that Babe, who was pronounced dead {{as a result of}} a serial killer's killing spree, is alive. She then reciprocates the romantic feelings Zarf (later known as Zoe), a transgender lesbian rock star, has for her. Zoe later tells her that at this point in her transition process, a romantic relationship between them would not be best; Zoe is not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> and instead moves to London. Bianca decides to move to Paris to be closer to Zoe, but returns on December 26, 2007 for a brief visit, cheering her family up following their recent traumas. Bianca reveals that she and Zoe drifted apart, but she is determined to provide a stable family unit for Miranda. After bidding farewell, she departs again on December 28, 2007.|$|E

500|$|A third {{title in}} the Elder Scrolls series was first {{conceived}} during the development of Daggerfall, though it was originally to be set in the Summerset Isles and called Tribunal. Following the release of Daggerfall, it was set up around an SVGA version of XnGine, which Bethesda later used in , and set {{in the province of}} Morrowind. The game was [...] "much closer to Daggerfall in scope", encompassing the whole province of Morrowind, rather than the isle of Vvardenfell, and allowing the player to join all five Dunmer Great Houses. The blight was conceived as a dynamic force, progressively expanding and destroying cities in its wake. It was finally decided that the scope of the original design was too grand given the technology current at the time. According to Ken Rolston, something was said approximating [...] "We're not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> we don't want to jump into this and fail". The project was put on hold in 1997, as Bethesda went on to develop [...] and Battlespire, though the project remained {{in the back of the}} developers' minds throughout this period.|$|E
500|$|At the film's release at the Sundance Film Festival, {{film critic}} Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News {{compared}} {{the effect of}} Reservoir Dogs {{to that of the}} 1895 film L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat, whereby audiences supposedly saw a moving train approaching the camera and ducked. Bernard said that Reservoir Dogs had a similar effect and people were not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Vincent Canby of The New York Times enjoyed the cast and the usage of non-linear storytelling. He similarly complimented Tarantino's directing and liked {{the fact that he did}} not often use close-ups in the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times also enjoyed the film and the acting, particularly that of Buscemi, Tierney and Madsen, and said [...] "Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect." [...] Critic James Berardinelli was of a similar opinion; he complimented both the cast and Tarantino's dialogue writing abilities. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was also enthusiastic about the cast, complimenting the film on its [...] "deadpan sense of humor".|$|E
