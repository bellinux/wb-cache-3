5|$|The {{capitulation}} of Germany in May 1945 {{was followed}} by a rapid <b>rundown</b> <b>of</b> Coastal Command with the immediate disbandment of combat units and the transfer of aircraft to the RAF Transport Command. Commonwealth personnel were also sent home and the powerful Bristol Beaufighter and de Havilland Mosquito wings were reduced. The Command still maintained strong air-sea-rescue ASR and reconnaissance forces but its ASW was lopsided. With a few exceptions, only a handful of squadrons with ASW aircraft remained by January 1946.|$|E
5|$|The game {{emphasizes}} Batman's detective skills; for example, he can scan a {{crime scene}} with Detective Vision (displayed in first-person perspective) to highlight points of interest; holograms act out theoretical scenarios of the crime. The crimes can be reviewed via Batman's link to the Batcomputer in the Batcave; this allows a player to view virtual recreations of the scene from different angles (with {{the ability to move}} back and forth through the crime's timeline), view it in slow motion or pause while looking for clues to solve the crime. Small (and large) crime scenes are distributed throughout Gotham City. Reviewing the downing of a helicopter, Batman is presented with false and accurate clues; investigation of the scene can reveal that the helicopter was shot, allowing Batman to trace the bullet's trajectory to a murdered police officer and another crime scene. When a crime is solved, the player is shown a Batman-narrated <b>rundown</b> <b>of</b> the crime. The Batcave is also a hub where Batman can change costumes, upgrade his equipment and access challenge maps to practice combat (these maps were accessed separately in previous games). After completing the story mode a New Game Plus mode is unlocked, enabling a player to replay the game with all their acquired gadgets, experience and abilities; enemies are tougher, and the icon warning players of attack is disabled. Completing New Game Plus unlocks I Am the Night mode, where the game ends if Batman dies.|$|E

25|$|Top of the Pops, {{also known}} as TOTP, is a British music chart {{television}} programme, made by the BBC and originally broadcast weekly between 1 January 1964 and 30 July 2006. It was traditionally shown every Thursday evening on BBC1, except {{for a short period}} on Fridays in mid-1973 before being again moved to Fridays in 1996, and then to Sundays on BBC Two in 2005. Each weekly programme consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a <b>rundown</b> <b>of</b> that week's singles chart. Additionally, there was a special edition of the programme on Christmas Day (and usually, until 1984, a second such edition a few days after Christmas), featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year.|$|E
25|$|By 1966 {{they began}} to be painted in {{corporate}} Rail Blue with yellow ends, the change generally coinciding with a works repair and the fitting of air brake equipment, the locomotives originally having only vacuum braking (the first so treated was D9002; the last to be painted blue was D9014).

25|$|In {{order to}} give all {{employees}} the same access to decision-making, the basic organisations of associated labor were also applied to public services, including health and education. The basic organizations were usually made up {{of no more than}} a few dozen people and had their own workers' councils, whose assent was needed for strategic decisions and appointment of managers in enterprises or public institutions. The results of these reforms however were not satisfactory. There have been rampant wage-price inflations, substantial <b>rundown</b> <b>of</b> capital plant and consumer shortages, while the income gap between the poorer southern and the relatively affluent northern regions was unchanged. The self-management system stimulated the inflationary economy that was needed to support it. Large state-owned enterprises operated as monopolists with unrestricted access to capital that was shared according to political criteria. Oil crisis of 1973 magnified the economic problems, which the government tried to solve with extensive foreign borrowing. Although such actions resulted in a reasonable rate of growth for a few years (GNP grew at 5.1% yearly), such growth was unsustainable since the rate of foreign borrowing grew at an annual rate of 20%.|$|E

For the AfterElton 2008 Visibility Awards, Jack won the award for Favourite TV Character. The website commented that [...] "unlike virtually every other TV sci-fi character, lead or supporting, Captain Jack is also openly bisexual. Ironically, this [...] "small" [...] change served to help make the science fiction genre, long the ultimate bastion of straight men, accessible not just to GLBT people, but also straight women, who also enjoy the show’s alternate take on sexuality." [...] The third award won for Torchwood, after Favourite TV Drama and Character, was won by Jack and Ianto for Best Couple, for which the editor commented [...] "Torchwood is revolutionary not just because the producers dare to put openly bisexual (or in Jack’s case [...] "omnisexual") characters in the formerly sacrosanct setting of sci-fi; it’s also that it presents these bisexual characters in such an amazingly matter-of-fact way. There’s no apologiing, no minimiing, and no moraliing—just good, old-fashioned romance and adventure." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mexiletine}} were evaluated on the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP) of rat skeletal muscle fibres using patch clamp techniques.

In addition, the effects of mexiletine were tested on single channel. In the absence of ADP and UDP, mexiletine inhibited the current through maximally activated channels with an IC 50 of − 5. 58 ± 0. 3 [*]M. Nucleoside diphosphates shifted the current versus mexiletine concentration relationship to the right on the log concentration axis. UDP (500 [*]μM) was more efficacious than ADP (50 – 100 [*]μM) in this effect. At the early stage <b>of</b> <b>rundown,</b> the sensitivity <b>of</b> the channel to mexiletine was reduced and nucleoside diphosphates, particularly UDP, antagonized the effect of mexiletine. At the late stage <b>of</b> <b>rundown,</b> mexiletine did not affect the currents. At the single channel level, 1 [*]μM mexiletine reduced the mean burst duration by 63 % and prolonged the arithmetic mean closed time intervals between the bursts of openings without altering the open time and closed time distributions. Mexiletine did not affect the single channel conductance. These results show that in skeletal muscle, mexiletine is a state-dependent KATP channel inhibitor which either acts through the nucleotide binding site or a site allosterically coupled to it...|$|R
