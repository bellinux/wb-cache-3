5000|$|Roughing or Finishing: Different {{types of}} cutter are {{available}} for cutting away large amounts of material, leaving a poor surface finish (roughing), or removing a smaller amount of material, but leaving a good surface finish (finishing). A <b>roughing</b> <b>cutter</b> may have serrated teeth for breaking the chips of material into smaller pieces. These teeth leave a rough surface behind. A finishing cutter may have a large number (4 or more) teeth for removing material carefully. However, {{the large number of}} flutes leaves little room for efficient swarf removal, so they are less appropriate for removing large amounts of material.|$|E

Despite a number of advantages, these gearings are not widely used due to design and manufacture complexity. Possible options of edge cutting machining of cylindrical gearwheel arched teeth are considered. The progressive process technology proposed by the authors combines the <b>roughing</b> by multi-purpose <b>cutter</b> head for bevel gear with circular tooth and finishing by cutter head with zero angle of cutting edge...|$|R

During the primary transformation in wood industry, logs are faced with conical <b>rough</b> milling <b>cutters</b> commonly named slabber or canter heads. Chips produced consist of raw materials for pulp paper and particleboard industries. The process efficiency of these industries partly comes from particle size distribution. However, chips formation is greatly dependent on milling conditions and material variability. Numerical simulation of chip fragmentation can allow some useful chip thickness prediction. In this complex situation in wood cutting, the utilization of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is relevant. In this method, solids are modeled with spherical discrete elements linked by cohesive bonds. However the Discrete Element Method requires a previous calibration step with simple mechanical loading. For example the nature and the mechanical properties of the cohesive bonds must be determined. After an analysis of the different mechanical loadings in green wood milling, a complete study of green wood compression is carried out. This experimental study covers the strain rates range of 10 - 3 to 103 s- 1 using a hydraulic compression machine and the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar technique. Wood specimens at different moisture content states are compressed longitudinally. This study enables us to observe the viscoelastic and hygroscopic behaviour of wood. The experimental and qualitative simulation results show that elastic brittle beams are not well adapted to be used in quantitative green wood milling simulations.

Chips produced consist of raw materials for pulp paper and particleboard industries. The process efficiency of these industries partly comes from particle size distribution. However, chips formation is greatly dependent on milling conditions and material variability. Thus, this study aims at better understanding and predicting chips production in wood milling. The different mechanisms of their formation are studied through orthogonal cutting experiments at high cutting speed for beech and Douglas fir. Within these conditions, ejection of free water inside wood can be observed during fragmentation, particularly on beech. As previously seen in quasi-static experiments, chip thickness {{is proportional to the}} nominal cut thickness. Moreover, the grain orientation has a great influence on the cutting mechanisms, so as the nominal cut and the grows rings widths. This chip fragmentation study finally allows the improvement of the cutting conditions in rough milling. In order to optimize machine design as well as cutting geometry, a geometrical model of a generic slabber head is developed. This model allows the study of the effective cutting kinematics, the log-cutting edges interactions and the effective wood grain direction during cutting. This paper describes the great influence of the carriage position on cutting conditions. The results obtained here can be directly used by milling machine manufacturers.
