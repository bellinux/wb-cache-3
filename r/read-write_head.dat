50|$|This {{computer}} was 38 ft long, 20 ft wide, and used 2700 vacuum tubes for its logic circuits. Its drum memory was 8.5 in in diameter, rotated at 3500 rpm, had 200 <b>read-write</b> <b>heads,</b> and held 16,384 24-bit words (a memory size equivalent to 48 kB) with access time between 32 microseconds and 17 milliseconds.|$|R
50|$|The basic Turing machine, as {{conceived}} by Alan Turing in 1936, {{consists of a}} memory: a tape of potentially-infinite cells on which a symbol can be written and a finite control, with a <b>read-write</b> <b>head</b> attached, which scans a cell on the tape. At each step, the <b>read-write</b> <b>head</b> can change the symbol in the cell being scanned and move one cell left, right, {{or not at all}} according to instruction from the finite control. Turing machines with two tape symbols may be considered for convenience, but this is not essential.|$|E
50|$|Any {{mechanical}} process encounters limitations modeled by Newtonian physics. The {{behavior of}} disk drives {{provides an example}} of mechanical latency. Here, it is the time needed for the data encoded on a platter to rotate from its current position to a position adjacent to the <b>read-write</b> <b>head</b> as well as the seek time required for the actuator arm for the <b>read-write</b> <b>head</b> to be positioned above the appropriate track. This is also known as rotational latency and seek time since the basic term latency is also applied to the time required by a computer's electronics and software to perform polling, interrupts, and direct memory access.|$|E

In this application, a very lightweight coil of wires is mounted within a strong magnetic field produced by permanent rare-earth magnets. The voice coil is the motor part of the servo system that positions the heads: an electric control signal drives the voice coil and the resulting force quickly and accurately positions the heads.|$|R
50|$|The drive spins a PET film {{floppy disk}} at about 3000 rpm, 1 µm over a <b>read-write</b> <b>head,</b> using Bernoulli's {{principle}} {{to pull the}} flexible disk towards the head {{as long as the}} disk is spinning. In theory this makes the Bernoulli drive more reliable than a contemporary hard disk drive, since a head crash is impossible.|$|E

50|$|Superimposition (SI) during sound {{recording}} and reproduction (commonly called overdubbing) {{is the process}} of adding new sounds over existing without completely erasing or masking the existing sound. Some reel-to-reel tape recorders of the mid 20th century provided crude superimposition facilities that were implemented by killing the high-frequency AC feed to the erase head while recording as normal via the <b>read-write</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} time {{evolution}} may {{be applicable to}} other stateful systems as well. For instance, the operation of a Turing machine {{can be regarded as}} the time evolution of the machine's control state together with the state of the tape (or possibly multiple tapes) including the position of the machine's <b>read-write</b> <b>head</b> (or heads). In this case, time is discrete.|$|E
50|$|Since {{most modern}} drives spin at rates between 5,400 and 15,000 RPM, {{the damage caused}} to the {{magnetic}} coating can be extensive. At 7,200 RPM, {{the edge of the}} platter is traveling at over 120 km/h, and as the crashed head drags over the platter surface, the <b>read-write</b> <b>head</b> generally overheats, making the drive or at least parts of it unusable until the heads cool.|$|E
50|$|Lubrication loss {{is another}} source of damage to tapes. This is most {{commonly}} caused by heavy use, but {{can also be a}} result of improper storage or natural evaporation. As a result of heavy use, some of the lubricant can remain on the <b>read-write</b> <b>heads</b> which then collect dust and particles. This can cause damage to the tape. Loss of lubrication can be addressed by re-lubricating the tapes. This should be done cautiously, as excessive re-lubrication can cause tape slippage, which in turn can lead to media being misread and the loss of data.|$|R
25|$|A typical HDD has two {{electric}} motors; {{a spindle}} motor that spins the disks and an actuator (motor) that positions the read/write head assembly across the spinning disks. The disk motor has an external rotor attached to the disks; the stator windings are fixed in place. Opposite the actuator {{at the end of}} the head support arm is the read-write head; thin printed-circuit cables connect the <b>read-write</b> <b>heads</b> to amplifier electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator. The head support arm is very light, but also stiff; in modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 g.|$|R

50|$|A {{head crash}} is a hard-disk failure {{that occurs when}} a <b>read-write</b> <b>head</b> of a hard disk drive comes in contact with its {{rotating}} platter, resulting in permanent and usually irreparable damage to the magnetic media on the platter surface. It is most commonly caused by a sudden severe motion of the disk, for example the jolt caused by dropping a laptop to the ground while it is operating or physically shocking a computer.|$|E
50|$|A head {{normally}} {{rides on}} {{a thin film}} of moving air entrapped at the surface of its platter (some drives of the mid-1990s used a thin liquid layer instead). The distance between the head and platter is called the flying height. The topmost layer of the platter is made of a Teflon-like material that acts like a lubricant. Underneath is a layer of sputtered carbon. These two layers protect the magnetic layer (data storage area) from most accidental touches of the <b>read-write</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new technique}} for track-following control in hard disk drives, {{in order to achieve}} high tracking precision of magnetic <b>read–write</b> <b>heads</b> uniformly for a huge number of disk drives. The basic idea in this technique is to classify the disk drives into several sets depending on dynamics properties, and to apply a robust controller to each set. The problem of designing the optimal classification of dynamics and the corresponding optimal robust controllers is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem, for which sub-optimal solutions are to be found numerically.

Ten sectors were available at each track. it took about 10 ms to read or write a sector.|$|R

50|$|Rotational latency (sometimes called {{rotational}} delay or just latency) is the delay {{waiting for the}} rotation of the disk to bring the required disk sector under the <b>read-write</b> <b>head.</b> It depends on the rotational speed of a disk (or spindle motor), measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). For most magnetic media-based drives, the average rotational latency is typically based on the empirical relation that the average latency in milliseconds for such a drive is one-half the rotational period. Maximum rotational latency is {{the time it takes to}} do a full rotation excluding any spin-up time (as the relevant part of the disk may have just passed the head when the request arrived). Therefore, the rotational latency and resulting access time can be improved (decreased) by increasing the rotational speed of the disks. This also has the benefit of improving (increasing) the throughput (discussed later in this article).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{throughput}} of a disk subsystem {{is critical}} to the performance of a computer system. The 4. 3 BSD UNIX operating system provides a good example for looking at the heuristics that are used to optimize the positioning of the <b>read-write</b> <b>heads</b> of a disk drive. In this paper we investigate the heuristics used in the BSD hp disk driver. These heuristics are driven by three parameters that can be changed by the system manager. We investigate the interaction of these parameters with the BSD fast file system. This provides a way to see the effects of the BSD fast frle system. Finally we present the results of monitoring three active frle systems during day-to-day use, to see what effect these heuristics can have...|$|R
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of new technologies in the field of hard drives we can witness a significant increase of surface density and transfer rate of interfaces which, as a result, enables greater performance and reliability of hard disks. The reason for this are increasing needs for higher capacities and data transfer rate to or from the hard disk. This thesis presents the structure of hard drives, features, performance and reliability of hard drives and alternative data storage technologies. Particular emphasis is to develop technologies that contribute significantly to the reduction of magnetic domains on the plates, thereby increasing the surface density. In {{the first part of the}} thesis the development of hard disks over the years and the basic principles of their operation are examined. A detailed description of the structure of hard drives with all the components follows. The longitudinal magnetic recording, which was used in the past, and perpendicular magnetic recording, which is used today, are presented. Furthermore, the recording media - platters with their layer structure, <b>read-write</b> <b>heads,</b> sliders, arms and actuator, technology of parking <b>read-write</b> <b>heads</b> on or off the platters, spindle motor, hard disk controller, cache on the disk, the standard form factors of hard drives and different interfacesn are presented. Next the characteristics of hard disks are described, including the areal density and the record format on the hard disk. When talking about performance of hard drives, the emphasis is on the speed of data transmission, the average access time and the impact of cache on the hard disk performance. Followed by a chapter on the reliability of hard drives in anticipation of the possibility of errors on hard disks. The final chapter describes the alternative data storage technologies, including Hybrid hard drives, Heat-assisted magnetic recording, Self-Ordered Magnetic Arrays technology and Pixie Dust. ...|$|R

This high-speed access subsystem allowed the real-time operation. Another feature was the communications subsystem with modem links to remote sites. A Uniservo VI-C tape drive provided an audit trail for the transactions. Other Peripherals were the card reader and punch, and printer. The operator's console had the 'stop and go' buttons and a Teletype Model 33 teleprinter for communication and control.|$|R
