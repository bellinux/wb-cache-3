25|$|The {{committee}} of inspection found 21 inmates {{with only two}} having been admitted during the previous 12 months. Of the remainder, six at least had been resident {{for a minimum of}} eight years and one inmate had been there for around 25 years. Three were from outside London, six were charitable cases paid for out of the hospital's resources, one was supported by a parochial authority, and the rest were provided for by family, friends, benefactors or, in one instance, out of their own funds. The reason for the Governors' new-found interest in Bethlem is unknown but it may have been connected to the increased scrutiny the hospital was coming under with the passing of poor law legislation in 1598 and to the decision by the Governors to increase hospital revenues by opening it up to general visitors as a spectacle. After this inspection, the Governors initiated some <b>repairs</b> and <b>visited</b> the hospital at more frequent intervals. During one such visit in 1607 they ordered the purchase of clothing and eating vessels for the inmates, presumably indicating the lack of such basic items.|$|R

50|$|Work-related roadway crashes are {{the leading}} cause of death from {{traumatic}} injuries in the U.S. workplace. They accounted for nearly 12,000 deaths between 1992 and 2000. Deaths and injuries from these roadway crashes result in increased costs to employers and lost productivity in addition to their toll in human suffering. Truck drivers tend to endure higher fatality rates than workers in other occupations, but concerns about motor vehicle safety in the workplace are not limited to those surrounding the operation of large trucks. Workers outside the motor carrier industry routinely operate company-owned vehicles for deliveries, sales and <b>repair</b> calls, client <b>visits</b> etc. In these instances, the employer providing the vehicle generally plays a major role in setting safety, maintenance, and training policy. As in non-occupational driving, young drivers are especially at risk. In the workplace, 45% of all fatal injuries to workers under age 18 between 1992 and 2000 in the United States resulted from transportation incidents.|$|R
40|$|Following {{demographic}} changes and improved treatment options for cardiac diseases {{the incidence of}} congestive heart failure increases. Despite a remarkable progress in medical therapy there is still a need for surgical procedures, while heart transplantation is only available to a limited number of patients. A central issue of disease progression in heart failure is left ventricular dilation and transformation of ventricular shape to a more spherical one. The CorCap Cardiac Support Device, a preformed mesh-like polyester device, is surgically placed around the ventricles and prevents further dilation. As part of an initial safety and feasibility trial the CorCap was implanted in 29 patients. Three patients with concomitant ventriculotomy were excluded, the remaining 26 patients form the cohort for this study. The patients were divided into two subgroups, one with device placement as the only surgical measure, the other with concomitant mitral valve surgery, mainly mitral valve <b>repair.</b> Follow-up <b>visits</b> were scheduled over a period of two years, including echocardiography and assessment of cardiopulmonary functional performance. 30 -day-mortality was 7, 7 %, the survival after 2 years was 77 %. During the follow-up period a decrease of left ventricular size was observed, while the systolic function improved significantly. The functional performance increased in the majority of the patients by at least one NYHA-class. These findings were more marked in the subgroup without mitral valve surgery. The degree of mitral regurgitation improved significantly after surgical correction of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, additionally the patients without concomitant mitral valve surgery also showed a decrease of mitral regurgitation on follow-up echocardiography. Implantation of the CorCap Cardiac Support Device in heart failure patients improves symptoms and functional performance and favourably influences left ventricular size and function, indicating reverse remodeling of left ventricle...|$|R
40|$|Between 1992 and 2001, 13, 337 {{civilian}} workers died in roadway crashes, {{an average}} of 4 deaths each day. Roadway crashes led all other causes, making up 22 % of workplace deaths, compared with 13 % from homicide and 10 % from falls (Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries). In 2000, lost wages and benefits for crash victims (occupational and non-occupational) were $ 61 billion. Costs to employers due to the loss or absence of an employee from work accounted for $ 4. 6 billion more (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). For employers and victims, a workplace crash can have far-reaching financial, medical, and legal consequences. Who is at risk? Anyone who operates a motor vehicle {{as part of his}} or her job is at risk of being involved in a roadway crash. In 2001, nearly 4. 2 million U. S. workers were motor vehicle operators; 73 % were truck drivers. Roadway crashes are by far {{the leading cause of death}} for transport workers. Millions of other workers who are not full-time professional drivers operate company or personal vehicles for deliveries, sales and <b>repair</b> calls, client <b>visits,</b> and many other tasks.

40|$|In the United States, roadway crashes are {{the leading}} cause of death from unintentional injury in the general {{population}} and also in the workplace, where they accounted for 1, 347 (23. 5 %) civilian worker deaths in 2000. This document provides an overview of current issues affecting work-related roadway crashes and focuses on preventing injuries and fatalities to vehicle drivers and passengers. No single satisfactory source of data exists for worker injuries and fatalities resulting from vehicle-related roadway crashes. Specialized data systems for work-related fatalities may identify high proportions of cases but lack necessary detail about the circumstances and risk factors surrounding vehicle-related crashes. On the other hand, systems designed to collect information about all vehicle-related crashes contain more pertinent data elements but may not determine the work status of persons involved in crashes. Data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), a program of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), indicate that 11, 952 work-related highway fatalities of civilian workers occurred during 1992 - 2000, with an average annual rate of 1. 08 deaths per 100, 000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers. These fatalities increased in number by 18. 7 % from 1992 to 2000 and were {{the leading cause of}} occupational fatalities throughout the period. CFOI data indicate that workers employed in the Transportation, Communications, and Public Utilities industry division, which includes commercial trucking, were at highest risk of fatality. Those employed in transportation and material moving occupations (truck drivers in particular) had far higher fatality rates than workers in any other occupation group. Fatality risk varied across age groups; workers aged 65 or older had more than three times the fatality risk of workers of all ages, and workers aged 20 or younger (who might be expected to have lower levels of exposure to vehicles in the workplace) had fatality rates that were similar to those for workers of all ages. According to CFOI data, collisions between vehicles accounted for nearly half the fatal events, followed by noncollision events (e. g., loss of control, rollover) and collisions in which the worker's vehicle left the roadway and struck a stationary object on the roadside. Workers who were occupants of trucks accounted for 58 % of all fatalities; nearly half of these were semi-truck occupants. However, crashes involving semi-trucks affect workers in vehicles that collide with semi-trucks as well as pedestrian workers. In recent years, sharp increases in the number of large trucks on the road and in the number of vehicle miles traveled by large trucks have been accompanied by an increase in the number of fatalities involving these vehicles. Although rates of fatal crash involvement for large trucks (number of vehicles involved per 100 million vehicle miles traveled) declined from 3. 8 to 2. 6 between 1988 and 1992, they have shown little improvement since that time. Concerns about motor vehicle safety in the workplace are by no means limited to those surrounding the operation of large trucks. Workers outside the motor carrier industry routinely operate company-owned vehicles for deliveries, sales and <b>repair</b> calls, client <b>visits,</b> and countless other job tasks. In these instances, the employer providing the vehicle generally plays a major role in setting safety, maintenance, and training policy. However, when a worker drives a personal vehicle for work purposes, the employer may have little or no control over vehicle maintenance and selection. The special needs of all three types of operating environments-the motor carrier industry, other vehicle fleets, and personal vehicles used for work purposes-must be considered by companies and policy makers when formulating safety policy.
