40|$|Background/Aims: To {{investigate}} whether a daily intake of a nutrient-balanced <b>ready</b> <b>meal</b> containing 4 g of oat beta-glucans lowers total cholesterol (T-C) and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in hyperlipidemic subjects and to evaluate {{its effect on}} postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations. Methods: A parallel, placebo-controlled trial {{was carried out in}} 43 healthy men and women with elevated serum cholesterol levels. During the 3 -week run-in period, all subjects consumed daily a ready-meal soup, low in energy and fat and high in fiber but without oat beta-glucans. Subjects were then randomly assigned for the following 5 -week intervention period to either continue consumption of the control soup or an equal soup supplemented with beta-glucan. Results: Consumption of the beta-glucan-enriched <b>ready</b> <b>meal</b> decreased T-C (0. 22 +/- 0. 41 mmol/l) and LDL-C (0. 16 +/- 0. 36 mmol/l), but the reductions were not significantly lower compared with control. After a meal with beta-glucan soup, neither postprandial glucose nor insulin concentrations were significantly different from those after a control soup. Conclusion: A daily dose of 4 g of oat beta-glucans incorporated into a healthy <b>ready</b> <b>meal</b> did not significantly lower T-C and LDL-C compared with an equal <b>ready</b> <b>meal</b> without beta-glucans. Thus, if a food product fulfils general healthy dietary recommendations it may not necessarily be a candidate for supplementation with beta-glucans. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{prepared}} frozen meals {{first became}} {{widely available in}} the late 1970s.

25|$|Between 2000/2001, the Smart Price brand {{replaced}} the Asda Farm Stores budget brand {{which had been}} introduced, at first initially, into some underperforming stores back in 1993. They had consisted of products that were offered {{at a lower price}} than the equivalent famous name brand product and Asda's own brand equivalent. The Farm Stores brand originally consisted of a small number of food only products, including fresh pies and quiches, pre-packed cooked meats, dairy products such as pre-packed cheeses, yogurt and cottage cheese and a selection of frozen foods such as frozen chips, burgers, ice cream and a small range of <b>ready</b> <b>meals.</b> The range later expanded to include selected fresh fruit and vegetables, tinned goods and household cleaning products and detergents.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the autumn}} of 2016, most fresh food Smart Price {{products}} have been phased out and replaced by better quality products under the Baker's Selection, Butcher's Selection, Fishmonger's and Grower's Selection sub-brands, and the core Asda own label branding. This is {{the decision of the}} new management team to focus on better quality food products and improve customer perception of the quality of products on sale within the stores. The Smart Price brand is still used for a small number of chilled <b>ready</b> <b>meals,</b> a few selected number of ambient grocery products, and a small number of household cleaning products and accessories. The Smart Price branded products are gradually being phased out. The packaging for Smart Price products since March 2017, now has the pre-1985 Asda logo without the blue stylised 'a' wave.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the home meal {{replacements}} (HMR) consumer and investigates three HMR categories: <b>ready</b> to eat <b>meals,</b> <b>ready</b> to heat <b>meals,</b> and <b>ready</b> to cook <b>meals.</b> A nationally representative (n= 359) survey was undertaken in Taiwan amongst primary food purchasers in the households. Within each HMR category, consumers were segmented into frequency based on their level of purchase behavior. The frequency with the highest purchase level of HMR was compared with the frequency with the lowest purchase level on their food-related lifestyles about HMR. Analysis of data found {{that the importance of}} product information were found to be positively contributing to the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> to eat <b>meals.</b> The demands of freshness were found to be negatively contributing to the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> to eat <b>meals.</b> The health and quality dimensions were found to be negatively contributing to the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> to heat <b>meals</b> and <b>ready</b> to cook <b>meals.</b> The whole family dimensions were found to be positively contributing to the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> to heat <b>meals</b> and <b>ready</b> to cook <b>meals.</b> The price criteria were found to be positively contributing to the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> to cook <b>meals.</b> 隨著時間壓力的增加、烹調設備的進步與缺乏烹調餐食慾望等生活型態轉變，影響到用餐型態的選擇，對於方便性飲食需求將持續增加；在此背景下，提供取代部分或全部的家庭餐食，減少消費者食用前的處理步驟，增加料理的簡便力和省力化，讓家庭可更方便食用的家庭取代餐(Home meal replacement) 概念之產品，在未來的國內食品市場將愈趨重要。因此，本研究目的希望鎖定在家庭食品消費中居於主導地位的家庭主婦為研究對象，藉由目的為收集消費者在購買、準備和消費食品產品時的態度和行為等資訊之食品生活型態(food-related lifestyle) ，找出影響家庭取代餐購買行為之因素，並探討食品生活型態因素對家庭主婦在不同類型之HMR產品購買行為之影響關係，提供相關食品產業在制定決策時的參考。研究結果發現，在顯著影響因素方面，產品資訊的重要性對即食餐購買頻率有顯著正面影響，新鮮需求則有負面的顯著影響關係；在健康與品質導向因素中，對即熱餐和即煮餐之購買頻率皆為負向顯著影響，相反的，家人的協助因素則有正向的顯著影響關係；此外，當家庭主婦對價格的敏感度愈高時，則會提高即煮餐之購買頻率。第一章 緒論 [...] . 1 第一節 研究背景與動機 [...] . 1 第二節 研究目的 [...] . 5 第二章 文獻探討 [...] . 6 第一節 用餐型態的轉變與家庭取代餐的崛起 [...] . 6 第二節 食品生活型態 [...] 17 第三節 食品生活型態與家庭取代餐購買行為相關研究 [...] 23 第三章 研究方法 [...] 25 第一節 研究架構與假說 [...] 25 第二節 變項操作性定義 [...] 27 第三節 研究對象、範圍與取樣方法 [...] 31 第四節 問卷設計與分析方法 [...] 32 第四章 分析與結果 [...] 38 第一節 問卷回收 [...] 38 第二節 樣本敘述性統計分析 [...] 39 第三節 食品生活型態之分析 [...] 42 第四節 家庭取代餐購買行為之分析 [...] 60 第五章 結論與建議 [...] 83 第一節 研究發現與結論 [...] 83 第二節 研究建議 [...] 87 參考文獻 [...] . 90 附錄...|$|R

The application of a Pareto-optimal multi-objective genetic algorithm is demonstrated, together with its ability to produce a selection of near-optimal schedules according to the manufacturer's needs rather than a single solution. Introduction Using genetic algorithms (GAs) as an optimisation technique for solving production scheduling problems has gained popularity over the last ten years. Manufacturers demand techniques which allow them to timetable production of factory orders to varied constraints and objectives. In the <b>ready</b> <b>meal</b> industry, there is frequently no ideal method for this {{to the extent that}} some shop-floors may commonly timetable work by pencil and paper using rules of thumb. Alternative automated methods are too slow, inaccurate, difficult to implement or simply not reliable enough to provide schedules when needed in practice.
