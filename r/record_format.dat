500|$|In May 1978, Streisand {{released}} her twentieth studio album Songbird that featured the song [...] "You Don't Bring Me Flowers". Despite not being released {{as a physical}} or commercial single from Songbird, it was distributed in a 7" [...] <b>record</b> <b>format</b> on October 7, 1978. However, the version that appears on Barbra Streisand's Greatest Hits Volume 2 is a duet with American singer Neil Diamond, who {{also contributed to the}} song's lyrics. As Streisand released Songbird, Diamond recorded a version of [...] "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" [...] originally meant for his 1978 album of the same name. Because both versions of the single were recorded in the same key, American DJ Gary Guthrie combined the two songs together while playing records at a local radio station in Louisville, Kentucky. Guthrie pitched the idea to CBS Records International (the international arm of Columbia) for a $5 million contract, to which they eventually accepted, despite CBS breaching the contract initially. Their collaboration was a global, commercial success, topping the charts in both the United States and Canada. The version with Diamond has since sold more than 2 million copies in the United States.|$|E
