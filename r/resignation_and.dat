5|$|Following Blair's {{announcement}} of his <b>resignation</b> <b>and</b> Brown's bid for leadership, the Labour Party rose in {{popularity in the}} polls, gaining three points after months of low polls and trailing behind the opposition Conservative Party. However, Labour subsequently lost this lead.|$|E
5|$|Ramarayaningar {{served as}} the Chief Minister of Madras from 11 July 1921 till 3 December 1926. A. P. Patro of Berhampur was {{appointed}} to fill the vacancy caused by Subbarayalu Reddiar's <b>resignation,</b> <b>and</b> he took the portfolio of education.|$|E
5|$|The Commons {{discussed}} the Munich Agreement on 3 October.

5|$|According to Moubayed, Atrash's anti-government {{activities}} significantly {{contributed to}} Shishakli's <b>resignation</b> <b>and</b> departure from Syria in February 1954 amid the countrywide unrest. In the first post-Shishakli democratic election later that year, Atrash {{was elected to}} parliament. Atrash was offered a cabinet position in Said al-Ghazzi's September 1955 government, but he rejected the offer because of the Ba'ath Party's opposition to the government's makeup.|$|E
5|$|After a {{promising}} {{start to the}} 1996–97, Everton were beaten six {{times in a row}} after Christmas and Southall resorted to ringing up a phone-in radio show to defend manager Joe Royle from unhappy supporters. Royle dropped Southall from the team despite the show of support, though he rejected a transfer offer from Chelsea, who were prepared to double Southall's wages. Caretaker-manager Dave Watson restored Southall to the starting line-up after Royle's <b>resignation,</b> <b>and</b> steered the club away from relegation.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{remained}} in Washington {{for a few}} weeks after Congress adjourned. Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabaman serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign in light of his state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his <b>resignation,</b> <b>and</b> by the time he definitely determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.|$|E

5|$|In {{a dispute}} {{over the use of}} the forces {{defending}} the Harpers Ferry garrison, Hooker offered his <b>resignation,</b> <b>and</b> Abraham Lincoln and General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck, who were looking for an excuse to get rid of him, immediately accepted. They replaced Hooker early on the morning of June 28 with Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade, then commander of the V Corps.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1992, Solidarity {{declared}} its first strike against the democratically elected government: a one-hour strike against {{a proposal to}} raise energy prices. Another, two-hour strike took place on December 14. On May 19, 1993, Solidarity deputies proposed a no-confidence motion—which passed—against the government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka. President Wałęsa declined to accept the prime minister's <b>resignation,</b> <b>and</b> dismissed the parliament.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, Election Day for Indianapolis {{political}} offices, {{bands of}} pro-union men roved {{the city and}} vandalized property, burnt streetcars, harassed public officials, and effectively shut down {{much of the city}} in the worst violence of the strike. Sheriff Porttens again ordered the police to protect the streetcars, but another twenty-nine officers resigned; because the force was so short on men, the sheriff refused their <b>resignation</b> <b>and</b> put them on other duties.|$|E

5|$|A {{week before}} the start of the Grand Prix weekend, the News of the World alleged that Max Mosley, the {{president}} of Formula One's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), had engaged in sexual acts with five prostitutes. While Mosley denied the allegations, he cancelled his scheduled appearance at the Bahrain Grand Prix. Several teams condemned Mosley's alleged actions and asked for his <b>resignation,</b> <b>and</b> while for a time the controversy threatened to overshadow the race, Mosley eventually retained his position and successfully sued the News of the World for the report.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his <b>resignation</b> <b>and</b> the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold {{continued}} on to Philadelphia, {{where he met}} with members of Congress about his rank. His action at Ridgefield, coupled {{with the death of}} Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action, resulted in Arnold's promotion to major general, although his seniority was not restored over those who had been promoted before him. Amid negotiations over that issue, Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on July 11, the same day that word arrived in Philadelphia, that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British. Washington refused his <b>resignation</b> <b>and</b> ordered him north to assist with the defense there.|$|E

5|$|Following Whitman's <b>resignation</b> <b>and</b> DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett {{served as}} acting {{governor}} {{for three and}} a half days. During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle as much as any other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Powell {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan {{dispatched}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease tensions with Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election of Abraham Lincoln as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, {{so much so that the}} Kentucky General Assembly asked for his <b>resignation</b> <b>and</b> some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body. Both groups later renounced their actions.|$|E
5|$|He {{remained}} as unused substitute, behind Martin Olsson, throughout Sweden's disappointing group stage at Euro 2016. Following Hamréns <b>resignation</b> <b>and</b> Janne Andersson's arrival later that summer, Augustinsson got bigger competition when Oscar Wendt re-joined the squad after {{conflicts with the}} former head coach. With Andersson's experimenting of the two veterans at the left-back position {{in the beginning of}} the World Cup qualification, Augustinsson opened possibilities to join the Sweden U21 squad, for which he still was eligible to play. Andersson however kept him in the senior squad and Augstinsson came to play the final 30 minutes against Bulgaria in the qualifier in October.|$|E

5|$|Sarwar became interim leader {{following}} Lamont's <b>resignation,</b> <b>and</b> {{announced plans}} for the party to hold a leadership contest, with the winner to be announced on 13 December. Sarah Boyack became {{the first person to}} confirm that she would be standing as a candidate for party leader; she was subsequently joined by Neil Findlay and Jim Murphy. Katy Clark and Kezia Dugdale entered the deputy leadership race. Findlay was among those to call on former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to enter the contest, but he ruled out doing so. Other senior Labour figures who decided not to put their names forward included Sarwar, Jackie Baillie, and Jenny Marra.|$|E
5|$|Sloan Gibson, who {{had been}} Acting Secretary between the time of Shinseki's <b>resignation</b> <b>and</b> McDonald's taking office, is now Deputy Secretary. He said on August 6, 2014 that more punishments were planned for VA {{officials}} for their roles in the scandal. The VA announced the week prior to Gibson's statement that two supervisors would be fired and four other employees would be disciplined for their roles in falsifying data in Colorado and Wyoming. The VA previously announced plans to fire three executives at the Phoenix VA. “These were the first in what I expect {{will be a long}} series of announcements of personnel actions,” said Gibson.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{may have}} weakened Mallory politically and certainly diverted him from other duties, {{but it was}} not enough to drive him from office. Perhaps because {{there was no one to}} replace him and perhaps because he absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president, Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war. After the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his <b>resignation</b> <b>and</b> went to La Grange, Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.|$|E
