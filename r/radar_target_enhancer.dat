The HWIL simulation technology of wide-band <b>radar</b> <b>targets</b> can accurately generate wide-band <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> echo which stands for the <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> scattering characteristics and pulse modulation of radar transmitting signal. This paper analyzes the wide-band <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> scattering properties first. Since the responses of target are composed of many separate scattering centers, the target scattering characteristic is restructured by scattering centers model. Based on the scattering centers model of wide-band <b>radar</b> <b>target,</b> the wide-band <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> echo modeling and the simulation method are discussed. The wide-band <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> echo is reconstructed in real-time by convoluting the transmitting signal to the target scattering parameters. Using the digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) system, the HWIL simulation of wide-band <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> echo with high accuracy can be actualized. A typical wide-band <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> simulation is taken to demonstrate the preferable simulation effect of the reconstruction method of wide-band <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> echo.

40|$|Abstract—Identification of <b>radar</b> <b>targets</b> {{has often}} been based on {{information}} gathered from only a single relative aspect between the <b>radar</b> and <b>target.</b> However, identification performances can be significantly improved, provided that radar signals at multiple aspects are simultaneously used to identify <b>radar</b> <b>targets.</b> In this paper, we investigate performances of various approaches to iden-tification using multiaspect radar signals. In addition, some novel techniques based on the feature space trajectory concept are intro-duced to further enhance the identification performance of the con-ventional methods.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} {{sparsity}} of the reflectivity function of several <b>radar</b> <b>targets</b> of interest, efficient low-complexity automatic target recognition (ATR) {{systems can be}} designed. Such ATR systems {{would be based on}} two-dimensional (2 D) spatial target models of low dimensionality, where critical information on the <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> signature is summarized. Discrete 2 D <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> models can be estimated using high range resolution (HRR) data, measured at a sparse system of view angles. This being the main objective, incoherent tomographic processing of HRR data from a distributed surveillance system, made up of several radar nodes, is studied in this paper. A sparse angular sampling scheme is proposed, which exploits diversity due to both the distributed radar system and the target motion. The novelty is in the exploitation of this locally dense, but otherwise sparse set of viewing angles of the targets, obtained using a sparse network of radars. The de-ghosting efficiency of such a sampling scheme is demonstrated geometrically. This results in identification of minimal information resources for unambiguous estimation of a 2 D target model, useful for <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> classification.

40|$|When {{simulating}} target seekers, {{there is}} a great need for computationally efficient, target models. This report considers a study of <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> modelling based on Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) measurements of generic aircraft. The results underlie future modelling of full-size air targets. A method is developed for two-dimensional modelling of aspect-dependent target scattering. The approach taken is to generate point-scatterer models of two targets, where each point scatterer is defined according to its position and radar cross section (RCS), estimated from ISAR images. The scattered energy contributions from all point scatterers are summed to simulate a radar return signal. To validate the models, the modelled <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> centre is compared to the true <b>radar</b> <b>target</b> centre, which is determined from ISAR images.

The standard procedure for extinction pulse (-pulse) construction is based on an expansion on subsectional polynomials. In this paper it is proposed a new formalism for-pulse construction using-splines. This formalism allows the-pulse polynomial basis expansion to be treated in a unified theoretical framework and leads to a simplification of the original problem due to the linear nature of all the involved parameters. This new formulation has been also used to impose new conditions over the spectral contents of the-pulses.

40|$|Dorsal is a sequence-specific {{transcription}} factor that is distributed {{in a broad}} nuclear gradient across the dorsal–ventral (DV) axis of the early Drosophila embryo. It initiates gastrulation by regulating at least 30 – 50 target genes in a concentration-dependent fashion. Previous studies identified 18 enhancers that are directly regulated by different concentrations of Dorsal. Here, we employ computational methods to determine the basis for these distinct transcriptional outputs. Orthologous enhancers were identified {{in a variety of}} divergent Drosophila species, and their comparison revealed several conserved sequence features responsible for DV patterning. In particular, the quality of Dorsal and Twist recognition sequences correlates with the DV coordinates of gene expression relative to the Dorsal gradient. These findings are entirely consistent with a gradient threshold model for DV patterning, whereby the quality of individual Dorsal binding sites determines in vivo occupancy of <b>target</b> <b>enhancers</b> by the Dorsal gradient. Linked Dorsal and Twist binding sites constitute a conserved composite element in certain “type 2 ” Dorsal <b>target</b> <b>enhancers,</b> which direct gene expression in ventral regions of the neurogenic ectoderm in response to intermediate levels of the Dorsal gradient.
