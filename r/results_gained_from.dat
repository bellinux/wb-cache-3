In this case, the classical <b>results</b> about <b>gains</b> <b>from</b> trade hold only under additional conditions, and an example is exhibited where the opening up of trade results in a welfare loss to every consumer in one of the countries. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Spelling {{recognition}} {{has been}} used for several purposes, such as enhancing speech recognition systems and implementing name retrieval systems. Tone information is an important clue, in addition to phones, for recognizing speeches in tonal languages. In this paper, we present a method to improve accuracy of spelling recognition in Thai, a tonal language, by incorporating tonerelated acoustic features to a well-known front-end feature named Perceptual Linear Prediction Coefficients (PLP). The proposed method makes use of three kinds of tone information: fundamental frequency (pitch), pitch delta and pitch acceleration, to enhance the original features. Compared to the baseline <b>result</b> <b>gained</b> <b>from</b> the original feature, our HMMs-based recognition model shows improvement of 1. 73 %, 2. 85 % and 3. 16 % of letter accuracy for close-type, mix-type and open-type language models, respectively. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{is a lot}} {{of debate}} about the fiscal impact of the National Treasury loans to BNDES. Given that the {{interest}} rates of the loans are mostly indexed to TJLP, there is, in principle, a fiscal cost equal to the difference between TJLP and the market rates of Treasury debt. However, this calculation ignores the tax <b>gains</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> operations made possible by the Treasury loans, such as: i) profits of BNDES resulting from these transactions, which return to the National Treasury through dividends, taxes and retained earnings, ii) short-term tax gains, due to the expansion of economic output and income through the increase of investments made possible by the Treasury loans, and iii) long-term tax <b>gains</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> the fact that the economy's productive capacity will be higher in the coming years, enabling further growth without pressing demand inflation, and generating higher tax revenues. Properly calculating the tax costs and <b>gains</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> the Treasury loans of R$ 180 billion in 2009 and 2010, we show that, instead of a fiscal cost, there is a net tax gain...|$|R
