5000|$|In September 1969, Van Dyck {{returned}} to Rutgers as [...] "the oldest living Scarlet Knight" [...] for {{a celebration of}} 100th anniversary of the first college football game, played by Rutgers in 1869. At the time, Van Dyck told a reporter, [...] "Drop kicking was the great thing in those days. We played shoulder-to-shoulder in the line. The ball was heavier and of a different shape. There was no forward pass or head gear or padding except long hair {{and a bit of}} <b>rubber</b> <b>clamped</b> between the teeth." ...|$|R

40|$|Management of {{vertically}} fractured tooth or a perforation frequently poses problem during endodontic management. Such teeth {{often need}} a pre-endodontic restoration prior to initiation of root canal therapy {{to aid in}} the placement of <b>rubber</b> dam <b>clamp.</b> This paper describes a simple method of placement of a pre-endodontic restoration using the canal projection technique using hollow metallic needles as sleeves...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the result of}} an investigation on the effect of <b>rubber</b> material <b>clamp</b> of core lamination with stagger yoke on three 100 kVA three-phase distribution transformer. The investigation involves the variation of power loss, building factor and the total harmonic distortion of flux. The method that used in the measurement is a no load test. Loss {{at the core of the}} clamps of wood is lower than the core without <b>clamps</b> and using <b>rubber</b> materials <b>clamp.</b> The Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of flux is larger in the core using wood clamp material and smaller in the core assembled without clamp, over the whole flux density range. Using wood material clamp of core lamination in transformer core is more efficient than using the other two types of transformer core lamination. In which the use of rubber in addition as clamp material will increase the losses in transformer core due to the surface area of core clamp is inhibit and not easily released to air in a short period...|$|R
50|$|Buccal nerve block (long buccal nerve block) is {{indicated}} for procedures involving the mucosa {{adjacent to the}} posterior molar teeth, such as the placement of a <b>rubber</b> dam <b>clamp.</b> The injection site is distal and buccal to the third molar, with the needle penetrating 1-2mm as the nerve lies directly below the mucosa. A buccal nerve block is carried out after an inferior alveolar nerve block for specific procedures, such as extraction of mandibular molar teeth.|$|R
50|$|Background The dam is {{held over}} {{individual}} teeth {{or groups of}} teeth by appropriate <b>rubber</b> dam <b>clamps</b> over the anchor tooth. The tooth crown stands out from the rubber dam through individual holes made by a hole punch, isolating the tooth to be treated {{from the rest of}} the person's mouth which keeps the tooth dry and reduces risk of exposure to oral micro-organisms. An ink stamp is available to guide placement of the holes prior to application of the dam.|$|R
40|$|A local anesthetic-impregnated mucosal {{adhesive}} patch (DentiPatch) {{was compared}} with topical anesthetic (Hurricaine Dry Handle Swab) for gingival anesthesia before <b>rubber</b> dam <b>clamp</b> placement in children. Twenty-eight children needing sealants on their posterior teeth {{were enrolled in}} this study. Topical anesthesia was provided using either the mucoadhesive patch (20 % lidocaine) or topical anesthetic (20 % benzocaine). Subjects were randomized using a split mouth model. Either the patch or topical anesthetic {{was applied to the}} gingiva for 5 minutes or 1 minute, respectively. Subjects used a visual analog scale to describe their pain during the procedure. Linear regression and mixed linear models were used for data analysis. The visual analog scale results (pain scores) showed no significant difference between treatments. The mean per-child patch-sticking fraction was 29. 7 %. Patch adherence to oral mucosa increased with age in girls (P =. 0045), but not in boys. The DentiPatch is as effective as, although not superior to, the Hurricaine Dry Handle Swab for gingival anesthesia before <b>rubber</b> dam <b>clamp</b> placement in children. These study results would not support the use of the DentiPatch for gingival anesthesia in children because of poor adherence to oral mucosa and the extra time necessary to apply and retain the device...|$|R
5000|$|... "Hydro Power" [...] {{is a term}} {{coined by}} Buzz Bee Toys Inc., {{referring}} initially to their series of water guns that employed an elastic rubber bladder to pressurize water. Akin to the CPS system, the rubber diaphragm system can be considered basically half of a CPS-pressure chamber. A sheet of elastic material (typically <b>rubber)</b> is <b>clamped</b> against a housing unit. Water is pumped into the chamber, expanding the bladder that pressurizes the water within. However, due {{to the shape of}} the bladder, its expansion is not as uniform as in the CPS system, thus it experiences more significant pressure dropoff as the pressure chamber empties.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{peripheral}} electrical stimulation on tooth pain threshold and comfort of oral soft tissue was evaluated in 30 children, using a double-blind, crossover, study design. Tooth pain threshold was measured {{before and after}} 8 minutes of electrical or sham stimulation. Comfort of oral soft tissue during placement of a <b>rubber</b> dam <b>clamp</b> was evaluated 3 minutes after electrical or sham stimulation was begun. Comfort level was rated by each subject and by the investigator, using a visual analog scale (VAS). Heart rate was measured before and immediately following placement of the clamp. Electrical stimulation significantly increased tooth pain threshold and reduced the cardiovascular stress response without altering comfort levels during placement of the clamp. These findings suggest that peripheral electrical stimulation applied in a pediatric dental setting alters sensory aspects of pain but not affective aspects of comfort...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} suits {{were made}} of waterproofed canvas invented by Charles Mackintosh. From the late 1800s and {{throughout most of the}} 20th century, most suits consisted of a solid sheet of rubber between layers of tan twill. Their thick vulcanized <b>rubber</b> collar is <b>clamped</b> to the corselet making the joint waterproof. The inner collar (bib) was made of the same material as the suit and pulled up inside the corselet and around the diver's neck. The wrist cuffs are also made of vulcanized rubber.|$|R
5000|$|A 90º elbow, {{also known}} as a [...] "90 bend", [...] "90 ell" [...] or [...] "quarter bend", {{attaches}} readily to plastic, copper, cast iron, steel, and lead, and is attached to <b>rubber</b> with stainless-steel <b>clamps.</b> Other available materials include silicone, rubber compounds, galvanized steel, and nylon. It is primarily used to connect hoses to valves, water pumps and deck drains. A 45º elbow, {{also known as}} a [...] "45 bend" [...] or [...] "45 ell", is commonly used in water-supply facilities, food, chemical and electronic industrial pipeline networks, air-conditioning pipelines, agriculture and garden production, and solar-energy facility piping.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Gastrointestinal {{nematodes}} (GIN) {{hinder the}} sustainable production of small ruminants on pasture and parasite resistance to chemical dewormers {{is becoming a}} growing concern. Condensed tannin containing legume forages are being tested to evaluate their anti-parasitic properties and potential contribution to an overall parasite control program for small ruminants such as sheep and goats. One of the most pathogenic GIN of small ruminants is Haemonchus contortus. The final step to full infectivity of H. contortus third stage larvae (L 3) is exsheathment in the rumen. The objective {{of this study was}} to establish an in-vivo exsheathment assay in fistulated sheep as a tool to evaluate the ability of several varieties of birdsfoot trefoil, a condensed tannin containing forage, to inhibit the exsheathment of H. contortus L 3. Methods: The larvae used in the experiment was harvested from the feces of infected donor lambs using a modified Baermann’s technique. In addition, two in-vitro exsheathment assays using either dilute bleach solution or overnight incubation after exposure to CO 2 were used for comparison against in-vivo exsheathment. Three different methods of containment of the infective L 3 in a porous PVC tube within the rumen were evaluated. 1) Histology cassettes fitted with nylon mesh with a pore size of 8 microns. 3000 larvae were pipetted into the cassettes and the cassettes sealed. To prevent the escape of L 3 various methods of sealing the cassettes were tried including super glue, <b>clamps,</b> <b>rubber</b> bands, and clay. 2) Dialysis tubes. 2000 larvae were pipetted into dialysis tubing with varying molecular weight cut offs (50 to 1, 000 kD). 3) Small (5 ml) polypropylene sample jars with 8 micron mesh cover. 2000 L 3 pipetted into polypropylene sample jars covered with an 8 micron mesh. Each method was tested by suspending the larvae in the various containment systems within a porous PVC tube and then removing a container after 60 and 120 minutes of incubation within the rumen. The percentage of viable and exsheathed infective L 3 larvae were determined by microscope. Criteria used to evaluate the efficacy of containment were the percent of recovered L 3 from the containment system and the percent of total L 3 exsheathed. Results: Results from the histology cassette technique show that, although some L 3 were exsheathed, the histology cassettes were not able to be sealed to the degree necessary to prevent L 3 from escaping, thus potentially infecting the sheep. Results are still pending on the other two methods as we continue to collect data. Conclusion: Development of an in-vivo exsheathment assay is critical in determining the anthelmintic efficacy of condensed tannin containing legume forages. In order to see if the forages affect exsheathment it is necessary to have an in-vivo assay that is able to provide reliable control-exsheathment from which you can compare exsheathment statistics after being fed the forages...|$|R
