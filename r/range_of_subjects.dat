5|$|Colleges {{arrange the}} {{tutorial}} teaching for their undergraduates, {{and the members}} of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>subjects.</b> Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).|$|E

McLachlan would later sell his stake in Omni, but remains proud of their documentary work. At the time, McLachlan was unsuccessful in joining an industry union, relegating his work to advertising and small-scale productions; his first union-backed project was on {{the revival of the}} television series Sea Hunt.|$|E

Reed's association with the B.O.P. lasted {{for the remainder of}} his life; the magazine would be the initial publisher for almost all his subsequent output of fiction. This commitment to the B.O.P. delayed progress on his History of the Old English Letter Foundries, especially as Reed began writing regular columns and book reviews for the Leeds Mercury, now edited by his cousin, the younger Edward Baines.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the first}} ten years of the society's existence, the {{organization}} grew in membership and held meetings {{at least twice a}} month, and usually four times a month. The society debated an extensive <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> including scientific, religious, political, and social topics, often violating the constitution's rules banning religious and political subjects. The society's debates were often acrimonious and regularly spilled beyond the confines of the meetings and into the community. Between January 30, 1819 and January 22, 1830, the society's membership rolls reached 52 members; although as few as 15 members attended the bimonthly meetings, and no more than 17 members were ever present at a meeting.|$|E

5|$|Samuel Escue Tillman (October 3, 1847 – June 24, 1942) was an astronomer, engineer, {{military}} educator, {{and career}} {{officer in the}} United States Army who spent 30 years teaching at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.

5|$|Gilbert's {{successor}} in 1842 was Richard Harrington, who {{inherited a}} college in good shape: income was around £15,000; only Christ Church was significantly bigger in size. Academic reforms, {{particularly with regard}} to examinations– which were to be administered by the university, rather than the college– were instituted across Oxford {{in the first half of}} the century. Brasenose's proportion of first-class degrees fell sharply from its previous peak. By 1850, no matriculation exam was instituted at Brasenose, as at other colleges, although the other examinations were altered: responsions moved forward and moderations instituted. Brasenose, like the University, was yet to truly reform the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> studied, however. It was only in 1849 that modern sciences were only given a separate School (and thus examination) in 1849; law and modern history a year later.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, Prescott {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} a legal career because of the continued deterioration of his eyesight, and resolved to devote himself to literature. Although he initially studied a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>subjects,</b> including Italian, French, English and Spanish literature, American history, classics and political philosophy, Prescott came to focus on Italian poetry. Among the works he studied during this period were such classics as Dante's Divine Comedy and Boccacio's Decameron. His first published works were two essays in the North American Review—both discussing Italian poetry. The first of these, published in 1824, was titled Italian Narrative Poetry, and became somewhat controversial after it was heavily criticized in an Italian review by Lorenzo Da Ponte, the librettist of Mozart's Don Giovanni. Prescott wrote a succinct reply to Da Ponte's fifty-page argument in the North American Review of July 1825. Da Ponte published the criticisms as an appendix to his translation of Dodley's Economy of Human life, which resulted in Prescott noticing them rather late.|$|E

5|$|Taper was not Levin's {{only work}} for The Spectator. He wrote {{on a wide}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>subjects,</b> from a {{campaign}} {{for the release of}} three Arabs imprisoned by the British authorities, to supporting publication of the banned novel Lady Chatterley's Lover, and denunciation of the retired Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard. The last led to a secret meeting of more than 20 senior judges to see whether Levin could be prosecuted for criminal libel; there was no prosecution, and his accusations about Goddard's vindictiveness, deceit and bias have relatively recently been claimed to have been justified. In 1959, Gilmour, while remaining as proprietor, stepped down as editor and was succeeded by his deputy, Brian Inglis; Levin took over from Inglis as assistant editor. Later in that year, after the general election victory of another of his bêtes noires, Harold Macmillan, Levin gave up the Taper column, professing himself to be in despair.|$|E
5|$|The Leges Henrici Primi or Laws of Henry I {{is a legal}} treatise, {{written in}} about 1115, that records the legal customs of medieval England in the reign of King Henry I of England. Although {{it is not an}} {{official}} document, it was written by someone apparently associated with the royal administration. It lists and explains the laws, and includes explanations of how to conduct legal proceedings. Although its title implies that these laws were issued by King Henry, it lists laws issued by earlier monarchs that were still in force in Henry's reign; the only law of Henry that is included is the coronation charter he issued at the start of his reign. It covers a diverse <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>subjects,</b> including ecclesiastical cases, treason, murder, theft, feuds, assessment of danegeld, and the amounts of judicial fines.|$|E

The College of Visual and Performing Arts was renamed in honor of the contributions by the J.
