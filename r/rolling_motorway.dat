40|$|The paper {{reports on}} a {{research}} project aimed at estimating the potential demand for a <b>rolling</b> <b>motorway</b> service connecting Trieste (Italy) and Chop (Ukraine). More specifically, the study has explored which factors {{play a role in}} the choice between the current prevailing mode of transport, that is road transport by trucks, and a <b>rolling</b> <b>motorway</b> service. Based on the estimates derived from a discrete choice model obtained on the basis of stated choice data collected from truck drivers and from transport companies, it is found that the monetary cost, the travel time and the day of the week play an important role. The scenario analysis allows us to conclude that under the current prices and regulations a <b>rolling</b> <b>motorway</b> service operating on a weekday would have no potential demand, whereas some potential demand would have a service operating during the weekend. Substantial demand for a <b>rolling</b> <b>motorway</b> service appears only if the monetary road cost (fuel cost or highway toll) increases considerably. A heavy-vehicle road tax equivalent to the one used for crossing the Alps in Switzerland and Austria would alter the balance in favor of the <b>rolling</b> <b>motorway.</b> Rail transport, modal choice, road transport, <b>rolling</b> <b>motorway.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} a {{consistent}} and strong political consensus that intermodal transport (in-termodal rail transport, specifically) should play {{a greater role in}} the movement of freight across continental Europe, the available statistics (especially) for the <b>rolling</b> <b>motorway</b> (RoMo) show only a moderate absolute increase over time and a worrying decrease in the last years. Understanding why that happened {{and what can be done}} about it is a challenging task for transport analysts. This paper adds to the existing literature - not very abundant for the <b>rolling</b> <b>motorway</b> - by illustrating, as a case study, the planned introduction of a new RoMo service, connecting Trieste Fernetti (Italy) with Chop (Ukraine). Sharing the difficulty common to freight mode choice studies in gathering a sufficiently large sample, only 42 valid interviews with freight forwarding and transport companies and truck drivers could be collected. However, the stated-preference interviews, generated via an efficient design, allowed us to estimate a quite robust mixed logit model containing several attributes of interest. The results indicate that: a) on average, road transport is, ceteris paribus, much preferred to RoMo both by freight forwarding and transport companies and truck drivers, with the first showing a stronger adversity towards RoMo; b) travel time and monetary costs are important variables for both actors; c) highway toll is a very sensitive variable especially for the freight forwarders and transport companies; d) differently from the truck drivers, the freight forwarders and transport companies appreciate the possibility of using the RoMo service on weekends. A simple simulation performed with the estimated model allowed us to conclude that, under the current circumstances, the probability that a RoMo service between Trieste Fernetti and Chop be used is close to zero. A road toll increase of € 300 euros would not change the probability of using the RoMo. Only an increase of € 660 euros, setting the road toll to a level equivalent to that imposed in Switzerland or Austria, where it is motivated by the need of protecting the fragile Alpine valleys, would increase to 29...|$|E
