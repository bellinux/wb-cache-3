5|$|Richard Nixon's jowly, beard-shadowed face, the {{ski-jump}} {{nose and}} the widow's peak, the arms upstretched in the V-sign, {{had been so}} often pictured and caricatured, his presence had become such a familiar one in the land, {{he had been so}} often in the heat of controversy, that it was hard to realize the nation <b>really</b> <b>would</b> not 'have Nixon to kick around anymore'.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be {{as he would have}} been high up in the mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he <b>really</b> <b>would</b> have been in the situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E
25|$|In the 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, Brando {{claims to}} have rewritten most of the script. This would be Brando's last great film. He would begin making poorer, more outlandish {{character}} choices, and being fed lines through an earpiece. Whether Brando really did save the film, after this he <b>really</b> <b>would</b> be difficult to work with, not out of technique, but out of laziness. Brando admits that his heart {{was no longer in}} it for the most part at this point in his career and with his family issues, personal problems, and social issues.|$|E

25|$|Here, CR33 intersects {{and joins}} US 202 {{for a third}} of a mile before turning north. It crosses CR 94 in {{downtown}} Garnerville. In fact, this used to be the former eastern terminus of CR94, until it was extended beyond US 9W/US 202 in West Haverstraw. CR33 then proceeds into the town of Stony Point for the final mile and a half of its run. It intersects CR 98 and CR 100 before coming to an end at CR 106. It <b>really</b> <b>would</b> be impossible to extend CR33 further north as Bear Mountain State Park lies close to its northern terminus.|$|E

500|$|The Castafiore Emerald was {{the first}} book in The Adventures of Tintin that was {{published}} in England the same year [...] 1963 [...] {{it was published in}} Belgium and France. When Hergé read the English version of the book, he found it to be [...] "absolutely delirious" [...] and even suggested to the book's translator, [...] "You <b>really</b> <b>would</b> think that this was originally written in English."

500|$|In a November 2013 {{interview}} with Q, Lorde expressed frustration about [...] "certain things about music": [...] "There {{are a lot}} of shock tactics these days. People trying to outdo each other, which will probably culminate in two people fucking on stage at the Grammys." [...] Following the release of Pure Heroine, she also described herself as a [...] "sex-positive" [...] person, elaborating:People like to paint me in a certain way, but I'm a hugely sex-positive person and I have nothing against anyone getting naked. For me personally I just don't think it <b>really</b> <b>would</b> complement my music in any way or help me tell a story any better. It's not like I have a problem with dancing around in undies—I think you can use that stuff in a hugely powerful way. It just hasn't felt necessary for me.|$|E

500|$|... {{utterance}} of 'you're my James Dean / {{you make}} me feel like I'm seventeen' on 'Rather Die Young' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides. Certainly, the 'bad boy' Beyoncé is in love with is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who 'drive too fast' and 'smoke too much' than an actual person, but at least it feels tangible. For once, the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn't feel like a total fraud. Forget Lady Gaga's song about her relationship with her father or Britney Spears' lullaby to her babies – here, I'm convinced, if only for a moment, that Beyoncé <b>really</b> <b>would</b> rather die young than to live her life without her lover, that she cares, even if you don't. This doesn't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is, but it does convey just how convincing Beyoncé can be when given the right tools – {{and it turns out that}} those tools consist of not much more than Beyoncé's voice itself.|$|E
500|$|Temple of the Dog was {{released}} on April 16, 1991, through A Records and initially sold 70,000 copies in the United States. Ament recalled that A requested a Pearl Jam sticker be on the cover—as they had just picked their new name—because [...] "it'll {{be a good thing}} for us", but they refused. The album received favorable reviews but failed to chart. Critic Steve Huey of AllMusic later rated the album with four-and-a-half stars out of five, stating that the [...] "record sounds like a bridge between Mother Love Bone's theatrical '70s-rock updates and Pearl Jam's hard-rocking seriousness." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone also wrote in retrospect that the album [...] "deserves immortality." [...] The band members were pleased with the material, as it achieved its purpose; Cornell believed that [...] "Andy <b>really</b> <b>would</b> have liked" [...] the songs, and Gossard also asserted that he thought Wood would be [...] "blown away by the whole thing". Soon after the album's release, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam embarked on recording their next albums, and the Temple of the Dog project was brought to a close.|$|E
500|$|Invincible {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from mainstream critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received a mixed score of 51 based on 19 reviews. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented {{that it has}} a [...] "spark" [...] and [...] "sound better than anything Jackson has done since Dangerous." [...] Erlewine noted that while the album had good material it was [...] "not enough to make Invincible the comeback Jackson needed - he <b>really</b> <b>would</b> have had to have an album that sounded free instead of constrained for that to work - but it does offer a reminder that he can really craft good pop." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly, felt that Invincible is Jackson's [...] "first album since Off the Wall that offers virtually no new twists" [...] but remarked that the album [...] "feels like an anthology of his less-than-greatest hits". James Hunter of Rolling Stone critiqued that the album's later ballads made the record too long. Hunter also commented that Jackson and Riley made [...] "Whatever Happens" [...] "something really handsome and smart", allowing listeners [...] "to concentrate on the track's momentous rhythms" [...] such as [...] "Santana's passionate interjections and Lubbock's wonderfully arranged symphonic sweeps". Mark Beaumont of NME called it [...] "a relevant and rejuvenated comeback album made overlong", while Blender also found it [...] "long-winded".|$|E

500|$|The Broadway {{production}} {{opened on}} October 30, 2003, to mixed to positive reviews from theatre critics. Menzel and Chenoweth received nearly unanimous praise for their performances as Elphaba and Glinda. Both USA Today and Time Magazine gave the Broadway production of Wicked very positive reviews, with Richard Zoglin of Time saying, [...] "If every musical had a brain, a {{heart and the}} courage of Wicked, Broadway <b>really</b> <b>would</b> be a magical place." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today described it as [...] "the most complete, and completely satisfying, new musical I've come across in a long time." [...] Conversely, Ben Brantley in the New York Times loved the production but panned the show itself, calling it a [...] "sermon" [...] that [...] "so overplays its hand that it seriously dilutes its power," [...] with a [...] "generic" [...] score. He noted that Glinda is such a showy role that the audience ends up rooting for her rather than the [...] "surprisingly colorless" [...] Elphaba, who is [...] "nominally" [...] the hero. Despite these mixed reviews, interest in Wicked spread quickly by word-of-mouth, leading to record-breaking success at the box office, as described below. Speaking to The Arizona Republic in 2006, Schwartz commented, [...] "What can I say? Reviews are reviews.... I know we divided the critics. We didn't divide the audience, and that's what counts." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Ryder {{hinted at}} a {{possible}} {{return for the}} sequel as well by saying, [...] "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy {{but it sounds like}} it might be happening. It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I <b>really</b> <b>would</b> like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E
500|$|Alyssa Rosenberg of ThinkProgress {{said that}} {{although}} {{it is common to}} see pop stars being assaulted by men in their videos —exemplifying Rihanna's [...] "Man Down"— the public is aware of Spears's vulnerability, explaining that [...] "we believe she <b>really</b> <b>would</b> choose a guy who would do something like this to her." [...] Rosenberg also stated even though her bad behaviour once she leaves her boyfriend is not directed at him, the fact that he treated her badly is a form of narrative permission for her to rob a store and have sex with the criminal. She also commented that the same narrative works on her previous video with Marrs Piliero for [...] "I Wanna Go". The video received comparisons to Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love", which was released two days after [...] "Criminal", on October 19, 2011. Among the similarities, critics noted that they were both filmed in the United Kingdom and arose controversy in the country; both contain scenes of sex, violence and crime; both feature bad boy archetypes and both evoke the personal lives of the artists. Katherine St Asaph found the opening line of Spears's boyfriend ("Would you try smiling just once?") a subtle dig at the press. She explained that there is a tendency among writers and spectators to call [...] "her every smile plastered on or conservator-mandated", and that the fact the line is delivered by her abusive boyfriend only makes it more evident. According to her, that there are two contradictory ways to analyze the relationship between Spears and Trawick as the criminal: it could be seen as him luring her into her life, but Spears is the one that kisses him and she is the first to pull the gun.|$|E
