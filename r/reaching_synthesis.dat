As a “baroque” artist, his work falls within a fusional approach to artistic creation, while revealing his search for formal perfection and plastic equilibrium. Economy of means and aesthetic perfection being of great concern for him, Barbeau still needs to express emotions in an elated way and refers to the unconscious, even in his paintings, let them be optical, geometrical, minimalist or serial.

All these features make definition of target design solution harder and reveals the complexity of reality as a process that requires creativity. In Gestalt school of thought, students are not limited with simple logic approaches or simple reasoning strategies. They are encouraged to effective, productive and functional way of thinking by learning creative thinking. Gestalt school aims to teach students a way of discovering the principles in solving problems and adopting this experience throughout their life.

This paper addresses the question of who would be suitable for the role as a corporate user representative, i. e. what is required to fill the role. Drawing on an in-depth interpretive study from the oil industry, this paper contributes by augmenting our view of the corporate user representative as a multidimensional social actor. The case is from an innovative integration of ECM with collaboration technology. With a state-of-the-art combination of technologies, the task of representing 26. 000 users proved to be a challenge.

Only by discarding intellectualism and embracing simple values is Herzog finally able to regain peace. This thesis analyses three elements vital to Herzog's journey. Chapter 1 demonstrates that although the protagonist frequently criticises Heidegger's "fall into quotidian," he himself has become unable to participate in quotidian matters. Chapter 2 details how Herzog's memories of childhood are revealed {{to be the source}} of his implicit understanding of the truth about people and life. Chapter 3 considers how Bellow employs humour to relieve the tension inherent to Herzog's struggles; further, it observes how the novel's ironic tone fades once the protagonist begins to discard his burdensome egotism and recognise the worth of the real world and other individuals...|$|R

The available documents suggest that Hitler temporized between two approaches {{to the question of}} the Churches. On the one hand, the predominant radical elements in the Party wanted to reduce clerical influence in German society as quickly as possible—and by force if necessary.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{grounded}} theory study was to learn how students in an explicitly integrative learning environment make meaning of and understand integrative learning. The research questions that guided this study included: Do students experience integrative learning? If so, how do students experience integrative learning, and which experiences do students identify as contributing {{to their ability to}} integrate? What challenges and successes do students experience with integrative learning? Consistent with constructivist grounded theory methodology (Charmaz, 2000, 2006). I developed an emerging theory about students' experiences with integrative learning that is grounded in the data. I interviewed 10 students enrolled in an Integrative Studies program at a university in the greater Washington, DC region. Students in this study defined integrative learning very broadly. To capture the range of learning described by students, I created a continuum of different forms of integration that vary by complexity: application, comparison, understanding context, and synthesis. A developmental theory of integrative learning emerged from this study. Students engaged in the least complex form of integration, application, by finding their coursework personally relevant and applying what they learn to their own lives. Through class discussion and reading students identified multiple perspectives, which led to integration as comparison. When different perspectives are in conflict, students began to engage in integration as understanding context. Context is an important consideration when evaluating competing claims and evaluating arguments. By reconciling conflict, students may reach the most complex form of integration: synthesis. Students needed to wrestle with the ambiguity and complexity and resist automatically adopting an externally provided solution from a trusted authority figure. Students in this study rarely if ever <b>reached</b> <b>synthesis,</b> but they agreed that it was an ideal. Students' level of cognitive complexity as well as their pattern of Integrative Studies course work affected students' progress with integrative learning. By listening to student voices, I learned about the Integrative Studies program as students experience it and compared it to faculty expectations. This study both celebrates program strengths and offers recommendations for improvement. I discuss the implications of this for future research and higher education practice...|$|R

We performed acylation experiments on three amino-alcohols (alaninol, 4 -amino- 1 -pentanol and 6 -amino- 1 -hexanol) using myristic acid as an acyl donor. Two organic solvents (tert-amyl alcohol and n-hexane) and one ionic liquid (1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate: Bmim [PF 6]) {{were used to}} determine the effect of the solvent. The influence of the amino-alcohol carbon chain length between the alcohol and amino groups on chemoselectivity C (kcat,app O-acylation/kcat,app N-acylation) was highlighted. N-acylation is improved using alaninol, a short chain amino-alcohol (no mono-O-acylation in tert-amyl alcohol and C = 0. 12 in n-hexane) whereas O-acylation is improved using 4 -amino- 1 -pentanol and 6 - amino- 1 -hexanol which are amino-alcohols with longer chain (C = 10. 5 in tert-amyl alcohol and C = 539 in n-hexane). On the other hand, the production of the acylated amino-alcohols after 96 h of reaction was shown to be strongly affected by the solvent nature and the amino-alcohol structure: starting from alaninol as an acyl acceptor, the yield of amide <b>synthesis</b> <b>reaches</b> up to 98 % in tert-amyl alcohol using 0. 7 equivalents of myristic acid while the yield of amido-ester <b>synthesis</b> <b>reaches</b> up to 88 % in Bmim [PF 6] using 1. 75 equivalents of myristic acid...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is in the area of Supply Chain Collaboration (SCC). More precisely we studied the TeleCom Installation Services supply chain in the case company Digita Oy. Our goal was to identify the key elements to be considered when pursuing towards SCC; highlight the development areas in Supply Chain Management (SCM) in the case company; study how the SCC efforts can improve SCM in the case company; and construct a Collaboration Based SCM Framework for the case company. Overall aim of the framework was to improve visibility and efficiency of the supply chain, as well as, improve material management. Such a study is important in order to fulfill a gap in existing research in that {{there is a lack of}} consensus in the definition of SCC, which causes variation in understanding the concept, as well as, difficulties in implementing such initiative. In addition, SCC initiatives are company and supply chain specific. Also, most of previous research has concentrated on a few industries and a majority of the companies that have successfully implemented SCC approaches fall into the large enterprise category. This, in other words, means that these approaches might be unsuitable for smaller companies, such as Digita Oy. Therefore, the evidence suggests that there was a need for empirical research. The research approach adopted in this dissertation was case study and it included extensive review of relevant literature, as well as, collection and analysis of empirical data obtained from Digita supply chain setting. Primary focus of the empirical work was to gather data by interviews of senior staff from various organisations within the Digita supply chain. In addition, data was collected from company internal systems, documents, project groups and meetings. Finally the findings of both review of literature and empirical research were compared to <b>reach</b> <b>synthesis.</b> The main findings and conclusions drawn from this study are that there are certain key elements that should be considered in Supply Chain Collaboration, as well as, every company should approach adopting it in a different way. In addition, empirical study indicated that Digita has experienced challenges in their overall supply chain activities, and expecially in material management. Therefore, this dissertation recommended that Digita adopts the Updated Collaborative SCM Framework, presented in this thesis, where an influential and impartial logistics integrator would operate as a moderator and information furnace in the supply chain.

Consistent with the H+/ATP ratio, cryoelectron micrograph images of 2 D crystals of the membrane-bound rotor ring of the V-ATPase at 7. 0 -Å resolution showed the presence of 12 Vo-c subunits, each composed of two transmembrane helices. These results indicate that symmetry mismatch between the rotor and catalytic domains is not obligatory for rotary ATPases/synthases...|$|R
