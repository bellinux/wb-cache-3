5|$|When {{animals are}} faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the {{discounting}} of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.|$|E

5|$|With feed-in tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> number of kilowatt-hours produced {{over a long period}} of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{a portion of}} the mountain, the player reaches a basecamp intermezzo with multiple opportunities for collecting new abilities. The player can trade minerals for abilities in the store, and choose between two abilities to receive for free. The basecamp also contains minigames, such as a shooting range, a gambling device, and optional sidequests, which <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> player with shortcuts to later stages in subsequent playthroughs for completing challenges such as finishing a level within a time limit or without receiving damage.|$|E

Homer desperately tries to prevent the letter from reaching Mr. Burns, but fails. Mr. Burns becomes furious and demands that Homer be beaten.

50|$|Ivan Pavlov was a {{psychologist}} who used <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> system to study classical conditioning. Pavlov used <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> system by rewarding dogs with food after they had heard a bell or another stimulus. Pavlov was <b>rewarding</b> <b>the</b> dogs so that the dogs associated food, <b>the</b> <b>reward,</b> with <b>the</b> bell, the stimulus.Edward L. Thorndike used <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> system to study operant conditioning. He began by putting cats in a puzzle box and placing food outside of the box so that the cat wanted to escape. The cats worked {{to get out of}} the puzzle box to get to the food. Although the cats ate the food after they escaped the box, Thorndike learned that the cats attempted to escape the box without <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> of food. Thorndike used <b>the</b> <b>rewards</b> of food and freedom to stimulate <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> system of <b>the</b> cats. Thorndike used this to see how the cats learned to escape the box.|$|R

5|$|Despite having aided Togashi Masachika in {{his return}} to power, within a year the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga fell into {{conflict}} with him. Claiming that he failed to adequately deliver on his promises of economic <b>reward,</b> <b>the</b> Ikkō-ikki of Kaga revolted in 1474. Rennyo refused to support these rebellions, and the Ikkō-ikki were quickly defeated and forced to take refuge in neighboring Etchū. Shimotsuma Rensu, a ji-samurai from Echizen and an advisor to Rennyo, led another revolt, falsely claiming that Rennyo authorized his actions. This revolt also failed, and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{similarities}} {{however, the}} gameplay offered many new changes. Instead of collecting four Jet Pods, the player-character must rescue four MuuMuus in each level before exiting. Another new addition {{is the new}} interface, which displays one of Robbit's travelling AI companions, a health bar, a timer and a jump-meter that displays {{whether or not the}} player is eligible for a triple jump. Other new additions include the power orbs as an added power-up and the ability to obtain Performance Medals. A certain Performance Medal may be awarded depending on how the player completes a level. For example, playing through a single level without firing any weapons will <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> player with the Flower Child medal. There are a total of twelve medals to collect.|$|E
5|$|Deus Exs {{gameplay}} combines {{elements of}} the first-person shooter with stealth elements, adventure, and role-playing genres, allowing for its tasks and missions {{to be completed in}} a variety of ways, that in turn lead to differing outcomes. Presented from the first-person perspective, the player can customize Denton's various abilities such as weapon skills or lockpicking, increasing his effectiveness in these areas; this opens up different avenues of exploration and methods of interacting with or manipulating other characters. The player is able to complete side missions away from the primary storyline by moving freely around the available areas, which can <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> player with experience points to upgrade abilities and alternative ways to tackle main missions.|$|E

5|$|In a {{gameplay}} mode {{exclusive to}} Western releases, the Arcade mode converts {{the game in}} a traditional fighting game, with all RPG elements removed and characters' abilities being stripped down to the basics to balance the playing field. Within the Arcade Mode, there are three tiers: Normal, Hard, and Time Attack; beating any tier of the Arcade mode will <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> player with PP (player points) and special items {{that can be used}} in story mode. All characters, including villains, are playable in Arcade mode; for example, Golbez, Sephiroth, Kuja, and Jecht are available for use in this mode from the start, but they still need to be bought via the PP Catalog for use in other modes.|$|E
5|$|In early 1973, {{with the}} ransom money still missing, The Oregon Journal republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 {{to the first}} person to turn in a ransom bill to the {{newspaper}} or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the Post-Intelligencer made a similar offer with a $5,000 <b>reward.</b> <b>The</b> offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.|$|E

5|$|Light gun {{shooters}} primarily {{revolve around}} shooting {{large numbers of}} enemies attacking in waves. The protagonist {{may be required to}} defend himself by taking cover, or by shooting incoming thrown weapons, such as axes or grenades. The player may also compete against the clock, however, with some games also featuring boss battles. Games may also <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> player for accurate shooting, with extra points, power-ups or secrets. Games which do not pit the player against antagonists instead feature elaborate challenges constructed mainly from inanimate objects, testing the player's speed and accuracy. More conventional games may feature these types of challenges as minigames.|$|E
5|$|Modern insect-pollinated (entomophilous) {{flowers are}} conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure {{pollination}} {{and in return}} to <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> pollinators with nectar and pollen. The two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years, creating a complex network of interactions. Either they evolved together, or at some later stages they came together, likely with pre-adaptations, and became mutually adapted. The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964, to describe the evolutionary interactions of plants and butterflies.|$|E

5|$|Reginald {{took part}} in the {{negotiations}} in August and September 1169 that attempted to reach a settlement between Henry and Becket. These negotiations included papal nuncios and most of the Norman bishops and prominent abbots, as well as the royal clerks. However, the negotiations came to nothing, and led to Becket's castigation of Reginald. Reginald {{was one of the main}} clerics working for King Henry during the dispute with Becket, along with John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and Geoffrey Ridel. Henry's plans to <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> four with bishoprics in late 1170 probably precipitated the final crisis that led to Becket's murder.|$|E
5|$|The promotional {{phase of}} the {{gameplay}} mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, {{some of which are}} necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal or good memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a horizontal bar in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> player with a heart point, used later during auditions. A good memory will <b>reward</b> <b>the</b> player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. Days off also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or go out into town and meet with other characters. The player can check on days off if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} about three {{brothers}} who, traveling together, reach a treacherous river. They make a magical bridge over the river wherein just as they cross, they meet the personification of Death, who is angry for losing three potential victims. He pretends to be impressed by them and grants each a wish as a <b>reward.</b> <b>The</b> oldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, so Death gives him the Elder Wand. The middle brother asks for the ability to resurrect the dead, so Death gives him the Resurrection Stone. The youngest brother does not trust Death and asks {{for a way to}} stop Death from following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of Invisibility. Afterwards, the brothers go their separate ways.|$|E
