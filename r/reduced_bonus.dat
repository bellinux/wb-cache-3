40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{reaction}} of compensation components awarded to executive directors of UK financial institutions following {{the adoption of the}} bonus tax in December 2009.

Using a comprehensive dataset on executive compensation we show that the introduction of the bonus tax decreased the net cash bonuses awarded to directors by about 43 %, accompanied however by a simultaneous increase in other compensation components leaving both variable as well as total compensation unaffected. Hence, the incidence of the bonus tax was borne by the firms which compensated their managers for the decrease in cash-based compensation by awarding them different forms of pay.

The authors uncover differential effects of these plans from a natural field-based experiment featuring 14, 000 monthly observations over three years from 458 sales territories of a pharmaceutical firm that switched from a bonus plan to an equivalent commission plan. The intervention led to significant sales productivity improvement; this effect was heterogeneous across ability deciles, with much larger increases occurring at lower ability deciles. The authors find significant differences across these plans on (1) effort against nonincentivized tasks and (2) output fluctuations induced through "timing games. " At this firm, the bonus plan was strictly inferior to the implemented commission plan with respect to short-term revenues and timing games. In contrast, the commission plan induced greater neglect of nonincentivized tasks (tasks not directly affecting observable output).

The birth bonus was differentiated by marital status (only married women were eligible), citizenship (only Italians were eligible), and birth order (the bonus grew for the second and especially the third birth). Moreover, the income threshold below which one got the bonus was fairly high. As of 1 January 2004 a new government substantially <b>reduced</b> the <b>bonus</b> amount as well as the upper income limit. We evaluate if the bonuses handed out in FVG during those four years (2000 - 03) {{had a significant impact on}} fertility and abortion choices, verifying whether fertility changed in a different way for women more affected by the new legislation. We also test if the impact of monetary measures was higher for less educated women, because in Italy the relationship between income and education is very strong, and the bonus was practically the same irrespective of income level, hence its relative impact should be stronger in a poorer family. We use two different methods: First, we compare the trends of births and abortion ratios, separately for women affected and not affected by the monetary measures, looking at the differential changes. Second, using log-linear models, we measure if the interactions among time, parity, marital status, citizenship and education are statistically significant in the direction that follows our expectations.

40|$|There is {{a robust}} {{evidence}} {{base for the}} negative health effects from smoking. Smoking is linked to severe morbidity and to mortality, and kills {{up to half of}} its regular users. Tobacco use and production also bring other negative consequences such as economic loss for countries, poverty for individuals, child labour, deforestation and other environmental problems in tobacco growing countries.  A combination of comprehensive interventions at different levels is needed to curb the tobacco epidemic. Tobacco control strategies at national levels in the western world often include components of information/education, taxation, legislative measures and influencing public opinion. Two approaches have dominated at the meso and micro levels: cessation support for tobacco users and prevention activities to support young people refraining from tobacco use. Smoking uptake is a complex process that includes factors at the societal level as well as social and individual characteristics.   At national level, taxation and legislation can contribute to a societal norm opposing tobacco and creating a context for primary prevention aimed at tobacco free youth.   There is no magic bullet in primary prevention.   At the meso and micro levels, a continued development of knowledge on the underlying mechanisms and primary prevention methods is essential to prevent young people from starting to use tobacco.  The overall aim of this thesis was to gain knowledge about factors that influence young people’s use of tobacco and of preventive mechanisms.   The specific aims included to study the relation between Tobacco Free Duo, an intervention program targeting youth in Västerbotten County, and tobacco use prevalence.   A specific interest was to explore the role adults can play in supporting young people to refrain from tobacco use.  The thesis is based on four studies with three separate sets of data, two were quantitative and one was qualitative. The studies were conducted among adolescents (aged 13 - 15 yr) in Västerbotten County and on national level in Sweden (aged 13, 15 and 17 yr).  Tobacco Free Duo is a school-based community intervention that started in 1993. An essential component of the intervention was to involve adults in supporting adolescents to stay tobacco free. Results showed decreased smoking in adolescents among both boys and girls in the intervention area during the study period of seven years.   There was no change in a national reference group during the same time period. A bonus effect was a decrease in adult tobacco use in the intervention area. One out of four adults who supported a young person taking part in the intervention stopped using tobacco. In a qualitative assessment of young smokers, starting to smoke was described as a means of gaining control of their feelings and their situation during early adolescence. They expected adults to intervene against their smoking and claimed that close relations with caring adults could be a reason for smoking less or trying to quit smoking.   In a quantitative study that used three decades of national data, over time adolescents became more positive toward parental action on children’s smoking. The adolescents strongly supported the idea of parental action, {{regardless of whether or not}} they themselves smoked. Adolescents preferred that actions from parents were dissuading their children from smoking, not smoking themselves, and not allowing their children to smoke at home.  These results suggest that the Tobacco Free Duo program contributed to a reduction in adolescent smoking among both boys and girls.   Using a multi-faceted intervention that includes an adolescent-adult partnership can decrease adolescent smoking uptake.   Engaging adults as partners in tobacco prevention interventions that target adolescents has an important tobacco <b>reducing</b> <b>bonus</b> effect in the adults. The intervention has proven sustainable within communities.   A growing majority of adolescents support parental interventions to help them refrain from tobacco.   The findings dismiss the notion that adolescents ignore or even disdain parental practices concerning tobacco. A common and consequent norm against tobacco from both schools and parents using a supportive attitude can prevent tobacco use in young people...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} resources determining chances in life is the amount of income an individual has at its disposal. For most people in contemporary societies wages make up the majority of their overall income and are therefore a key dimension of social inequality. This phenomenon attracted scholarly interest before the recent debates about widening wage inequality in many industrialized societies and represents a core topic in sociology and economics. Wages are the result of employment relationships and, as such, are determined by characteristics of the employee, but also by characteristics of the employer and the idiosyncratic match between them. This thesis aims to add to a growing strand in the literature that focuses on the latter two influences. This does not imply that individual attributes do not matter. It rather means that characteristics of the firm and the specific combination of these two factors need more attention. Associated with this switch in perspective is the emphasis of work organizations as social arenas in which (collective) actors struggle over the available organizational resources. Unlike human capital theory (and most other economic theories) which conceptualize wage levels as the result of valuation processes of individual skills and other productivity-relevant attributes on labor markets, relational inequality theory (RIT) treats work organizations as the actual place where wage inequality is generated. The thesis makes use of this comparably new theory in combination with concepts that emerged in the “new structuralism” literature to formulate a coherent theoretical framework. Overall, the thesis tries to understand and empirically explore the role that firms play for the processes of generation and change of wage inequality. I make use of four samples of the German Structure of Earnings Survey (1995, 2001, 2006, and 2010), a large administrative dataset whose distinctive feature is the possibility to link employee with employer information in order to receive a linked employer-employee dataset (LEED). The first study addresses the generation of one type of wage inequality, namely the gender wage gap (GWG). The article demonstrates that firm-specific opportunity structures in form of status relations influence the GWG in firms. More specifically, relative wages of women in the firm increase with the share of female managers and advantages in educational certificates compared to men. The other two studies, which are written together with Martin Groß, focus on the change in wage inequality between 1995 and 2010 in Germany. Study 2 shows that three firm characteristics, namely average human capital, stability, and coverage by collective agreement, influence individual wages positively – net off individual attributes. However, there is much variation in effects along the wage distribution. We also detect variation in effects and over time, which we interpret as the consequence of globalization and financialization, two processes that change the environment of firms and hence their pay and selection regimes. Using a series of RIF-decompositions we show that these changes in effects as well as changes in the composition contribute to the change in wage inequality. Finally, Study 3 complements this analysis with a look on bonus payments. We show that bonus inequality has been rising since 1995 and that this rise fuels the rise in overall wage inequality. We further highlight differences between firms and conclude that less stable firms and covered firms <b>reduce</b> <b>bonus</b> payments especially for low wage groups. Overall, the findings emphasize the important role of firms for the generation and change of wage inequality. It is not only individual characteristics that determine wages, but also the firm one finds employment as well as the opportunity structures within it. Additionally, firms react and adapt to changes in the environment and change their pay and selection regimes accordingly. Such adaption strategies on the firm level influence wage inequality and have contributed to the rise in wage inequality in Germany between 1995 and 2010. These findings also have policy implications: Increasing the share of female managers should lead to a corresponding reduction of the GWG; re-strengthening of the collective bargaining system and unions should also lead to a decrease in wage inequality as should an expansion of firm internal labor markets...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on new {{evidence}} from a firm-level survey {{conducted in a}} broad range of Member States, this article presents findings of recent research that will contribute {{to a better understanding of}} wage setting in the euro area and other EU countries. The main results of this research can be summarised as follows. The frequency of wage changes is lower than that of price adjustments and wage changes are more synchronised than price changes, with many such changes being concentrated in January. The pass-through of wages to prices is strong in firms with a high labour share and is mitigated if the firms are exposed to a high degree of competition or if their export share is high. There is evidence of downward wage rigidity, but the prevailing form of rigidity (nominal versus real) in a given country depends on wage-setting institutional features such as the degree of indexation, which varies considerably across countries. The survey evidence suggests that firms use various means to adjust labour costs that go beyond changes in base wages (e. g. cutting <b>bonuses,</b> <b>reducing</b> non-wage benefits, changing working practices, reducing promotion rates and replacing departing workers with lower-paid ones). Finally, wages of newly recruited workers are primarily determined by internal factors such as the collective agreement or the wages of similar employees in the firm rather than by external labour market conditions. ...|$|R
