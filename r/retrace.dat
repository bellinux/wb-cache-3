5|$|Upon reading Pike's journal, Hill became {{convinced}} that the Kansas site could not be the correct one. To him, the local topography {{did not appear to}} match that described by Pike; and when he attempted to <b>retrace</b> Pike's route, he concluded that the actual village site must be some distance northwest of the Kansas monument.|$|E
40|$|<b>Retracing</b> a {{recently}} traveled route {{is a frequent}} navigation task when learning novel routes or exploring unfamiliar environments. In the present study we utilized virtual environments technology to investigate age-related differences in repeating and <b>retracing</b> a learned route. In the training phase of the experiment participants were guided along a route consisting of multiple intersections each featuring one unique landmark. In the subsequent test phase, they were guided along short sections of the route and asked to indicate overall travel direction (repetition or <b>retracing),</b> the direction required to continue along the route, and the next landmark they would encounter. Results demonstrate age-related deficits in all three tasks. More specifically, in contrast to younger participants, the older participants had greater problems during route <b>retracing</b> than during route repetition. While route repetition can be solved with egocentric response or route strategies, successfully <b>retracing</b> a route requires allocentric processing. The age-related deficits in route <b>retracing</b> {{are discussed in the}} context of impaired allocentric processing and shift from allocentric to egocentric navigation strategies as a consequence of age-related hippocampal degeneration. - See more at: [URL]...|$|R

5|$|In earlier times, when large {{populations of}} {{springbok}} roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} several days to pass a town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently <b>retrace</b> their paths to their territories after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.|$|E
5|$|The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature {{requires}} {{each species}} {{to be represented}} by a type collection. The destruction of Burret's type collections left many species only known from his original descriptions, which generally lacked illustrations. Other specimens (called neotypes) were designated to replace these, either by Rodrigo Bernal and colleagues in 1989 or by Borchsenius and Bernal in their 1996 monograph of the genus. Bernal and colleagues attempted to <b>retrace</b> Kalbreyer's travels in northern Colombia and collect specimens from {{as close as possible}} to the location of the original collections.|$|E
5|$|Barbara and Adam Maitland {{decide to}} spend their {{vacation}} decorating their idyllic Connecticut country home. As the two are driving home {{from a trip to}} town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into a river. After they return home, Adam decides to <b>retrace</b> their steps as they can't recall how they got home. Upon stepping outside he's taken to a desert world with monstrous sandworms before being pulled back in by Barbara. Even though he had been gone for less than a minute Barbara claims he had been gone for over an hour. She and Adam notice that they now lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased and realize they did not survive the crash.|$|E
25|$|Riggenbach's 1991 {{study of}} fluency {{development}} in Chinese learners of English had {{an analysis of}} repair phenomena, which included <b>retraced</b> restarts and unretraced restarts. <b>Retraced</b> restarts refer to the reformulations whereby {{a portion of the}} original utterance is duplicated. They can either involve repetition, that is, the precise adjacent duplication of a sound, syllable, word or phrase, or insertion, which refers to a <b>retraced</b> restart with the addition of new unretraced lexical items. Conversely, unretraced restarts refer to reformulations that reject the original utterance, similarly known as false starts.|$|R

5|$|Most {{species are}} solitary when not mating, {{though a few}} are known to occur in high densities and with {{frequent}} interactions, signaling, mate defending and eviction of individuals from dens. This is likely the result of abundant food supplies combined with limited den sites. Octopuses hide in dens, which are typically crevices in rocky outcrops or other hard structures, though some species burrow into sand or mud. Octopuses are not territorial but generally remain in a home range; they may leave the area in search of food. They can use navigation skills {{to return to a}} den without having to <b>retrace</b> their outward route. They are not known to be migratory.|$|E
5|$|Keith and Vinnie {{debate on}} Piz’s radio show, and Vinnie gathers some support about his lax underage {{drinking}} policy. Wallace notices someone following him, {{and the student}} wants to recruit him for a secret society. Vinnie insults Keith’s handling of his home life, and Veronica hits {{him on the head}} lightly. She helps Weevil <b>retrace</b> his steps and notices one of her criminology classmates, Jenny (Dianna Agron), involved with one of Weevil’s clients. Veronica deduces that Jenny and her circle of friends are responsible for creating the fake student IDs, disseminating them, and implicating Weevil. Logan and Dick (Ryan Hansen) go surfing, and they run into Veronica, Piz, and Mac helping Wallace (Percy Daggs III) with his final project for a class. Veronica learns that one of Jenny’s group lives in the same town in Georgia where the student ID machines are made.|$|E

25|$|The {{park has}} {{a system of}} jogging trails, many {{surrounded}} by swamps, forest, and bayous. Many of the trails follow the Buffalo Bayou, and biking is popular year round. The trail {{is well known for}} its flexibility in biking; many speed bikers ride the trails. It is very similar to the nearby Terry Hershey Park in that both feature paved trails. A critical shortcoming of the trail system is that the sole paved trail does not form a loop, requiring cyclists to either ride in the traffic lanes of high-speed thoroughfares or <b>retrace</b> their route.|$|E
25|$|They {{have a few}} (widely spaced) {{frequency}} ranges, {{and relatively}} wide-range continuous frequency control within a given range. In use, the sweep frequency is set to slightly lower than some submultiple of the input frequency, to display typically at least two cycles of the input signal (so all details are visible). A very simple control feeds an adjustable amount of the vertical signal (or possibly, a related external signal) to the sweep oscillator. The signal triggers beam blanking and a sweep <b>retrace</b> sooner than it would occur free-running, and the display becomes stable.|$|E
