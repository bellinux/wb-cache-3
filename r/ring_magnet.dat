This paper presents a mathematical model of a permanent magnet bearing made of <b>ring</b> <b>magnets</b> with radial polarizations. Coulombian model and vector approach are used to estimate the force, moment and stiffness. A MATLAB code is developed for evaluating the envisaged parameters for three degrees (translational) of freedom of the rotor. Comparison of force and stiffness results of the presented model with that reported in the literature and also with the results of 3 D finite element analysis shows good agreement. Then, it is extended to analyse stacked <b>ring</b> <b>magnets</b> with alternate radial polarizations.

Two of the most important were the vibration of the flexibly supported foundation and the torsional vibration between the motor and generator which occurs when running on pulse duty {{and in the case of}} motor or generator line-to-line short-circuits. Measurements taken during commissioning showed that the operating performance was fully satisfactory and confirmed the design calculations. (4 refs) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an {{improvement of the}} calculation of the magnetic field components created by <b>ring</b> permanent <b>magnets.</b> The three-dimensional approach taken {{is based on the}} Coulombian Model. Moreover, the magnetic field components are calculated without using the vector potential or the scalar potential. It is noted that all the expressions given in this paper take into account the magnetic pole volume density for <b>ring</b> permanent <b>magnets</b> radially magnetized. We show that this volume density {{must be taken into account}} for calculating precisely the magnetic field components in the near-field or the far-field. Then, this paper presents the component switch theorem that can be used between infinite parallelepiped magnets whose cross-section is a square. This theorem implies that the magnetic field components created by an infinite parallelepiped magnet can be deducted from the ones created by the same parallelepiped magnet with a perpendicular magnetization. Then, we discuss the validity of this theorem for axisymmetric problems (<b>ring</b> permanent <b>magnets).</b> Indeed, axisymmetric problems dealing with <b>ring</b> permanent <b>magnets</b> are often treated with a 2 D approach. The results presented in this paper clearly show that the two-dimensional studies dealing with the optimization of <b>ring</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> dimensions cannot be treated with the same precisions as 3 D studies. 1...|$|R

50|$|When {{selecting}} a magnetic level gauge {{it is important}} {{to take into account the}} strength of the magnetic field. The magnetic field is the heart of the magnetic level gauge - the stronger the field, the more reliable the instrument will function. Some manufacturers rely on a single magnet for their magnetic level gauges which causes the strength of the north field to be identical to, and as weak as, the south field. It is apparent that at the location of the indicators, switches and transmitters, the field would not be as intense. Some manufacturers use a single annular <b>ring</b> <b>magnet,</b> others use a series of single bar magnets in a circular array in their float design. In this design the relative field strength of the north and south poles will be equal to one another and less than that of a dual magnet design. Moreover, the field strength as you travel around the circumference will have high and low spots as you pass between the individual bar magnets.|$|E
50|$|The {{wow and flutter}} spec for the Numark Pro TT-2, Pro TT-1+, Pro TT-1 and TT-100 is 0.13%, {{which is}} high {{compared}} to the spec of 0.025% wrms for the Technics SL-1200MK2 and 0.025% wrms for the JVC QL-Y5F turntables. With the Numark turntables the only concentration of mass {{is at the center}} of the platter where the ceramic <b>ring</b> <b>magnet</b> is located. There is no extra mass provided at the circumference of the platter like found on the platters for the Technics and JVC turntables. So the Numark platter exhibits little inertia which is probably why the wow and flutter figure is not up to par. All of the Hanpin made turntables seem to have an inordinately high wow and flutter spec, even their own top of the line models, the DJ-5500 and DJ-3560. The only exception to this for Hanpin made turntables seems to be the ReLoop RP-7000 and RP-8000 which claim a wow and flutter spec of 0.01% wrms. Possibly the ReLoop turntables have a greatly improved platter design to reduce axial run-out of the platter but no mention of that is made in the product literature. If your main use is as a DJ, scratching and playing Hip-Hop, excessive wow and flutter and is probably a non-issue. However if you are an audiophile involved in record restoration, excessive wow and flutter is to be avoided.|$|E
