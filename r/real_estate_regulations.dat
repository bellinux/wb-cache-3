40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to scrutinize the Dutch {{property}} market from the angle of crime-inducing conditions and circumstances. Design/methodology/approach – The perspective adopted is in line with recent developments in the study of crime and crime prevention, which focus not so much on perpetrators, as on the opportunities they have to commit a criminal offence. Findings – Despite the exploratory character of the analysis, it can be concluded that the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> sector lends itself very well to an entwining of regular and irregular activities. <b>Real</b> <b>estate</b> has become booming business, attracting domestic and foreign investment. The market is closed, dominated by old boy networks, with possibilities to conceal irregularities. Regulations, law enforcement and (both formal and informal) control seem to be inadequate. Hence, it is less transparent than other markets and enables legitimate and illegitimate entrepreneurs to meet, co-operate and share expertise and knowledge. Practical implications – Strategies to prevent serious forms of crime in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> sector vary from self-regulation and administrative measures to public and private policing. The various public and private institutions tend to stick to a primarily domestically oriented approach, whilst social research in this area is still predominantly based on national studies. The author recommends that comparative, multidisciplinary empirical research on irregularities and crime in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> sector in various (European) countries needs to be conducted. Originality/value – This is one of the first attempts to apply principles of analysis of potential crime-inducing vulnerabilities to the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> sector.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how political considerations affect local officials' revenue maximization {{behaviors in the}} context of urban land conveyance in China. Particularly, we analyze government intervention based on local officials' choice of two land auction types, namely, “English auction” and “two-stage auction”. The latter presumably serves as a tool of government intervention. We aim to address the research question: “Are local governments maximizing land revenue?” The major findings are threefold. First, for cities with higher housing prices, two-stage auctions are adopted more frequently than English auctions. In addition, land parcels in these “hot” cities adopt two-stage auctions more frequently during sensitive political events, suggesting that local officials respond positively to the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>regulation</b> policy from central government. Second, when city leaders are more incentivized to promote economic performance, they respond less positively to rises in housing prices. Third, such interventionist behavior results in a significantly depressed land price and housing price. Despite its intention of improving public welfare, this interventionism can susceptibly cause problems of misallocation and corruption. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
