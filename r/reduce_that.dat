5|$|Activision Publishing chief {{executive}} Mike Griffith, {{in response to}} questions about Activision's approach to the Guitar Hero market, noted that Guitar Hero continues to outsell the Rock Band series in both number of sales and revenue, with consumers continuing to buy the separate games on the market, and considered the market acceptance of the multiple games as validation for their model. Regardless, after releasing 25 different SKUs (between games and bundle packages) in 2009, Activision opted to <b>reduce</b> <b>that</b> number to 10 in 2010, recognizing the music game genre was not as profitable as it once was. Activision later opted to put future development of the series on hold in early 2011 citing weak sales in the rhythm game genre, a move that many journalists attributed to Activision's earlier oversaturation.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To <b>reduce</b> <b>that</b> risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E

25|$|These {{measures}} were further {{strengthened by the}} 1979 Packwood-Magnuson Amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976. It provides that, when the Secretary of Commerce certifies that a country is diminishing {{the effectiveness of the}} work of the IWC, the Secretary of State must <b>reduce</b> <b>that</b> country's fishing allocation in U.S. waters by at least 50%. Certification under the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment also serves as certification under the Pelly Amendment. The threatened application in 1980 of the Packwood-Magnuson and Pelly Amendments led South Korea to agree to follow IWC guidelines restricting the use of cold (i.e., non-explosive) harpoons. Faced with similar pressure, the Republic of China (Taiwan) placed a complete ban on whaling in 1981. Without United States support, it's possible that the 1986 moratorium would have been substantially limited, as nations such as Iceland, Japan, Norway and the Soviet Union would have opted out and continued commercial whaling.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Senators and Representatives cannot resign to take {{newly created}} or higher-paying {{political}} positions; rather, they must {{wait until the}} conclusion of the term for which they were elected. If Congress increases the salary of a particular officer, it may later <b>reduce</b> <b>that</b> salary to permit an individual to resign from Congress and take that position (known as the Saxbe fix). The effects of the clause were discussed in 1937, when Senator Hugo Black was appointed an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court with some time left in his Senate term. Just prior to the appointment, Congress had increased the pension available to Justices retiring at the age of seventy. It was therefore suggested by some that the office's emolument had been increased during Black's Senatorial term, and that therefore Black could not take office as a Justice. The response, however, was that Black was fifty-one years old, and would not receive the increased pension until at least 19 years later, long after his Senate term had expired.|$|E

500|$|The {{training}} of WSOP dealers was also heavily criticized in past tournaments. In {{an effort to}} forestall this criticism, the WSOP began intensive training for dealers as early as March 2007 for over 300 dealers. [...] The training included staff and supervisory training. [...] Part {{of the reason for}} this additional training was to prevent a repeat of the [...] "extra chips" [...] that materialized during 2006's main event. [...] During the 2006 main event, the tournament finished with more chips than normal chip upgrading would have led to.

500|$|Players {{and enemies}} may use {{physical}} or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves. [...] Each character and enemy {{has a certain}} number of hit points; successful attacks <b>reduce</b> <b>that</b> character's hit points, which can be restored with potions and spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, they faint; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose. Between battles, the player can equip his/her characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used {{both in and out of}} battles. [...] Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in treasure chests. By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through Chrono Triggers story.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt's {{essay on}} Hamlet was later used by David Bromwich in an {{extensive}} comparison of Coleridge's and Hazlitt's critical views in general. Although, to Bromwich, Coleridge's criticism of Hamlet contained {{a greater number}} of original ideas, including the general assessment of Prince Hamlet's character, Hazlitt's view is notable in that it does not, like Coleridge, <b>reduce</b> <b>that</b> character to a single dominating flaw, his inability to act. In one of his lectures on Shakespeare, Coleridge claimed that [...] "Shakespeare wished to impress upon us the truth that action is the chief end of existence‚Äîthat no faculties of intellect, however brilliant, can be considered valuable, or indeed otherwise than as misfortunes, if they withdraw us from or render us repugnant to action, and lead us to think and think of doing, until the time has elapsed when we can do anything effectually." [...] Hazlitt, on the other hand, instead of applying this moral, pointed to the necessity of each reader's identifying with Hamlet to understand him (which, he believed, occurred more readily than with any other of Shakespeare's characters) and the reader's judging of Hamlet in part {{on the basis of what}} that reader then saw in himself. This made it unlikely that Hamlet's entire character would be reduced to a single flaw that would provide the reader with a moral lesson.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{industrial}} and medical applications exist for silane and functionalized silanes. For instance, silanes {{are used as}} coupling agents to adhere fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers to certain polymer matrices, stabilizing the composite material. In other words, silane coats the glass fibers to create better adhesion to the polymer matrix. They {{can also be used}} to couple a bio-inert layer on a titanium implant. Other applications include water repellents, masonry protection, control of graffiti, applying polycrystalline silicon layers on silicon wafers when manufacturing semiconductors, and sealants. The semiconductor industry used about 300 metric tons per year of silane in the late 1990s. More recently, a growth in low-cost solar photovoltaic module manufacturing has led to substantial consumption of silane for depositing hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on glass and other substrates like metal and plastic. The PECVD process is relatively inefficient at materials utilization with approximately 85% of the silane being wasted. To <b>reduce</b> <b>that</b> waste and the ecological footprint of a-Si:H-based solar cells further several recycling efforts have been developed.)". , [...]|$|E

2500|$|ROS may {{be useful}} in the {{oxidation}} or reduction of necessary or toxic metals. [...] Since iron is necessary for phytoplankton growth, the auto-reduction of reactive oxygen species may be a way for algae to get usable iron from free or organically bound ferric iron. For instance, Cakman et al. showed that ROS may increase the amount of iron available through extracellular ferric reduction. [...] It is thought that the high reducing power of this reaction is maintained through the electron-rich superoxide ion. [...] In several studies on the ROS production of Heterosigma akashiwo, hydrogen peroxide production was found to be inversely proportional to the concentration of iron available. [...] In addition, Cornish and Page in 1998 found that phytoplankton produce more ROS when there are lower levels of extracellular iron. [...] They suggested that when intracellular iron is limiting, the phytoplankton respond by producing more ROS as a way to increase the reducing potential around the cell and thus be better able to <b>reduce</b> <b>that</b> iron to a usable form. [...] Similarly, lower ROS production would suggest that the intracellular iron is at sufficiently high levels for cellular function.|$|E
2500|$|His primary {{campaign}} faced significant problems. In June, the Far Northeast/Southeast Council, {{a coalition of}} Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANC) and neighborhood civic associations, voted [...] "no-confidence" [...] in Chavous, saying he had been absent from too many community meetings and events and had failed to keep resident informed about major changes in their ward (such as the relocation of the D.C.

In late July, the Metropolitan Washington Council of the AFL-CIO declined to make an endorsement in the Ward 7 Council primary race, after the Washington Federation of Teachers accused Chavous of ignoring their input on education policy. (The teachers union also declined an endorsement in August.) By August 4, Chavous had only raised $2,100 in contributions, but spent more than $46,500.
