5|$|The state's {{conservative}} {{white voters}} began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for {{local and state}} offices as well, and most whites became Republican Party members. The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift to the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>is</b> much-attributed {{to the fact that}} the Democratic Party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter. As Texas was always a conservative state, voters switched to the GOP, which now more closely reflected their beliefs. Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s. Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the Sun Belt that favored the Republican Party and conservatism.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} {{associated with}} social conservative policies, {{although it does}} have dissenting centrist and libertarian factions. The social conservatives want laws that uphold their traditional values, such as opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion, and marijuana. Most conservative Republicans also oppose gun control, affirmative action, and illegal immigration.|$|E
5000|$|The Socialist <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> (Partido Republicano Socialista, PRS), {{whose members}} were {{also known as}} [...] "Saavedristas", <b>was</b> a {{political}} <b>party</b> in Bolivia. The Socialist <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> emerged on January 28, 1921, as the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>was</b> bifurcated {{on the same day}} Bautista Saavedra took office as President of the country. The Socialist <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>was</b> formed by Saavedra's followers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>was</b> {{formed in}} early 1854 {{to oppose the}} Kansas-Nebraska Act. During the midterm {{elections}} of 1854-1855, the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>was</b> one of the patchwork of anti-administration parties contesting the election, but {{they were able to}} win thirteen seats in the House of Representatives for the 34th Congress. However, the party collaborated with other disaffected groups and gradually absorbed them. In the elections of 1855, the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> won three governorships.|$|R

25|$|The state {{legislature}} is the Rhode Island General Assembly, {{consisting of the}} 75-member House of Representatives and the 38-member Senate. Both houses of the bicameral body are currently dominated by the Democratic Party; {{the presence of the}} <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>is</b> almost non-existent in the state government, with Republicans holding a handful of seats in both the Senate and House of Representatives.|$|E
25|$|After the 2016 elections, Republicans {{maintained}} {{a majority in}} the Senate, House, Governorships and elected Trump as President. The <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>is</b> set to control 69 of 99 state legislative chambers in 2017, the most it has held in history; and at least 33 governorships, the most it has held since 1922. The party will have total control of government (legislative chambers and governorship) in 25 states, the most since 1952, while the opposing Democratic Party will have full control in five states.|$|E
25|$|Many {{conservative}} Southern Democrats {{defected to}} the Republican Party, {{beginning with the}} passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the general leftward shift of the party. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, Kent Hance and Ralph Hall of Texas, and Richard Shelby of Alabama are examples of this. The influx of conservative Democrats into the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>is</b> often cited as a reason for the GOP's shift further to the right during the late 20th century, as well as the shift of its base from the Northeast and Midwest to the South.|$|E

25|$|In recent decades, Republicans {{have been}} {{moderately}} successful in gaining support from Hispanic and Asian American voters. George W. Bush, who campaigned energetically for Hispanic votes, received 35% of their vote in 2000 and 44% in 2004. The party's strong anti-communist stance {{has made it}} popular among some minority groups from current and former Communist states, in particular Cuban Americans, Korean Americans, Chinese Americans, and Vietnamese Americans. The election of Bobby Jindal as Governor of Louisiana has been hailed as pathbreaking. He is the first elected minority governor in Louisiana and the first state governor of Indian descent. According to John Avlon in 2013, the <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> <b>is</b> more diverse at the statewide elected official level than the Democratic Party, including Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, then-Apostle Ezra Taft Benson {{was quoted}} by the Associated Press {{that it would}} be {{difficult}} for a faithful Latter-day Saint to be a liberal Democrat. Although the LDS Church has officially repudiated such statements on many occasions, Democratic candidates—including LDS Democrats—believe that Republicans capitalize on the perception that the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>is</b> doctrinally superior. Political scientist and pollster Dan Jones explains this disparity by noting that the national Democratic Party is associated with liberal positions on gay marriage and abortion, both of which the LDS Church is against. The Republican Party in heavily Mormon Utah County presents itself as the superior choice for Latter-day Saints. Even though Utah Democratic candidates are predominantly LDS, socially conservative, and pro-life, no Democrat has won in Utah County since 1994.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party's current {{ideology}} is American conservatism, which {{contrasts with the}} Democrats' more progressive platform (also called modern liberalism). Its platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to advocating for conservative economic policies, the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>is</b> socially conservative and seeks to uphold traditional values based largely on Judeo-Christian ethics. The GOP was strongly committed to protectionism and tariffs from its founding until the 1930s, when it was based in the industrial Northeast and Midwest. Since 1952, {{there has been a}} reversal against protectionism and the party's core support since the 1990s comes chiefly from the South, the Great Plains, the Mountain States and rural areas in the North, as well as from conservative Catholics, Mormons and Evangelicals nationwide.|$|E

[...] Another sign of Wilson's emotional restoration was the aggressiveness with which he pursued passage of a ship-purchase bill to bulk up the inadequately equipped merchant marine. This lasted until March 1915, when he moderated, drew back from the bill and, without its passage, congratulated the Congress for its work in the session just ended—his initial journey through mourning was evident.|$|E
