England also replaced Cowdrey with DeFreitas, dropped Gower for Matthew Maynard, and replaced the injured Allan Lamb with Rob Bailey, a <b>recall</b> <b>and</b> two Test debuts respectively.

40|$|International audienceBackground: A {{discrepancy}} between <b>recalled</b> <b>and</b> recorded bowel habit subtypes {{has been reported}} in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but the reasons for it are unclear. Aim: To assess: 1) the agreement between <b>recalled</b> <b>and</b> recorded bowel habit subtypes; 2) whether any discrepancy is related to stool form variability or psychological factors; and 3) the correlations of <b>recalled</b> <b>and</b> recorded stool form with colonic transit time. Methods: Bowel habit subtype was established in 54 IBS patients at the enrolment visit (<b>recalled)</b> <b>and</b> with the aid of diary cards (recorded). Colonic transit time, the variability of stool form, and the patients' psychological profiles were also recorded. Results: <b>Recalled</b> <b>and</b> recorded bowel habit subtypes agreed in only 54 % of the patients (kappa= 0. 28). Stool form variability was greater among the patients whose <b>recalled</b> <b>and</b> recorded bowel habit subtypes were discordant (P= 0. 03), whereas the psychological profiles were not different. Colonic transit time significantly correlated with stool form only when it was recorded on diary cards. Conclusions: The {{discrepancy between}} <b>recalled</b> <b>and</b> recorded bowel habits in IBS patients is related more to stool form variability than an altered psychological profile. Diary cards should be used to ensure that stool form reflects colonic transit time...|$|R

30|$|Hence, {{the large}} {{discrepancy}} {{may be due}} to difference in reporting and recall; for instance, this mentee was <b>recalling</b> <b>and</b> reporting on the meeting as being a space that they were listened to and cared about, while the mentor <b>recalled</b> <b>and</b> reported on details about problems they were helping to solve.|$|R
5|$|Further, birds <b>recall</b> <b>and</b> avoid {{objects that}} are both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than {{objects that are}} equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired <b>recall</b> <b>and</b> impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E
5|$|In both {{of these}} instances, a failed retreat by Hybrida and his cavalry led to his unit being {{absolutely}} defeated and any plunder accrued during the attack was forfeited back to the natives. This lack of success, rather than the extortion of the provincials, drew {{the attention of the}} Senate who threatened to <b>recall</b> <b>and</b> prosecute Hybrida for his mismanagement of the province. In 60 BC, Hybrida was quietly replaced by Gaius Octavius as the Governor of Macedonia and in March of 59 BC, during the consulship of Caesar and Marcus Culpurnius Bibulus, was prosecuted for the mishandling of the governorship by Caesar and Crassus. In the end, Hybrida was tried by Marcus Caelius Rufus for his participation in the Catilinarian conspiracy and by Lucius Caninius Gallus for his crimes in Macedonia. He was defended by Cicero, not out of duty but as a protest against the current state of affairs in Rome. Despite this, Hybrida was found guilty of his crimes, ordered to pay a fine and be banished from Rome to a place of his choosing. Hybrida had settled upon Cephallenia as his residence for the duration of his exile.|$|E

5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully <b>recall</b> <b>and</b> express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

The objectives of the study are to investigate car <b>recall</b> trends <b>and</b> identify the causes <b>and</b> effects of <b>recalls.</b> Analysis shows {{that the majority of}} car recalls are initiated by a few car makers that are facing an increase in <b>recalls</b> <b>and</b> customer complaints. There exists a significant influence of customer complaints on car recalls. Furthermore, the latest car models seem to have less customer complaints compared to older models, and they also have less recalls compared to the older models. The research examines Toyota’s case of recent <b>recalls</b> <b>and</b> identified some immediate impacts of <b>recalls</b> on sales <b>and</b> on market share. This research can be further extended to identify key causes of car <b>recalls</b> <b>and</b> the impact on business performance...|$|R
