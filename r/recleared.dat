5000|$|The turnpike was {{chartered}} on June 15, 1805, by the Massachusetts legislature. After {{an extremely}} contentious argument about its route, it opened {{about five years}} later. The road started near present-day Technology Square in East Cambridge, where it intersected with the Cambridge and Concord Turnpike (now Broadway), headed roughly northwest along what are now Hampshire and Beacon Streets, passed by the 'Foot of the Rocks' in West Cambridge (now along Massachusetts Avenue in Arlington), and onwards to Lexington by today's Westminster and Lowell Streets. From there, it continued through Burlington, Bedford, and Billerica, the section of which is still called the Middlesex Turnpike as far as Concord Road in Billerica. The remainder {{of the right of}} way in Billerica is fragmented. The portion between Concord Road and the Concord River had become overgrown with fairly substantial trees, but a portion was recently <b>recleared</b> and paved as a driveway into a new commercial development that is not yet completed. On {{the north side of the}} Concord river, short section now called Old Middlesex Turnpike serves a few blocks in a residential neighborhood, but a gate blocks access to the block nearest the river. The section between River Street Extension and River Street is substantially overgrown, with the southern end serving as a dirt driveway from River Street into a couple residences. The portion of River Street nearest U.S. Route 3 also follows the original right of way. There are original fragments remaining in the Billerica State Forest, alongside Route 3, and again north and south of Rangeway Road. From Billierca, it continued northwest to Chelmsford, and then along the bank of the Merrimack River to Tyngsborough. A small, 1.5 mi stretch of the turnpike remains in Chelmsford, now known as [...] "Turnpike Road." [...] There is also a short residential street named [...] "Old Middlesex Turnpike Street" [...] that lies on or very near the original right-of-way, and the occasional property line denotes the original route. From there, maps show a route through Chelmsford along North Road and Princeton Street into what is now North Chelmsford's Vinal Square, then along Tyngsboro Road through North Chelmsford and Middlesex Road through Tyngsboro to Nashua, New Hampshire. It was about 26 mi in length, with four (4) toll gates along the way.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of forest regeneration on abandoned agricultural land in the Amazon has often been restricted by limited knowledge of historical land use. This study compared time-series classifications of mature forest, nonforest, and regrowth generated from Landsat sensor data for areas north of the Brazilian cities of Manaus (1973 - 2003) and Santarem (1984 - 2003) to chronicle land histories and forest age. At Manaus, active land use prior to abandonment ranged from 10 - 15 years with burning. Few forests were <b>recleared</b> on more than three occasions. From the mid- 1980 s, land was increasingly abandoned and, in 2003, over 75 % of the deforested area supported regenerating forests, with several being older than 20 years. South of Santarem, forests were cleared up to seven times. In 2003, few regenerating forests were older than 10 years, and all land covers, but particularly mature forest, were damaged by extensive wildfires in 1993 and 1998. Based on previous research, the study concludes that the capacity of regenerating forests to recover biomass and tree species diversity will be reduced where prior land use is more intense, as in Santarem and some clearings north of Manaus.

40|$|Excellent data on {{deforestation}} {{have been}} obtained in the tropics {{with the use of}} high-resolution optical sensors. Yet, several problems remain. Cloud cover creates data gaps that limit the possibility of complete and frequent assessments, and secondary growth is not well characterized. Active microwave sensors could complement these sensors because they operate independently of cloud cover and smoke and can detect differences in woody biomass and forest structure associated with various stages of forest clearing and regrowth. An example of comparison and synergy between the two techniques is discussed here. Polarimetric, C- (5. 6 cm) and L-band (24 cm) frequency, radar data gathered in October 1994 by NASA's Spaceborne Imaging Radar C, on a test site southeast of the city of Porto Velho, in the state of Rondonia, Brazil, are analyzed in conjunction with one 1993 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene, a 9 -year time series of Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre (SPOT) XS data, two Japan Earth Resources Satellite (JERS- 1) radar images from 1994 and 1995, and a field visit conducted in 1995. The C-band radar data are found to be of limited utility for mapping deforestation. At L-band, multiple polarizations are required to obtain a reliable classification. The single polarization, L-band, single date, JERS- 1 data underestimate the extent of deforestation, especially during the wet season. With multiple polarizations, six classes of land cover, including one level of regrowth, are mapped with 90 % accuracy, but intermediate regrowth 5 - 8 years of age is not well separated from the forest. The Landsat TM data identify deforested areas better but provide less information on residual woody biomass levels. Combining the two classifications, seven classes of land cover including two levels of regrowth are mapped with 93 % accuracy. The results show that the deforestation rate for 1994 was 1. 7 %. Large variations in residual woody biomass are detected among new clearings. Half of the total deforested land is in some stage of regrowth but most of it is less than 5 years old. Secondary growth is therefore a significant form or land use that is <b>recleared</b> quickly...|$|E
50|$|One factor {{identified}} by Arthur and Rose that helps achieve the maximum possible saving {{is to have}} an initial destination positioned so that descent to the initial destination starts immediately after the <b>reclear</b> fix. This is beneficial because it minimises the reserve fuel needed between <b>reclear</b> fix and initial destination, and hence maximises the amount of reserve fuel available at the <b>reclear</b> fix.|$|R
5000|$|The idea of <b>reclear</b> flights {{was first}} {{published}} in Boeing Airliner (1977) by Boeing engineers David Arthur and Gary Rose. The original paper contains a lot of magic numbers relating to the optimum position of the <b>reclear</b> fix and so on. These numbers apply only to the specific type of aircraft considered, for a specific reserve percentage, and take no account of the effect of weather. The fuel savings due to <b>reclear</b> depend on three factors: ...|$|R
50|$|The initial {{destination}} is positioned so that less reserve fuel {{is needed for}} a flight from the origin to the initial destination than for a flight from the origin to the final destination. Under normal circumstances, little {{if any of the}} reserve fuel is actually used, so when the aircraft reaches the <b>reclear</b> fix it still has (almost) all the original reserve fuel on board, which is enough to cover the flight from the <b>reclear</b> fix to the final destination.|$|R
50|$|There may {{be several}} {{possible}} <b>reclear</b> fixes and initial destinations, and {{which one is}} best depends on {{the weather and the}} zero fuel weight. A flight planning system can analyse each possibility and select whichever is best for this particular flight.|$|R
50|$|A <b>reclear</b> {{flight plan}} has two {{destination}}s. The final destination airport {{is where the}} flight is really going to, while the initial destination airport is where the flight will divert to if more fuel is used than expected during {{the early part of}} the flight. The waypoint at which the decision is made as to which destination to go to is called the <b>reclear</b> fix or decision point. On reaching this waypoint, the flight crew make a comparison between actual and predicted fuel burn and check how much reserve fuel is available. If there is sufficient reserve fuel, then the flight can continue to the final destination airport; otherwise the aircraft must divert to the initial destination airport.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{achievable}} saving {{depends on}} {{the position of the}} <b>reclear</b> fix. This position cannot be determined theoretically since there are no exact equations for trip fuel and reserve fuel. Even if it could be determined exactly, there may not be a waypoint at the right place.|$|R

25|$|Since then, both {{portions}} of the concourse have seen little change. Gate E3 was closed in the 1990s to accommodate a connector between Concourses D and E. In the mid-2000s (decade), the Low E and High E security checkpoints were expanded and merged into one, linking both {{portions of}} the concourse without requiring passengers to <b>reclear</b> security. At the same time Gates E32, E34, and E35 were closed {{to make way for}} a second parallel taxiway between the Concourse D extension and Concourse E. Concourse E also contains the (currently closed) Central Terminal's immigration and customs halls.|$|R
50|$|From an accountant's viewpoint, the {{provision}} of reserve fuel costs money (the fuel needed to carry the hopefully unused reserve fuel). Techniques known variously as <b>reclear,</b> redispatch, or decision point procedure have been developed, which can greatly {{reduce the amount of}} reserve fuel needed while still maintaining all required safety standards. These techniques are based on having some specified intermediate airport to which the flight can divert if necessary; in practice such diversions are rare. The use of such techniques can save several tons of fuel on long flights, or it can increase the payload carried by a similar amount.|$|R

25|$|Concourse C {{also has}} a {{dedicated}} Federal Inspection Station located at ground level. International United flights not originating at an airport with US customs preclearance can directly deplane passengers via jetbridge at Concourse C (as opposed to using plane mates to offload passengers). Once deplaned, arriving passengers are separated. Passengers terminating at Dulles take a mobile lounge that transports them to the International Arrivals Building, while connecting passengers continuing on another United flight go through U.S. Customs and Immigration at the FIS station on the ground level. Since this immigration facility is only for connecting passengers on United and other Star Alliance carriers, it has shorter lines and passengers don't have to <b>reclear</b> security at the massive security checkpoints in the main terminal.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of flights from destinations with U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance, all inbound international flights arrive at Terminal 5, as the other terminals do not have screening facilities. Several carriers, such as American, Iberia, Lufthansa and United, with outbound international flights depart from Terminals 1 and 3. This arrangement requires that passengers disembark at Terminal 5 and then, crews tow the empty plane to another terminal for boarding. This is done, in part to make connections for passengers transferring from domestic flights to international flights easier, since while Terminals 1, 2, and 3 allow airside connections, Terminal 5 is separated from the other terminals {{by a set of}} taxiways that cross over the airport's access road, requiring passengers to exit security, ride the Airport Transit System, then <b>reclear</b> security in either direction.|$|R
5000|$|The {{more likely}} {{scenario}} {{is that much}} like other films from the 1970s and 1980s, the original contracts covering the artists and songs in the film only covered existing media, and that all those details {{would have to be}} renegotiated for any new media such as CDs, DVDs, or mp3 downloading. Naturally, with the large number of labels and publishers controlling the material, combined with the increased value of the music, to <b>reclear</b> the performances would be extremely cost-prohibitive and time-consuming. It is rumored that three songs from each band were filmed and saved during the editing process and that Copeland has these in storage. There is the potential for a six-hour special edition, possibly containing over 100 songs, should Copeland and Warner Bros. decide to release it later. At least one extra song from these recordings, [...] "Imposter" [...] by Oingo Boingo, is circulating as a bootleg.|$|R
