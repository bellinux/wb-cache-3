Furthermore, using those linear non-self-intersecting offsets as the legs of NURBS control polygons, NURBS-format tool paths can be smoothly reconstructed with G(1) -continuity, no overcutting, no cusps, and global error control. Since all operations involved in computing tool path curves are linear geometric calculations, the method is robust and simple.

40|$|Abstract: The {{determination}} of the optimal cutting parameters {{that are able to}} satisfy specific technological and economic conditions {{is one of the most}} important elements in the process planning of metal cutting operations. For multi-pass turning operations, solving the problem of machining economics by optimizing the key cutting parameters including the number of <b>roughing</b> cuts, <b>cutting</b> speeds, depth of cuts, and feed rates has been an important research topic for at least the last two decades. Numerous cutting constraints considering tool life, cutting force, power, stable cutting region, chip–tool interface temperature, and roughing and finishing parameter relations complicate the machining optimization problem. However, no paper in the existing literature has taken into account the influence of the use of lubricants. In recent years, many researchers and experts have urged the minimization (and in same cases total elimination) at the use of lubricants in machining operations to avoid causing environ-mental and human health problems. Some studies indicate that in fact the purchase costs of lubricants and the costs associated with their use are frequently higher than the costs of the cutting tools. Therefore, metal cutting without fluids has become a new field for technological innovation.

40|$|From an {{analytical}} viewpoint, {{the relationship between}} <b>rough</b> mill <b>cutting</b> bill part requirements and lumber yield is highly complex. Part requirements can have almost any length, width, and quantity distribution within the boundaries set by physical limitations, such as maximum length and width of parts. This complexity {{makes it difficult to}} understand the specific relationship between cutting bill requirements and lumber yield, rendering the optimization of the lumber cntting process through improved cutting bill composition difficult. An approach is presented to decrease the complexity of cutting bills to allow for easier analysis and, ultimately, to optimize cutting bill compositions. Principles from clustering theory were employed to create a standadized way to describe cutting bills. Cutting bill part clusters are part groups within the cutting bill's total part size space, where all parts are reset to a given group's midpoint. Statistical testing was used to determine a minimum resolution part group matrix that had no significant influence on yield compared to an actual cutting bill. Iterative search led to a cutting bill part group matrix that encompasses five groups in length and four groups in width, forming a 20 -part group matrix.

Investigation shows that in <b>rough</b> <b>cutting</b> operation, machining speed and surface roughness increases with increasing discharge energy across the electrodes. Different values of machining speed and surface roughness were obtained for four work materials under the similar conditions of discharge energy.

Trim cutting operation at similar discharge parameters but with different wire offset were performed for four work materials.

40|$|Virtual {{testing of}} portal machine tool {{has been carried}} out with the help of finite {{elements}} method (FEM). Static, modal and harmonic analyses have been made for a heavy planer. The paper reveals influence of concrete filler on machine tool dynamic flexibility. A peculiar feature of the simulation is concrete filling of a high-level transverse beam. Such approach oes look a typical one for machine-tool industry. Concrete has been considered as generalized material in two variants. It has been established that concrete application provides approximately 3 -fold increase in machine tool rigidity per each coordinate. In this regard it is necessary to arrange closure of rigidity contour by filling all the cavities inside of the portal. Modal FEA makes it possible to determine that concrete increases comparatively weakly (1. 3 – 1. 4 -fold) frequencies of resonance modes. Frequency of the lowest mode rises only from 30. 25 to 42. 86 Hz. The following most active whole-machine eigenmodes have been revealed in the paper: “Portal pecking”, “Parallelogram” and “Traverse pecking”. In order to restrain the last mode it is necessary to carry out concrete filling of the traverse, in particular. Frequency-response characteristics and curves of dynamic rigidity for a spindle have been plotted for 0 – 150 Hz interval while using harmonic FEM. It has been determined that concrete increases dynamic machine tool rigidity by 2. 5 – 3. 5 -fold. The effect is obtained even in the case when weakly damping concrete (2 %) is used. This is due to distribution of vibrational energy flow along concrete and along cast iron as well. Thus energy density and vibration amplitudes must decrease. The paper shows acceptability for internal reinforcement of high-level machine tool parts (for example, portal traverses) and fillers are applied for this purpose. Traverse weighting is compensated by additional torsional, shear and bending rigidity. The machine tool obtains the possibility for <b>rough</b> intermittent <b>cutting</b> even at resonance frequencies. Complete concrete filling of portal cavities is definitely a positive action for static and dynamic properties of the machine tool. </p...|$|R

The purpose of the work herein was to evaluate the variables of the blue fired aluminum oxide heat treatment process. This heat treatment process improves the physical properties of the brown fused aluminum oxide and results in a blue coloring, which uniquely identifies it within the abrasives industry. The work herein includes information beginning with the electro-fusion process of bauxite (the manufacturing of the brown fused aluminum oxide) to the Blue Fired process. It also compares the fracture resistance index between these materials. This index is the inverse of the friability. Besides the content of titanium and iron oxides, process variables such as time, temperature and atmospheric conditions are important to monitor {{in order to reach}} standard requirements. Experimental evidence measuring these parameters is presented in the article herein. The blue coloring of this aluminum oxide is explained by the optical phenomena of electron transition, and not by the formation of aluminum titanate, as some technical literature has stated. Furthermore, it was proved that the coloring of blue fired material should not be used exclusively as an indicator of the optimal abrasive characteristics of this class of aluminum oxide...|$|R

The main objective of the project are to study the optimum cutting parameters that are the cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut for single tool boring process to obtain the best surface roughness. The Brinell hardness of the material tested is 151. In this study, the Design of Experiment (DOE) with Box-Behnken design is used. By using the STATISTICA software a table of run was generated based on the full factorial with three factor and three levels. Twenty seven experiments are then run according to the "Table of run" generated by the STATISTICA software and the surface roughness value is recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify the significant cutting parameters that affect the surface roughness. The ANOVA table has shown that from the 27 experiments, cutting speeds and depth of cut are significant. From the experiment, rough optimization values are obtained. The <b>rough</b> optimizations of <b>cutting</b> speeds are 110 mlmin and the depths of cut are, 0. 278 mm gives a surface roughness value of 2. 18 pm. The experiments are continued by another ten experiments to find the fine optimized cutting speed and depth of cut to obtain the best surface roughness. It was concluded that the fine optimization cutting speeds for the mild steel (AISI 1019) are 112 m/min and the depths of cut are 0. 182 mm gives a surface roughness of 2. 06 pm for the specific machine. The usage of a harder material which is commonly used in industry and cutting parameter such as tool nose radius and length of the boring tool is highly recommended to find the optimization parameter for the best surface roughness in the boring operation...|$|R
