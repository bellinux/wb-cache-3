However, due to the <b>roughneck</b> {{reputation}} of their neighborhood at the time, the Excelsior District, Garcia's mother moved their family to Menlo Park. During their stay in Menlo Park, Garcia became acquainted with racism and antisemitism, things he disliked intensely. The same year, Garcia was also introduced to rock and roll and rhythm and blues by his brother, and enjoyed listening {{to the likes of}} Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, B. B.

Clifford often memorized the vocals for his favorite songs, and would then make Garcia learn the harmony parts, a move to which Garcia later attributed much of his early ear training.|$|E

Lafayette immediately {{left his}} troops {{and went to}} see the king, grandly announcing himself with the declaration, [...] "I have come to die at the feet of Your Majesty". Outside, an uneasy night was spent in which his Parisian guardsmen mingled with the marchers, and the two groups sounded each other out. Many in the crowd persuasively denounced Lafayette as a traitor, complaining of his resistance to leaving Paris and the slowness of his march. By the first light of morning, an alliance of the national guards and the women was evident, and as the crowd's vigor was restored, their <b>roughneck</b> poissard clamoring resumed.|$|E
500|$|Other writers, such as Mark Anthony Neal, have {{described}} these lyrical themes {{as a form}} of “brooding introspection”, disclosing the tortured dimensions of drug crime and its impressions on an adolescent Nas.

He traveled to Vermont in 1830 as a debate coach for the University of Vermont, at Burlington; however, he left after a year due to symptoms of tuberculosis. [...] Colt then traveled to the Great Lakes to recuperate and bought a farm in Michigan on Gooden's Lake; however, tubercular symptoms surfaced again and he soon left for Cincinnati, Ohio, where he became a teacher of one of the first correspondence courses in America; he also became a center of a Bohemian circle, and counted John Howard Payne and Hiram Powers among his friends.|$|E

Owen worked for Mara as a supervisor in his Harlem River area coalyard in the offseason. Mara said that his leaderships skills displayed in that job earned him the top position. Owen was decidedly blue collar; he {{grew up on a}} farm in Oklahoma where he was raised by a [...] "prairie schoolmarm and a Cherokee strip farmer", and spent his summer vacations in high school working as a <b>roughneck</b> in a Burkburnett, Texas oil field. An accomplished player who was noted for his toughness and physical strength, Owen had to learn on the job as a head coach.

500|$|On the contrary, Girlschool's {{change of}} musical style in 1984 and their sudden predilection for the US market were not well {{received}} by the British press and by their fans at home. The change of attitude and image, exemplified by the music video for [...] "Running Wild" [...] on rotation on MTV, which showed the girls playing with heavy make-up, combed hair and fancy costumes, imitating a trendy American glam outfit, alienated the love of British fans, whose perception of the band was still that of <b>roughneck</b> companions to Motörhead, instead of competitors of Mötley Crüe and Ratt. In the time span of two years, Girlschool passed from headliner act to having serious difficulty to find a gig in the UK: [...] "Nobody seems to want us in Britain anymore", confessed McAuliffe to journalist Malcolm Dome in 1984.

500|$|Critical {{opinion of}} the music video was {{generally}} favorable.

Farber also lauded the video's depiction of sexuality, stating [...] "it feels like a privilege to be part of such a comfortable act of carnality. Was it good for you, too?". A columnist for Billboard magazine shared a similar sentiment about the video, writing that [...] "it's pure sexuality. D'Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it. The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year". However, David Thigpen of Time magazine criticized the vanity of the video, stating [...] "It's a good song, but I thought he was preening pretty heavily in the video". Thigpen also compared it to the music video for singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette's [...] "Thank U" [...] (1998), which features Morissette appearing nude, and stated [...] "Nakedness is usually an expression of vulnerability — that was the point of the Alanis Morissette video. But in this case, it's really about power, an in-your-face form of masculinity". Douglas Century of The New York Times called it [...] "the most controversial music video to air in years", and favored the video's unconventional concept, writing that [...] "'Untitled' breaks a long-established pattern in hip-hop and R videos in which male artists are often dressed in <b>roughneck</b> gear — baggy jeans, Timberland boots and baseball caps — surrounded by shimmying women in thong bikinis".|$|E
