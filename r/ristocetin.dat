40|$|<b>Ristocetin</b> will {{induce the}} {{agglutination}} of platelets {{in the presence}} of von Willebrand factor. In previous studies, an electrostatic mechanism was proposed for this phenomenon wherein first the platelet's surface charge is reduced by the binding of <b>ristocetin</b> and then the von Willebrand factor acts as a bridge between platelets. To test this hypothesis, the effects of <b>ristocetin</b> and von Willebrand factor, singly and together, on the electrophoretic mobility of normal, trypsinized, and Bernard-Soulier platelets was measured. <b>Ristocetin</b> alone, at concentrations of 0. 5 mg/ml or more, produced a statistically significant reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of fresh or fixed platelets. Control experiments showed that the reduction was not due to changes in the ionic milieu of the solution. Therefore, the decrease in platelet mobility is evidence for binding of <b>ristocetin</b> to the platelet surface. Bernard-Soulier and trypsinized platelets also had reductions in mobility with <b>ristocetin,</b> suggesting that <b>ristocetin</b> binds to the platelet at sites other than the binding site for von Willebrand factor. The presence of plasma from a patient with von Willebrand's disease did not alter the reduction in mobility of normal platelets by <b>ristocetin.</b> However, the reduction was markedly enhanced {{in the presence of}} normal plasma. This enhancement did not occur with Bernard-Soulier platelets and was inhibited by anti-Factor VIII/von Willebrand factor antiserum or trypsinization of the platelets. Thus, the enhanced reduction appears {{to be associated with the}} binding of von Willebrand factor to the platelet surface. These studies indicate that platelets undergo two changes with <b>ristocetin</b> and von Willebrand factor, both of which facilitate agglutination: reduction in net surface charge and binding of von Willebrand factor, a large molecule which can serve as a bridge between platelets. In parallel studies, bovine von Willebrand factor, without <b>ristocetin,</b> agglutinated and reduced the electrophoretic mobility of normal but not Bernard-Soulier or trypsinized platelets; this indicates a similar mechanism of agglutination...|$|E

40|$|The {{agglutination}} {{of human}} platelets by <b>ristocetin</b> and von Willebrand factor was inhibited by aggregated immunoglobulin (Ig) G and by Fc fragments of IgG, {{but not by}} Fab, F(ab′) 2 or pFc fragments of IgG. Because this inhibition occurred with formalin-fixed platelets {{as well as with}} normal platelets, a generalized aggregation of fluid membrane components by Fc fragments was not responsible for this inhibition of <b>ristocetin</b> and von Willebrand factor-induced agglutination. Reciprocal inhibition of platelet Fc receptors was produced by prior incubation of platelets with von Willebrand factor and <b>ristocetin.</b> Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation studies demonstrated that aggregated IgG did not form fluid-phase complexes with von Willebrand factor and <b>ristocetin.</b> Furthermore, passage of von Willebrand factor and <b>ristocetin</b> through a column of immobilized heat-aggregated IgG did not alter platelet agglutinating activity which indicates that aggregated IgG did not inactivate von Willebrand factor or <b>ristocetin.</b> Thus, it was likely that the IgG-mediated interference with platelet agglutination by <b>ristocetin</b> and von Willebrand factor did not occur in the fluid phase but at the platelet surface.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of high shear forces, the in vitro binding of human von Willebrand factor (vWF) to its {{platelet}} receptor glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) can be promoted by two well-characterized mediators, botrocetin and <b>ristocetin.</b> Using purified vWF and GPIb, we have investigated the mechanisms by which <b>ristocetin</b> mediates this binding. Specific binding of vWF monomers to GPIb occurred with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry, but high-affinity binding required the participation of two <b>ristocetin</b> dimers. Binding was strongly dependent on pH and inhibited by low poly-L-lysine concentrations, indicating ristocetin-dependent charge neutralization during the interaction. With increasing <b>ristocetin</b> concentrations, vWF binding depended progressively less on the involvement of its A 1 loop, which is compatible with a model {{in which the two}} <b>ristocetin</b> dimers bridge the vWF-GPIb complex on secondary sites. In agreement with this model, the ristocetin-dimer-promoted stabilization of vWF on GPIb was abolished by low concentrations of poly(Pro-Gly-Pro), which is known to complex <b>ristocetin</b> dimers. Mechanistic analysis of the inhibition of vWF binding by the recombinant vWF fragment Leu 504 -Ser 728 (VCL), which covers the entire A 1 loop, revealed an affinity of VCL for GPIb comparable with that of the botrocetin-vWF complex for GPIb, and identified a specific but 20 -fold lower affinity of VCL in the presence of <b>ristocetin.</b> The proline-rich peptides flanking the vWF A 1 loop, Cys 474 -Val 489 and Leu 694 -Asp 709, inhibited vWF binding semispecifically by competitively interfering with the formation of the GPIb-vWF complex rather than by complexation of free <b>ristocetin</b> dimers. In conclusion, ristocetin-promoted binding of vWF to its GPIb receptor results from charge neutralization and interactions involving proline residues {{in the vicinity of the}} natural interaction sites present on both GPIb and the A 1 domain of vWF. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{determination}} of the relative affinity of vancomycin and <b>ristocetin</b> for isolated cell walls and for a peptidoglycan precursor was made. These antibiotics had previously been shown to adsorb to cell walls and to complex with peptides containing a d-alanyl-d-alanine C-terminus. By using 14 C-uridine diphosphate (UDP) -N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide, it was shown that the complex which is formed between this peptidoglycan precursor and either vancomycin or <b>ristocetin</b> does not preclude adsorption of the antibiotics to cell walls of Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Complex formation between <b>ristocetin</b> and UDP-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide was assured by differential absorption spectra.
