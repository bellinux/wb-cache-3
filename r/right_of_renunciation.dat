In 1905, Nicholas I of Montenegro's [...] "Statute of Montenegro" [...] promulgated further guidelines, for the first time using the term [...] "Montenegrin citizens" [...] instead of [...] "Montenegrins" [...] and [...] "Highlanders", and also establishing the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>renunciation</b> of citizenship after completion of military service. However the law did not spell out the guidelines for acquisition of citizenship.|$|E

The Custom stated that if such a right was specified in the marriage contract, a widow could choose between taking a legal or contractual dower. The vast majority of early modern marriage contracts in New France {{provided for}} dowers, and in Quebec City and Montreal, {{the vast majority of}} wives with dower rights also had the right to choose their form. However, the principle that such transactions involving the dower could not be carried out by the husband without the wifes presence or written permission was not always respected.|$|E

The early time renunciation is consistent with the model <b>of</b> <b>renunciation</b> presented by heterodox traditions, while the late time <b>of</b> <b>renunciation</b> parallels the orthodox asrama system's model <b>of</b> <b>renunciation.</b> The forty-nine stories discussed in this thesis are organized according to a tripartite typology based on the social position of the renunciant, the time <b>of</b> <b>renunciation,</b> and the cause <b>of</b> <b>renunciation.</b> The stories are initially divided into three groups according to the social position of the renunciant- ordinar...|$|R
