40|$|Graduation date: 1988 A {{high-pressure}} {{liquid chromatography}} method based on reported literature {{was developed for}} the quantitative analysis of chlorpheniramine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and acetaminophen in dissolution fluids and urine. The effects of buffer, pH and different concentrations of organic solvent in the mobile phase on chromatographic separation are described in Chapter I. Dissolution studies using the USP rotating-basket method were carried out on several commercially available brands of sustained and immediate release products. Dissolution pattern comparisons among products provided preliminary data before conducting a <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> <b>study.</b> Relative bioavailability of chlorpheniramine from one immediate and two sustained-release products was determined in a urinary excretion study using 4 normal healthy subjects. Urinary excretion of acetaminophen was also studied in these four subjects. Bioavailability results were consistent with dissolution results...|$|E
40|$|During a {{carbamazepine}} (CBZ) <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> <b>study</b> involving tablets and a syrup preparation, salivary drug concentrations appeared disproportionately high {{relative to}} simultaneous plasma drug {{concentrations in the}} first 2 - 3 h after oral drug intake. This raised the suspicion of contamination of saliva by retention of drug in the mouth. In a separate study CBZ was retained in the mouth in tablet form (whole or crushed) or in syrup, for only 5 s before being spat out, and the mouth was carefully rinsed. Despite this, measurable salivary concentrations, sufficient to cause substantial error if extrapolated to simultaneous plasma drug concentrations, were present for at least 2 h after drug administration. CBZ in these studies disappeared from saliva with an apparent mean half-life of 21. 0 ± 4. 8 min. This experience suggests that, in therapeutic drug monitoring, salivary CBZ concentrations for at least 2 h after dosage may lead to invalid conclusions about simultaneous plasma CBZ concentrations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe former use of {{chlordecone}} (CLD) in the French West Indies {{has resulted}} in long-term pollution of soils and of food chains. CLD may be transferred into eggs of hens reared outdoors, through polluted soil ingestion. Tropical volcanic soils display variable capacities of pollutant retention: CLD is less available and more persistent in andosol than in nitisol. The impact of soil type on CLD bioavailability to hens was tested through a <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> <b>study.</b> The deposition of CLD in egg yolk and in abdominal fat was measured in 42 individually housed laying hens fed with diets containing graded levels of CLD from polluted andosol, nitisol, or spiked oil during 23 days. Within each ingested matrix, the concentration of CLD in yolk and in abdominal fat linearly increased {{with the amount of}} ingested CLD (P 0. 1), indicating that CLD was equally bioavailable to laying hens, irrespective of the matrix.

40|$|International audienceThe {{exposure}} assessment of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) contaminated soils {{is a critical}} issue {{in terms of human}} health, especially since little reliable information on transfer of PCBs to humans via involuntary soil ingestion is available. Indeed, young children with their hand-to-mouth activity may be exposed to contaminated soils. The current study addresses the impact of soil organic matter (OM) condensation on bioavailability of sequestrated NDL-PCBs. Three artificial soils (ASs) were prepared according to OECD guideline 207. One standard soil (SS), devoid of OM, and two amended versions of this SS with fulvic acid (FA) or activated carbon (AC) were prepared to obtain 1 % organic mass. This study involved fourteen juvenile male swine as a digestive physiology model of young children. Animals were randomly distributed into 4 contaminated groups (3 replicates) and a control one (2 replicates). During 10 d, the piglets were fed AS or a corn oil spiked with 19200 ng of Aroclor 1254 per g of dry matter (6000 ng g(- 1) of NDL-PCBs) to achieve an exposure dose of 1200 ng NDL-PCBs kg(- 1) of body weight per day. After 10 d of oral exposure, NDL-PCBs in adipose tissue, liver and muscles were analyzed by GC-MS, after extraction and purification. Two distinct groups of treatments were found: on the one hand oil, SS and FA, on the other hand C and AC. This study highlights that condensed OM (AC) strongly reduces bioavailability whereas the less condensed one (FA) {{does not seem to have}} a significant effect. This result has to be considered as a first major step for further <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> <b>studies</b> involving mixture of different humic substances...|$|R
40|$|In this <b>study,</b> cadmium (Cd) <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> in {{contaminated}} (n = 5) and spiked (n = 2) soils {{was assessed}} using an in vivo mouse model following administration of feed containing soil or Cd acetate (reference material) over a 15 day exposure period. Cadmium <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> varied {{depending on whether the}} accumulation of Cd in the kidneys, liver, or kidney plus liver was used for <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> calculations. When kidney plus liver Cd concentrations were used, Cd <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> ranged from 10. 1 to 92. 1 %. Cadmium <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> was higher (14. 4 - 115. 2 %) when kidney Cd concentrations were used, whereas lower values (7. 2 - 76. 5 %) were derived when liver Cd concentrations were employed in calculations. Following in vivo studies, four in vitro methodologies (SBRC, IVG, PBET, and DIN), encompassing both gastric and intestinal phases, were assessed for their ability to predict Cd <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability.</b> Pearson correlations demonstrated a strong linear relationship between Cd <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> and Cd bioaccessibility (0. 62 - 0. 91), however, stronger in vivo-in vitro relationships were observed when Cd <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> was calculated using kidney plus liver Cd concentrations. Whereas all in vitro assays could predict Cd <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> with varying degrees of confidence (r(2) = 0. 348 - 0. 835), large y intercepts were calculated for a number of in vitro assays which is undesirable for in vivo-in vitro predictive models.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the systemic bioavailability {{of a new}} controlled release cyclobenzaprine tablet, {{and the influence of}} a high fat meal on its bioavailabillty. Subjects, materials and methods: 24 and 12 healthy male subjects were recruited for the bioavailability and influence of diet studies, respectively. Experimental design for both studies was an open randomized, 2 -period, single dose, crossover <b>study.</b> In the <b>bioavailability</b> <b>study,</b> each subject received in different occasions, a single oral dose of cyclobenzaprine of immediate (10 mg) or controlled release (20 mg) tablet, followed by a 2 -week washout period. In the influence of diet study, the volunteers received the controlled-release tablet concomitantly with a high fat meal or in a state of fasting. Results: In the <b>bioavailability</b> <b>study,</b> plasma cyclobenzaprine profiles were in agreement with a controlled release system. This formulation presented a 92. 8 % of <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> (IC 85. 5 - 105 %) and a significant reduction in C-max (IC 58 - 65. 5 %), when compared with equal dose of the immediate release tablet. The presence of food increased AUC (11. 6 %) and C-max (48 %). For both parameters the calculated 90 % confidence interval was not in the bioequivalence interval, 97. 4 - 125. 8 % for AUC and 111. 7 - 184. 2 % for C-max. Conclusions: The controlled release tablet showed a <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> comparable with equal dose of the immediate release product and produced a significantly lower C-max, as expected in a controlled release formulation.

40|$|Levothyroxine sodium {{is a drug}} with {{a narrow}} {{therapeutic}} index for which an individual patient must have his or her dose carefully titrated to achieve the necessary therapeutic effect. In addition, exogenous levothyroxine cannot be distinguished from the endogenously produced hormone. Since 2004, generic formulations have been approved for the most frequently prescribed brands of levothyroxine sodium. This review examines the methodology and statistical acceptance criteria and summarizes findings of a previously published <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> <b>study</b> that brings into question the use of standard criteria to assess bioequivalence of levothyroxine sodium. The key findings reviewed were the following: (1) {{in the absence of}} baseline correction for endogenous T 4 levels, products that differed by as much as 25 % to 33 % would be declared bioequivalent; (2) the use of baseline correction reduced the likelihood of declaring products bioequivalent when they actually differed by 25 % to 33 %; (3) even with baseline correction, products that differed by 12. 5 % would be declared bioequivalent; and (4) there was evidence of significant carryover from one dosing period to the next even with washout periods of up to 53 days. In conclusion, the current recommended methodology in the United States to assess bioequivalence for levothyroxine sodium products is inadequate to differentiate products that differ by 12. 5 %, a clinically relevant difference. Recommendations are made for modifications to the criteria that could improve the likelihood that products that differ by a clinically significant amount in their bioavailability would not be accepted as bioequivalent...|$|E

40|$|Soil plays a {{significant}} role in controlling the potential bioavailability of contaminants in the environment. In this study, eleven soils were used to investigate the relationship between soil properties and <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> (RB) of lead (Pb). To minimise the effect of source of Pb on in vivo <b>bioavailability,</b> uncontaminated <b>study</b> soils were spiked with 1500 mg Pb/kg soil and aged for 10 – 12 months prior to investigating the relationships between soil properties and in vivo RB of Pb using swine model. The biological responses to oral administration of Pb in aqueous phase or as spiked soils were compared by applying a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model to blood Pb concentration. The study revealed that RB of Pb from aged soils ranged from 30 ± 9 % to 83 ± 7 %. The very different RB of Pb in these soils was attributed to variations in the soils’ physico-chemical properties. This was established using sorption studies showing: firstly, Freundlich partition coefficients that ranged from 21 to 234; and secondly, a strongly significant (R² = 0. 94, P < 0. 001) exponential relationship between RB and Freundlich partition coefficient (Kd).

40|$|Background: The goal of {{this study}} was to develop an in vivo-in vitro (IVIV) correlation, both in men and women, which allows {{constructing}} a model to predict bioequivalence assessments for drugs with narrow absorption windows. Besides, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equivalences were also investigated. Furosemide was chosen as a prototype. Methods: Twelve healthy Caucasian volunteers (8 women and 4 men) participated in a <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> <b>study.</b> Two oral formulations [Lasix® (Reference, R) and Furosemide EFA® (Test, T) ] were administered under fasting conditions. Urinary excretion of unchanged drug (PK), and of chloride, sodium and potassium (PD) wasmonitored throughout time. PK and PD parameters were calculated from each respective excretion rate versus time curve. In vitro dissolution testing of both formulations was carried out using the USP apparatus 2 and 4 with fixed and variable dissolution media. Results: T and R could be considered bioequivalent since the 90 % confidence intervals for the T/R ratio of geometric means for the area under the urinary drug excretion rate versus time curve and for the maximum excretion rate were within the 0. 80 - 1. 25 bioequivalence interval. However, T had faster initial absorption and higher levels in women, while R displayed such characteristics in men. Closer IVIV correlations in women were obtained when apparatus 4 with variable biorelevant dissolution media were used [going from fasting state simulated gastric fluid to fasting state simulated intestinal fluid]. Since R had faster disintegration time than T, a shorter stay of R under gastric conditions was required in order to obtain a good IVIV correlation in men. Saluretic effect displayed a typical clockwise hysteresis loop for the PKPD correlation assessed through chloride-versus-furosemide urinary excretion rates. Even though a higher amount of furosemide was excreted with the urine in men, differences in the excretion of electrolytes between sexes were almost negligible. Conclusions: Sex-differences in the gastrointestinal transit of formulations, under fasting conditions, determined the extent and the rate of furosemide absorption. The prolongation of the absorption process by mean of slowing the gastric emptying would make the formulation more effective. The USP- 4 apparatus with variable dissolution media was able to discriminate the formulations even between sexes, becoming a promissory in vitro dissolution testing to predict bioequivalence...|$|E

One hundred and sixty eight male Ross 308 broiler chicks were divided into 42 groups 4 balanced for body weight and fed 7 diets in a completely randomized design (6 groups/diet) from day 1 to 21 of age. The diets were a corn-soybean meal basal diet, and the corn-soybean meal basal diet to which monosodium phosphate, brown- or yellow-seeded pea was added at the expense of cornstarch to supply 0. 5 % or 1 % total phosphorus. Monosodium phosphate was included as a reference, and hence the estimated bioavailability of P in pea cultivars was relative to that in the monosodium phosphate. Birds and feed were weighed weekly and on d 21 they were killed to obtain tibia. The brown-seeded pea contained 23. 4 % crude protein, 0. 47 % P, whereas the yellow-seeded pea contained 24. 3 % crude protein and 0. 38 % P. Increasing dietary P supply improved (p< 0. 05) chick body weight gain and tibia ash and bone density. The estimated <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> of p values for brown- and yellow-seeded peas obtained using final body weight, average daily gain, tibia ash, and bone mineral density were 31. 5 % and 36. 2 %, 35. 6 % and 37. 3 %, 23. 0 % and 5. 60 %, and 40. 3 % and 30. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|The UK Food Standards Agency {{convened a}} group of expert {{scientists}} to review current research investigating folate bioavailability. The workshop aimed to overview current research and establish priorities for future research. Discrepancies were observed in the evidence base for folate bioavailability, {{especially with regard to}} the <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> of natural folates compared with folic acid. A substantial body of evidence shows folic acid to have superior <b>bioavailability</b> <b>relative</b> to food folates; however, the exact <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> still needs to be determined, and in particular with regard to mixed diets. The bioavailability of folate in a mixed diet is probably not a weighted average of that in the various foods consumed; thus the workshop considered that assessment of folate bioavailability of whole diets should be a high priority for future research...|$|R

40|$|Background: b-Hydroxy-b-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to enhance muscle protein synthesis and attenuate loss of muscle mass by multiple pathways. The beneficial effects of HMB have been studied by using either the calcium salt, monohydrate, of HMB (CaHMB) or the free acid form (FAHMB). Objective: The present {{study was designed to}} compare the pharmacokinetics and <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> of the 2 forms of HMB administered as a liquid suspension in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Methods: CaHMB at 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg and equivalent doses of FAHMB at 24. 2, 80. 8, and 242 mg/kgwere administered orally as a liquid suspension to male Sprague-Dawley rats. A single i. v. dose of 5 mg/kg CaHMB, corresponding to an equivalent dose of 4. 04 mg/kg FAHMB, was also administered. Plasma concentrations of HMB were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandemmass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic variables and <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> of the 2 forms of HMBwere determined. Results: After oral administration, the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from time 0 to time t (0 -t) and from time 0 to infinity (0 -N) and the maximum (peak) plasma concentration (Cmax) for CaHMB were significantly greater than for FAHMB,whereas the time to reachCmax did not differ from that of FAHMB. The <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> of CaHMBwas 49 %, 54 %, and 27 %greater than that of FAHMB for the 3 respective oral doses tested. After i. v. administration, the AUCs 0 -t and 0 -N of the calcium salt were significantly greater than those of FAHMB.

40|$|Background: Sucralfate impairs {{absorption}} of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones in humans, but no sucralfate-fluoroquinolone interaction {{has been reported}} in dogs. Veterinary formularies recommend avoiding concurrent administration of these medications, which might impact compliance, therapeutic success, and resistance selection from fluoroquinolones. Objectives: To determine whether a drug interaction exists when sucralfate is administered to fed dogs concurrently with ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin, and whether a 2 hour delay between fluoroquinolone and sucralfate affects fluoroquinolone absorption. Animals: Five healthy Greyhounds housed in a research colony. Methods: This was a randomized crossover study. Treatments included oral ciprofloxacin (C) or oral enrofloxacin (E) alone, each fluoroquinolone concurrently with an oral suspension of sucralfate (CS, ES), and sucralfate suspension 2 hours after each fluoroquinolone (C 2 S, E 2 S). Fluoroquinolone concentrations were evaluated using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Results: Drug exposure of ciprofloxacin was highly variable (AUC 5. 52 - 22. 47 h ?g/mL) compared to enrofloxacin (AUC 3. 86 - 7. 50 h ?g/mL). The mean <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> for ciprofloxacin and concurrent sucralfate was 48 % (range 8 - 143 %) compared to ciprofloxacin alone. <b>Relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> of ciprofloxacin improved to 87 % (range 37 - 333 %) when sucralfate was delayed by 2 hours. By contrast, <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> for enrofloxacin and concurrent sucralfate was 104 % (94 - 115 %). Citation: KuKanich, K., KuKanich, B., Guess, S. and Heinrich, E.

Quetiapine fumarate is an antipsychotic drug with poor oral bioavailability (9 %) due to first-pass metabolism. Present work {{is an attempt}} to improve oral bioavailability of quetiapine fumarate by incorporating in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN). Six quetiapine fumarate SLN formulationswere developed using three different lipids by hot homogenisation followed by ultrasonication. Thedrug excipient compatibility was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Stable quetiapine fumarate SLNs having a mean particle size of 200 – 250 nm with entrapment efficiency varying in between 80 % and 92 % were developed. The physical stability of optimized formulation F 3 was checked at room temperature for 2 months. Comparative <b>bioavailability</b> <b>studies</b> were conducted in male Wistar rats after oral administration of quetiapine fumarate suspension and SLN formulation. The <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> of quetiapine fumarate from optimized SLN preparation was increased by 3. 71 times when compared with the reference quetiapine fumarate suspension. The obtained results are indicative of SLNs as potential lipid carriers for improving the bioavailability of quetiapine fumarate by minimizing first-pass metabolism. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Lenalidomide (LND) is an {{anti-cancer}} {{drug and}} an effective derivative of thalidomide used for multiple myeloma therapy. Because of its poor solubility in water, LND {{is known to}} cause low oral bioavailability (below 33 %), and as {{a direct consequence of}} this, the dosing frequency is extended thus increasing risk of toxicity. To improve its bioavailability and sustained release, the present study aims to formulate polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) for LND using [Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) ] (PLGA) as a polymer. The polymeric NPs were evaluated for particle size, SEM, XRD, drug content, entrapment efficiency (EE), in vitro release studies and in vivo <b>bioavailability</b> <b>studies</b> in rats. The formulated NPs possessed a size of 179 ± 0. 9 nm and a zeta potential of - 24. 4 ± 0. 2 mV. The drug loading and EE of the optimized formulation was 32 ± 0. 37 % and 78 ± 0. 92 % respectively. After oral administration of LND PLGA-NPs, the <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> was enhanced about 3. 67 -fold compared to LND. This study demonstrates the novel drug delivery for LND with PLGA-NPs as effective drug delivery system for sustained delivery of LND...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] A simple {{non-invasive}} method, {{in which}} a urine sample is taken 30 minutes after drug administration, has previously {{been shown to be}} a measure of the <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> of salbutamol to the lungs. This technique has been used to determine an optimal inhaler technique with commercially available metered dose inhalers (MDI). METHODS [...] Ten healthy subjects were trained in the use of MDIs. Each inhaled 4 x 100 micrograms salbutamol in a series of experiments to examine the <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> to the lung after different respiratory manoeuvres. Urine collection intervals were 0 - 0. 5 hours and 0. 5 - 24 hours after administration. RESULTS [...] There was significantly greater elimination of unchanged salbutamol 30 minutes after administration, indicating a greater <b>relative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> of salbutamol to the lungs after (1) exhaling gently to residual volume rather than to functional residual capacity before inhalation; (2) slow inhalation (10 l/min) compared with fast inhalation (50 l/min); (3) breath holding for 10 seconds after inhalation compared with no breath holding. CONCLUSIONS [...] All patient information leaflets and healthcare personnel should standardise the instructions given to patients and should adopt the inhalation method proposed...|$|R
40|$|Absolute <b>bioavailability</b> <b>studies</b> {{in humans}} are not {{routinely}} performed {{as part of}} the drug registration process. They tend to be reasonably demanding, not least because toxicology data are required to support intravenous administration of a drug. Moreover, the classical crossover design of an absolute <b>bioavailability</b> <b>study</b> can suffer from artefacts caused by concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. Many of the problems associated with absolute <b>bioavailability</b> <b>studies</b> can be alleviated using isotopically labelled drugs. Stable isotopes have been used in the performance of absolute <b>bioavailability</b> <b>studies</b> in humans for > 30 years. More recently, the advantages of using radiolabelled drugs have been expanded by using the ultrasensitive technology of accelerator mass spectrometry.
