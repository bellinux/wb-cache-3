40|$|SUMMARY Of 19 {{patients}} with chronic non-specific lung disease, chosen without reference to dyspeptic symptoms, 17 (89 %) exhibited duodenogastric <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> barium indicating pyloric in-competence. In the one patient who proved to have a gastric ulcer the amount <b>of</b> <b>reflux</b> diminished when the ulcer healed. The degree of pyloric incompetence was {{not found to be}} related to the severity of arterial blood gas or pH disturbance or to the presence of right heart failure. All patients who exhibited <b>reflux</b> had evidence <b>of</b> obstructive airways disease and most were receiving bronchodilators. We believe that <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> detergent bile into the stomach may explain the high incidence of dyspepsia and acute gastric ulceration in chronic non-specific lung disease. Reports that bile appears in the stomach more frequently in gastric than in duodenal ulcer (James and Pickering, 1949; Watkinson, 1951) suggested that this might be a factor in the production of gastric ulcer. Duodenogastric <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> barium in the majority of {{patients with}} gastric ulcer was demon...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} gastric juice on tumorigenesis in a rat model of esophageal adenocarcinoma. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In rats treated with the carcinogen methyl-n-amyl nitrosamine, squamous cancer of the esophagus develops in a time- and dose-dependent manner. When methyl-n-amyl nitrosamine treatment is preceded by an operation to induce <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> duodenal and gastric juice into the esophagus, there is an increased yield of esophageal tumors, {{many of which are}} adenocarcinomas. When only gastric juice refluxes into the esophagus, the tumor yield is less and adenocarcinomas are not found. METHODS: Two hundred seventy 8 -week old Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Twenty unoperated rats served as controls. The remaining rats underwent the following operations: esophagoduodenostomy with gastric and vagal preservation to induce duodenogastroesophageal reflux (n = 48); esophagoduodenostomy with antrectomy and Billroth 1 reconstruction to produce <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> duodenogastric juice with the exclusion of the antrum (n = 53); esophagoduodenostomy with proximal gastrectomy to induce hypergastrinemia and <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> duodenogastric juice with exclusion of the body and forestomach (n = 51); esophagoduodenostomy plus total gastrectomy to produce <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> duodenal juice alone (n = 50); and esophagoduodenostomy with vagal and gastric preservation but with division of the duodenum just beyond the pylorus and reimplantation into the jejunum, 13 cm distal to the esophagoduodenostomy. This produced <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> duodenal juice with gastric juice diverted downstream, (n = 48). At 10 weeks of age, all rats were given 4 weekly doses of carcinogen (methyl-n-amyl nitrosamine, 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and survivors were killed at 36 weeks of age. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of esophageal adenocarcinoma was 30 % in rats with duodenogastroesophageal reflux and 87 % in rats with <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> duodenal juice alone. Fifty-six percent <b>of</b> rats with <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> duodenogastric juice with exclusion of the antrum and 72 % <b>of</b> rats with <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> duodenogastric juice with the exclusion of the body and forestomach developed adenocarcinoma, showing a progression increase in the prevalence of adenocarcinoma as less gastric juice was permitted to reflux with duodenal juice into the esophagus. CONCLUSION: In this rat model, the presence of gastric juice in refluxed duodenal juice against the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The protective effect appears to be due to acid secretion from the stomach. Continuous profound acid suppression therapy may be detrimental by encouraging esophageal metaplasia and tumorigenesis in patients with duodenogastroesophageal reflux...|$|R

30|$|Kumamoto et al. have {{postulated}} that the <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> activated pancreatic juice {{is the strongest}} contributing factor to carcinogenesis. A study of biliary enteric reconstruction performed for benign disease {{has shown that the}} incidence of cholangiocarcinoma after choledochoduodenostomy is higher compared to hepaticojejunostomy (7.6 vs. 1.9  %) [6]. They postulate that this significant difference in incidence rate occurs because activated pancreatic juice can more easily flow back to the biliary tract in a choledochoduodenostomy as compared to a hepaticojejunostomy and hence, the <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> activated pancreatic juice might be the strongest carcinogenic factor. However, of the cases reported in the literature, few patients had reconstruction with a choledochoduodenostomy, suggesting that unlike other benign pathologies, in patients with previous choledochal cysts, <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> pancreatic juice may not be the strongest carcinogenic factor.|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{demonstrate}} the imaging findings of biliopancreatic and pancreatico-biliary reflux {{in patients with}} anomalous union of the pancreatico-biliary duct (AUPBD) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced functional magnetic resonance cholangiography (fMRC). METHODS: This study included six consecutive patients (two men and four women; mean age 47. 5 years) with AUPBD. All subjects underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP); one subject also underwent bile sampling of the common bile duct (CBD) to measure the amylase level because his gadoxetic acid-enhanced fMRC images showed evidence <b>of</b> pancreatico-biliary <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> pancreatic secretions. Of the five patients with choledochal cysts, four underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. RESULTS: The five cases of choledochal cysts were classified as Todani classification&#x 2005;I. In three of the six patients with AUPBD, injected contrast media reached the distal CBD and pancreatic duct on delay images, suggesting biliopancreatic <b>reflux.</b> In two <b>of</b> these six patients, a band-like filling defect was noted in the CBD on pre-fatty meal images, which decreased in size on delayed post-fatty meal images, suggesting pancreatico-biliary <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> pancreatic secretions, and the bile sampled from the CBD in one patient had an amylase level of 113 &#x 2005; 000 IU/L. In {{one of the six}} patients with AUPBD, contrast media did not reach the distal CBD due to multiple CBD stones.

Methods: We retrospectively identified 343 patients investigated for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) by CTPA at our medical center between 9 / 2004 - 3 / 2006. A total of 145 consecutive patients with PE (age 67 ± 19 years) and 168 consecutive ones with negative 1 CTPAs (age 64 ± 20 years) fulfilled entry criteria. CTPAs were evaluated for retrograde <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> contrast to the IVC by fast visual grading from 1 to 6 using the original axial images.

Papillary morphology determines the distribution <b>of</b> intrarenal <b>reflux</b> (IRR) and subsequent scar formation [3 – 6]. There is still considerable controversy whether scarring may occur following intrarenal <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> sterile urine [7, 8] or whether urinary infection is an essential prerequisite [3, 9]. Germane to this argument is the clinical observation that most patients with reflux nephropathy have renal scars when first seen {{and the development of}} completely new scars is a distinctly rare event [10]. The finding of sterile urine in the presence of established scarring does not mean that infection never occurred or that it is unimportant in the pathogenesis of the scarring process. The possibility exists that scarring may develop very quickly in the presence <b>of</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>of</b> infected urine, perhaps even during the first episode of urinary tract infection.
