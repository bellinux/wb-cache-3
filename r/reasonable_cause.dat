The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay.

The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open, which allowed people to look in, but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate, who was usually either a consul (the highest-ranking magistrate) or, if the consul was unavailable, a Praetor (the second-highest ranking magistrate).

In 1359 Bishop Gynwell, passing by the priory, noticed 'certain insolences and unlawful wanderings' of the canons, and wrote to reinforce the rule that none should go beyond the precincts of the monastery without <b>reasonable</b> <b>cause,</b> nor without the permission of the prior; and ordered further that such permission should not be too frequently given.

40|$|Abstract – Within {{the frame}} of Bethe theory, and within the first Born approximation, the basic formula for energy loss {{including}} excitation and ionization of the coupled (projectile-target) system for both (H and C) as projectile {{and a number of}} atoms like (Li, Be, B, C, N, Al, Ca, Fe, Co, and Cu) as targets were considered.

500|$|In 1968, Congress {{passed the}} Gun Control Act (GCA), under which modern firearm {{commerce}} operates. The GCA mandated Federal Firearms Licenses (FFLs) for those [...] "engaged in the business" [...] of selling firearms, {{but not for}} private individuals who sold firearms infrequently. Under the Gun Control Act, firearm dealers were prohibited from doing business anywhere except the address listed on their Federal Firearms License. It also mandated that licensed firearm dealers maintain records of firearms sales.

500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the 911 call contained sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the traffic stop. Although he acknowledged that this was a [...] "close case", Justice Thomas concluded that indicia of the 911 caller's reliability were stronger than those in Florida v. J.L., where the Court held a [...] "bare-bones" [...] tip was unreliable. Justice Thomas began his opinion by emphasizing that the Supreme Court had [...] "firmly rejected the argument that <b>reasonable</b> <b>cause</b> for an investigative stop can only be based on the officer’s personal observation, rather than on information supplied by another person.” By identifying the make, model, and license plate number of the pickup truck, Justice Thomas argued that [...] "the caller necessarily claimed eyewitness knowledge of the alleged dangerous driving," [...] and that basis of knowledge supported the tip's reliability. Furthermore, Justice Thomas concluded that [...] " [...] driver’s claim that another vehicle ran her off the road, however, necessarily implies that the informant knows the other car was driven dangerously." [...] Justice Thomas also noted that the calls made through the 911 emergency system are particularly reliable, because calls are recorded and individuals may face prosecution for making false reports.|$|E

The inquiry found that the ammunition issued to the men was of the same type the men previously used, and was in fact manufactured {{under the supervision of}} one of the five men who had accepted his ammunition during the parade. During the inquiry, only one man expressed a concern regarding the greased cartridges; the wider concerns of the men were based on the perceived stigma that they would face if they had accepted the ammunition. The inquiry found that the men had no <b>reasonable</b> <b>cause,</b> and no religious grounds, to refuse to accept the cartridges. A court martial was ordered, again composed entirely of Indian officers (six Muslim, nine Hindu), and this took place over a three-day period with each of the 85 men giving a plea of [...] "not guilty". The men were found guilty, by 14 of 15 officers, of disobeying orders, and were sentenced to 10 years' hard labour. The judges asked Hewitt to take into consideration the fact that the men were of good character and had been misled, but this was ignored as Hewitt felt there had been no expression of remorse. Eleven of the men, the youngest, had their sentences reduced from 10 to 5 years, but sentences of the remaining men were confirmed on 8 May.|$|E

Here we describe 4 previously normal children and one girl with chronic lung disease, secondary to bronchopumonary dysplasia, with acute and significant hemoptysis of variable severity.

In private enforcement, the contents and criteria of the proof of evidences for “reasonable cause” and whether the assessment and comparison between pro-competition vs. anti-competition are limited within the preset scope of AML Article 15 only or can include all <b>reasonable</b> <b>causes</b> in all relevant aspects or elements beyond AML Article 15, also remain unclear.|$|R

2500|$|In 1999, {{the former}} Singaporean President Devan Nair, {{who was living}} in Canada, remarked in an {{interview}} with the Toronto The Globe and Mail that Lee's technique of suing his opponents into bankruptcy or oblivion was an abrogation of political rights. He also remarked that Lee is [...] "an increasingly self-righteous know-all", surrounded by [...] "department store dummies". In response to these remarks, Lee sued Nair in a Canadian court and Nair countersued. Lee then brought a motion to have Nair's counterclaim thrown out of court. Lee argued that Nair's counterclaim disclosed no <b>reasonable</b> <b>cause</b> of action and constituted an inflammatory attack on the integrity of the Singapore government. However, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice refused to throw out Nair's counterclaim, holding that Lee had abused the litigating process and therefore Nair had a <b>reasonable</b> <b>cause</b> of action.|$|E

40|$|The {{requirement}} that the plaintiff in an action for malicious prosecution must prove a lack of <b>reasonable</b> and probable <b>cause</b> to initiate, instigate or continue the prosecution {{on the part of}} the instigator or prosecutor is one of the four elements of that cause of action. It is a vital link between the lawfulness of the prosecution and the state of mind of the defendant. Again, whether a prosecution is wrongful or lawful depends on whether there was a <b>reasonable</b> and probable <b>cause</b> coupled with the animus iniuriandi of the defendant in instigating, initiating or continuing it. It is not whether the prosecutor possessed evidence to secure a conviction since that is for the trial court to decide after the conclusion of evidence; but, the honest belief by the prosecutor that, having carefully collected and objectively assessed the available information, the plaintiff was probably guilty of the crime. In coming to that decision the prosecutor must have grappled with both the subjective and objective elements in the exercise of that discretion. The Australian High Court judgment in A v New South Wales 2007 230 CLR 500 (HCA) has brought clarity to this aspect of the problem. However, as this paper contends, the ten-point guidelines enunciated by that court in that case and designed to provide the courts with a seemingly less complicated formula for determining if the prosecutor lacked <b>reasonable</b> and probable <b>cause</b> do not appear to have provided the panacea to the problem. Meanwhile, the distinct nature of the requirement of <b>reasonable</b> and probable <b>cause</b> is made clearer when it is compared with reasonable ground to arrest in the case of wrongful arrest and the tort of abuse of process. Also problematic and equally challenging is identifying where a <b>reasonable</b> and probable <b>cause</b> inquiry stops and malice begins. This is brought out in the attempt by the Supreme Court of Canada to unravel the tension between the proof of the existence of malice and <b>reasonable</b> and probable <b>cause</b> in the law of malicious prosecution in Miazga v Kvello Estate 2009 3 SCR 339 (SCC). The extent to which the guidelines laid down in these recent cases would have resolved the confusion in this field of the law is yet to be realised...|$|R
