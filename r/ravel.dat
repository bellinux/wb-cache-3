5|$|In 1888 <b>Ravel</b> met {{the young}} pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became {{not only a}} lifelong friend, but {{also one of the}} {{foremost}} interpreters of his works, and an important link between <b>Ravel</b> and Spanish music. The two shared an appreciation of Wagner, Russian music, and the writings of Poe, Baudelaire, and Mallarmé. At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, <b>Ravel</b> was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. This music had a lasting effect on both <b>Ravel</b> and his older contemporary Claude Debussy, as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan, also heard during the Exposition.|$|E
5|$|On 30 December 1937, <b>Ravel</b> {{was buried}} {{next to his}} parents in a granite tomb at the {{cemetery}} at Levallois-Perret, a suburb of northwest Paris. <b>Ravel</b> was an atheist {{and there was no}} religious ceremony.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ravel</b> {{composed}} little during 1913. He {{collaborated with}} Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky's unfinished opera Khovanshchina, {{and his own}} works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier. In 1913, together with Debussy, <b>Ravel</b> was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of The Rite of Spring. Stravinsky later said that <b>Ravel</b> {{was the only person}} who immediately understood the music. <b>Ravel</b> predicted that the premiere of the Rite would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande.|$|E

On January 1, 2012 <b>Ravels</b> had a total population of 14,515. The total area is 94.99 km² which gives a population density of 153 inhabitants per km². A large proportion of its inhabitants are immigrants from The Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|In 1932 he {{conducted}} the Vienna Symphony Orchestra and one-armed pianist Paul Wittgenstein {{in the world}} premiere of Maurice <b>Ravel's</b> Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, after Arturo Toscanini had declined <b>Ravel's</b> invitation to conduct the premiere.|$|R
50|$|The {{piece was}} {{transcribed}} for solo piano by <b>Ravel's</b> friend Jacques Charlot {{the same year}} as it was published (1910); the first movement of <b>Ravel's</b> Le tombeau de Couperin was also dedicated to Charlot's memory after his death in World War I.|$|R
5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{recollections}} {{throw some}} light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that <b>Ravel</b> frequented brothels. Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, <b>Ravel</b> {{was in love with}} Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that <b>Ravel,</b> a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of <b>Ravel</b> by Benjamin Ivry; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years of the new century, <b>Ravel</b> made five {{attempts}} to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome, past winners of which included Berlioz, Gounod, Bizet, Massenet and Debussy. In 1900 <b>Ravel</b> was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition. In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy, the judges suspected <b>Ravel</b> of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies. In 1905 <b>Ravel,</b> by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a furore. He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable. The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu, was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received. L'affaire <b>Ravel</b> became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire.|$|E
5|$|He cites {{animation}} composers Hiroshi Miyagawa and Ryuichi Sakamoto of Yellow Magic Orchestra, impressionist composers Maurice <b>Ravel</b> and Claude Debussy, and {{his father}} as major musical influences. During his adolescence, he enjoyed listening to the works of Miyagawa and Sakamoto. While attending university, he developed an appreciation for classical music, especially the compositions of <b>Ravel</b> and Debussy.|$|E

500|$|Marcel Marnat's {{catalogue}} of <b>Ravel's</b> complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned. Though that total is small {{in comparison with}} the output of his major contemporaries, it is nevertheless inflated by <b>Ravel's</b> frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra. The performable body of works numbers about sixty; slightly more than half are instrumental. <b>Ravel's</b> music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera, and song cycles. He wrote no symphonies or religious works (with the exception of [...] "Kaddish").|$|R
5|$|In October 1932, <b>Ravel</b> {{suffered}} {{a blow to}} the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia. Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. <b>Ravel</b> completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. <b>Ravel</b> composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Though no longer able to write music or perform, <b>Ravel</b> remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that <b>Ravel</b> preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.|$|E
5|$|Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was {{the music}} of Debussy. <b>Ravel,</b> twelve years his junior, had known Debussy {{slightly}} since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued {{for more than ten}} years. In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece. The Apaches were loud in their support. The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: <b>Ravel</b> attended all of them.|$|E

5|$|Daphnis et Chloé was {{commissioned}} in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes. <b>Ravel</b> began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine, and designer, Léon Bakst. Fokine {{had a reputation}} for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music. This appealed to <b>Ravel,</b> and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, <b>Ravel</b> began composing the music. There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work. It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London. The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere.|$|E
5|$|Monteux's final studio {{recordings}} {{were with}} the London Symphony Orchestra in works by <b>Ravel</b> {{at the end of}} February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers.|$|E
5|$|Peters' show record {{before the}} 1992 Summer Olympics {{made him a}} hopeful {{to compete for the}} US team. However, his {{citizenship}} papers were not processed in time to compete in the Olympic trials, and so he did not compete in Barcelona. Peters won his first Olympic medal when he rode with the US dressage team to a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, together with Robert Dover, Michelle Gibson and Guenter Seidel. Peters, riding Floriano, was an alternate for the US team at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and did not compete. In 2006, with an aging Floriano, Peters and the US team won bronze at the 2006 World Equestrian Games. Soon after, he began riding TC <b>Ravel,</b> who would become his most successful horse. Despite being gelded while in quarantine after his shipment from the Netherlands and suffering an injury in 2007 that prevented training, <b>Ravel</b> carried Peters to a qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In individual dressage competition at the Games, Peters placed fourth, riding <b>Ravel.</b> The US team finished fourth at the 2008 Games, but was disqualified after team member Courtney King's horse tested positive for felbinac, a banned substance. In 2009, Peters and <b>Ravel</b> had the highest scores in all three portions of the prestigious German Aachen World Equestrian Festival Grand Prix competition, leading them to be the first American pair to be named the Aachen Grand Prix Champions.|$|E

5|$|Among {{those taking}} a close {{interest}} in the controversy was Alfred Edwards, owner and editor of Le Matin, for which Lalo wrote. Edwards was married to Ravel's friend Misia; the couple took <b>Ravel</b> on a seven-week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905, {{the first time he}} had travelled abroad.|$|E
5|$|Born to a music-loving family, <b>Ravel</b> {{attended}} France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was {{not well}} regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the Conservatoire, <b>Ravel</b> found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known.|$|E
5|$|By {{the latter}} part of the 1900s <b>Ravel</b> had {{established}} a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra. He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed. There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; <b>Ravel</b> was known for his indifference to financial matters. The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestrated 1910), Une barque sur l'océan (1906, from the 1905 piano suite Miroirs), the Habanera section of Rapsodie espagnole (1907–08), Ma mère l'Oye (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911, orchestrated 1912), Alborada del gracioso (from Miroirs, orchestrated 1918) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years Edouard <b>Ravel</b> {{declared}} his intention to leave {{the bulk of the}} composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind. After his death in 1960 the estate passed through several hands. Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were. The British newspaper The Guardian reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the <b>Ravel</b> museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Poulenc {{remained}} concerned at {{his lack of}} formal musical training.

5|$|<b>Ravel</b> {{was among}} the first composers to {{recognise}} the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public. From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision.|$|E
