50|$|The radar {{transmitter}} waveform may be either unmodulated continuous wave, modulated or pulsed. An unmodulated continuous wave radar has no range resolution, but can resolve targets {{on the basis}} of different velocity, while a modulated or pulsed radar can resolve echoes from different ranges. The radar waveform plays a very important role in <b>radar</b> theory (<b>Plant</b> and Shuler, 1980).|$|R
5000|$|Underwater {{demolition}} teams (UDT) {{approached the}} beach in small craft to reconnoiter the landing beaches and to <b>plant</b> <b>radar</b> beacons which would provide reference points to the next day's landing. Tennessee closed to 3,000 yd of Agingan Point and opened up with 14 in, 5 inand [...] batteries. Some smoldering powder grains from the 5 in guns fell {{on the port side}} of the battleship's quarterdeck and burst into flame, but were quickly extinguished.|$|R
50|$|The Electromagnetic Research Laboratory (ERL) {{was located}} near the Missile and Surface <b>Radar</b> Division <b>plant</b> of RCA in Moorestown, New Jersey. The C-band, low-power, cross-section-measurement system in {{conjunction}} with two static range configurations was used for full-scale targets weighing up to 4,000 pounds rotated through 360 degrees. Since measurements must be made on targets {{as if they were}} located in free space, returns from other than the target were reduced to 10−5 m², the general background level of one tower-terrain combination. The low-power radar was capable of transmitting any linear, circular, or elliptical polarization at C-band frequencies. It could receive the horizontal and vertical components of backscattered energy simultaneously. Cross-section data was recorded in analog form on Sanborn and Scientific Atlanta strip-chart recorders and on Ampex magnetic tape. Digital cross sections were also recorded on a specially-designed CEC magnetic tape recorder.|$|R
50|$|Built in 1954 by French contractors, {{the base}} was opened on 15 April 1955. The base {{was one of}} four Strategic Air Command (SAC) bases (Sidi Slimane, Nouasseur and Ben Guerir being the other three), that were {{constructed}} in Morocco in response to the heightened Cold War fears by NATO after the Korean War. Its base host unit was the 3936th Air Base Squadron which reported to the SAC 5th Air Division. SAC assumed jurisdiction of the base on 1 June 1955. The base included housing, code rooms, <b>radar,</b> a cold-storage <b>plant,</b> a glass-walled servicemen's club and a movie theater, along with a 10,000-foot runway, all at a cost of $23 million.|$|R
2500|$|Levels are {{composed}} of several missions that can be completed in any order but it is often better to complete them sequentially, as completing an earlier mission will make later ones easier. This is because the objectives of later missions are usually protected by a [...] "Danger Zone" [...] which gives enemies in the area increased weapon range, firepower and damage as well as additional armor. A [...] "Danger Zone" [...] can be removed by {{the destruction of a}} <b>radar</b> or power <b>plant,</b> often the objective of an earlier mission. Later levels will often present only one mission that must be completed to reveal the next one. Missions can range from destruction of enemy targets, rescuing a MIA soldier who carries vital information, protecting friendly troops, capturing or eliminating an enemy leader, or delivery of friendlies or cargo to a drop zone. Between each level cut-scenes developing the story take place.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how multiple preventative maintenance (PM) {{activities can be}} modeled in the availability and reliability analyses of complex systems, using popular off the shelf software. This is a necessary and critical step for {{an understanding of the}} downtime implications of certain electromechanical subsystems and systems, but is not always easy to model with all software packages. Quite often, maintenance and service related actions are an afterthought in reliability and availability calculations. This is because most electronic systems require minimal maintenance of electronic circuit boards, components and sub systems. Dust filter replacement, inspection (and perhaps calibration) are the primary activities usually needed. As a result, many find it prudent to ignore these activities because they are second or third order effects. In most cases, they do not even require downing the system. However, electromechanical devices and assemblies are different. There are many situations where several maintenance activities on an ongoing, repeatable schedule are required in order to prevent premature faults and extend the useful life of the device. This is especially true of engines, motors, generators, cooling fans and any device that includes bearings or mechanical movement. In addition, downing of the system is usually necessary to perform the needed maintenance. This paper discusses an actual example of a <b>radar</b> power <b>plant</b> reliability block diagram (originally consisting of over 1000 blocks) with redundant gensets that shows how the maintenance dominates the down time and how failure rates play a lesser role in the availability of the power plant. ...|$|R
50|$|During Etzioni's {{time in the}} Palmach, {{underground}} Jewish groups, {{mainly the}} Irgun and Lehi militias, {{and to a lesser}} extent the Palmach, were carrying out a violent campaign against the British authorities to compel them to allow more Jewish immigration to Palestine and leave the country to enable a Jewish state to be established. Etzioni participated in a Palmach operation to blow up a British radar station near Haifa being used to track ships carrying illegal Jewish immigrants attempting to enter Palestine. Etzioni's team managed to breach the fence protecting the <b>radar</b> station and <b>plant</b> and detonate a bomb, and escaped after the British shot their team leader through the head. After the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the outbreak of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Etzioni's Palmach unit participated in the defense of Jerusalem, which was under siege by the Arab Legion. They sneaked through Arab lines and for the next few months, fought to defend Jerusalem and to open a corridor to Tel Aviv, participating in the Battles of Latrun and the establishment of the Burma Road.|$|R
40|$|The Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) {{mission will}} yield new and {{advanced}} scientific {{studies of the}} Earth. SIR-C {{will be the first}} instrument to simultaneously acquire images at L-band and C-band with HH, VV, HV, or VH polarizations, as well as images of the phase difference between HH and VV polarizations. These data will be digitally encoded and recorded using onboard high-density digital tape recorders and will later be digitally processed into images using the JPL Advanced Digital SAR Processor. SIR-C geologic studies include cold-region geomorphology, fluvial geomorphology, rock weathering and erosional processes, tectonics and geologic boundaries, geobotany, and radar stereogrammetry. Hydrology investigations cover arid, humid, wetland, snow-covered, and high-latitude regions. Additionally, SIR-C will provide the data to identify and map vegetation types, interpret landscape patterns and processes, assess the biophysical properties of plant canopies, and determine the degree of <b>radar</b> penetration of <b>plant</b> canopies. In oceanography, SIR-C will provide the information necessary to: forecast ocean directional wave spectra; better understand internal wave-current interactions; study the relationship of ocean-bottom features to surface expressions and the correlation of wind signatures to radar backscatter; and detect current-system boundaries, oceanic fronts, and mesoscale eddies. And, as the first spaceborne SAR with multi-frequency, multipolarization imaging capabilities, whole new areas of glaciology will be opened for study when SIR-C is flown in a polar orbit...|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{establish}} a relationship between volume and biomass with interferometric and radiometric SAR (Synthetic Aperture <b>Radar)</b> response from <b>planted</b> Eucalyptus saligna forest stands, using multi-variable regression techniques. X and P band SAR images from the airborne OrbiSAR- 1 sensor, were acquired at the study area in the southeast region of Brazil. The interferometric height (Hint = difference between interferometric digital elevation model in X and P bands), contributed to the models developed due to fact that Eucalyptus forest is composed of individuals whose structure is predominantly cylindrical and vertically oriented, and whose tree heights have great correlation with volume and biomass. The volume model showed that the stand volume was highly correlated with the interferometric height logarithm (Log 10 Hint), since Eucalyptus tree volume has a linear relationship with the vegetation height. The biomass model showed {{that the combination of}} both Hint 2 and Canopy Scattering IndexCSI (relation of s°VV by the sum of s°VV and s°HH, which represents to the canopy interaction) were used in this model, {{due to the fact that}} the Eucalyptus biomass and the trees height relationship is not linear. Both models showed a prediction error of around 10 % to estimate the Eucalyptus biomass and volume, which represents a great potential to use this kind of technology to help establish Eucalyptus forest inventory for large areas.
