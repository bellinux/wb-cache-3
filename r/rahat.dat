30|$|Returning to the {{questions}} posed above, Jewish planners from outside of the community (i.e., non-Bedouin) were tasked {{with the challenge of}} bringing a series of ad hoc-produced neighborhood-specific detailed building plans together under unified urban outline schemes (Rafaeli 2010).

40|$|New-Flemish Alliance (N-VA) burst on {{the scene}} barely a decade ago and is now Belgium’s largest {{political}} party. One explanation for this success is that N-VA is not brand new but rose {{from the ashes of}} a dissolved party. How exactly should we differentiate between new and old parties? We use Barnea and <b>Rahat’s</b> (2011) analytical framework to assess dimensions of N-VA’s newness and capture the party at two stages – start-up and more developed. This shows that N-VA is a successor party, building on its predecessor’s ideology and programme, its electorate, activists and organization. However, we also find indicators that the party actively renewed in terms of ideology and party organization. The empirical evidence illustrates that newness of political parties should be conceived of as multidimensional, which allows for a more subtle approach to questions about the origin and varying success of new political parties. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
