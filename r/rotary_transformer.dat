50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>{{transformers}}</b> {{cannot be}} used in most DC motors instead of commutators, as transformers can only transfer AC current.|$|R
50|$|In {{brushless}} synchros, typical <b>rotary</b> <b>transformers</b> (in pairs) provide {{longer life}} than slip rings. These <b>rotary</b> <b>transformers</b> have a cylindrical, {{rather than a}} disc-shaped, air gap between windings. The rotor winding is a spool-shaped ferromagnetic core, with the winding placed like thread on a spool. The flanges are the pole pieces. The stator winding is a ferromagnetic cylinder with the winding inside, and end poles that are discs with holes, like washers.|$|R
40|$|Ducommunâ€™s {{variable}} reluctance resolvers (VRRs) {{are highly}} reliable brushless resolvers without <b>rotary</b> <b>transformers.</b> Unlike conventional resolvers, VRRs have both {{primary and secondary}} windings in the stator assembly and no windings in the rotor. This offers significant advantages in price, weight and envelope dimensions. The VRRs are mechanically and electrically compatible with traditional brushless resolvers. They provide accurate absolute positioning or velocity feedback and can be offered as single-speed and multi-speed designs. Since VRRs do not require <b>rotary</b> <b>transformers,</b> they are more compact and reliable than conventional brushless resolves. Ducommun offers different stator and rotor core designs depending on the required accuracies and mounting dimensions. Custom designs are available upon request. VRR 41 PS...|$|R
50|$|Slip rings can be {{used for}} the same purpose, but are subject to friction, wear, {{intermittent}} contact, and limitations on the rotational speed that can be accommodated without damage. Wear can be eliminated by using a pool of liquid mercury instead of a solid ring contact, but the toxicity and slow corrosion of mercury are problematic, and very high rotational speeds are again difficult to achieve. A <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer</b> has none of these limitations.|$|E
50|$|Rotary {{transformers}} {{are most}} commonly used in videocassette recorders. Signals must be coupled from the electronics of the VCR to the fast-moving tape heads carried on the rotating head drum; a <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer</b> is ideal for this purpose. Most VCR designs require more than one signal to be coupled to the head drum. In this case, the cup core {{has more than one}} concentric winding, isolated by individual raised portions of the core. The transformer for the head drum shown to the right couples six individual channels.|$|E
5000|$|A metadyne is {{a direct}} current {{electrical}} machine with two pairs of brushes. It {{can be used as}} an amplifier or <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer.</b> It is similar to a third brush dynamo but has additional regulator or [...] "variator" [...] windings. It is also similar to an amplidyne except that the latter has a compensating winding which fully counteracts the effect of the flux produced by the load current. The technical description is [...] "a cross-field direct current machine designed to utilize armature reaction". A metadyne can convert a constant-voltage input into a constant-current, variable-voltage output.|$|E

Additional winding built into full winding as integral part or added externally. Technique provides quick way of tuning reactance out of power-transformer circuit to maximize power transfer or to adjust frequency of oscillator. Applications include <b>rotary</b> <b>transformers,</b> servo amplifiers, and analog computer modules...|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>transformers</b> are {{constructed}} by winding {{the primary and}} secondary windings into separate halves of a cup core; these concentric halves face each other, with each half mounted {{to one of the}} rotating parts. Magnetic flux provides the coupling from one half of the cup core to the other across an air gap, providing the mutual inductance that couples energy from the transformer's primary to its secondary.|$|R
50|$|Some {{other names}} used for slip ring are {{collector}} ring, rotary electrical contact and electrical slip ring. Some people {{also use the}} term commutator; however, commutators are somewhat different and are specialized for use on DC motors and generators. While commutators are segmented, slip rings are continuous, and the terms are not interchangeable. <b>Rotary</b> <b>transformers</b> are often used instead of slip rings in high-speed or low-friction environments.|$|R
50|$|There were {{a number}} of {{problems}} to be overcome with this system. The high tape/head speed could lead to rapid wear of both the tape and the head, so both need to be highly polished, and the head made of a hard, wear-resistant material. Most systems operate with an air bearing separating the heads {{from the surface of the}} drum. Supplying signals to a rotating head is also problematic: This is usually accomplished by coupling the signal(s) inductively through a <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer.</b> The transport mechanism is also much more complex than a fixed head system, since during loading, the tape must be pulled around a rotating drum containing the head(s). In a VCR for example, the tape must be pulled out of the cassette case and threaded around the drum, and between the capstan and pinch roller. This leads to complex and potentially unreliable mechanics.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} type of {{resolver}} is the brushless transmitter resolver (other types are described at the end). On the outside, this type of resolver may look like a small electrical motor having a stator and rotor. On the inside, the configuration of the wire windings makes it different. The stator portion of the resolver houses three windings: an exciter winding and two two-phase windings (usually labeled [...] "x" [...] and [...] "y") (case of a brushless resolver). The exciter winding is located on the top; it is in fact a coil of a turning (<b>rotary)</b> <b>transformer.</b> This transformer induces current in the rotor without a direct electrical connection, thus there are no wires to the rotor limiting its rotation and no need for brushes. The two other windings are on the bottom, wound on a lamination. They are configured at 90 degrees from each other. The rotor houses a coil, which is the secondary winding of the turning transformer, and a separate primary winding in a lamination, exciting the two two-phase windings on the stator.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design a {{kilowatt}} three-phase step-down <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer</b> for a permanent magnet DC motor. The permanent magnet DC motor has an on-rotor drive system, and therefore requiring a power supply that can transfer power to its drive unit without mechanical contact. The <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer</b> has a detached magnetic coupling structure that qualifies it as a potential method for the wireless power transfer. This thesis studies the <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer</b> as a static device, focusing on its core loss. By using a transient finite element analysis of COMSOL Multiphysics and an iron loss prediction model, the <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer</b> was optimized in terms of efficiency and power density for the on-rotor drive system through proper material selection and geometry exploration. After this, a mechanical design, which based on a literature review of the influences of manufacturing processes on electrical steels, was proposed for realizing the core fabrication and the <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer</b> assembly. The {{results show that the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer</b> can step down 400 V/ 50 Hz three-phase voltage to 13. 15 V in a Delta-wye connection and output 1. 17 kW power over an air-gap of 0. 3 mm with 95. 94 % overall efficiency. The proposed mechanical design enables the transformer to minimize the core loss and the manufacturing cost. Without using resonant inductive coupling, this transformer design simplifies the power supply for the motor, thereby decreasing the motor manufacturing and maintenance cost...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>transformers</b> are {{designed}} to transmit electric signals from a rotating body to a fixed body or from a fixed body to a rotating body. In this regard, {{it is not possible}} to use lead wires to carry electrical signals between a rotating and a fixed body. A spring - brush arrangement as used in motors is not also suitable for this task, since it generates high electric noise...|$|R

50|$|Alternatively, the {{three-phase}} {{alternating current}} {{of the power}} grid can be converted in substations by <b>rotary</b> <b>transformers</b> or static inverters into the voltage and type of current required by the trains. For railways which run on direct current (DC), this method is always used, {{as well as for}} railways which run on single-phase AC of decreased frequency, as in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony-Anhalt, Norway and Sweden. In these areas there are no traction current networks.|$|R

40|$|Many future {{satellites}} and spacecraft with spun and despun configurations {{will require the}} transfer of power across rotating interfaces in lieu of slip-rings and/or flexures. This is particularly true of spacecraft that have to demonstrate a long life expectancy. The <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer</b> has the desirable characteristics of high reliability and low noise, which qualify it as a potential replacement for slip rings. Development of a rotary power transformer follows the successful completion of a task to develop rotary signal-level transformers for the Galileo Spacecraft Project. The physical configuration of a rotary power transformer has {{a significant effect on}} its magnetic and electrical characteristics and therefore impacts the design of the dc/ac inverter driver. Important characteristics addressed during this development effort include: operating frequency, efficiency, transformer gap size, leakage inductance, and leakage flux.

40|$|Contactless power {{transfer}} devices for transferring electrical power across a rotating spacecraft interface were studied.

Rotary transformers and rotary capacitors together with the required dc to ac power conditioning electronics were examined. Microwave devices were addressed. The <b>rotary</b> <b>transformer</b> with resonant circuit power conditioning was selected as the most feasible approach.
