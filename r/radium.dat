5|$|In 1920, for the 25th {{anniversary of}} the {{discovery}} of <b>radium,</b> the French government established a stipend for her; its previous recipient was Louis Pasteur (1822–95). In 1921, she was welcomed triumphantly when she toured the United States to raise funds for research on <b>radium.</b> Mrs. William Brown Meloney, after interviewing Marie, created a Marie Curie <b>Radium</b> Fund and raised money to buy <b>radium,</b> publicising her trip.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove their}} discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate {{polonium}} and <b>radium</b> in pure form. Pitchblende {{is a complex}} mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore. <b>Radium,</b> however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of <b>radium,</b> but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach. The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out <b>radium</b> salt by differential crystallization. From a ton of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of <b>radium</b> chloride was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure <b>radium</b> metal. She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.|$|E
5|$|The Eldorado Mine at Port <b>Radium</b> was {{a source}} of uranium ore.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and isolation of <b>radium</b> in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked {{the development of}} uranium mining to extract the <b>radium,</b> which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of <b>radium.</b> This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted {{for the bulk of}} the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} yield {{is about}} 2% of the <b>radium</b> weight. 227Ac can further capture neutrons resulting {{in small amounts}} of 228Ac. After the synthesis, actinium is separated from <b>radium</b> and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH (to about 6.0 for actinium). An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in nitric acid, which {{can result in a}} separation factor of 1,000,000 for <b>radium</b> and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from <b>radium,</b> with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as eluant.|$|E
5|$|Unbinilium {{should be}} a solid at room temperature, with melting point 680°C: this {{continues}} the downward trend down the group, being lower than the value 700°C for <b>radium.</b> The boiling point of ununennium {{is expected to be}} around 1700°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group (in particular, <b>radium</b> boils at 1737°C), following the downward periodic trend. The density of ununennium has been predicted to be 7g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density down the group: the value for <b>radium</b> is 5.5g·cm−3.|$|E
5|$|Curie's {{quest to}} create a new {{laboratory}} did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the <b>Radium</b> Institute (Institut du <b>radium,</b> now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris. The initiative for creating the <b>Radium</b> Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute. Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.|$|E
5|$|Her name is {{included}} on the Monument to the X-ray and <b>Radium</b> Martyrs of All Nations, erected in Hamburg, Germany in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Zappa {{was often}} sick as a child, {{suffering}} from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of <b>radium</b> {{into each of}} Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation, and although it has since been claimed that nasal <b>radium</b> treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this.|$|E
5|$|A {{sample of}} {{beryllium}} was bombarded with alpha rays from {{the decay of}} <b>radium</b> in a 1932 experiment by James Chadwick that uncovered {{the existence of the}} neutron. This same method is used in one class of radioisotope-based laboratory neutron sources that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.|$|E
5|$|After the 1938 Anschluss, Rona and Marietta Blau {{left the}} <b>Radium</b> Institute {{because of their}} Jewish {{heritage}} and the antisemitic persecution they experienced in the laboratory. Rona first returned to Budapest and worked in an industrial laboratory, but within a few months, the position was eliminated. She worked from October to December 1938 in Sweden, and then accepted a temporary position for one year at the University of Oslo, which had been offered by Gleditsch. Reluctant to leave her home, {{at the end of}} her year in Oslo, Rona returned to Hungary. She was appointed to a position at the Radium-Cancer Hospital in Budapest, preparing <b>radium</b> for medicinal purposes.|$|E
5|$|Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a {{total of}} 32 {{scientific}} papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to <b>radium,</b> diseased, tumor-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.|$|E
5|$|Blandy ordered Warren {{to explain}} his {{position}} to 1,400 skeptical officers and sailors. Some found him persuasive, but it was August 9 before he convinced Blandy. That was the date when Blandy realized, for the first time, that Geiger counters could not detect plutonium. Blandy {{was aware of the}} health problems of <b>radium</b> dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of <b>radium</b> in the 1920s, and the fact that plutonium was assumed to have a similar biological effect. When plutonium was discovered in the captain's quarters of Prinz Eugen, unaccompanied by fission products, Blandy realized that plutonium could be anywhere.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the small}} size of {{brachytherapy}} sources and low control in early decades, there is a risk that some of these have escaped into the environment to become orphaned sources. A <b>radium</b> needle was found in a Prague playground in 2011, radiating 500 µSv/h from one metre away.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, Marie Curie {{became a}} member of the newly created International Commission for Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. In 1923, she wrote a {{biography}} of Pierre, entitled Pierre Curie. In 1925, she visited Poland, to participate in the ceremony that laid foundations for the <b>Radium</b> Institute in Warsaw. Her second American tour, in 1929, succeeded in equipping the Warsaw <b>Radium</b> Institute with radium; it was opened in 1932 and her sister Bronisława became its director. These distractions from her scientific labours and the attendant publicity caused her much discomfort but provided resources needed for her work. In 1930, she was elected a member of the International Atomic Weights Committee where she served until her death.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive {{substances}} can harm {{human health}} via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation. Together with <b>radium</b> and transuranium elements, actinium {{is one of}} the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity. The most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than <b>radium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{isotopes}} of bismuth {{with short}} half-lives occur within the radioactive disintegration chains of actinium, <b>radium,</b> and thorium, and more have been synthesized experimentally. Bismuth-213 {{is also found}} on the decay chain of uranium-233.|$|E
5|$|The americium-241 and curium-242 {{isotopes}} {{also were}} produced by irradiating plutonium {{in a nuclear}} reactor. The latter element was named after Marie Curie and her husband Pierre who are noted for discovering <b>radium</b> and for their work in radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of unbinilium {{is predicted to}} be {{similar to that of the}} alkaline earth metals, but it would probably behave more like calcium or strontium than barium or <b>radium.</b> Like strontium, unbinilium should react vigorously with air to form an oxide (UbnO) and with water to form the hydroxide (Ubn(OH)2), which would be a strong base, and releasing hydrogen gas. It should also react with the halogens to form salts such as UbnCl2. While these reactions would be expected from periodic trends, their lowered intensity is somewhat unusual, as ignoring relativistic effects, periodic trends would predict unbinilium to be even more reactive than barium or <b>radium.</b> This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilization of unbinilium's valence electron, increasing unbinilium's first ionization energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for <b>radium.</b> the {{chemistry of}} unbinilium in the +2 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of strontium than to that of <b>radium.</b> On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is predicted to be larger than that of Sr2+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilized and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Unbinilium may also show the +4 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other alkaline earth metal, in addition to the +2 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkaline earth metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkaline earth metals: this is because of the destabilization and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionization energy than what would otherwise be expected. The +1 state may also be stable in isolation. Many unbinilium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding: this effect is also seen to a lesser extent in <b>radium,</b> which shows some 6s and 6p3/2 contribution to the bonding in <b>radium</b> fluoride (RaF2) and astatide (RaAt2), resulting in these compounds having more covalent character. The standard reduction potential of the Ubn2+/Ubn couple is predicted to be −2.9V.|$|E
5|$|The {{dangers of}} {{radiation}} poisoning had become well-known {{due to the}} experience of the <b>radium</b> dial painters. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects. Robert S. Stone, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project's health and safety program. Simeon Cutler, a radiologist, assumed responsibility for radiation safety in Chicago, before moving on to head the program at the Hanford Site. Groves appointed Stafford L. Warren from the University of Rochester as head of the Manhattan Project's Medical Section. Over time, the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like <b>radium,</b> was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous.|$|E
5|$|The major {{difficulty}} in separation of actinium is {{the similarity of}} its properties with those of lanthanum. Thus actinium is either synthesized in nuclear reactions from isotopes of <b>radium</b> or separated using ion-exchange procedures.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, the {{radioactive}} isotope bismuth-213 {{can be produced}} by bombarding <b>radium</b> with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in the targeted alpha therapy (TAT) program.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electrons, unbinilium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 6.0eV, {{comparable to that}} of calcium. The electron of the hydrogen-like unbinilium atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ubn119+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 2.05 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like <b>radium</b> is 1.30 and the figure for hydrogen-like barium is 1.095. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 200pm, very close to that of strontium (215pm); the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is also correspondingly lowered to 160pm. The trend in electron affinity is also expected to reverse direction similarly at <b>radium</b> and unbinilium.|$|E
5|$|Francium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolFr and atomic number87. It {{used to be}} known as eka-caesium and actinium K. It is the second-least electronegative element, behind only caesium, and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine). Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, <b>radium,</b> and radon. As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron.|$|E
5|$|In June 1903, {{supervised}} by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris. That month {{the couple were}} invited to the Royal Institution in London {{to give a speech}} on radioactivity; being a woman, she was prevented from speaking, and Pierre alone was allowed to. Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on <b>radium.</b> The Curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business.|$|E
5|$|Led by Curie, the Institute {{produced}} {{four more}} Nobel Prize winners, including her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie and her son-in-law, Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Eventually, it {{became one of}} four major radioactivity research laboratories, the others being the Cavendish Laboratory, with Ernest Rutherford; the Institute for <b>Radium</b> Research, Vienna, with Stefan Meyer; and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} centenary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize in 2011, an allegorical mural was {{painted on the}} façade of her Warsaw birthplace. It depicts an infant Maria Skłodowska holding a test tube from which emanate the {{elements}} that she would discover as an adult: polonium and <b>radium.</b> Also in 2011, a new Warsaw bridge over the Vistula was named in her honor.|$|E
5|$|The decay {{products}} of 232Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as <b>radium</b> and radon. Although relatively little of those products is created {{as the result}} of the slow decay of thorium, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous gamma emitters, and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of 232Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain. As the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide, they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. In the first hour of use large fractions of the thorium daughters 224Ra, 228Ra, 212Pb, and 212Bi are released. Most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the <b>radium,</b> resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2millisieverts per use, about a third of the dose sustained during a mammogram.|$|E
5|$|This element was {{the first}} one {{discovered}} by the Curies while they were investigating the cause of pitchblende radioactivity. Pitchblende, after removal of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium, was more radioactive than the uranium and thorium combined. This spurred the Curies to search for additional radioactive elements. They first separated out polonium from pitchblende in July 1898, and five months later, also isolated <b>radium.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1926, Meyer {{had written to}} Irène Joliot-Curie {{suggesting}} that Rona work with her to learn how his laboratory could make their own polonium samples. Once Hans Pettersson was able to secure funds to pay Rona's expenses, Joliot-Curie allowed her to come and study polonium separation at the Curie Institute in Paris. Rona developed an enhanced method of preparing polonium sources and producing alpha-emissions.(α-emission). Gaining recognition as {{an expert in the}} field, she took those skills back to the <b>Radium</b> Institute along with a small disc of polonium. This disc allowed Rona to create lab specimens of polonium, which were used in much of the Institute's subsequent research.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the work}} on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like <b>radium,</b> was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the first of the national laboratories, the Argonne National Laboratory, on 1 July 1946.|$|E
5|$|Francium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{unstable}} of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of only 22minutes. The only comparable element is astatine, whose most stable natural isotope, astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56seconds, although synthetic astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1hours. All isotopes of francium decay into astatine, <b>radium,</b> or radon. Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived isotope of each synthetic element up to and including element 105, dubnium.|$|E
5|$|Her {{achievements}} {{included the}} development of the theory of radioactivity (a term that she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and <b>radium.</b> Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms, using radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today. During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the Warsaw Scientific Society {{offered her}} the {{directorship}} {{of a new}} laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing <b>Radium</b> Institute {{to be completed in}} August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie. She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities. The Institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding {{received}} {{her at the}} White House to present her with the 1 gram of <b>radium</b> collected in the United States. Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed {{by the fact that}} she had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered her a Legion of Honour award, but she refused. In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine. She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of human subjects, this {{involved}} injecting solutions containing (typically) five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill, or {{to have a life}} expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition. This was reduced to one microgram in July 1945 after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was more dangerous than <b>radium.</b> Most of the subjects, Eileen Welsome says, were poor, powerless, and sick.|$|E
