5|$|Around 1898 Holden began {{living with}} Margaret Steadman (née Macdonald, 1865–1954), {{a nurse and}} midwife. They were {{introduced}} by Holden's older sister, Alice, and became friends through their common interest in Whitman. Steadman had separated from her husband James Steadman, a university tutor, because of his alcoholism and abuse. Steadman {{and her husband were}} never divorced and, though she and Holden lived as a married couple and Holden <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as his wife, the relationship was never formalised, even after James Steadman's death in 1930.|$|E
5|$|Edward Drinker Cope {{was born}} on July 28, 1840, the eldest son of Alfred and Hanna Cope. The death of his mother when he {{was three years old}} seemed to have had little effect on young Edward, as he {{mentioned}} in his letters that he had no recollection of her. His stepmother, Rebecca Biddle, filled the maternal role; Cope <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James Biddle Cope. Alfred, an orthodox member of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope, in 1821. He was a philanthropist who gave money to the Society of Friends, the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, and the Institute for Colored Youth.|$|E
5|$|A casting {{call was}} {{announced}} by Suresh Productions for {{the roles of}} Venkatesh's daughters in the film. They {{were looking for a}} girl aged 14–17 years {{to play the role of}} the elder daughter named Anjali, and another aged 8–12 years to play her younger sibling, Anu. Esther Anil was confirmed to reprise her role as the younger sister. Kruthika Jayakumar, a 17-year-old science student from Bangalore, was selected to play the role of elder sister in the film. This happened when a Malayalam filmmaker visited her dance performance in Thiruvananthapuram, and was struck by her expressions and photogenic features. He suggested that she pursue a career in the film industry. She <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> character as a simple and vulnerable girl, who gets exploited. Her family is her world and she is particularly attached to her father. Kalabhavan Shajon was initially reported to reprise his role of a corrupt police officer from the original, but Ravi Kale was chosen instead.|$|E
50|$|Galadriel was {{originally}} named Artanis , and Nerwen , <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> height and strength; Galadriel is the Sindarinized version of Telerin Quenya Alatáriel , a name given <b>her</b> by Celeborn, <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> silver-golden hair.|$|R
50|$|Only two ancient sources make {{reference}} to her: the historian Tacitus and Strabo the Geographer. Tacitus <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as Cotys’ widow and Strabo <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as the unnamed daughter of Polemon Pythodoros and the wife of Cotys. The Greek geographer Strabo was a friend <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother.|$|R

5|$|No {{official}} canonization {{procedures have}} begun for Richard, though the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette began collecting testimonials about reputed help obtained through her in 1991. Unlike the traditional support for canonization of a saint, which begins with popular devotion {{and is only}} later recognized by the Church, support for Richard began outside her immediate home area and was first promoted by the clergy, beginning with Brennan, Crowley, and Calais. The bishop of the Lafayette diocese {{at the time of}} her death, Maurice Schexnayder, visited her grave multiple times and <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as a saint. Another bishop of the diocese, Harry Flynn, presided at the thirtieth anniversary mass in 1989, along with sixteen other priests. The diocese also approved the creation of a private organization, the Friends of Charlene, to spread her story.|$|E

25|$|The {{spread of}} devotion {{to her in}} France {{as well as in}} Italy was helped when Saint John Vianney built a shrine in her honour and <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> often, {{attributing}} to her the miracles that others attributed to himself.|$|E
25|$|To {{help her}} spread {{nutrition}} {{information to the}} public she took a writing course and began writing pamphlets and books.

2500|$|The exact {{birth name}} of Wu Zetian {{is no longer}} retrievable. She changed <b>her</b> name <b>to</b> Wu Zhao after rising to power, often written as 武曌, (曌 has also been written as 瞾 on occasion, and both are {{derivatives}} of 照, which possibly is her original name), with 瞾 {{being one of the}} invented characters by Wu. Wu was her patronymic surname, which she retained, according to traditional Chinese practice, after marriage to Gaozong, of the Li family. Emperor Taizong gave her the art name Wu Mei (武媚), meaning [...] "glamorous". (Thus, today Chinese people often <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as Wu Mei or Wu Meiniang (武媚娘) when they write about her youth, whereas they <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as Wu Hou (武后) when <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as empress consort and empress dowager, and Wu Zetian (武則天) when <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> reign as empress regnant.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Hagen's {{nickname}} is [...] "Apple", <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{hometown of}} Appleton, Wisconsin.|$|R
5000|$|Another theory {{sees the}} rhyme as {{connected}} to Mary, Queen of Scots (1542-1587), with [...] "how does your garden grow" [...] <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> reign over her realm, [...] "silver bells" [...] <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> (Catholic) cathedral bells, [...] "cockle shells" [...] insinuating {{that her husband}} was not faithful <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and [...] "pretty maids all in a row" [...] <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ladies-in-waiting - [...] "The four Maries". [...] In Disney's The Truth About Mother Goose the [...] "silver bells" [...] are said to [...] "refer to the elaborate decoration on her dresses", the [...] "cockle shells" [...] <b>to</b> <b>her</b> love of exotic food such as cockles, with the [...] "pretty maids all in a row" [...] <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ladies-in-waiting.|$|R
25|$|A survey {{cited by}} The Washington Post in 2012 stated that 61 percent of small {{business}} owners planned to vote for then-Republican Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney. Small business became a major theme of the 2012 Republican National Convention. For example, South Dakota Senator John Thune discussed his grandfather's hardware store and New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband's landscaping company.|$|E
25|$|Eventually steamships {{began to}} {{dominate}} the wool trade too and it ceased to be profitable for a sailing ship. In 1895 Jock Willis sold Cutty Sark to the Portuguese firm Joaquim Antunes Ferreira for £1,250. She was renamed Ferreira after the firm. Her crews <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as Pequena Camisola (little shirt, a straight translation of the Scots cutty sark).|$|E
25|$|Mr. Charles Neakes, {{draftsman}} and {{purveyor of}} the Thames shipbuilders Messrs Wigram and Green, {{testified to the}} House Select Committee on Petitions Relating to East-India-Built Shipping that repairs to her prior to her first and second voyages amounted to £1578 8s 11d and £1411 18s 7d; although he <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as a new ship, he did not specify {{the years of the}} work on so which voyages it actually pertained to.|$|E

25|$|Because {{her birth}} {{certificate}} was never found, her legal given name is unknown. The name Salavarrieta is known {{only by the}} names {{her family and friends}} used. Her father <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as Apolonia in his will, which Salvador Contreras, the priest who formalized the testament on 13 December 1802, confirmed. She was closest to her brother, Viviano, as she became his de facto guardian when her parents died. When the armed forces in Guaduas started looking for her, she began calling herself Policarpa.|$|E
25|$|Eclair was {{probably}} paid-off and laid up before 1801. On 17 January 1801 the British captured the French schooner Eclair at Trois-Rivières, in the French Antilles. The Royal Navy commissioned this Eclair as HMS Eclair, and throughout her subsequent career <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as His Majesty's schooner Eclair. Although {{there were a}} few cases where two vessels in the same theatre might share a name, generally as soon as the Admiralty became aware of the name conflict it would rename one of the vessels to remove ambiguity. That there were two Eclair schooners on active duty in the West Indies at the same time is highly improbable.|$|E
25|$|Chrissie Wellington {{has said}} she has two passions in life: sport and development. In her victory speech at the 2007 Hawaii Ironman, she <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{experience}} teaching at Beaver Country Day School near Boston, where she first noticed the difference that sport can make to children's lives. She also noted, from her experience in Nepal, how sport can bring conflict-affected communities together. In an interview, her coach Brett Sutton said: She has kicked around for years through South East Asia, working for underprivileged people. That's why she was in Nepal. Already this year she has done clinics in Thailand and the Philippines and now sponsors a young Filipino athlete to attend our group for the coach to work some magic. I think her win could be the catalyst for the sport in South East Asia.|$|E

25|$|Dr Maressa Orzack {{studied at}} Columbia University, {{where she worked}} as an {{experimental}} psychologist. From there, in the late 1950s she worked with Agnes N. O'Connel on setting up a research arm at the Wisconsin Central Colony and Training School, under a job share arrangement. It is understood that her later work involved experience with impulse control disorders such as eating disorders and gambling addiction. Her research into computer addiction started at around 1994 while she was treating patients for gambling addiction and substance abuse at McLean Hospital. From discussions with her colleagues and patients <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> in 1996. Orzack went on to found and coordinate computer addiction services and a study centre at the hospital. When the clinic first opened Orzack would see at most two patients a week, but later expanded to dozens a week. After that time, Orzack expanded her research from online sex to computer gambling addiction, through to computer game addiction.|$|E
25|$|Bachué: {{the mother}} of the Muisca people. It was said that a {{beautiful}} woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque. Bachué sat down at the bank of the lake and waited for her son to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachué taught them to hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachué was so good and loved that the Muisca <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as Furachoque (Good woman in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachué and her son and husband {{decided to go back to}} the deep of the lagoon. That day the Muisca were so sad, but at the same time very happy because they knew their mother was very happy. Other versions of the legend say that after stepping into the lagoon of Iguaque, Bachué ascended to the sky and became Chía; in other versions Chia and Bachué are two different figures.|$|E
25|$|She <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> early girlhood as {{the most}} eventful part of her life. There was the long journey to Vermont the summer she was 18 months old, and her young mother’s death only four days after {{reaching}} the state which it had been hoped would give her health. There was the sojourn in New York, where William had established himself in business, and where he wanted his little daughter’s company. Clear and vivid was her memory of that trip down the Hudson River taken with her father when she was three years old, and of their arrival at the small boarding school on then fashionable Bleeker Street. At six, {{she was back in}} Middlebury, browsing in her father’s large and well chosen library —she could not remember the time when she {{did not know how to}} read— a library established in a newly-built house four miles up the Otter from Middlebury village in a quarter of the town called Farmingdale, a house presided over by a new step-mother. Here, also she recited daily lessons to her father and did her daily “stent” of sewing or knitting. Dorr grew to womanhood in a home of culture and refinement, and it is here where she began writing as a little child. It is here also that the father engaged in business again, and devoted himself chiefly to the development of the Rutland marble quarries. The home also included her half-brothers, Edward H. Ripley and Major General William Y. W. Ripley, both of whom became prominent officers in the American Civil War.|$|E
