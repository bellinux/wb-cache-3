5|$|NGC 4027 {{is another}} member of the NGC 4038 group, notable for its {{extended}} spiral arm. Known as the <b>Ringtail</b> Galaxy, it lies close to 31 Crateris. A barred spiral galaxy, its distorted shape is probably due to a past collision, possibly with the nearby NGC 4027A. NGC 4782 and NGC 4783 are a pair of merging elliptical galaxies in the northeastern part of the constellation, around 200 million light-years distant.|$|E

Staphylococcus spp. are a mostly benign group of bacteria that commonly reside {{on the top of}} the skin, but cuts and scratches from social and hierarchical fighting can open up the pathways for them to cause ulcerative dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|While some of {{the native}} flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert can be found within Phoenix city limits, most {{are found in the}} suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas {{surrounding}} the city. Native mammal species include coyote, javelina, bobcat, mountain lion, desert cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, antelope ground squirrel, mule deer, <b>ringtail,</b> coati, and multiple species of bats, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and western pipistrelle, that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including Costa's hummingbird, Anna's hummingbird, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, mourning dove, white-winged dove, the roadrunner, the cactus wren, and many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such as the turkey vulture and black vulture), and eagles, including the golden and the bald eagle.|$|E

5|$|The concept plan {{identified}} 145 {{species of}} birds as either known or expected {{to be found in}} the park. By 2006, 98 species had been recorded in the park's area, though not all specifically within the park's boundaries. Of the park's insects, seven species were found to be largely confined by its boundaries, with little presence in the rest of Adelaide. Their presence was unusual, as they were regarded as arid zone species. Approximately 35 reptile and amphibian species have been recorded within Anstey Hill park. Fauna in the park includes western grey kangaroo, common <b>ringtail</b> possum, common brushtail possum, short-beaked echidna, Gould's wattled bat, chocolate wattled bat, little forest bat, white-striped free-tailed bat and the lesser long-eared bat. Koalas are present, though they are not native to the area, having been deliberately introduced to the Adelaide hills.|$|E
25|$|The rock-haunting <b>ringtail</b> possum (Petropseudes dahli), {{also known}} as the rock <b>ringtail</b> possum, is a species of Australian possum. It is found in rocky escarpments in the Kimberley, Arnhem Land and Gulf of Carpentaria across Western Australia and Northern Territory and just passing the Queensland border. It is also found on Groote Eylandt. It the only species in the genus Petropseudes, but is part of the group {{including}} the common <b>ringtail</b> possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus).|$|E
25|$|The rock-haunting <b>ringtail</b> possum {{has one of}} the {{shortest}} tails of all <b>ringtail</b> possums, and at its end it is hairless and scaly. It lives in small groups and is mainly herbivorous. It has a stocky build and is mostly grey in colour.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ringtails</b> mate in the spring. The {{gestation}} period is 45-50 days, {{during which the}} male will procure food for the female. There will be 2-4 cubs in a litter. The cubs open their eyes after a month, and will hunt for themselves after four months. They reach sexual maturity at ten months. The <b>ringtail's</b> lifespan in the wild is about seven years.|$|R

25|$|The rock-haunting <b>ringtail</b> possum disperses seeds {{through its}} fruit eating habits. It also {{influences}} termite populations and acts as prey for regional predators. The rock-haunting <b>ringtail</b> possum has {{been affected by}} human induced habitat fragmentation and hence, its numbers have decreased significantly. The species is listed as a priority species in Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|The rock-haunting <b>ringtail</b> possum mostly uses scent to communicate. Adult possums have a {{distinct}} gland {{on the chest}} and males have a paracloacal gland which is about 2cm in diameter. The possum maintains scent posts that are visited commonly. The rock-haunting <b>ringtail</b> possum uses both urine and faeces to mark these areas. This poossum is also thought to mark tree branches using its paracloacal gland. The rock-haunting <b>ringtail</b> possum has been observed striking its tail against rocks, possibly {{as a form of}} communication. The species also is able to make quiet screeches and grunts that serve as auditory communication.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{studies have}} shown that kinkajous are a sister group to all other extant procyonids; they split off about 22.6 Ma ago. The clades leading to coatis and olingos on one hand, and to <b>ringtails</b> and {{raccoons}} on the other, separated about 17.7 Ma ago. The divergence between olingos and coatis is estimated to have occurred about 10.2 Ma ago, {{at about the same time}} that <b>ringtails</b> and raccoons parted ways.|$|R

50|$|The Musteloidea {{consists}} of the families Ailuridae (red pandas), Mustelidae (mustelids: weasels, otters, martens, and badgers), Procyonidae (procyonids: raccoons, coatis, kinkajous, olingos, olinguitos, <b>ringtails</b> and cacomistles), and Mephitidae (skunks).|$|R
25|$|Some known predators of the rock-haunting <b>ringtail</b> possum are the Dingo (Canis lupus dingo), the Oenpelli Python (Morelia oenpelliensis), the Olive Python (Liasis olivaceous), quolls (Dasyurus spp.), owls (Strigiformes), feral cats (Felis catus), {{domestic}} dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) {{and humans}} (Homo sapiens). The rock-haunting <b>ringtail</b> possum spends {{a large amount}} of time participating in sentinel behaviour to avoid predators. It perches on branches or ledges and scans the area for danger. In an attempt to deter predators and to warn others, this possum beats its tail against tree branches vigorously causing the entire tree to shake.|$|E
25|$|Presence of {{long-lasting}} {{bonds between}} parents and young seen in the family of this species is another attribute of obligate monogamy. Both sexes of the rock-haunting <b>ringtail</b> possum showed substantial long-term care of offspring. An unusual interaction observed {{between parents and}} young were the embrace by adult males and the bridge formation. Both sexes embrace young, whereas only females engage in bridge formation. The mother allows her young to move from branch to branch by using her body as a bridge. This has never been seen in another possum. Embracing {{is a way for}} the adults to know the stage of maturation of the offspring. A third feature of obligate monogamy shown by the Rock-haunting <b>Ringtail</b> Possum is the rearing of younger siblings by juveniles.|$|E
25|$|Feral cats in Australia prey on {{a variety}} of wildlife. In arid and {{semi-arid}} environments, they eat mostly introduced European rabbits and house mice. In arid environments where rabbits do not occur, native rodents are taken.

25|$|The {{reserve is}} a very {{important}} habitat for native fauna, particularly small mammals, reptiles and amphibians. Southern brown bandicoots, swamp wallabies, echidnas, and brushtail and <b>ringtail</b> possums are present but are often hard to find as they are not all active during the day.

40|$|A 31 -year-old woman {{presented}} with a clinically otherwise unsuspicious area of profuse sweating on her right forearm.

Histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen showed hyperplastic eccrine glands with pale, stippled cytoplasm characteristic of eccrine hamartoma. No explanation, however, has been given {{for the fact that}} several authors observed eccrine hamartomas in the same anatomical location. Adolescent lemurs of the species catta (<b>ringtailed</b> lemur) are equipped with a pair of antebrachial cutaneous glands located on the volar sur-face of the wrist.

25|$|Very little {{physical}} evidence proving {{the existence of}} the waitoreke exists. Julius von Haast is reported to have obtained a waitoreke pelt in 1868. The fur was brown, with white spots, and the toes lacked webbing. This is inconclusive evidence; the pelt seems to have resembled a quoll's. The common brushtail possum was successfully introduced in 1858 and is now a widespread pest, whereas introduction of the common <b>ringtail</b> possum ultimately failed. Both animals are unspotted.|$|E
