5|$|Speaking {{after the}} game's release, Sonic Team member and Sonic and the Black Knight {{director}} Tetsu Katano <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> {{although he did}} not feel the Werehog concept was a mistake, time and resources were a limiting factor in the game's production. He also <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> the Werehog may reappear in future games, or possibly in a sequel to Sonic Unleashed, should one be made.|$|E
5|$|Historians have <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> here Darwin {{anticipated}} the modern {{concept of an}} ecological niche. He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Lawson caused {{controversy}} and {{was featured in}} various newspapers for publicly advocating wearing fur. She also <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> she would love to kill a bear and then wear it.|$|E

5|$|Scholars still {{disagree}} on exact numbers. Father John T. Pawlikowski (a Servite priest from Chicago) <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> {{the hundreds of}} thousands of rescuers strike him as inflated.|$|E
5|$|Some analysts <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> Indonesia's {{delayed action}} also {{prevented}} peaceful transfer of East Timor to it, {{similar to the}} manner in which the French transferred Pondicherry to India in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{became the}} first team to win three World Cups, and {{registered}} a record 17 consecutive ODI wins. They also {{became the first}} team to win all the matches in a World Cup tournament. Writing for the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Simon Wilde <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> Australia would have beaten a Rest of the World XI had they been asked.|$|E

5|$|Because he was {{developed}} to be Naruto's opposite, Kishimoto <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> Sasuke was the most memorable character for him to design. Kishimoto has <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> Sasuke's character was also influenced by Hiei from Yoshihiro Togashi's series YuYu Hakusho, stating that he referenced Hiei when designing the character character and his Sharingan ability. He also considered Sasuke his most challenging character to create, because his design gave Kishimoto a number of problems. He lacked a proper idea of what Sasuke's face should look like, and his initial drafts of Sasuke appeared too old or mature for a character {{the same age as}} Naruto. Original designs of Sasuke had a number of necklaces and ties around his arms and legs a result of Kishimoto's habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible. Realizing he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to be a basic contrast of Naruto's costume.|$|E
5|$|Built in {{slightly}} over 30 months, Iloilo International Airport {{is one of}} the largest airports to be constructed in the Philippines.

5|$|In May 2008, The Industry Standard <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> Twitter's {{long-term}} viability {{is limited by}} a lack of revenue. Twitter board member Todd Chaffee forecast that the company could profit from e-commerce, noting that users may want to buy items directly from Twitter since it already provides product recommendations and promotions.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{frequently}} <b>remarked,</b> <b>that</b> {{it seems to}} have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions, on accident and force.|$|E
5|$|Martingales {{have many}} {{applications}} in statistics, {{but it has}} been <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> its use and application are not as widespread as it could be in the field of statistics, particularly statistical inference. They have found applications in areas in probability theory such as queueing theory and Palm calculus and other fields such as economics and finance.|$|E
5|$|Milne {{has been}} {{described}} as Ferguson's and even as Manchester United's worst signing, despite his low transfer fee. Ferguson defended the signing by pointing out Milne's contribution to the development of Lee Sharpe, who was playing left-back at the time. Ferguson <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> Milne helped Sharpe by both dropping back to protect Sharpe and by giving him positional advice. Milne remained on United's payroll until 30 June 1991, when he was released.|$|E

Additionally, judge Robert Banks of Suffolk County Superior Court imposed a {{probation}} condition that Power could not profit from her crime. Banks <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> the sentence negotiated was inadequate.|$|E
5|$|Russell T Davies {{scrapped}} a {{glass bowl}} storyline for the Partners in Crime slot in Series 4, as he decided {{this would make}} the story too contained, and that wasn't the tone he wanted. In his book The Writer's Tale, Davies <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> he was glad he abandoned the idea, because The Simpsons Movie had a similar premise.|$|E
5|$|The {{music played}} during the {{broadcast}} of the 1939 radio speech at {{the climax of the}} film is from the 2nd movement (Allegretto) of Beethoven's 7th Symphony; it was added by Tariq Anwar, the editor. When Desplat later joined the team to write the music, he praised and defended Anwar's suggestion. Hooper further <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> the stature of the piece helps elevate the status of the speech to a public event.|$|E

5|$|The unique {{condition}} of Argentina, {{as a country}} which had achieved advanced development in the early 20th century but experienced a reversal, has inspired a wealth of literature and analyses on the causes of this progressive decline.

5|$|Urobuchi {{stated that}} Sayaka was his {{favorite}} character overall, and <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> her plotline was the most enjoyable to write. Due to her grim fate {{by the end of}} the series, a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair, he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so that Sayaka could be spared. Urobuchi declined, asserting that her death was too integral to the overarching story. Shinbo then inquired if there were any way that she could be brought back to life, admitting he had become very attached to the character. However, Urobuchi again refused, explaining that this would be impossible with regard to the already-established rules governing the story. Shinbo finally acquiesced to this, but <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> he believed there may have been too large of a burden placed on the characters who were in essence young middle school girls.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked about}} the {{possibility}} of a European release, Nintendo representatives said there were no plans for one, and <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> preparing an RPG for release in Europe is far more difficult than other regions due to the need to optimize the game for PAL TV systems and translate it into multiple languages.|$|E
