40|$|International audiencePurposeThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer a novel {{perspective}} on <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> in franchising, i. e. from a franchisee perspective, by combining legal and managerial considerations in the European context. The objective is to assess franchisee perceptions regarding <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> in their chains. Design/methodology/approachThe authors adopt a qualitative approach and use 46 in-depth interviews with franchisees covering retail and service industries in the French market. FindingsMany of the interviewed franchisees believe that joining a franchise chain involves respecting the recommended <b>resale</b> <b>prices.</b> For some of the franchisees, in link with the chain uniformity, imposing uniform <b>resale</b> <b>prices</b> throughout the chain represents a strength, because customers who visit different stores within the franchise chain expect to find consistent pricing. Moreover, many franchisees consider that their franchisors have some know-how that they use to set correct <b>resale</b> <b>prices,</b> taking into account the profit margin. Research limitations/implicationsThis research contributes to the literature on <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> in franchising, as well as the franchising literature in general, by combining legal and managerial considerations, adopting a franchisee perspective, covering retail and service industries and focusing on French and European markets. Practical implicationsThis research can be viewed by franchise experts, franchisors, franchisees and franchisee candidates as a synthesis of resale price-related legal aspects, adopted practices and potential conflicts in franchise chains in the French market. It also highlights price-related practices to be avoided to prevent potential conflicts. Originality/valueThe subject of <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> in franchise chains is a hot topic, because of its link with customer attraction, chain uniformity, franchisor know-how, franchisee autonomy and the legal dimension...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurposeThe {{subject of}} <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> {{is a hot}} topic in franchising, due to its links with chain {{homogeneity}} and franchisee autonomy. The franchisee is bound by current legislation and regulations, in addition to respecting the franchise contract clauses, {{to the extent that}} they are lawful, and potentially opposing contentious professional practices. Focusing on <b>resale</b> <b>prices,</b> we cover these three perspectives, that is, legal, contractual, and professional constraints, using a dual approach based on managerial and legal perspectives and illustrating our arguments using examples from European and French cases. Methodology/approachWe illustrate our arguments using examples from European and French cases. FindingsWe pointed out that the ban on the practice of imposed <b>resale</b> <b>prices</b> presents several advantages (e. g., integrity of franchise chains, chain’s commercial dynamism).
