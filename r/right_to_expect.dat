Based on Tracy Letts's Pulitzer Prize-winning , Streep received positive reviews for her portrayal of the family's strong-willed and contentious matriarch, who is suffering from oral cancer and an addiction to narcotics, and was subsequently nominated for another Golden Globe, SAG, and Academy Award. At the National Board of Review Awards in 2013, Streep labeled Walt Disney as [...] "anti-semitic" [...] and a [...] "gender bigot". Former actors, employees and animators who knew Disney during his lifetime rebuffed the comments as misinformed and selective. The Walt Disney Family Museum issued a statement rebuking Streep's allegations indirectly, citing, among others, Disney's contributions to Jewish charities and his published letters stating that women [...] "have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> the same chances for advancement as men". However, Disney's grandniece, Abigail Disney, wholeheartedly agreed with Streep's statements, stating {{that he was an}} [...] "anti-Semite" [...] and [...] "racist" [...] who was also an exemplary filmmaker whose work [...] "made billions of people happy".|$|E

George Melly similarly wrote in The Observer that Roeg had joined [...] "that handful of names whose appearance {{at the end of the}} credit titles automatically creates a sense of anticipation". Penelope Houston for Sight & Sound also found much to appreciate in Roeg's direction: [...] "Roeg deploys subtle powers of direction and Hitchcockian misdirection." [...] American critics were similarly impressed with Roeg's work on the film. Jay Cocks regarded Don't Look Now to be Roeg's best work by far and that Roeg was one of [...] "those rare talents that can effect a new way of seeing". Cocks also felt that the film was a marked improvement on the novella, noting that a reading [...] "makes one appreciate Roeg and Screenwriters [...] Scott and [...] Bryant all the more. Film and story share certain basic elements of plot and an ending of cruel surprise. The story is detached, almost cursory. Roeg and his collaborators have constructed an intricate, intense speculation about levels of perception and reality." [...] Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times commented that Roeg is [...] "a genius at filling his frame with threatening forms and compositions", while Pauline Kael labelled him [...] "chillingly chic" [...] in hers.

500|$|AM2 {{developed}} what Sega {{hoped would}} be the Dreamcast's killer app, Shenmue, a [...] "revenge epic {{in the tradition of}} Chinese cinema." [...] The action-adventure title involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy—and only one sequel was ever released.s development |publisher=Polygon |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |quote=Yu Suzuki: The biggest challenge we encountered was project management.

An important text, seen as the lay people's Vinaya (code of conduct) is the Sigalovada Sutta which outlines wrong action and warns against the squandering of wealth. The Sigalovada Sutta outlines how a virtuous person [...] "worships the six directions" [...] which are parents (East), teachers (South), wife (West), and friends and colleagues (North), and the two vertical directions as: ascetics and Brahmins (Up) and the Servants (Down). The text elaborates on how to respect and support them, and how in turn the Six will return the kindness and support.

[...] According to the affidavits of eyewitnesses, Thayer also lectured members of his clubs, calling Sacco and Vanzetti [...] "Bolsheviki!"

You wait till I give my charge to the jury, I'll show them!" [...] In 1924, Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer at Dartmouth, his alma mater, and said: [...] "Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day. I guess that will hold them for a while.... Let them go to the Supreme Court now and see what they can get out of them." [...] The Committee knew that, following the verdict, Boston Globe reporter Frank Sibley, who had covered the trial, wrote a protest to the Massachusetts attorney general condemning Thayer's blatant bias. Thayer's behavior both inside the courtroom and outside of it had become a public issue, with the New York World attacking Thayer as [...] "an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> of a man presiding in a capital case." ...|$|E
