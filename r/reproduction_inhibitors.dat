40|$|Hibiscus rosa-sinensis leaf (HLM) {{was added}} to a basal diet (350 g crude protein and 18. 5 MJ gross energy/kg diet) at 0, 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0 or 4. 0 g/kg diets and fed to mixed-sex Oreochromis niloticus for 60 days to {{evaluate}} the effects on growth, feed conversion ratio, reproduction traits, and histology of gonads. There were no variations (p > 0. 05) in growth parameters and feed conversion ratio. Indices of reproduction traits decreased with increasing dietary HLM levels. Fish fed with the basal diet had higher and better indices of reproduction traits (P tissues, and no lesions were observed. Fish fed 1. 0 g HLM/kg diet showed slight increase in interstitial cells in testes. Fish fed 2. 0 g HLM/kg diet showed swollen spermatids nuclei, increased interstitial cells and focal necrosis in testes; and hydropic degeneration, ruptured follicles, granulomatous inflammation in the insterstitium and necrosis in ovaries. Fish fed 3. 0 g HLM/kg diet exhibited atrophy of seminiferous tubules in testes. Fish fed 4. 0 g HLM/kg diet, there was disintegration of spermatids and necrosis in testes and severe atretic follicles in ovaries.

40|$|Abstract: By {{the time}} of primary 21 st century, water {{hyacinth}} had become a serious environmental problem in China. Water hyacinth contributes to the major part of ecological hazards from the invasion of foreign plant species, which is estimated about USD 7 {{billion a year in}} values. In the past 10 years, herbicides glyphosate, 2, 4 -D and paraquat have been used in controlling water hyacinth in China. Al-though the herbicides provided effective control on the weed in some areas, they could not provide the sustainable inhibition on the weed population, while would lead to pollution on water at various levels. At present, the herbicide application on water hyacinth is forbidden in many areas of China such as Shanghai. In this situation, the asexual <b>reproduction</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> KWH 02, was invented for controlling water hyacinth and it provided about 70 % of growth inhibition without any risk of dead plant pollution. It has been about 10 years for bio-control of water hyacinth in China. Works focused on mainly the efficacy and safety of the utilization of foreign insects. Researches on microorganism herbicides to control water hyacinth were started and obtained primary achievements in recent years. Although there are different opinions on how to face the water hyacinth problem in China, it is accepted widely that the control methods should be high efficient and safe with low cost. Some practical measures for integrated management of water hyacinth are suggested...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess the ability of using pawpaw (Carica papaya) seeds as a natural <b>reproduction</b> <b>inhibitor</b> for tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) culture to control its breeding. Biochemical, {{physiological}} and histopathological effects of pawpaw seeds on male tilapia fish were also determined. Mature male tilapia were stocked for 4 weeks and treated with low dose (3 g/kg/day) and high dose (6 g/kg/day) of ground dried pawpaw seeds mixed with their feed. The obtained {{results showed that the}} pawpaw seeds induced permanent sterility in the high dose treated fish while the low dose treatment showed reversible results. The results also demonstrated that fish treated with high dose of pawpaw exhibited higher biochemical and physiological effects as: low meat quality, a progressive fall in erythrocyte (RBCs) count, hemoglobin (Hb) content and haematocrit values. Also the high dose revealed {{a significant increase in the}} leukocytes (WBCs) count, serum glucose, total protein, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine and uric acid levels. Moreover, serum total lipids revealed a significant decrease compared to control group. On the other hand, the low dose treatment revealed lower biochemical and physiological changes. Histological sections of testis showed disintegration of sperm cells and focal necrosis of seminefrous tubules in the high dose treated fish, hepato-pancreas and posterior kidney tissues also showed severe changes in high dose treated fish. Milder degenerative changes in some necrotic foci and slight changes in hepato-pancreas and posterior kidney were observed in the low dose treated fish. The study concluded that pawpaw seeds which are cheap and easy to obtain, can be incorporated into fish feeds with adjusted amount and be used to control breeding of tilapia fish in growing ponds instead of unfavorable and expensive hormonal use...|$|R
40|$|Widespread {{resistance}} of Anopheles sp. populations to pyrethroid insecticides {{has led to}} the search for sustainable alternatives in the plant kingdom. Among many botanicals, there is great interest in essential oils and their constituents. Many researchers have explored essential oils (EOs) to determine their toxicity and identify repellent molecules that are effective against Anopheles populations. Essential oils are volatile and fragrant substances with an oily consistency typically produced by plants. They contain a variety of volatile molecules such as terpenes and terpenoids, phenol-derived aromatic components and aliphatic components at quite different concentrations with a significant insecticide potential, essentially as ovicidal, larvicidal, adulticidal, repellency, antifeedant, growth and <b>reproduction</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> The current review provides a summary of chemical composition of EOs, their toxicity at different developmental stages (eggs, larvae and adults), their repellent effects against Anopheles populations, for which there is little information available until now. An overview of antagonist and synergistic phenomena between secondary metabolites, the mode of action as well as microencapsulation technologies are also given in this review. Finally, the potential use of EOs as an alternative to current insecticides has been discussed...|$|E
40|$|Methanolic {{extracts}} of {{the leaves}} of Atlantia monophylla (Rutaceae) were evaluated for mosquitocidal activity against immature stages of three mosquito species, Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi, and Aedes aegypti in the laboratory. Larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus and pupae of An. stephensi were found more susceptible, with LC 50 values of 0. 14 mg/l and 0. 05 mg/l, respectively. Insect growth regulating activity of this extract was more pronounced against Ae. aegypti, with EI 50 value 0. 002 mg/l. The extract was found safe to aquatic mosquito predators Gambusia affinis, Poecilia reticulata, and Diplonychus indicus, with the respective LC 50 values of 23. 4, 21. 3, and 5. 7 mg/l. The {{results indicate that the}} mosquitocidal effects of the extract of this plant were comparable to neem extract and certain synthetic chemical larvicides like fenthion, methoprene, etc. Key words: Atlantia monophylla- plant extract- mosquitocidal activities The problems of high cost and development of resis-tance in many vector mosquito species to several of the synthetic insecticides have revived interest in exploiting the pest control potential of plants (Grainge & Ahamed 1988).

40|$|Abstract: The recent de-registration {{of several}} {{chemical}} nematicides and the impending loss of methyl bromide from the pest-control market necessitate {{the development of}} new methods for controlling nematode-induced crop damage. One approach for developing novel target-specific controls is by exploiting fundamental differences between the biological processes of nematodes and their host plants. Researchers of the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the US Department of Agriculture are actively exploring these differences. Research accomplishments include the discovery of heat shock protein genes possibly involved in developmental arrest of the soybean cyst nematode, the identification of neuropeptides and female-specific proteins in the soybean cyst nematode, the disruption of nematode <b>reproduction</b> with <b>inhibitors</b> of nematode sterol metabolism, the development of novel morphological and molecular (heat shock protein genes and the D 3 segment of large subunit ribosomal DNA) features useful for nematode identification and classification, and the elucidation of the population genetics of potato cyst nematode pathotypes. In addition, several ARS researchers are investigating biological determinants of nematode response to management strategies utilized in agricultural fields. These collective efforts should lead to new chemical and non-chemical alternatives to conventional nematode control strategies...|$|R
