5|$|Bond {{visits the}} island, where he meets a local shell diver, Honey Ryder. The three are {{attacked}} by No's men, who kill Quarrel using a flame-throwing armoured tractor; Bond and Honey are taken prisoner. Dr. No informs them he {{is a member}} of SPECTRE, the SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion, and he plans to disrupt the Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered <b>radio</b> <b>beam.</b> Bond and Honey escape from the island, killing No and blowing up his lair in the process.|$|E
5|$|Upon waking, {{they are}} escorted to dine with Dr. No, a Chinese/German {{criminal}} scientist who, due to radiation exposure, has metal hands. He reveals {{that he is}} a former member of a Chinese crime Tong, from whom he stole ten million dollars. He also reveals that he is working for a secret organisation called SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion). He plans to disrupt the Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his <b>radio</b> <b>beam.</b> After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards.|$|E
5|$|In the film, James Bond {{is sent to}} Jamaica to {{investigate}} the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. No, who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch with a <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> weapon. Although {{the first of the}} Bond books to be made into a film, Dr. No was not the first of Fleming's novels, Casino Royale being the debut for the character; the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film also introduced the criminal organisation SPECTRE, which would also appear in six subsequent films.|$|E

5|$|Klaus Dodds {{has noted}} {{that there is a}} geopolitical aspect to the {{locations}} used, although this is often a pre-emption of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It {{took a long}} time to set up, so it could not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which made it hard to warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
5|$|During the series' fifty-year history {{only a few}} of {{the films}} have {{remained}} substantially true to their source material; Dr. No has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a giant squid, and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a centipede; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a bauxite mine instead of a guano quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt NASA space launches from Cape Canaveral using a <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating reactor coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book. Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.|$|E
40|$|We collate the {{evidence}} for rotation-powered neutron stars that are visible as X-ray sources and not as radio pulsars. Quantitative upper limits exist for the radio fluxes of eight objects, revealing a population at least {{an order of magnitude}} less luminous at radio wavelengths than known radio pulsars of similar power or age. These objects could have intrinsically low radio luminosities, but a simple alternative explanation is that they are pulsars in which the <b>radio</b> <b>beams</b> are directed away from Earth. Where hard X-ray or gamma-ray fluxes are seen, the beaming explanation implies different emission sites for the high-energy radiation and the unseen <b>radio</b> <b>beams.</b> We estimate that (a) the <b>radio</b> <b>beaming</b> fraction of young pulsars is roughly 50 %, certainly much less than 100 %, and (b) one neutron star is born in the Galaxy every ~ 90 years. We conclude that probably all neutron stars are born as radio pulsars and that most young, nearby pulsars have already been discovered.

500|$|Phase-difference {{couplers}} {{can be used}} {{to create}} beam tilt in a VHF FM radio station, by delaying the phase to the lower elements of an antenna array.

500|$|A {{number of}} decoy towns were {{constructed}} in Somerset in World War II to protect Bristol and other towns, at night. They {{were designed to}} mimic the geometry of [...] "blacked out" [...] streets, railway lines, and Bristol Temple Meads railway station, to encourage bombers away from these targets. One, on the <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> flight path to Bristol, was constructed on Beacon Batch. It was laid out by Shepperton Studios, based on aerial photographs of the city's railway marshalling yards. The decoys were fitted with dim red lights, simulating activities like the stoking of steam locomotives. Burning bales of straw soaked in creosote were used to simulate the effects of incendiary bombs dropped by {{the first wave of}} Pathfinder night bombers; meanwhile, incendiary bombs dropped on the correct location were quickly smothered, wherever possible. Drums of oil were also ignited to simulate the effect of a blazing city or town, with the aim of fooling subsequent waves of bombers into dropping their bombs on the wrong location. The Chew Magna decoy town was hit by half a dozen bombs on 2 December 1940, and over a thousand incendiaries on 3 January 1941. The following night the Uphill decoy town, protecting Weston-super-Mare's airfield, was bombed; a herd of dairy cows was hit, killing some and severely injuring others.|$|E

5000|$|Optical {{vortices}} {{can significantly}} improve communication bandwidth. For instance, twisted <b>radio</b> <b>beams</b> could increase <b>radio</b> spectral efficiency {{by using the}} large number of vortical states. [...] The amount of phase front ‘twisting’ indicates the orbital angular momentum state number, and beams with different orbital angular momentum are orthogonal. Such orbital angular momentum based multiplexing can potentially increase the system capacity and spectral efficiency of millimetre-wave wireless communication.|$|R
2500|$|On July 26, 1963 {{the first}} {{operational}} geosynchronous satellite Syncom 2 was launched.

Although Hitler commented on 22 September 1943 that [...] "It is a great load off our minds that we have dispensed with the radio guiding-beam; now no opening remains for the British to interfere technically with the missile in flight", about 20% of the operational V-2 launches were beam-guided.
