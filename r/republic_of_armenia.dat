5|$|On July 5, 1995, the new {{constitution}} of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> was adopted.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Soviet Union, the Armenian SSR {{transformed}} from a largely agricultural hinterland to an important industrial production center, while its population almost quadrupled from around 880,000 in 1926 to 3.3 million in 1989 due to natural growth and large-scale influx of Armenian Genocide survivors and their descendants. On August 23, 1990, it was renamed the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> after its sovereignty was declared, but remained in the Soviet Union until its official proclamation of independence on 21 September 1991. Its independence was recognized on 26 December 1991 when the Soviet Union ceased to exist. After {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, the state of the post-Union <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> existed until the adoption of the new constitution in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (also {{known as}} Artsakh among Armenians) remains internationally unrecognized. Today, the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> and Nagorno-Karabakh Republic are de facto {{functioning}} as one entity, although the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic territory is internationally recognized as de jure part of Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is more monoethnic than the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia,</b> with 99.7% {{of its population}} being Armenian. The Azerbaijani minority {{was forced to leave}} during the war. The areas outside the original NKAO borders taken over by the Armenian forces during the war are mostly uninhabited or very sparsely inhabited, with the city of Lachin being exception. Between 2000 and 2011, 25,000 to 30,000 people settled in NKR.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} stages of World War I, Andranik {{commanded}} the first Armenian volunteer battalion within the Russian Imperial army against the Ottoman Empire, capturing and later governing much of the traditional Armenian homeland. After the Revolution of 1917, the Russian army retreated and left the Armenian irregulars outnumbered against the Turks. Andranik led the defense of Erzurum in early 1918, but was forced to retreat eastward. By May 1918, Turkish forces stood near Yerevanthe future Armenian capitaland were halted at the Battle of Sardarabad. The Dashnak-dominated Armenian National Council declared the independence of Armenia and signed the Treaty of Batum with the Ottoman Empire, by which Armenia gave up its rights to Western Armenia. Andranik never accepted the existence of the First <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> because it included {{only a small part of}} the area many Armenians hoped to make independent. Andranik, independently from the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia,</b> fought in Zangezur against the Azerbaijani and Turkish armies and helped to keep it within Armenia.|$|E
5|$|After {{the communists}} {{took over the}} {{short-lived}} First <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> and ARF leaders were exiled, the Dashnaks moved their base of operations to where the Armenian diaspora had settled. With the large influx of Armenian refugees in the Levant, the ARF established a strong political structure in Lebanon {{and to a lesser}} extent, Syria. From 1921 to 1990, the Dashnaktsutiun established political structures in more than 200 states including the USA, where another large influx of Armenians settled.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{before and}} {{continuing}} into {{the time of}} the dissolution of the Soviet Union, waves of Armenians from the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> and other former Soviet republics arrived for political reasons and economic opportunities, settling in older established Armenian communities across the country. The 1988 Armenian earthquake and the energy crisis in Armenia during the Nagorno-Karabakh War caused an estimated number of 700,000 Armenians to leave the country, most of whom ended up in Russia, still others in the US, and some in Europe. Annually, on average 2,000 people from Armenia migrated to the US since 1994, not including ethnic Armenians from Middle Eastern countries. According to the 2000 US Census, there were 65,280 Armenian-born people in the US: 57,482 in California, 1,981 in New York and 1,155 in Massachusetts. According to the 2011 American Community Survey, there were 85,150 Armenian-born people in the US, about 20,000 more than in 2000. According to the US embassy in Yerevan, about 21,000 citizens of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> have moved to the US for permanent residency in the period from 1995 to 2012. Meanwhile, Armenian immigration from the Middle East continues, contributing to California's distinction of having, by far, the highest Armenian American population of any state.|$|E

Taron Margaryan has 6 children, 5 sons and 1 daughter. Generally, Taron Margaryan’s family does not engage in public activism. However, Margaryan’s wife, Gohar Sargsyan, {{annually}} gives out presents on April 7, recognized as the day of mothers and beauty, to expecting mothers.|$|R

50|$|Established on 13 July, 1991 as the Ordinariate of East Europe for Armenian Catholics in {{the former}} Soviet <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia,</b> Georgia, Russia and Ukraine.|$|R
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1918 the cathedral {{was in danger of}} an attack by the Turks. Prior to the May 1918 Battle of Sardarabad, which took place just miles away from the cathedral, the {{civilian}} and military leadership of Armenia suggested Catholicos Gevorg (George) V to leave for Byurakan for security purposes, but he refused. The Armenian forces eventually repelled the Turkish offensive and set the foundation of the First <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Armenian National Council {{declared}} {{the independence of}} the Armenian provinces on 28 May 1918. It was recognized by the Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of Batum on 4 June 1918. After its defeat in World War I, the Ottoman Empire and the Allies signed the Armistice of Mudros by which the Turkish troops left the Caucasus and by 1919 the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> established control over the former Kars Oblast, the city of Iğdır and its surrounding territory, including Mount Ararat.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{recognition of}} the Armenian Genocide by the US federal government is seen {{one of the most}} vital steps in international and full {{recognition of the}} 1915–1923 events. Many Armenians think that the US has the ability to force Turkey to recognize the past and pay Armenians and Armenia their reparations, that includes (for some) the return of the so-called Wilsonian Armenia to the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, {{with the}} {{creation}} of the newly established First <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> in 1918, Bagramyan enlisted in the 3rd Armenian Regiment of that country's armed forces. From 1 April 1918, that is, after the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 3, 1918) with the Russian SFSR, he was in the 1st Armenian Cavalry Regiment, which put a halt to the Ottoman 3rd Army, which was bent on conquering the remains of the republic, in Karaurgan, Sarikamish and Kars. He most notably took part in the May 1918 Battle of Sardarapat, where the Armenian military scored a crucial victory against Turkish forces. He remained in the regiment until May 1920.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{the party}} was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} First <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia,</b> which fell to the Soviet communists in 1920. After its leadership was exiled by the communists, the ARF established itself within Armenian diaspora communities, where it helped Armenians preserve their cultural identity. After the fall of the USSR, it returned to Armenia, where it now again has a presence as a minor party in Armenia's parliament. Prior to Serzh Sargsyan's election as president of Armenia and for a short time thereafter, the ARF was a member of the governing coalition, even though it nominated its own candidate in the presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|In late May 1988, amid rising {{nationalist}} tensions from glasnost and perestroika, Armenia's new Communist {{party leader}} allowed the banned tricolour of the DRA {{to fly in}} Yerevan {{for the first time}} in over sixty years. A year later, following a Nagorno-Karabakh-themed mass demonstration where the tricolour was flown, he urged its official recognition. This came on August 24, 1990, a day after the Armenian Supreme Soviet declared the republic's sovereignty and renamed the country the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia.</b> At that point, just over a year before Armenia declared its formal independence from the USSR, the tricolour replaced the 1952 flag.|$|E

50|$|From March 12, 1922 to December 5, 1936, Armenia and Georgia {{were a part}} of the Transcaucasian SFSR {{together}} with the Azerbaijan SSR. In 1936, the TSFSR was dissolved under Stalin's orders and the socialist <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia,</b> Azerbaijan, and Georgia were established instead.|$|R

5|$|The Armenian {{language}} has two distinct standardized forms: Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian, both widely spoken among the Armenian American community. Armenians from Lebanon, Turkey, Syria and few other countries speak the Western dialect, which was spoken in Turkish (Western) Armenia, the eastern regions of Turkey with historical Armenian presence. Eastern Armenian is primarily spoken in the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> and Iran, though the Iranian Armenians {{have their own}} dialect. Furthermore, Western and Eastern Armenian use two different spellings. In Armenia, the reformed orthography is used, while most Armenians in the diaspora (including Lebanon, Syria, Turkey and Iran) use the classical orthography.|$|E
5|$|The {{three major}} Armenian {{political}} {{parties of the}} late 19th century and early 20th century — the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun), Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hunchak) and Armenakan Party (later Ramgavar) were present in America not too long after their foundation. They established their own newspapers: Hairenik and Asbarez by Dashnaks and Baikar by Ramgavars. After the Bolsheviks took over Armenia in 1920, Rmagavars and Hunchaks formed a coalition supporting Soviet Armenia, while the ARF, the ruling party of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> from 1918 to 1920, remained anti-Soviet in the diaspora. The 1988 Spitak earthquake and the Karabakh movement brought the separate groups of the Armenian community together.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Persian Armenia was {{annexed to}} the Russian Empire {{after the last}} Russo-Persian War, and became known as Russian Armenia. When the Russian Empire collapsed, Russian Armenia {{declared}} its independence and joined the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, together with Georgia and Azerbaijan. This unified state hardly lasted a year and was soon dissolved. Since the Republic was short-lived, it did not use any flags or symbols. Nevertheless, some historians consider a horizontal gold, black, and red tricolor, {{similar to that of}} the German flag but arranged differently, to have been the flag of Transcaucasia. The federation was dissolved on May 26, 1918, when Georgia declared its independence as the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan declared their independence two days later, on May 28, 1918, as the First <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{influence}} gradually penetrated {{into the}} region by the early 19th century. The Erivan Khanate, in which Etchmiadzin was located, became an arena for rivalry between the Russian and Persian empires. During the Russo-Persian War (1804–13), Etchmiadzin was twice captured by the Russian troops led by General Pavel Tsitsianov, first in 1804 and then again in 1806. However, Russia returned it to Persia by the 1813 Treaty of Gulistan. On 13 April 1827, during the Russo-Persian War (1826–28), Etchmiadzin was captured by the Russian General Ivan Paskevich's troops without fight and was formally annexed by Russia, with the Persian-controlled parts of Armenia, roughly corresponding to {{the territory of the}} modern <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> (also known as Eastern Armenia), according to the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{two years}} after the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> was established, on 23 April 1920, the United States officially {{recognized}} it. Its frontiers were to be determined later. On 26 April 1920, the Supreme Council of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers in Paris (British Prime Minister Lloyd George, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and Italian Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti) requested that the United States accept the mandate over Armenia and to make an Arbitral Decision to determine the boundaries of Armenia with Turkey. President Woodrow Wilson agreed to act as arbitrator and draw a mutually acceptable border between the two nations. In July 1920, the US State Department founded the Committee upon the Arbitration of the Boundary between Turkey and Armenia, headed by William Westermann. The Treaty of Sèvres was signed on 10 August 1920. On 28 September 1920, the Committee submitted a report that defined the border between Armenia and Turkey. It guaranteed access to the Mediterranean sea for Armenia via Trebizond and proclaimed Turkey's border regions demilitarization frontier line.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Transcaucasian Federation, the Armenians were left to fend for themselves as the Turkish army approached the capital of Yerevan. At first, fearing a major military defeat and massacre of the population of Armenia, the Dashnaks wanted to evacuate the city of Yerevan. Instead, the Military Council headed by Colonel Pirumian decided that they would not surrender and would confront the Turkish army. The opposing armies met on May 28, 1918, near Sardarapat. The battle was a major military success for the Armenian army as it was able to halt the invading Turkish forces. The Armenians also stood their ground at the Battle of Kara Killisse and at the Battle of Bash Abaran. The creation of the First <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Armenia</b> was proclaimed on the same day of the Battle of Sardarapat, and the ARF became the ruling party. However, the new state was devastated, with a dislocated economy, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and a mostly starving population.|$|E
