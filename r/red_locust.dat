50|$|Red locusts are {{sedentary}} when ample shelter, perches {{and food}} is available. In dry years, when {{the amount of}} suitable habitat is reduced population densities increase. If the population density increases past a threshold, the locusts will transform into their gregarious phase, changing their behaviour and anatomy. When gregarious, <b>red</b> <b>locusts</b> keep together in large swarms and fly with the wind in daylight hours, looking for more food. The higher temperatures during daylight enable gregarious locusts to travel longer distances by flying longer and higher, aided by thermal lift. A swarm will rarely move more than 20-30 km in a day.In contrast, solitary locusts prefer to fly {{in the dark and}} do so alone.|$|R

50|$|After the {{termination}} of the LUBILOSA programme, activities to promote the use of Green Muscle continued, including field trials against <b>red</b> <b>locusts</b> and desert locusts {{with support from the}} FAO. A new project in West Africa, PRéLISS (Regional Project for Integrated Grasshopper Control in the Sahel), aimed at developing an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy that included the use of Green Muscle. This project conducted field trials with reduced dosages of Green Muscle and proved that 25 g/ha was as effective as the registered dosage of 50 g/ha. It also tested mixtures with lambda-cyhalothrin (a pyrethroid insecticide) to try {{to solve the problem of}} the slow action of Green Muscle. It was demonstrated that application of both products together, each at a quarter of its registered dose, caused mortality almost as quick as lambda-cyhalothrin alone and maintained low population levels for weeks, and all this at a much lower cost.|$|R

40|$|Anglická anotace Symbolic Colours in the Apocalypse of Saint John This thesis {{attempts}} {{to study the}} use of colours in the depiction of certain themes in the Apocalypse of st. John. The colours used {{by the author of}} Revelation are taken both from apocalyptic literature of the Old Testament era, but mainly from the books of Daniel, Ezechiel, Zacharias and Joel. The most often used colour is white: the white stone (Rev 2, 17); the white cloud (Rev 14, 14); the white horse (Rev 19, 11); the white throne (Rev 20, 11). Most likely {{the reason is that the}} author wanted to encourage his contemporaries in time of persecution. An exception is the text Rev 6, 2, where white is used in a concrete historical event. Red or scarlet is used in opposition to white: the red horse (Rev 9, 3 - 4); the <b>red</b> body-armour of <b>locusts</b> (Rev 9, 1 - 21); purple (or scarlet) in Rev 17, 4. The author also names colours of such minerals as emerald, ruby and jasper (Rev 4, 3). However most attention is paid to Revelation 6, where four riders appear on four horses of different colours.

30|$|These post-mining {{land uses}} were {{selected}} and established on 80  % to 90  % {{of the land}} reclaimed {{during the early years}} of SMCRA (early 1980 s and through the 1990 s). While much of the land was used by landowners as prescribed, many other lands reclaimed as hay land or pasture were not used by landowners for that purpose. Such lands were often left in an unused and unmanaged condition. When such lands were established with soils similar to the natural area, woody species would gradually invade by natural secondary succession if given sufficient time, especially where the reclaimed site was closely surrounded by native forest (Skousen et al. 2006). The succession process progresses through a series of pioneer and early-successional tree species such as <b>red</b> maple, black <b>locust,</b> black birch (Betula lenta L.), black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), autumn olive, crabapple (Prunus coronaria L.) and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.). Gradually, ash (Fraxinus spp.), yellow poplar, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), oak, hickory (Carya spp.), and other mid- to late-successional trees can become established in the understory and replace some of the early-successional trees. However, a more common outcome was for such lands to be left with compacted soils constructed with mine spoils that differed chemically from native soils and covered with dense herbaceous vegetation. Such lands did not return to native forest cover naturally even within several decades after mining (Angel et al. 2005; Zipper et al. 2011 a). Soil properties, vegetation established through reclamation, aspect, subsequent disturbance, local climate/weather patterns and wildlife are factors that influence the eventual plant community on unmanaged reclaimed mine lands.|$|R
50|$|There {{was a major}} {{plague of}} the African migratory locust from 1891 to 1903, {{followed}} by one that lasted from 1928 to 1941. For many years after that, the African migratory locust was in recession, which perhaps lulled the authorities into {{a false sense of}} security. The Sahel region experienced several years of drought in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The rains and more normal weather returned in 1984, providing ideal conditions for the locusts to breed abundantly. As well as the African migratory locust, the Senegalese grasshopper, the <b>red</b> <b>locust,</b> the brown locust and the desert locust were flourishing {{in various parts of the}} continent at the same time. The Desert Locust Control Organisation of East Africa remained an effective body, but elsewhere little monitoring was done, with civil wars in Chad and the Central African Republic hindering the detection of outbreaks.

40|$|The International <b>Red</b> <b>Locust</b> Control Organisation for Central and Southern Africa (IRLCO-CSA) {{has existed}} since 1949 (when {{known as the}} International <b>Red</b> <b>Locust</b> Con-trol Service, IRLCS) after its {{establishment}} by an international convention. The formation of IRLCO-CSA was partly a result of nearly 15 years ’ work to identify sources of <b>Red</b> <b>Locust</b> (Nomadacris septemfasciata Serville) plagues and to prevent their re-occurrence. A plague of Red Locusts, which started in 1929 and ended in 1944, had affected most of Africa south of the equator and some areas further north. For the organisation to achieve its objectives, its strategy was first to identify {{the source of the}} plague and then to control hopper bands and incipient swarms. For more than 40 years this strategy was effective. Consequently, the organisation expanded its mandate to include the management of other migratory pests, viz. African Armyworm, Spodoptera exempta, and quelea birds, Quelea quelea. This paper reviews the historical development of methodologies for the control of Red Locusts and other migratory pests and appraises current techniques. The role of ecological and weather factors in <b>Red</b> <b>Locust</b> upsurges is briefly examined. The quantitative study of such factors may lead to more accurate forecasts of outbreaks, which in turn would lead to more judicious use of pesticides.

40|$|It is {{just over}} 100 {{years since the}} {{chemical}} control of locusts began in South Africa when sodium arsenite dust was first applied by hand to <b>Red</b> <b>Locust</b> hopper bands and roosting swarms in Natal (Anonymous, 1906). Although our knowledge of locust outbreak dynamics, insecticide technology, application techniques and intervention strategies has made great advances, locusts remain a serious problem. Outbreaks of Brown, African Migratory and <b>Red</b> <b>Locust</b> still threaten sustainable agricultural production in southern Africa. Due to insufficient early warning and limited operational capacity, Brown Locust outbreaks are only contained after emergency campaigns have been launched. Such a curative control response involves vast expenditure, high insecticide usage and increased risk of environmental contamination. This paper briefly describes the biology and outbreak dynamics of the four species of plague locust occurring in southern Africa and focuses on the Brown Locust – a species of great economic importance for the SADC Region. The status of the Brown Locust in South Africa, the advances made, the current control strategy and operational tactics are highlighted.

This correctly translated the progressive evolution of a solitary state into a gregarious state, while passing through several intermediate transiens stages. According to their density, hopper populations consist of a mixture, in various proportions, of several pigment types. The gregarization threshold is estimated at 100, 000 hoppers/ha.

40|$|The LUBILOSA (Lutte Biologique contre les Locusts et les Sauteriaux) Programme {{has been}} working on the {{development}} of a myco-insecticide for the control of locusts and grasshoppers for the past 9 years. The resulting myco-insecticide product (trade name Green MuscleTM) is based on an oil formulation of aerial conidia of the fungal entomopa-thogen, Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum. Field testing of this myco-insecticide in sou-thern Africa has been conducted in close collaboration with the Locust and Termite Research Division of the Plant Protection Research Institute, South Africa. Trials have been conducted against Brown Locust, Locustana pardalina, in the Karoo region of South Africa and the <b>Red</b> <b>Locust,</b> Nomadacris septemfasciata, in the Buzi outbreak area of Moz-ambique. High (H 90 %) insect mortalities have been demonstrated following field appli-cations with standard ultra low volume (ULV) spraying equipment normally used in acridid control. Moreover, extensive eco-toxicological work has shown that Green MuscleTM has minimal impact on other non-target species, including other insects, reptiles, birds and mammals. Accordingly, Metarhizium has been recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Pesticide Referee Group for locust control in environmen-tally sensitive areas. Most significantly, Green MuscleTM has recently undergone successful registration for locust control in South Africa.
