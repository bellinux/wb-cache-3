25|$|While {{there are}} some correspondences between the ideas about genius and juno, {{especially}} in the imperial age, the <b>relevant</b> <b>documentation</b> is rather late (Tibullus mentions it first). Dumézil also remarks from these passages one could infer every woman has a Venus too. As evidence of the antiquity {{of the concept of}} a juno of women, homologous to the genius of men, is the Arval sacrifice of two sheep to the Juno Deae Diae ("the juno of goddesses named Dea Dia"), in contrast to their sacrifice of two cows sacrificed to Juno (singular). However both G. Wissowa and K. Latte allow that this ritual could have been adapted to fit theology of the Augustan restoration. While the concept of a Juno of goddesses is not attested in the inscriptions of 58 BC from Furfo, that of a Genius of gods is, and even of a Genius of a goddess, Victoria. On this point it looks remarkable that also in Martianus Capella's division of Heaven a Juno Hospitae Genius is mentioned in region IX, and not a Juno: the sex of this Genius is feminine. See section below for details.|$|E
25|$|Mendizábal's {{cooperation}} benefited {{both his}} business and his military influence, and the governor {{went as far as}} employing politics to favor him. On one night, a group of 23 slaves escaped from El Plantaje and were joined by some employees from his shipyard. Consequently in May 1728, Enríquez ordered two of his ships to go to St. Thomas to reclaim the slaves that had escaped. He also ordered that if this could not be accomplished, they should go to the San Juan cays and capture as many as possible, which they did and returned with 24 slaves. Taking notice, Mendizábal requested a treaty with Denmark that allowed the return or replacement of slaves that escaped between Puerto Rico and St. Thomas. Despite being fully invested in the war effort, Enríquez also continued to serve the Crown in other aspects. His fleet was forced to secure the arrival of Cumaná's Situado, evading a British squadron. Enríquez also continued providing transport to the authorities and even some civilians. That same year, he sent Camino to Havana in order to complete a task. However, Enríquez's confidant failed when he lost the <b>relevant</b> <b>documentation,</b> losing to a local privateer and costing a significant amount of money. The privateer was angered by this development, Camino responded by reclaiming payment for his entire career and threatened that he would travel to Spain seeking retribution. Enríquez's enemies considered this an opportunity to give credibility to their allegations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinguished}} {{scholar and}} administrator, Howard F. Cline, who, {{at the time}} of his death was Director of the Hispanic Foundation of the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. gave, in 1969, this positive assessment of Torquemada's skill as an historian :-Historians generally see their tasks broken into three main stages: as comprehensive as possible collection of <b>relevant</b> <b>documentation,</b> followed by critical and evaluative appraisal of it, and finally, a synthesis based on verified data. Contrary to a considerable body of hostile secondary discussion, critical examination of Juan de Torquemada's Monarquía Indiana indicates a surprisingly high level of workmanship in at least the first two phases. Although what he strove for in synthesis [...] an accurate record that would place native Mexican cultures on a par with ancient, classical, and for him modern societies [...] is an early and interesting example of a comparative approach, the classical and Biblical citations he employed for such comparisons are now largely of curiosity value, except as clues to his own ambience and personal outlook.|$|E

During this period, increase of birth rate of 1.7% per year, occurred. Peter Grgec wrote in his war memoirs that the Croatian loses were hardest of all Austro-Hungarian nations.|$|R

Music researchers have found correlations between music making and some of the deepest workings of the human brain.

40|$|Web APIs {{have gained}} {{increasing}} popularity in recent Web service technology development owing to its simplicity of technology stack and {{the proliferation of}} mashups. However, efficiently discovering Web APIs and the <b>relevant</b> <b>documentations</b> on the Web is still a challenging task even with the best resources available on the Web. In this paper we cast the problem of detecting the Web API documentations as a text classification problem of classifying a given Web page as Web API associated or not. We propose a supervised generative topic model called feature latent Dirichlet allocation (feaLDA) which offers a generic probabilistic framework for automatic detection of Web APIs. feaLDA not only captures the correspondence between data and the associated class labels, but also provides a mechanism for incorporating side information such as labelled features automatically learned from data that can effectively help improving classification performance. Extensive experiments on our Web APIs documentation dataset shows that the feaLDA model outperforms three strong supervised baselines including naive Bayes, support vector machines, and the maximum entropy model, by over 3 % in classification accuracy. In addition, feaLDA also gives superior performance when compared against other existing supervised topic models...|$|R
