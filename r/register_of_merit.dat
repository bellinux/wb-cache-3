25|$|On the racetrack, AQHA offers year-end Champion {{awards in}} {{age and sex}} divisions, plus broodmare, {{distance}} horse, Canadian champion, owner, breeder, trainer, and jockey.

The three-year-old and aged categories work the same way, with the World Champion being chosen from {{the winners of the}} age and sex divisions. In addition to the year end awards, there are three lifetime awards - Race <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>Merit,</b> Superior Race Horse and Supreme Race Horse. A <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>Merit</b> is awarded when a horse attains a speed index of 80 or above. A Superior Race Horse is achieved when the horse earns 200 racing points. A Supreme Race Horse award requires the horse to satisfy the following three criteria - 1) win over $500,000.00 in earnings, 2) win two Grade 1 stakes races and 3) win a total of ten races.|$|E

2500|$|The racing {{interests}} {{formed the}} American Quarter Racing Association (AQRA) on February 1, 1945. This group mainly {{was concerned with}} the operation of racetracks and their registration efforts were limited to what was needed for identification for racing purposes. They set the standards for racing, {{and set up a}} <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>Merit</b> system to help with handicapping racing. They registered horses that were in AQHA's stud books, as well as Thoroughbreds. Even [...] "Paint" [...] horses, which at this time had no registry and would not for another two decades, were registered. Painted Joe, a foundation stallion with the American Paint Horse Association (APHA), was registered with the AQRA and ran against many of the early Quarter Horse racers.|$|E
2500|$|AQHA now {{registers}} {{the offspring}} of other American Quarter Horses in its numbered stud book.

2500|$|Hyperkalemic {{periodic}} paralysis (HYPP), {{which is}} caused by an autosomal dominant gene linked to the stallion Impressive. [...] It is characterized by uncontrollable muscle twitching and substantial muscle weakness or paralysis among affected horses. [...] Because it is a dominant gene, only one parent has to have the gene {{for it to be}} transmitted to offspring. [...] There is a DNA test for HYPP, which is required by the AQHA. Since 2007, the AQHA bars registration of horses who possess the homozygous form (H/H) of the gene, and though heterozygous (H/N) horses are still eligible for registration, altering that status is currently being discussed. Additionally all Quarter Horses born 2007 or later that are confirmed to be descendants of Impressive must carry a note about the risks of HYPP on their registration papers. Due to HYPP, the halter classes are undergoing significant changes. [...] Halter classes are dominated by the Impressive bloodline. [...] Impressive, a very prolific halter horse, brought to the stock breeds the muscle mass that is popular in halter competition today. [...] This muscle mass is linked to HYPP, and as the condition is reduced within the breed, the style of horse in halter classes is also likely to change. [...] Already there have been rule changes, including the creation of a [...] "Performance Halter class" [...] in which a horse must possess a <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>Merit</b> [...] in performance or racing before it [...] can compete.|$|E

In spite of this, the exact relationship between age and producing ability, if such exists, has never been definitely determined.
