40|$|Scientists {{around the}} world use 3 He to study the spin {{structure}} of the neutron. This study is made more efficient by polarizing 3 He {{through a process of}} spin-exchange collisions with optically pumped alkali vapor. One method to determine the absolute 3 He polarization employs the techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance. Water has a known polarization and serves as a standard by which to calibrate the polarization of a given sample. If a water sample is placed in two magnetic fields, one constant and one oscillating with time, the spins of the water molecules absorb energy at a certain resonant frequency. When the spins flip, a voltage is induced in nearby pickup coils. This process is repeated with a 3 He sample. Together, the two NMR signals and the polarization of water are used to determine the polarization of the 3 He sample. Using this method, the absolute polarization of a 3 He target cell, Voltaire, was measured to be (8. 1 ± 1. 0) %. 3 Acknowledgements There were many people who helped make this research experience both educational and fun.
