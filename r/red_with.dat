5|$|Variety borealis has a {{slightly}} darker color scheme than the main species. The coloration in general is darker; the cap can vary from a bright apple red to a dark brick <b>red</b> <b>with</b> maturity, to almost purple in some instances. The pore surface has a varying coloration of orange red to red and becoming a dull brown <b>red</b> <b>with</b> age. The bruising coloration is a blue green and the spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety borealis is relatively small, ranging from Michigan to the upper New England states. The similar distribution and coloration to Boletus carminiporus has caused the two to be confused. New molecular evidence shows that borealis is not closely related to Baorangia bicolor var. bicolor.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's home colours {{have been}} the {{inspiration}} {{for at least three}} other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time; in 1938, Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip. In 1920, Sporting Clube de Braga's manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's <b>red</b> <b>with</b> white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of Os Arsenalistas. These teams still wear those designs to this day.|$|E

5|$|Chapman also {{advocated}} {{the use of}} white footballs and numbered shirts, as well as adding hoops to Arsenal's socks {{to make it easier}} for players to pick each other out. He later made a further change to Arsenal's kit, adding white sleeves to the previously all-red shirt and brightening the colour, before a match against Liverpool on 4 March 1933; the same kit theme of <b>red</b> <b>with</b> white sleeves or trim survives to this day. The tradition of both teams walking out together at the FA Cup Final was started in 1930 due to Herbert Chapman's involvement with both clubs, and has continued since.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{rallying}} {{successes of}} the Simca 1000 and the Talbot Sunbeam, PSA launched the Samba Rallye. Fitted with the 1219cc XW version of the X engine, delivering 66kilowatt (90PS), it came in either white or <b>red,</b> <b>with</b> a hood scoop and side stripes. In 1985, a version with the 1360cc unit producing 59kilowatt (80PS) was launched, without the stripes.

5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish <b>red</b> <b>with</b> oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E
5|$|Intimidator 305 {{features}} two trains themed as Dale Earnhardt's black number 3 car. The trains feature headlights at {{the front}} of each train as well as advertisement stickers that are found on NASCAR cars. One train is <b>red</b> <b>with</b> the other being silver. Each train has eight four-passenger cars, allowing thirty-two passengers per train. The trains are arranged in stadium-style seating with overhead lap bars fitted with soft, padded over-the-shoulder straps. In early July 2010, the ride received a unique new restraint design. The over-the-shoulder part of the harness now resembles a padded seat belt rather than the typical over-the-shoulder restraints used by Intamin.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius xanthogalactus {{has nearly}} {{identical}} microscopic features to L.vinaceorufescens, but macroscopically, {{it does not}} have the reddish-vinaceous stains that develop on the cap, gills, and stem of L.vinaceorufescens, and it grows on the ground under oak. Another lookalike is L.colorascens, but it may be distinguished from L.vinaceorufescens by several features: a smaller fruit body; a whitish cap that becomes brownish <b>red</b> <b>with</b> age and does not spot vinaceous or brown; bitter to faintly acrid latex; and slightly smaller spores. L.chrysorrheus is also similar, but it has a whitish to pale yellowish-cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods (especially oak) on well-drained, often sandy soil, and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow {{at the nape of}} the neck. It had white unfeathered areas around the eyes, and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The legs were brown. The upper back was brownish <b>red</b> <b>with</b> feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws.|$|E
5|$|The MX3000 {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical innovations to the metro. Regenerative brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the third rail. The passengers also have air conditioning. The driver's cabs are more ergonomic than in the older models, and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens. The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' <b>red</b> <b>with</b> blue detailing. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This will remove the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of June was heralded by {{the debut of}} United's third kit, which debuted in the opening match of the month. The new third kit, which featured a primary color of <b>red,</b> <b>with</b> black accents debuted in the 3 June away fixture at Los Angeles Galaxy. June also saw a wave of controversy arrive involving Charlie Davies and deceiving match officials during the run of play, causing Davies to be fined by MLS. As the international transfer window neared, United made an unanticipated, blockbuster trade with their Atlantic Cup rivals, New York Red Bulls on 27 June. On the pitch, however, United failed to win any matches during the month, tallying three draws and a loss during the month.|$|E
