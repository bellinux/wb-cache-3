40|$|The {{issue before}} the Court was whether selling stolen {{property}} through a retractable <b>sliding</b> <b>tray</b> on a pawn shop’s drive-through window satisfied {{the element of}} unlawful entry of a building as defined in the burglary statute. The Court held that when the outer boundary of a building is not self-evident from the shape and contours of the structure itself, courts must apply California’s “reasonable belief” test which legally defines the outer boundary to include, “any element that encloses an area into which a reasonable person would believe that {{a member of the}} general public could not pass without authorization. ...|$|R
50|$|The Kodak system offered three {{advantages}} over the straight-tray, horizontal-feed systems that were then common on the market. The Carousel <b>tray</b> held <b>slides</b> {{in place with}} a locking ring on its hub, preventing slides from accidentally spilling out of the tray if it was dropped. By using gravity to lower the slide into the projector, the chance of jamming was greatly reduced, since a warped slide would not descend past {{the point at which}} it encountered resistance in the mechanism. The circular tray also enabled the projector to display automated shows without the need to manually reset the <b>slide</b> <b>tray</b> between performances.|$|R

50|$|Less {{well-known}} but plentiful is {{a family}} of projectors based around a design originated by Sawyer's and later sold under other brand names. That manufacturer's first slide projectors, in the late 1950s, had used straight trays. In 1963, the Sawyer's Rotomatic, the first version using circular trays (called Rototrays), was introduced. These are distinguished by the round tray being in an upright orientation, like a Ferris wheel. Unlike the Carousel tray's use of a locking collar to hold the <b>slide</b> in the <b>tray,</b> the Rototray held slides in place using friction {{against the side of}} each slide. Projectors using the 100-slide Rototray were backward-compatible with the TDC-Universal straight <b>slide</b> <b>trays</b> that had been popular since the late 1950s. The 1960s would also see the introduction of a plethora of less popular tray designs, most incompatible with each other, introduced by manufacturers possibly hoping to profit from the Razor-and-blades business model.|$|R
50|$|The {{stays on}} period sackbuts are flat. While the bell stay {{remained}} flat, from about 1660 the slide stays became tubular. On many modern reproductions <b>round</b> <b>slide</b> stays {{are much more}} comfortable to play and easier to make.|$|R

50|$|Cabinets were in {{the rear}} {{quarters}} beside the two rear seats; one held cocktail equipment, including cut glass decanters, glasses and thermos jugs, while the other held picnic equipment, including Perspex sandwich boxes, cups, saucers, and linen. A folding table was fitted in {{the centre of the}} front seat, a manicure set in the passenger door recess, and an ivory-handled nylon umbrella in {{the lower part of the}} passenger door. A <b>sliding</b> <b>tray</b> under the passenger side of the dashboard held a folding mirror, a clothes brush, a comb, a powder compact, a cigarette case, and a cream jar. The boot held rawhide suitcases with gilt Bramah locks.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers {{of highly}} {{specialized}} multi-image {{equipment such as}} optical slide cameras and slide projector programming hardware. Precise camera systems were developed for the multi-image market featuring pin-registered film movements capable of making multiple exposures, controlled backlit color light sources, motorized multi-axis compounds for precise positioning of artwork, and long-roll film loads. Slide projector programming computers and dissolve equipment and software was developed to synchronize the slides with the audio by providing precise time control over <b>slide</b> <b>tray</b> positioning and lamp fade rates needed to create multi-image animation. Programmer and camera manufacturers included Audio Visual Labs, Electrosonic, Clearlight Inc. Spindler & Sauppe, Marron Carrel and Forox.|$|R

40|$|ViSTA is {{a digital}} asset {{management}} and display system designed for education. The system enables instructors to search a database of digital assets, select the ones they want and save them in sortable virtual <b>slide</b> <b>trays.</b> They can then use those trays for in-class presentations as well as allowing registered students to view them at will from any internet-connected computer. Students register for courses in the ViSTA system through a special code issued by the instructor. Once registered, their ViSTA homepage automatically displays the courses they are registered for and the associated trays for that particular course. Students can also create and modify their own personal trays organized in any fashion they want. These trays {{can be used for}} reference, studying for an exam, or for presentation purposes. The ViSTA system helps administrators and faculty manage the digital collection, the courses, the trays, and the user accounts. ...|$|R
50|$|For MYs 1972 and 1973 the carburetors {{had been}} three {{separate}} items with the complex cabling. 1974 models featured The unitized carburetors mounted {{to a single}} bracket with a less complex single push-pull cable arrangement for easier and more durable synchronization. The unitized carbureters continued {{through to the end}} of production of the three-cylinder models, when the GT750 received the Mikuni BS40 type diaphragm style carburetors. All smaller models featured Mikuni VM type <b>round</b> <b>slide</b> caruretors.|$|R
50|$|Each link {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} metal curved into two partial cylinders, into which adjacent <b>rounds</b> <b>slide.</b> Like the M13 link, the M27 link is a push-through design. Rounds are extracted by pushing forward out of the link. With the round freed, the link disintegrates (detaches from the belt) and is ejected. This is in contrast with older belt systems which were typically made of fabric and were fed straight through the weapon without disintegrating.|$|R
30|$|The thin {{sections}} were prepared by laying samples set in open sample trays with clean glass slides. Sample numbers were {{marked on the}} glass slide with diamond scriber. Sample number checked against the marked number on the glass slides to ensure the sample identity is correct. The samples were ground to a flat surface using only diamond abrasive with distilled water. Sample grinding was done by hand on a flat plate for the core samples. Samples that required stabilization (the side wall core samples) prior to grinding, were stabilized. Epoxy stabilization was done in a plastic using Epon 815 -diethylene-triamine. The glass <b>slide</b> <b>tray</b> was ensured to be next to the samples. The sample was allowed to cure at room temperature. Final grinding of the surface to be mounted on the glass slide was done using 400 -mesh diamond plate. Lapping was done using glass impregnated plate.  10 ×-power magnification microscopes were used in observing {{the progress of the}} grinding. The prepared slides were analyzed using petrographic microscope.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the use of {{immersive}} spherical imaging techniques to document, visualize and investigate architectural space. This technology can be used in the classrooms and design studios to augment traditional instructional and design investigation tools. As opposed to cylindrical imaging found in the popular QuickTime VR format, spherical imaging provides a 360 -degree view in all directions - horizontally and vertically. The ability to capture and display a full sphere can be crucial for many interior architectural spaces. Spherical panoramas can originate from real, synthetic or hybrid source images. In addition to the ability to embed links to web pages or other panoramas, a unique feature of this technology allows the viewer to navigate through a scene as well as pause at any point and view the space in all directions. In addition, the technology allows the user to sketch over the scene in an intelligent manner such that the sketched artifacts rotate correctly when the target view shifts. The software also integrates with collaborative tools to allow synchronous viewing of shared panoramas over the Internet. These features allow for a truly immersive and interactive experience of the space that can be quite useful in a design studio setting. Finally, this paper describes ongoing efforts to integrate this technology with an interactive web-based, databasedriven virtual <b>slide</b> <b>tray</b> system for the storage, sorting, and display of multimedia content...|$|R

50|$|Originally, the {{machines}} in U.S. automats took only nickels. In the original format, a cashier {{sat in a}} change booth {{in the center of}} the restaurant, behind a wide marble counter with five to eight rounded depressions. The diner would insert the required number of coins in a machine and then lift a window, hinged at the top, and remove the meal, usually wrapped in waxed paper. The machines were replenished from the kitchen behind. All or most New York automats had a cafeteria-style steam table where patrons could <b>slide</b> a <b>tray</b> along rails and choose foods, which were ladled from tureens.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s {{the company began}} {{manufacturing}} slide projectors (for conventional 2x2-inch slides), viewers for conventional slides and scenic slide sets. By 1961, slide projectors had become Sawyers' second-most-profitable product. A new model introduced in 1963 {{was known as the}} Sawyer's Rotomatic and used upright circular trays, called Rototrays, to hold the <b>slides</b> (100 per <b>tray).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cigarettes}} {{were available}} in tins and the original cardboard container was a four sided tray of cigarettes that slid out from a covering like a classic matchbox.

50|$|The {{board is}} a 6x6 grid with grooves in the tiles to allow cars to <b>slide,</b> card <b>tray</b> {{to hold the}} cards, current active card holder and an exit hole. The game comes with 16 {{vehicles}} (12 cars, 4 trucks) which each are colored differently and 40 puzzle cards. Additionally the cars take up 2 squares each and the trucks take up 3 squares each. Also all vehicles can only be moved within a straight line along the grid and they cannot be rotated. Lastly, the puzzle card shows which colored cars and trucks get placed {{on the board and}} where they should be placed. In addition to that, each card has a different level number. The higher the level number, the more difficult the challenge is.|$|R
50|$|In 1960, Rollei {{introduced}} its first slide projector, the P11.
