5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves <b>round</b> <b>and</b> <b>round,</b> the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E

Sheppard ran <b>round</b> <b>and</b> <b>round</b> a skier from Carmody and did not touch it and, from having the home men 50 for three, the Englishmen allowed them to get on top completely.

Bailey emulated Sheppard by running <b>round</b> <b>and</b> <b>round</b> a catch, and not touching it, and Brown seemed to despair of victory...Brown left Perth stating, in a most determined manner, that his fieldsmen would know that they had had fielding practice before very long.|$|E

500|$|The {{partnership}} with Alfa Romeo ended during the 1979 season, the team's first with young Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet. Murray designed the full-ground effect BT48 around a rapidly developed new Alfa Romeo V12 engine and incorporated an effective [...] "carbon-carbon braking" [...] system—a technology Brabham pioneered in 1976. However, unexpected {{movement of the}} car's aerodynamic centre of pressure made its handling unpredictable and the new engine was unreliable. The team dropped to eighth in the Constructors' Championship {{by the end of}} the season. Alfa Romeo started testing their own Formula One car during the season, prompting Ecclestone to revert to Cosworth DFV engines, a move Murray described as being [...] "like having a holiday". The new, lighter, Cosworth-powered BT49 was introduced before the end of the year at the Canadian Grand Prix; where after practice Lauda announced his immediate retirement from driving, later saying that he [...] "was no longer getting any pleasure from driving <b>round</b> <b>and</b> <b>round</b> in circles".|$|E

I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Brian, {{now in his}} seventies, {{had been}} advised to await {{the outcome of the}} battle in a tent not far from the field, and it is said that a traitor in the Irish camp, {{possibly}} Tadhg O Ceallaigh, King of Uí Maine, had pointed out Brian's position to Bróðir {{at some point during the}} battle. Accounts differ over whether Bróðir was the killer of Brian Boru. According to one Irish account, Bróðir overcame Brian's guard, only to be killed by the High King who then killed himself. Njal's saga records that Bróðir killed Brian and cried out: [...] "Now let man tell man that Brodir felled Brian." [...] Two of Brian's followers, Wolf and Kerthialfad, returned to the king, and captured Bróðir and the remainder of his men. According to the saga, [...] "Wolf the Quarrelsome cut open his belly, and led him <b>round</b> <b>and</b> <b>round</b> the trunk of a tree, and so wound all his entrails out of him," [...] while Bróðir's men were [...] "slain to a man". The modern Irish medievalist historian Donnchadh Ó Corráin, however, merely states that Bróðir was killed on the day of the battle and that Brian was killed in his tent [...] "by Norsemen fleeing from the scene".|$|E

500|$|The {{design of}} these ships was very {{controversial}} {{while they were}} being built in the 1870s, with many articles being published in the newspapers of the day by supporters and detractors, and later picked up by historians. One such account, published in 1875, claimed that Novgorod made an uncontrollable turn while on the Dniepr, while Reed, describing {{a time when the}} ship's engines on one side were reversed during a cruise in Sevastopol Bay, wrote: [...] "The circular form is so extremely favourable to this kind of handiness that the Novgorod can easily be revolved on her centre at a speed which quickly makes one giddy. She can, nevertheless, be promptly brought to rest, and, if, needed have her rotary motion reversed." [...] It would seem probable that the two reports quoted above were combined into the story as given by Fred T. Jane: [...] "On a trial cruise, they (Novgorod and [...] ) went up the Dniepr very nicely for some distance, till they turned to retire. Then the current caught them, and they were carried out to sea, whirled helplessly <b>round</b> <b>and</b> <b>round,</b> every soul on board helplessly incapacitated by vertigo." [...] The other criticisms made by Preston have been discussed earlier and the opinion of naval historian Stephen McLaughlin is a reasonable assessment of these ships: In the final analysis, the popovkas seem to have been relatively effective coast-defence vessels; certainly their combination of armament and armour could have only been carried by a conventional ship of much greater draught. Their faults – and they certainly had faults — were exaggerated by critics, both in Russia and abroad, and have left as a legacy stories of uncontrollable ships designed by incompetent men.|$|E

Early recipes for potato chips in the United States are found in Mary Randolph's Virginia House-Wife (1824), and in N.K.M. Lee's Cook's Own Book (1832), both of which explicitly cite Kitchiner.|$|E

Guitarist the Edge considered the song at that point to be [...] "awful". The track consisted of a Yamaha drum machine beat and a bass part played by bassist Adam Clayton using an Ibanez bass guitar with a short scale.

2500|$|Karma forms {{a central}} and {{fundamental}} part of Jain faith, being intricately connected to other of its philosophical concepts like transmigration, reincarnation, liberation, non-violence (ahiṃsā) and non-attachment, among others. Actions {{are seen to}} have consequences: some immediate, some delayed, even into future incarnations. So the doctrine of karma is not considered simply in relation to one life-time, but also in relation to both future incarnations and past lives. Uttarādhyayana-sūtra 3.3–4 states: [...] "The jīva or the soul is sometimes born {{in the world of}} gods, sometimes in hell. Sometimes it acquires the body of a demon; all this happens on account of its karma. This jīva sometimes takes birth as a worm, as an insect or as an ant."
