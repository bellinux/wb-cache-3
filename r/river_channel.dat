5|$|Latest {{research}} has also shown that Murray cod in fact live their entire lifecycle within the main channel of the stream. Earlier ideas that Murray cod spawn on floodplains, or the larvae feed on floodplains, are incorrect. Murray cod breed in the main <b>river</b> <b>channel</b> or, in times of spring flood, the inundated upper portion of the main channel and tributary channels, but not on floodplains.

5|$|One {{neighborhood}} of New York County is contiguous with the U.S. mainland. Marble Hill {{at one time}} was part of Manhattan Island, but the Harlem River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan. Before World War I, {{the section of the}} original Harlem <b>River</b> <b>channel</b> separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.|$|E
5|$|The Petitcodiac {{river valley}} at Moncton is broad and {{relatively}} flat, bounded {{by a long}} ridge to the north (Lutes Mountain) and by the rugged Caledonia Highlands to the south. Moncton lies at the original head of navigation on the river, however a causeway to Riverview (constructed in 1968) resulted in extensive sedimentation of the <b>river</b> <b>channel</b> downstream and rendered the Moncton area of the waterway unnavigable. On 14 April 2010, the causeway gates were opened {{in an effort to}} restore the silt-laden river.|$|E
5|$|Later inhabitation of Southcote was {{discovered}} at Anslow's Cottages {{south of the}} Kennet, where excavation suggests that a Bronze Age waterfront was made on {{a branch of the}} river. A 1991 report by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England—now known as English Heritage—detailed the discovery of fragments of twined basketry at Anslow's Cottages, showing that eel or fish traps were used on the river near Southcote. Archaeological findings of timber structures adjacent to the trap suggest that it dated from the eight or ninth century. Later discoveries, made in the 1980s during gravel extraction in the area, also uncovered evidence of a landing stage or jetty on the <b>river</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E

40|$|In the {{northern}} {{slope of the}} Carpathian Mountains and in their foreland, <b>river</b> and stream <b>channels</b> have been significantly transformed by human impact. These transformations result from changing land use in river basins and direct interference with <b>river</b> <b>channels</b> (alluvia extraction, engineering infrastructure, channel straightening). Anthropogenic impacts cause {{significant changes in the}} channel system patterns leading to increased impact of erosion. This mainly leads to the channelling of the fluvial system.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of February 19, 1845, a large {{earthquake}} resulted in a substantial mudflow. This mudflow flowed down {{the valley of the}} Lagunillas River for approximately , spilling out of the <b>river</b> <b>channel</b> and killing much of the local population. After reaching an alluvial fan, the mudflow split into two branches. The larger portion of it joined the Lagunillas River and flowed into the nearby Magdalena River, while the smaller portion was diverted by hills in front of Lagunillas Canyon, turned 90degrees to the north until it reached the Sabandija River, and then flowed east with the Sabandija River, until it rejoined the other branch of the mudflow at the junction of the Sabandija and the Magdalena. It is estimated that 1000people were killed in the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower portion}} of the river, from the sea to Ford, was navigable in the {{eleventh}} century {{at the time of}} the Norman conquest. In the sixteenth century, Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel built wharves at Ford, and improved the <b>river</b> <b>channel</b> below there, so that the town became a port. Over the 30 years from 1544, he also improved the river as far upstream as Pallingham Quay. Although the work involved a number of flash locks, which were not very successful, no tolls were charged for its use, and vessels of around 15 tons were used to carry timber. Attempts to make the river navigable up to Newbridge in the early sixteenth century were not successful.|$|E
5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the <b>river</b> <b>channel</b> network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface drainage network and the internal karst drainage system. Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground drainage system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{assessments}} of soil loss from cultivated land and sediment redistribution along pathways from cultivated fields to <b>river</b> <b>channels</b> have been undertaken using {{a range of}} different methods and techniques, including erosion models, detailed studies of sediment redistribution in representative catchments, monitoring of gully head retreat and evaluation of sediment deposition in ponds and small reservoirs. Most of the sediment eroded from arable land is deposited between the lower portions of the cultivated slopes and the <b>river</b> <b>channels.</b> Less than 15 % of the eroded sediment is delivered to the <b>river</b> <b>channels.</b> Sediment redistribution rates in the upper parts of the fluvial system have declined during the last 25 years in both the western and eastern parts of the Russian Plain, because of a major reduction of surface runoff during snowmelt and a reduction of the {{area of arable land}} {{in some parts of the}} study area...|$|R

5|$|All of the localities that Eolambia were {{discovered}} in belong to the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Predominant rocks in the Mussentuchit consist of interleaved light gray to gray layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone. Deposits representing two separate <b>river</b> <b>channel</b> systems are also present in the Mussentuchit. The lower of these systems consists of four layers, respectively of muddy sandstone, fine-grained sandstone, silty mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone, with the latter two layers bearing plant debris. The Cifelli #2 Quarry is associated with this system. The upper system consists of greenish fine-grained sandstone. Three layers of bentonite clay layers, representing volcanic ash deposits, are also present in the Mussentuchit, being respectively whitish-gray, yellow, and tan in color. The middle of these layers cuts through the Cifelli #2 Quarry. Bentonite is also present within the sandstone itself throughout the Mussentuchit. In the Cifelli #2 quarry, the bones themselves are blackened, having been replaced by calcite, quartz, pyrite, and carbonate-hydroxyapatite.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{navigation}} ceased to operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock remained in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the main <b>river</b> <b>channel</b> just above {{the start of the}} first cut. Most of the bridges over {{the navigation}} were owned by the navigation, and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the navigation was insolvent, and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett agreed that the navigation would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, but at this point it was agreed that the navigation had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} on the Santa Ana River for at least 9,000 years. In the period {{immediately}} before and during European colonization, there were four distinct indigenous groups in the area. The river was first seen by Europeans in 1769, when it received its name {{from members of the}} Spanish Portola expedition. Because {{it was one of the}} only reliable sources of water in a wide region, many large ranchos developed along the river and one of its major tributaries, Santiago Creek. After the area became part of the United States, the economy transitioned to agriculture, before urbanizing in the 20th century. Many cities established during this time including Santa Ana, Riverside and Anaheim derived their names from the river. In order to protect urban areas from the river's flood threat, major channelization and damming projects were undertaken in the 20th century, resulting in the loss of much of the natural <b>river</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E

40|$|Channelization {{includes}} {{those methods}} of engineering (resectioning, straightening, construction of levees, diversions, etc.) that modify existing <b>river</b> <b>channels</b> or create new channels, often changing {{the relationship between}} <b>river</b> <b>channels</b> and floodplains. The most common purposes of channelization are flood control, land drainage improvement, creation of new spaces for urbanization or agriculture, maintenance or improvement of navigation, and reduction of bank erosion. Channelization is carried out both on very large rivers and small streams; it is widespread in lowland rivers, but also many upland (mountain) rivers have experienced this type of human intervention...|$|R
50|$|Water {{entering}} the lake, unlike in more easterly playas of the Australian arid zone, {{does not come}} from well-defined <b>river</b> <b>channels</b> since the soils of the region are so weathered - lacking tectonic or glacial activity since the Carboniferous ice ages - that sediment is completely absent and the terrain so flat that only the most unweatherable rocks remain on the surface and well-defined <b>river</b> <b>channels</b> cannot form, especially since the extreme age of the soils and consequent high rooting density of native flora limits runoff to an extreme extent.|$|R
5|$|The canal then looped {{around the}} {{northern}} edge of Horse Marsh to reach West Deeping, where there was another lock. There are visible remains of this lock, indicating that it had stone piers at both ends to support the gates, with turf sides between them. It then crossed King Street. An enclosure map dating from 1810 shows that the road crossed the canal by a ford, but that there was also a footbridge to allow pedestrians to cross the canal without getting wet. From West Deeping to Market Deeping, the canal was close to the northern bank of the northern <b>river</b> <b>channel.</b> There were two more locks in open countryside, and another at {{the western edge of the}} town, after which the cut rejoined the river. The final two locks were built on the River Welland, Briggins Lock in Deeping St James, and Low Lock to the south-east of the village.|$|E
5|$|The {{navigation}} then {{passes to}} the east of Southampton Airport, while further east is the <b>river</b> <b>channel</b> and the Itchen Valley Country Park. Between the two waterways is Decoy Covert, a small wood which contained a duck decoy. The lock nearby is called Decoy Pond Lock, below which is Sandy Lock. There is little water in this section, since its main supply has been cut off, and although there are springs along this section, the channel is periodically blocked where occupation bridges have been replaced by earth embankments. Sandy Lock has much barbed wire in it, possibly dumped when the wartime defences of the airport were dismantled. The final lock on this section is Mans Bridge Lock, shortly after the modern crossing by the M27 motorway. The cut then rejoins the main river, and passes under the A27 road. The current bridge was constructed in 1975, and replaced a bailey bridge erected during the Second World War. Just below it is a single arched stone bridge dating from the early nineteenth century, which was the original course of the road. It has been restored and is used as a footbridge.|$|E
5|$|Downriver of the Hells Canyon is the Lower Snake River Project, {{authorized}} by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945, which {{was created by the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a navigable channel on the Snake River from its mouth to the beginning of Hells Canyon. These dams are, in downstream order: Lower Granite Lock and Dam, Little Goose Lock and Dam, Lower Monumental Lock and Dam, and Ice Harbor Lock and Dam. Dredging work was also done throughout the length of the navigation channel to facilitate ship passage. These dams form a cascade of reservoirs with no stretches of free-flowing river in between. Immediately below Ice Harbor Dam is Lake Wallula, formed by the construction of the McNary Dam on the Columbia River. (McNary Dam {{is not part of the}} Lower Snake River Project.) Above Lower Granite Dam, the <b>river</b> <b>channel</b> from Lewiston to Johnson Bar, just below Hells Canyon, is also maintained for jet-boats as this section is too rugged for ships. These dams have been proposed for removal, and if they were to be removed, it would be the largest dam removal project ever undertaken in the United States. The removal has been proposed on the grounds that it would restore salmon runs to the lower Snake River and the Clearwater River and other smaller tributaries. Idaho's Snake river once teemed with sockeye salmon. However, there are almost no wild sockeye salmon left in the river due to a number of factors.|$|E

Specifically, as flow moves around a bend it spirals in the opposite direction in the deep sea compared to the spiral found in <b>river</b> <b>channels</b> on land. This is important in understanding the sedimentology and layers of sediment deposited by these systems.|$|R
5|$|Prime Minister of Bangladesh Khaleda Zia urged senior {{officials}} in Dhaka and coastal districts {{to prepare for}} the storm. Officials in Chittagong asked that all 24ships be moved out of the harbor and <b>river</b> <b>channel.</b> In coastal areas, thousands of Red Crescent volunteers reported for duty in order to assist vulnerable villages in preparation of the storm. Winds destroyed bamboo huts, uprooted trees, and disrupted road transport between towns and villages on the shore of the Bay of Bengal. Torrential rainfall in the area flooded dozens of villages, forcing thousands to evacuate. Heavy precipitation also lashed the capital city of Dhaka, inundating streets, which caused a shutdown of electricity and interrupting public transportation. One death was reported after a man drowned while attempting to cross a river in southern Bhola Island. Ten wooden trawlers carrying 150men sank near Cox's Bazar; only 11 of them were known to have survived. An additional eight fishing boats transporting 60people was reported missing off of Barisal Division. By November15, 47fishing vessels were still unaccounted for. A navy motor boat also sunk near Kutubdia, though its six crew members swam ashore. In the aftermath of the storm, the number of deaths in Bangladesh rose to 49.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{altitude}} in Grand Teton National Park impacts {{the types of}} plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line {{to the base of}} the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake <b>River</b> <b>channel</b> are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this ecotone, forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} of the {{restoration}} project will be the section from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul, which has been blocked by both the M5 motorway and the A38 road. A bid was submitted to the Living Landmarks Fund in August 2006. This is part of the Big Lottery Fund, and £16 million was requested. An interim award of £250,000 was made, to allow the bid to be developed, but the application was rejected in November 2007. Despite this setback, money for purchasing the land around the M5 and the A38 was part of the phase 1 grant by the HLF. Current proposals for the A38 involve tunnelling under the Whitminster roundabout. The original Bristol Road Lock was buried by the construction of the roundabout, and will be reconstructed to the east of it. There are two proposals for passing under the M5 motorway. One is for a new channel alongside the River Frome through an existing culvert, and the other is for a new wider culvert, nearer to the original line of the canal. Below this, the canal used to cross the River Frome at Lockham Aqueduct, but this was demolished in the 1970s, when the canal and <b>river</b> <b>channel</b> were combined as part of a flood defence scheme.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{emissions}} {{to the atmosphere}} from inland waters are globally significant and mainly occur at tropical latitudes. However, processes controlling the intensity of CO 2 and CH 4 emissions from tropical inland waters remain poorly understood. Here, we report a data-set of concurrent measurements of the partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2) and dissolved CH 4 concentrations in the Amazon (n = 136) and the Congo (n = 280) Rivers. The pCO 2 values in the Amazon mainstem {{were significantly higher than}} in the Congo, contrasting with CH 4 concentrations that were higher in the Congo than in the Amazon.
