On 1 October 2003, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced plans to create more IITs [...] "by upgrading existing academic institutions that have the necessary promise and potential". Subsequent developments led to the formation of the S K Joshi Committee in November 2003 to guide the selection of the five institutions which would become the five new IITs. Based on the initial recommendations of the Sarkar Committee, it was decided that further IITs should be spread throughout the country. When the government expressed its willingness to correct this <b>regional</b> <b>imbalance,</b> 16 states demanded IITs. Since the S K Joshi Committee prescribed strict guidelines for institutions aspiring to be IITs, only seven colleges were selected for final consideration. Plans are also reported to open IITs outside India, though not enough progress has been made in this regard. Eventually in the 11th Five year plan, eight states were identified for establishment of new IITs and IT-BHU was converted into an IIT.|$|E

Thus, Germany still has a big strategic challenge to reduce its <b>regional</b> <b>imbalances</b> in all scales of their national territory...|$|R

50|$|Maternal {{mortality}} rates in Senegal remain high relative {{to those of}} more developed countries. In 2008, the World Health Organization estimated a maternal mortality rate of 450 deaths per 100,000 live births in Senegal. Maternal deaths are typically clustered around labor, delivery, and the immediate postpartum period. One of the most prevalent issues is the <b>regional</b> <b>imbalance</b> {{in the distribution of}} health personnel and health indicators, with a disproportionate burden of disease in Eastern Senegal. Expanding coverage of healthcare workers present at birth, in particular midwifery care, can lessen delays, thus minimizing the risk of severe complications and even death. Increased numbers of health workers in a given region is associated with improved outcomes in maternal mortality. Additionally, extreme conservative practices and fundamentalism can limit dispersal of health personnel, especially that of midwives and other female health workers.|$|E
