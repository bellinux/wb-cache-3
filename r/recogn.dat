A few research efforts have explored intermediate levels of representation that give more than simply structure but demand less than full numbers. Wellman [38] defines qualitative influences among random variables in terms of stochastic dominance of their distribution functions, and defines a qualitative version of synergy and anti-synergy among joint influences on a variable. Because these definitions capture only the direction of influence, not its magnitude, the resulting models are clearly not useful to resolve detailed tradeoffs among competing decision policies.
