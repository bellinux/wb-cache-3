5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> to make clinical assessments and new <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E

This case describes, for example, a money manager being evaluated {{relative to a}} risky benchmark index rather than a fixed target return level.

5|$|Mechner's main preoccupation {{for this}} new storyline was keeping the {{narrative}} simple and engaging, using his preferred writing style of keeping cutscenes short and working {{as much of the}} story as possible into the gameplay. He also aimed to mix narrative and gameplay genres that might normally clash with one-another. The three main characters he created were the hero (the Prince), the villain (the Vizier) and the love interest and sidekick (Farah). Two non-playable authority figures (the Prince's father Shahraman and the Sultan of Azad) were included to add weight to the Prince's burden as they were transformed into monsters by the Sands. The three artefacts each character used (the Dagger, Farah's medallion and the Vizier's staff) were created to explain their survival of the Sands' release, with the Dagger also becoming integral to gameplay. The Prince's narration was both difficult and satisfying for Mechner. It needed to be written to work on two levels: first to be understandable for first-time players, and to gain greater significance upon future playthroughs. The narration also served to give gentle hints to the player, and expand upon the setting and add depth to the experience. Among his cited <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> for the narration were the 1940s version of The Thief of Bagdad, the works of Edgar Allan Poe, and films such as Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. The Prince's interactions with Farah were also an important factor. As part of the character interaction, Farah was deliberately designed not to be a perfect archer, sometimes hitting the Prince if he strayed into her line of fire. Despite this, unspecified features planned for her needed to be cut.|$|E

40|$|Operations {{research}} applications often pose multicriteria problems. Mathematical {{research on}} multicriteria problems predominantly {{revolves around the}} set of Pareto optimal solutions, while in practice, methods that output a single solution are more widespread. In real-world multicriteria optimization, <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> methods are widely used and successful examples of such methods. A <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> solution is the solution closest to a given <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> in the objective space. We study the approximation of <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> solutions. In particular, we establish that approximating <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> solutions is polynomially equivalent to approximating the Pareto set. Complementing these results, we show {{for a number of}} general algorithmic techniques in single criteria optimization how they can be lifted to <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> optimization. In particular, we lift the link between dynamic programming and FPTAS, as well as oblivious LP-rounding techniques. The latter applies, e. g., to Set Cover and several machine scheduling problems.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> adaptation {{in the analysis of}} the disposition effect. We consider two exogenous factors pertinent to <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> adaptation: prior outcome and recent expectation of future outcome. We show that the incidence of the disposition effect varies {{in a manner consistent with}} <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> adaptation. Both prior outcome and recent expectation of future outcome affect the location of the <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> and have a large and significant impact on the incidence of the disposition effect. First, the disposition effect can largely be explained by investors’ inability to sufficiently adapt the <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> in response to large capital losses. Second, a negative expectation of future outcome, due to recent unfavorable information and highly speculative investments, accelerates <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> adaptation to price depreciation and dramatically increases loss realization. These effects are economically sizeable and are robust to plausible heterogeneity concerns and alternative explanations such as a belief in mean-reversion and managerial incentives...|$|R
