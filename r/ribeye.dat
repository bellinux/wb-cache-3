25|$|In {{correspondence}} to its activity, ribbon synapses can have synaptic ribbons that vary in size. In mouse photoreceptor synapses when the neurotransmitter release rate {{is high and}} exocytosis is high, the synaptic ribbons are long. When neurotransmitter release rate is low and exocytosis is low, the synaptic ribbons are short. A current hypothesis is that synaptic ribbons can enlarge {{by the addition of}} more <b>RIBEYE</b> subunit.|$|E
25|$|Several {{proteins}} of the synaptic ribbon {{have also}} {{been found to be}} associated with conventional synapses. RIM (Rab3-interacting proteins) is a GTPase expressed on synaptic vesicles that is important in priming synaptic vesicles. Immunostaining has revealed the presence of KIF3A, a component of the kinesin II motor complex whose function is still unknown. The presynaptic cytomatrix proteins Bassoon and Piccolo are both expressed at photoreceptor ribbons, but Piccolo is only expressed at retinal bipolar synaptic ribbons. Bassoon is responsible for attaching itself {{to the base of the}} synaptic ribbons and subsequently anchoring the synaptic ribbons. The function of Piccolo is unknown. Also important is the filaments that tether the vesicles to the ribbon synapse. These are shed during high rates of exocytosis. The only unique protein associated with the synaptic ribbon is <b>RIBEYE,</b> first identified in purified synaptic ribbon from bovine retina. It is found to be a part of all vertebrate synaptic ribbons in ribbon synapses and is the central portion of ribbon synapses. <b>RIBEYE</b> interactions are required to form a scaffold formation protein of the synaptic ribbon.|$|E

50|$|Beef {{alternative}} merchandising, sometimes shortened to BAM, is {{a method}} of fabricating sirloins, strip loins, and <b>ribeyes</b> into smaller cuts of meat created by the beef checkoff. The system was designed to appeal to consumers {{who are concerned about}} the portion sizes of these three cuts by dividing them into smaller steaks based on the individual muscles that compose the larger steaks. These cuts have an added bonus of reducing the cost of the meat for the consumer while simultaneously increading profits for the butcher.|$|R
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{to determine the}} use of blade tenderizers in beef fabrication facilities was sent to 241 members of the North American Meat Processors Association (NAMP). Eighty-four percent of the 90 respondents used blade tenderizers. These subprimals were at least sometimes tenderized by the following percentages of respondents: tenderloins, 7. 9; chuck cuts, 18; round cuts, 36; <b>ribeyes,</b> 38; strip loins, 56; and top sirloin butts, 62. If a processor blade-tenderized a particular cut, they tenderized a majority of their production for that cut, generally with multiple passes through the tenderizer. For example, the 62 % of respondents who tenderized top sirloin butts tenderized 87 % of their production of that cut {{with an average of}} 1. 6 passes. Cuts were aged by 70. 7 % of respondents that used blade tenderizers. The average aging period was 20 days, and the range was 7 to 60 days. Our respondents fabricated 75. 1 % of their beef products for the hotel/restaurant industry, 13. 3 % for retail, and 6. 0 % for other markets such as export or warehouse distributors. Blade tenderization is used widely by NAMP members, most often on <b>ribeyes,</b> strip loins, and top sirloin butts, and often combined with aging...|$|R

2500|$|A cheesesteak, or a Philly cheesesteak, is a long, crusty roll {{filled with}} thinly sliced sautéed <b>ribeye</b> beef and melted cheese. Generally, the cheese {{of choice is}} Cheez Whiz, but American and {{provolone}} are common substitutions. The art of cheesesteak preparation lies {{in the balance of}} flavors, textures and what {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "drip" [...] factor. Other toppings may include fried onions, sautéed mushrooms, ketchup and hot or sweet peppers. The cheesesteak was invented in 1930 by Philadelphian hot dog vendor Pat Olivieri who one day decided to substitute beef instead of a hot dog in a hoagie bun. A taxicab driver noticed the alluring aroma and asked for his own sandwich. Through word of mouth, Olivieri's sandwiches the following day were highly sought after by taxi cab drivers around Philadelphia. Due to booming business, Olivieri soon opened up his own shop, Pat's King of Steaks on 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue. Eventually, according to legend, he added cheese to the steak. The cheesesteak is considered to be a cultural icon of the city of Philadelphia.|$|E

40|$|Implanting young bulls with Compudose® {{three times}} {{from birth to}} {{slaughter}} resulted in performance {{similar to that of}} nonimplanted bulls, but decreased masculinity development. Implanted bulls tended to have higher marbling scores, more tender meat, more youthful carcasses, and lighter lean color than nonimplanted bulls. Although both implanted and nonimplanted bulls were more efficient and gained faster in the feedlot than implanted steers, the steers showed very little carcass masculinity and had finer-textured lean. Implanted steers had more youthful carcasses and lower Warner-Bratzler shear values than nonimplanted bulls. However, nonimplanted bulls grew faster, were more efficient, had larger <b>ribeyes</b> and lower yield grade numbers than implanted steers. For large-framed cattle, castration and implanting with Compudose® near birth result in the most desirable combination of performance, carcass, and meat quality traits...|$|R
40|$|One hundred sixty one steers were {{finished}} {{in a total}} confinement deep-bedded system at the Armstrong Research Farm, Lewis, IA during 2008. The three treatment groups were implanted with Synovex-Choice 112, 82 and 56 days prior to harvest. The implant resulted in an immediate and significant improvement in average daily gain. In the weigh period immediately after receiving the implant average daily gains increased from. 72 to 1. 35 lb/day compared to treatment groups or group {{that had not yet}} received their implant. The overall average daily gain of steers implanted 112 days (3. 76 lb/day) and 82 days (3. 70 lb/day) prior to harvest was significantly more than steers implanted 56 days (3. 44 lb/day) prior to harvest.

Why is the {{international market}} important to beef producers? There are several examples that demonstrate the importance of the export market to U. S. beef producers. U. S. beef exports represented 13 % of production in 2000. This is equivalent to 2. 7 billion pounds. 2000 was also the first year the U. S. became the largest beef and beef variety meat exporting country in the world, surpassing Australia. Without the export market the domestic market would have to absorb this product into our marketing channels. There is a perception that the export market is primarily an outlet for U. S. middle meats, which could be easily consumed domestically. This perception is false. The export market is an outlet for beef products that are not readily consumed in the U. S. When dividing the carcass into rounds and chucks, middle meats, thin meats (briskets, short plate, short ribs and flanks), and variety meats, thin meats and variety meats make up the largest exports by volume, 31 % each.
