2500|$|If {{the load}} is purely reactive, then the {{voltage and current}} are 90degrees out of phase. For two {{quarters}} of each cycle, the product of voltage and current is positive, but for the other two quarters, the product is negative, indicating that on average, exactly as much energy flows into the load as flows back out. [...] There is no net energy flow over each half cycle. In this case, only reactive power flows: There is no net transfer of energy to the load, however, electrical power does flow along the wires and returns by flowing in reverse along the same wires. During its travels both from the power source to the <b>reactive</b> <b>load</b> {{and back to the}} power source, this purely reactive power flow loses energy in the line resistance.|$|E

Chopping <b>reactive</b> <b>load</b> into the circuit in this manner injects undesirable odd-order harmonics and so banks of high-power filters are usually provided to smooth the waveform. Since the filters themselves are capacitive, they also export MVARs to the power system.|$|E

50|$|The commutating dv/dt rating applies when a TRIAC {{has been}} {{conducting}} and attempts to turn off with a partially <b>reactive</b> <b>load,</b> such as an inductor. The current and voltage are out of phase, so when the current decreases below the holding value, the TRIAC attempts to turn off, {{but because of the}} phase shift between current and voltage, a sudden voltage step takes place between the two main terminals, which turns the device on again.|$|E
50|$|Some devices, {{including}} uninterruptible {{power supplies}} (UPSs), have ratings both for maximum volt-amperes and maximum watts. The VA rating {{is limited by}} the maximum permissible current, and the watt rating by the power-handling capacity of the device. When a UPS powers equipment which presents a <b>reactive</b> <b>load</b> with a low power factor, neither limit may safely be exceeded. For example, a (large) UPS system rated to deliver 400,000 volt-amperes at 220 volts can deliver a current of 1818 amperes.|$|E
5000|$|Initially during startup of a vibrator, some {{force is}} {{necessary}} to lift and lower the entire load mass of the system. When the vibrator tunes to the resonant frequency of the system, the <b>reactive</b> <b>load</b> impedance cancels out to zero {{by virtue of the}} inductance reactance (mass of the system) equaling the compliance or stiffness reactance (elasticity of the tubular). The remaining impedance of the system, known as the resistive load impedance, is what is retaining the stuck pipe.|$|E

In a fan-out RF power distribution system, feeding multiple accelerating cavities with a single RF power generator {{can be accomplished by}} adjusting phase delays between the <b>load</b> cavities and <b>reactive</b> <b>loads</b> at the cavity inputs for independent control of cavity RF voltage vectors.

5000|$|In {{transmission}} applications, the SVC is used {{to regulate}} the grid voltage. If the power system's <b>reactive</b> <b>load</b> is capacitive (leading), the SVC will use thyristor controlled reactors to consume VARs from the system, lowering the system voltage. Under inductive (lagging) conditions, the capacitor banks are automatically switched in, thus providing a higher system voltage. By connecting the thyristor-controlled reactor, which is continuously variable, along with a capacitor bank step, {{the net result is}} continuously variable leading or lagging power.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 2014, the Power Station is an {{innovative}} product design which couples an adjustable <b>reactive</b> <b>load</b> with an internal 50W, 6L6 power amplifier.

5000|$|Not all {{generating}} {{plants are}} suitable for black-start capability. Wind turbines are not suitable for black start because wind may not be available when needed. Wind turbines, mini-hydro, or micro-hydro plants, are often connected to induction generators which are incapable of providing power to re-energize the network. The black-start unit must also be stable when operated with the large <b>reactive</b> <b>load</b> of a long transmission line. Many high-voltage direct current converter stations cannot operate into a [...] "dead" [...] system, either, since they require commutation power from the system at the load end. A PWM-based (voltage-source converter) HVDC scheme has no such restriction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Various {{communication}} systems require single radiating element operating in wide band. In this paper, a novel active integrated single microstrip antenna is proposed and its radiation pattern and gain performance is optimized with analysis. The <b>reactive</b> <b>loading</b> {{is provided by}} a negative capacitor section embedded within the patch. The active negative capacitor is made of a field-effect transistor that exhibits negative resistance as well as capacitance. It can, therefore, compensate the loss of an inductor. A microstrip patch operating at 10. 5 GHz having 12. 2 % bandwidth has been utilized as a reference antenna. With the proposed antenna design, the antenna radiation pattern can be as large as about 1. 5 times that of an antenna without <b>reactive</b> <b>loading.</b> In addition, {{it has been shown}} that active compensation significantly improves the matching level. 1...|$|R
50|$|TRIACs {{may also}} fail {{to turn on}} {{reliably}} with <b>reactive</b> <b>loads</b> if the current phase shift causes the main circuit current to be below the holding current at trigger time.

50|$|In 2002, a {{different}} class of negative refractive index (NRI) metamaterials was introduced that employs periodic <b>reactive</b> <b>loading</b> of a 2-D transmission line {{as the host}} medium.

50|$|The {{negative}} resistance oscillator model {{is not limited}} to one-port devices like diodes but can also be applied to feedback oscillator circuits with two port devices such as transistors and tubes. In addition, in modern high frequency oscillators, transistors are increasingly used as one-port {{negative resistance}} devices like diodes. At microwave frequencies, transistors with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable due to internal feedback and show negative resistance at the other port. So high frequency transistor oscillators are designed by applying a <b>reactive</b> <b>load</b> to one port to give the transistor negative resistance, and connecting the other port across a resonator to make a negative resistance oscillator as described below.|$|E

This reactance cancels the reactive component of the antenna input impedance causing the input impedance to appear resistive at the feed point. This leads to outstanding linearity and bandwidth up to and possibly exceeding plus or minus 16 kHz, sometimes exceeding plus and minus 20 kHz. The antenna is particularly useful for AM broadcasting of high quality music with response capable of being better than that of FM.

5000|$|Loudspeakers {{present a}} <b>reactive</b> <b>load</b> to an {{amplifier}} (capacitance, inductance and resistance). This impedance may vary in value with signal frequency and amplitude. This variable loading affects the amplifier's performance both because the amplifier has nonzero output impedance (it cannot keep its output voltage perfectly constant when the speaker load varies) {{and because the}} phase of the speaker load can change the stability margin of the amplifier. The influence of the speaker impedance is different between tube amplifiers and transistor amplifiers. The reason is that tube amplifiers normally use output transformers, and cannot use much negative feedback due to phase problems in transformer circuits. Notable exceptions are various [...] "OTL" [...] (output-transformerless) tube amplifiers, pioneered by Julius Futterman in the 1950s, or somewhat rarer tube amplifiers that replace the impedance matching transformer with additional (often, though not necessarily, transistorized) circuitry in order to eliminate parasitics and musically unrelated magnetic distortions. In addition to that, many solid-state amplifiers, designed specifically to amplify electric instruments such as guitars or bass guitars, employ current feedback circuitry. This circuitry increases the amplifier's output impedance, resulting in response {{similar to that of}} tube amplifiers.|$|E

[...] School of Computing and Engineering and Department of Physics and Astronomy. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 Ultra wide band is rapidly advancing {{as a high}} data rate wireless communication technology. As {{is the case in}} conventional wireless communication systems, an antenna also plays a very crucial role in UWB systems. However, there are more challenges in designing a UWB antenna than a narrow band one. A suitable UWB antenna should be capable of operating over an ultra-wide bandwidth as allocated by the FCC. At the same time, satisfactory radiation properties over the entire frequency range are also necessary. This thesis focuses on UWB antenna design and analysis. Studies have been undertaken covering the areas of UWB fundamentals and antenna theory. In recent years, the U-slot patch antenna established itself as a versatile, low profile and cost effective antenna that can be fine tuned for ultra-wideband operations. The main objective of this thesis is to propose an effective practical design procedure to design U-Slot antenna and provide physical insight into the design using full wave analysis methods. This research work focuses on developing a novel scheme to design wideband U-Slot antenna. To validate the design technique antenna is fabricated and measured results are compared with the simulated to assess the performance. In this dissertation, effect of <b>reactive</b> <b>loading</b> on probe fed, single layer, U-Slot loaded microstrip antenna is investigated using Theory of Characteristic Modes (TCM). Detailed analysis of <b>reactive</b> <b>loading</b> due to feed location and arm-angle variation is presented.
