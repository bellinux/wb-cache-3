50|$|Expression of let-7 {{members is}} {{controlled}} by MYC binding to their promoters. The levels of let-7 {{have been reported to}} decrease in models of MYC-mediated tumorigenesis, and to increase when MYC is inhibited by chemicals. In a twist, there are let-7-binding sites in MYC 3' untranslated region(UTR) according to bioinformatic analysis, and let-7 overexpression in cell culture decreased MYC mRNA levels. Therefore, there is a double-negative feedback loop between MYC and let-7. Furthermore, let-7 could lead to IMP1(/insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein) depletion, which destabilizes MYC mRNA, thus forming an indirect <b>regulatory</b> <b>pathway.</b>|$|E
50|$|FOXP3 (forkhead box P3), {{also known}} as scurfin, is a protein {{involved}} in immune system responses. A member of the FOX protein family, FOXP3 appears {{to function as a}} master regulator of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>pathway</b> in the development and function of regulatory T cells. Regulatory T cells generally turn the immune response down. In cancer, an excess of regulatory T cell activity can prevent the immune system from destroying cancer cells. In autoimmune disease, a deficiency of regulatory T cell activity can allow other autoimmune cells to attack the body's own tissues.|$|E

40|$|Results: In {{this work}} we {{performed}} a meta-analysis on four microarray and four datasets of gene expression data on OSCC in order to evaluate the degree of agreement of the biological results obtained by these different studies and to identify common <b>regulatory</b> <b>pathways</b> that could be responsible of tumor growth. Sixteen dys-regulated pathways implicated in OSCC were mined out from the four published datasets, and most importantly three pathways were first reported. Those <b>regulatory</b> <b>pathways</b> and biological processes which are significantly enriched have been investigated by means of literatures and meanwhile, four genes of the maximally altered pathways, ECM-receptor interaction, were validated and identified by qRT-PCR as a possible candidate of aggressiveness of OSCC. |$|R
40|$|Plants are sessile {{organisms and}} so they cannot escape changes in {{environmental}} conditions. In order to optimize seed production {{and to ensure that}} flowering occurs during the appropriate season, plants have evolved a complex of <b>regulatory</b> <b>pathways</b> to control when the floral transition takes place. One group of <b>regulatory</b> <b>pathways</b> involves enviromental factors like certain photoperiod or vernalization. The second group of <b>regulatory</b> <b>pathways</b> involves the state of development and is not sensitive to environmental cues, this pathway is called autonomous pathway and plants in this group do not require a particular photoperiod or vernalization, they are called day-neutral plants. The transition of these plants from vegetative to reproductive phase depends on combination of reaching certain minimal number of nodes, inhibition effect of roots, floral signals generated by leaves and activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Among early events of the transition of SAM to reproductive phase belongs an increase in the mitotic activities of the cells in SAM. Precise mechanisms of the action of the signals connected with transition of SAM to flowering have not been elucidated yet. The plants of day-neutral tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cv.

40|$|Tuberculosis {{remains a}} global {{pandemic}} and drives lung matrix destruction to transmit. Whilst pathways driving inflammatory responses in macrophages {{have been relatively}} well described, negative <b>regulatory</b> <b>pathways</b> are less well defined. We hypothesised that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) specifically targets negative <b>regulatory</b> <b>pathways</b> to augment immunopathology. Inhibition of signalling through the PI 3 K/AKT/mTORC 1 pathway increased matrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP- 1) gene expression and secretion, a collagenase central to TB pathogenesis, and multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. In patients with confirmed pulmonary TB, PI 3 Kδ expression was absent within granulomas. Furthermore, Mtb infection suppressed PI 3 Kδ gene expression in macrophages. Interestingly, inhibition of the MNK pathway, downstream of pro-inflammatory p 38 and ERK MAPKs, also increased MMP- 1 secretion, whilst suppressing secretion of TH 1 cytokines. Cross-talk between the PI 3 K and MNK pathways was demonstrated {{at the level of}} eIF 4 E phosphorylation. Mtb globally suppressed the MMP-inhibitory pathways in macrophages, reducing levels of mRNAs encoding PI 3 Kδ, mTORC- 1 and MNK- 1 via upregulation of miRNAs. Therefore, Mtb disrupts negative <b>regulatory</b> <b>pathways</b> at multiple levels in macrophages to drive a tissue-destructive phenotype that facilitates transmission...|$|R
