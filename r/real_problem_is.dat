25|$|PNAS has {{received}} occasional criticism for releasing papers to science journalists {{as much as}} a week before making them available to the general public; this practice is known as a news embargo. According to critics, this allows mainstream news outlets to misrepresent or exaggerate the implications of experimental findings before the scientific community is able to respond. Science writer Ed Yong, on the other hand, has argued that the <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> not embargoes themselves, but the press releases issued by research institutes and universities.|$|E
25|$|The <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{what this}} movie says about us. When those Abu Ghraib {{pictures}} came out years ago, {{at least half}} of America was horrified. The national consensus (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) was that this wasn't who we, as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty comes out, and it seems that that we've become so blunted to the horror of what we did and/or are doing at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and Bagram and other places that we can accept it, provided we get a boffo movie out of it.|$|E

The program is built upon {{the foundation of}} a FORTRAN program entitled Analysis of Supersonic Combustion Flow Fields With Embedded Subsonic Regions. The major improvements are described and a listing of the new program is provided. The subroutines and their functions are given as well as the input required for the program. Several applications of the program to <b>real</b> <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> qualitatively described. Three runs obtained in the investigation of a <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>are</b> presented to provide insight for the input and output of the program...|$|R

She and he had got into each other's lives to stay: the <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> the terms upon which they were to stay in each other's lives.

There are many other people with similar points of view such as Prof. , Harun Yahya and Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. Huston Smith, an author on comparative religion, argued that extremists have hijacked Islam, just as has occurred periodically in Christianity, Hinduism and other religions throughout history. He added that the <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that extremists do not know their own faith.|$|E
2500|$|Women in Morocco {{are often}} forced to endure daily {{harassment}} whenever {{they go out}} in public. Often the sexual harassment {{takes the form of}} name callings, such as [...] "whore". To fight this abusive misogynistic culture, a number of Moroccan women have stood up to their abusers. There is also a demand to uphold the law {{to ensure the safety of}} women, and to punish the abuser. Despite the fact that there is a law that protects women from abuse, the <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that there is no tangible intention to pursue apply it.|$|E
2500|$|Bill O'Reilly {{joined in}} the {{political}} fray over Harry Potter character Albus Dumbledore's outing by asking if {{it was part of}} a [...] "gay agenda" [...] to indoctrinate children. He called J. K. Rowling a [...] for telling fans about Dumbledore's sexuality after the books were written. His guest, Entertainment Weekly Senior Editor Tina Jordan, called his [...] "indoctrination" [...] claims [...] "a shallow argument", saying [...] "indoctrination is a very strong word" [...] because [...] "we all know gay people, whether we know it or not." [...] O'Reilly continued the following day saying that the <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> Rowling is teaching [...] "tolerance" [...] and [...] "parity for homosexuals with heterosexuals". His guest Dennis Miller said that tolerance was good and didn't think you could indoctrinate a child into being gay.|$|E

2500|$|In many jurisdictions, administrative/government {{health policy}} and {{practice}} has changed {{very little in the}} last decades. Cost-cutting is the priority, patient loads are uncontrolled, and nurses are rarely consulted when recommending health care reform. The major reason nurses plan to leave the field, as stated by the First Consulting Group, is because of working conditions. With the high turnover rate, the nursing field does not have a chance to build up the already frustrated staff. Aside from the deteriorating working conditions, the <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> [...] "nursing’s failure to be attractive to the younger generation." [...] There’s a decline in interest among college students to consider nursing as a probable career. More than half of currently working nurses [...] "would not recommend nursing to their own children" [...] and a little less than a quarter would advise others to avoid this as a profession altogether.|$|E

No individual can stand at their strongest and best while leaning upon some other. I believe with Browning and Ruskin that the development of personality is the goal of the race." ...|$|E

Not oracles who can see into the future for us. They don't see into the future. They only make statistical predictions--not prophecies. There's a big difference there, but Reinhart doesn't understand it. Reinhart and his kind have made such things as the SRB machines into gods. But I have no gods. At least, not any I can see." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{any such}} {{theories}} as these {{the belief in}} a moral Supreme Being is a very late (or a very early?) result of evolution, due to the action of advancing thought upon the original conception of ghosts. This opinion of Mr. Im Thurn's is, roughly stated, the usual theory of anthropologists. We wish, on the other hand, {{to show that the}} idea of God, as he is conceived of by our inquiring plain man, is shadowed forth (among contradictory fables) in the lowest-known grades of savagery, and therefore cannot arise from the later speculation of men, comparatively civilised and advanced, on the original datum of ghosts. We shall demonstrate, contrary to the opinion of Mr. Spencer, Mr. Huxley, and even Mr. Tylor, that the Supreme Being, and, in one case at least, the casual sprites of savage faith, are active moral influences. What is even more important, we shall make it undeniable that Anthropology has simplified her problem by neglecting or ignoring her facts. While the <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> to account for the evolution out of ghosts of the eternal, creative moral god of the 'plain man,' the germ of such a god or being in the creeds of the lowest savages is by anthropologists denied, or left out of sight, or accounted for by theories contradicted by facts, or, at best, is explained away as a result of European or Islamite influences. Now, as the problem is to account for the evolution of the highest conception of God, as far as that conception exists among the most backward races, the problem can never be solved while that highest conception of God is practically ignored.|$|E
