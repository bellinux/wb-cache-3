40|$|We have {{proposed}} and demonstrated a low numerical aperture technique {{to measure the}} depth of through silicon vias (TSVs) using white-light scanning interferometry. The high aspect ratio hole like TSV’s {{was considered to be}} impossible to measure using conventional optical methods due to low visibility {{at the bottom of the}} hole. We assumed that the limitation of the measurement was caused by <b>reflection</b> <b>attenuation</b> in TSVs. A novel interference theory which takes the structural <b>reflection</b> <b>attenuation</b> into consideration was proposed and simulated. As a result, we figured out that the low visibility in the interference signal was caused by the unbalanced light intensity between the object and the reference mirror. Unbalanced light can be balanced using an aperture at the illumination optics. As a result of simulation and experiment, we figured out that the interference signal can be enhanced using the proposed technique. With the proposed optics, the depth of TSVs having an aspect ratio of 11. 2 was measured in 5 seconds. The proposed method is expected to be an alternative method for 3 -D inspection of TSVs...|$|E

Drilling decisions to obtain technology economic value have increased downhole information {{quantity and quality}} requirements which stimulated greater bandwidth and higher data rate transmission demands. Accurate downhole information signal impairment suppression methods prior to signal decoding are compulsory for safety reasons. Sophisticated digital signal and noise processing are compulsory to improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performances.

Two such applications can be as a peda-gogical tool for enhanced perception of complex topics, or as an everyday aid that helps engineers interpret the out-come of simulations. In this paper we try to meet both these objectives and propose a novel approach to three-dimensionally visualize time-varying electromagnetic fields and show how this can be applied to improve the under-standing of propagating radio waves used in wireless com-munication networks. To obtain this, we use a numerical version of Maxwell’s equations to create snapshots of a propagating electromagnetic field. In this manner we are able to not only, intuitively get a better general understand-ing of radio waves, but also disclose important phenomena such as diffraction, <b>reflection,</b> <b>attenuation</b> and multipath be-havior. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{auditory}} behaviour of tethered locusts {{flying in}} a wind tunnel was investigated under controlled acoustic conditions. 1. <b>Reflection,</b> <b>attenuation</b> and diffraction of ultrasound evoked by the locust's physical presence caused pronounced distortions of the acoustic field. Interaural pressure variations were observed {{that account for}} directional hearing at high frequencies. 2. Sound field measurements indicated only a minor influence of flight posture or wing position on the interaural pressure gradient. 3. The locusts steered away from pulsed ultrasounds that simulated bat echolocation signals. The phonotactic response was measured as ruddering by the abdomen and hind legs, resulting in a yaw torque directed away from the sound source. Wingbeat frequency increased by 15 % in response to ultrasonic stimu-lation. This behaviour {{is considered to be}} analogous to the bat avoidance behaviour of flying crickets. 4. The avoidance response was observed for carrier frequencies higher than 10 kHz and for sound pressure levels (on average) higher than 45 dB SPL. Low-frequency stimuli (< 10 kHz) failed to elicit any phonotactic steering at any intensity used (up to 100 dB SPL). Because of its relatively low threshold of reaction, this steering behaviour is thought to be part of an early-warning system adapted to the acoustic detection of echolocating predators. 5. The avoidance response was suppressed when a 30 kHz (normally effective) tone was combined with a 5 kHz tone (which is ineffective alone). Two-tone suppression only occurred when the low-frequency component was 10 - 15 dB SPL higher than the high-frequency tone. The biological significance of two-tone suppression is discussed. 6. The intensity-response characteristics, the frequency sensitivity and the two-tone suppression of the avoidance behaviour are discussed with respect to the auditory physiology of Locusta migratoria. The involvement of some identified auditory ascending interneurones in the avoidance behaviour is considered...|$|E

This data was obtained with a new approach: using a vibrator to generate spatial waves on ice, Vibroseismics. one advantage is that more energy is transmitted into the subsurface with a deeper penetration than the typically used explosives in firn/ice covered areas.

5000|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{receiving}} the ultrasound waveform: <b>reflection</b> and <b>attenuation.</b> In <b>reflection</b> (or pulse-echo) mode, the transducer performs both the sending and the receiving of the pulsed waves as the [...] "sound" [...] is reflected {{back to the}} device. Reflected ultrasound comes from an interface, such as {{the back wall of}} the object or from an imperfection within the object. The diagnostic machine displays these results {{in the form of a}} signal with an amplitude representing the intensity of the reflection and the distance, representing the arrival time of the <b>reflection.</b> In <b>attenuation</b> (or through-transmission) mode, a transmitter sends ultrasound through one surface, and a separate receiver detects the amount that has reached it on another surface after traveling through the medium. Imperfections or other conditions in the space between the transmitter and receiver reduce the amount of sound transmitted, thus revealing their presence. Using the couplant increases the efficiency of the processby reducing the losses in the ultrasonic wave energy due to separation between the surfaces.|$|R

It has been established that the increasing frequency and filler content lead to an increase in the relative permittivity and tangent of dielectric loss angle.

40|$|The {{geological}} {{setting of}} the Central Adriatic Basin {{is characterized by the}} presence of several sedimentary features originated during the growing up of the Dinaric and Apennine Chains. The migration of these fronts towards the axis of the Adriatic Sea, determined the Plio-Quaternary clastic sequence (Channel et al., 1979). During the Lower Pliocene, the migration of the Apennine Chain produced the west-ward tilting of the Adriatic foreland, causing a sedimentary wedge and a thickness of sub-horizontal Pliocene deposits, covered by the Quaternary prograding sequence. These last are visible on the seismic profile ADRIA 95 located in the western portion of the Central Adriatic Basin. The profile was partially processed by Geletti et al.

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} wave absorption characteristics of composite cement-based building material have attracted {{much interest in}} recent times. Researchers have mainly focused on the 2 GHz to 12 GHz frequency range. Mobile and wireless communication systems use frequencies from 800 MHz upwards. The determination of characteristics such as <b>reflection</b> loss, absorption, <b>attenuation</b> and shielding effectiveness are crucial in the evaluation and development of these materials for the building industry. Absorption {{is an indication of}} how much of the EMW energy enters the material. Attenuation indicates how much of the absorbed energy is converted into other forms of energy by the material. Shielding effectiveness (SE) is a combination of <b>reflection</b> loss, <b>attenuation</b> and multiple internal <b>reflections</b> and <b>attenuations.</b> This research determined these characteristics by measuring the S 11 and S 21 parameters of the composite cement-based material in the GSM and WiFi frequency bands. The time domain gating function of a vector network analyser is applied to measure the reflection from the material. The data was then used to obtain the reflection and absorption losses in the frequency bands. The transmission loss was measured by placing the sample in the propagation path between two antennas. MnZn-ferrite and electrolytic manganese dioxide in powder form were evaluated as absorber material to increase the permeability of the cement-based material to improve absorption and attenuation capabilities to create a cost-effective practical {{electromagnetic wave}} absorber. The compound of the cement-based material was cement, sifted river sand and filler powder. The results achieved in the research showed the uniqueness of electrolytic manganese dioxide as filler in composite cement based material for electromagnetic wave shielding effectiveness improvement.
