Radiative corrections receive contributions from loop diagrams and from processes with the emission of additional photons. Some of the radiative events can be identified and removed from the event sample by experimental methods. However, a substantial contribution with soft or collinear photons {{can not be separated from}} non-radiative events. Thus, radiative effects have to be calculated theoretically and subtracted from measured cross sections. In this paper the FORTRAN codes HERACLES [1] and POLRAD [2] are applied for the cal [...] ...|$|R
