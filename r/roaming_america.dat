Jack Kerouac described 1940s hipsters as [...] "rising and <b>roaming</b> <b>America,</b> bumming and hitchhiking everywhere as characters of a special spirituality". Toward {{the beginning of his}} poem Howl, Allen Ginsberg mentioned [...] "angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night". In his essay [...] "The White Negro", Norman Mailer characterized hipsters as American existentialists, living a life surrounded by death—annihilated by atomic war or strangled by social conformity—and electing instead to [...] "divorce themselves from society, to exist without roots, to set out on that uncharted journey into the rebellious imperatives of the self".|$|E

We'd even heard old 1910 Daddy Hipsters of the streets speak the word that way, with a melancholy sneer. It never meant juvenile delinquents, it meant characters of a special spirituality who didn't gang up but were solitary Bartlebies staring out the dead wall window of our civilization...|$|E

5|$|For preschoolers, {{there was}} the {{educational}} television show Barney & Friends starting in 1992; their older siblings had the 1988 animated movie The Land Before Time and its increasing line of direct to video sequels (13 by 2016). Dinosaurs, a television sitcom, parodied humans and other television shows. Of particular note is Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, Jurassic Park, the popularity of {{which led to a}} series of films and other media. The first of these, Jurassic Park, married advanced CGI with advances in scientific knowledge of dinosaurs. Dinosaur was the most expensive movie in 2000, but was a box-office success. The falling cost of computer-generated effects also has recently allowed the increased production of documentaries for television; the award-winning 1999 BBC series Walking with Dinosaurs, the 2001 When Dinosaurs <b>Roamed</b> <b>America,</b> the 2009 Animal Armageddon, and the 2011 Planet Dinosaur are notable examples.|$|R

He has also worked in television animation, including for Discovery Channel's 2002 documentary film When Dinosaurs <b>Roamed</b> <b>America.</b> For models and other artwork outside of special effects, Trcic commonly consults with paleontologists in order to achieve a high standard of accuracy for his work. His sculpture has been compared to that of Brian Cooley, but with a [...] "somewhat more traditional" [...] style. He has provided dinosaur sculpture work for a variety of media and institutions, including IMAX, The University of Chicago, The National Geographic Society, Disney, and the Arizona Museum of Natural History, where his life-sized bronze Dilophosaurus sculpture is featured. His statue of the sauropod dinosaur Jobaria can be viewed at the Navy Pier of Chicago, Illinois.

50|$|Over the years, Stegosaurus {{has often}} been pitted in battle against large {{carnivorous}} dinosaurs, on both the big and small screen.

(1992), in the documentary When Dinosaurs <b>Roamed</b> <b>America</b> (2001), and in Jurassic Fight Club (2008) where it also faces Allosaurus. It faced Allosaurus in the first episode of the French animated series Once Upon a Time...

The Smithsonian project to build a working model of Q. northropi {{was the subject of}} the 1986 IMAX documentary On the Wing, shown at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.. In the BBC's 1999 documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, Quetzalcoatlus was erroneously shown as toothed piscivore with an inaccurate stub-like crest. In 2009, Dangerous Ltd.'s Clash of the Dinosaurs depicted it as having a number of fictional traits created by the producers to heighten entertainment value, including the ability to use ultraviolet vision to locate dinosaur urine when hunting in the air. Quetzalcoatlus was also erroneously depicted in the 2011 documentary March of the Dinosaurs as a clawless, bipedal scavenger. Conversely, in the 2009 series Animal Armageddon and the 2010 BBC film Flying Monsters 3D, Quetzalcoatlus was accurately portrayed with pycnofibres. However, in both Flying Monsters 3D and the 2001 documentary When Dinosaurs <b>Roamed</b> <b>America,</b> Quetzalcoatlus was shown as being a vulture-like scavenger. In the [...] "Return to Jurassic Park" [...] bonus feature of the 2011 Blu-ray release of the Jurassic Park film series, John R.

5000|$|Humans {{were almost}} {{exclusively}} {{accountable for the}} near-extinction of the American bison in the 1800s. At {{the beginning of the}} century, tens of millions of bison <b>roamed</b> North <b>America.</b> Humans slaughtered an estimated 50 million bison, not for sustenance but for sport, in a bid by the U.S. government to strip the Plains Indians of a vital component of their way of life. Railroads were advertising [...] "hunting by rail", where trains encountered large herds alongside or crossing the tracks. Men aboard fired from the trains roof or windows, leaving countless animals to rot where they died. The overhunting of the bison reduced their population to hundreds. Attempts to revive the American bison have been highly successful. Farming of bison has increased their population to nearly 150,000. The American bison is, therefore, no longer considered an endangered species. The extinction of four species of bison (B. antiquus, B. latifrons, B. occidentalis, and B. priscus) was due to natural selection (see section Evolution and genetic history).|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{is firmly}} {{rooted in the}} notion of wildness, of nature untrammeled by people. Organizations such as The Nature Conservancy or the Wildlife Conservation Society aim to protect “the last great places on earth ” or “the last of the wild. ” Such mottos {{emphasize}} the clear distinction between these places and those that bear the human footprint, and that few such places remain. Conservation has largely been about protecting those areas of essential wildness, where nature still rules and people are visitors who come and experience, to go away renewed and enriched. Two recent publications have brought the issue of “wildness ” and its place in the conservation agenda into sharp relief. In a paper in Nature, Josh Donlan and his colleagues (2005) have proposed “re-wilding ” parts of North America. Proxies for the large animals – camels, elephants, cheetahs, and lions – that once <b>roamed</b> North <b>America</b> but became extinct 13, 000 years ago would be introduced, restoring the ecological and evolutionary processes (and renewing a presumed balance of nature) that existed during the Pleistocene. Tim Flannery (1994) suggested a similar re-wilding of Australia, restoring ecological communities to the pre-Aboriginal state of 50, 000 (or more) years ago. Such re-wilding is ecological restoration at it...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 98 - 100) Members of {{a distinctive}} Gypsy culture {{are found in}} many parts of the contemporary world. Although their common Gypsy origin has been traced back over a thousand years to India, enough differences have evolved among Gypsies during their world-wide migrations to enable some scholars to identify Gypsy sub-culture. Nomad Gypsies have been distinguished among all Gypsies now living in the United States. Further distinctions have been made between different kinds of Nomads. Macvaya culture-bearers are Nomad fortune-telling specialists. They have been able to organize themselves and other Gypsies into complex socio-economic unions in many American cities. The appearance of these unions has coincided with the increasing impracticability of many traditional Nomad patterns of livelihood in the progressively urbanized and mechanized United States. It is possible that Nomad chiefdoms have evolved in American cities from decentralized nomadic bands that once <b>roamed</b> in rural <b>America.</b> Explicit territorial behavior is a phenomenon that can be associated with the growth of the urban Nomad chiefdom. The study indicates that the City of Los Angeles has been the terri??tory of a Nomad chiefdom. In Los Angeles a local economic union was operational for over thirty years, until 1964. Its eventual des??truction was a calculated effort by policemen seeking to enforce an anti-fortune-telling ordinance in the City. This ordinance attempts to protect from Gypsy fraud the superstitious aged, minority and low income persons that make up the fortune-teller's market. Notwithstanding police pressures, Nomad fortune-tellers continue to operate in the City indicating that fortune-telling, as an occupational trait-complex, is an integral part of the Macvaya Nomad culture system...|$|R
