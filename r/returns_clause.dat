Adopting a syntax tentatively close to XQuery/XPath (so as to allow an integration with XML or JSON based metadata retrieval), the for clause defines iterations over coverage objects; the where clause allows filtering of coverage combinations to be retained, and in the <b>return</b> <b>clause,</b> processing (including coverage fusion) of the coverages is specified, including {{an indication of the}} delivery format of the result.

Using inverted in-dexes on XML elements, holistic twig joins move a set of index cursors in a coordinated way to quickly ¯nd structural matches. Because each cursor move can trigger I/O, the performance of a holistic twig join is largely determined by how many cursor moves it makes, yet, surprisingly, existing join algorithms have not been optimized along these lines. In this paper, we describe TwigOptimal, a new holistic twig join algorithm with optimal cur-sor movement.

In {{mechanically}} drawn {{patterns of}} dress, Alhambra and common Moorish ornament, Greek mouldings, common flamboyant traceries, common Corinthian and Ionic capitals, and such other work, lines of this declared kind (generally to be classed under {{the head of}} [...] "doggerel ornamentation") {{may be seen in}} rich profusion; and they are necessarily the only kind of lines which can be felt or enjoyed by persons who have been educated without reference to natural forms; their instincts being blunt, and their eyes actually incapable of perceiving the inflexion of noble curves. But the moment the perceptions have been refined by reference to natural form, the eye requires perpetual variation and transgression of the formal law. Take the simplest possible condition of thirteenth-century scroll-work, Fig. 98. The law or cadence established is of a circling tendril, terminating in an ivy-leaf. In vulgar design, the curves of the circling tendril would have been similar to each other, and might have been drawn by a machine, or by some mathematical formula. But in good design all imitation by machinery is impossible. No curve is like another for an instant; no branch springs at an expected point. A cadence is observed, as in the <b>returning</b> <b>clauses</b> of a beautiful air in music; but every clause has its own change, its own surprises. The enclosing form is here stiff and (nearly) straight-sided, in order to oppose the circular scroll-work; but on looking close it will be found that each of its sides is a portion of an infinite curve, almost too delicate to be traced; except the short lowest one, which is made quite straight, to oppose the rest.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Static {{analyses}} of object-oriented programs usually rely on intermediate representations that respect the original semantics while having a more uniform and basic syntax. Most {{of the work}} involving object-oriented languages and abstract interpretation usually omits the description of that language or just refers to the Control Flow Graph (CFG) it represents. However, this lack of formalization on one hand results in an absence of assurances regarding the correctness of the transformation {{and on the other}} it typically strongly couples the analysis to the source language. In this work we present a framework for analysis of object-oriented languages in which in a first phase we transform the input program into a representation based on Horn clauses. This allows on one hand proving the transformation correct attending to a simple condition and on the other being able to apply an existing analyzer for (constraint) logic programming to automatically derive a safe approximation of the semantics of the original program. The approach is flexible {{in the sense that the}} first phase decouples the analyzer from most languagedependent features, and correct because the set of Horn <b>clauses</b> <b>returned</b> by the transformation phase safely approximates the standard semantics of the input program. The resulting analysis is also reasonably scalable due to the use of mature, modular (C) LP-based analyzers. The overall approach allows us to report results for medium-sized programs. ...|$|R

A ship is like a state or a kingdom where the nakhoda (sea captain) is the king. This power hierarchy follows successively downwards which partly described as the following:Another position which was just as important as that of the nakhoda was that of the malim (pilot). It is rather difficult to find a comparative designation on the land, because most of his functions were-maritime related. The position of malim is often compared to that of an imam (leader of prayer group) on a ship due to his sailing skills. He was the one who decides when to set sail because he is knowledgeable about the prevailing winds, storm prediction and waves, sandbanks and corals. Clearly, the malim {{was the first person to}} give advise to the nakhoda about each voyage. The function of the juru mudi, who was the nakhodas closest aide, was comparable to that of the bendahara (prime minister). The juru batu is said to have been the same status as the temenggung (chief of public security), this means that his role was to keep the peace on the ship and act as a judge in any dispute. This corresponds to an excerpt of Undang-Undang Laut Melaka, [...] "….to decide right and wrong". Undang-Undang Laut Melaka gives an example, a crewman (awak-awak) who refused to follow the orders of the tukang agong was punished by the juru batu by canning of up to seven strokes. Among other provisions in the clause are::*Rules and procedures for the crew on the duty of berkepang (guarding the ship). Four points are mentioned for the guard to pay attention to: water getting into the ship, incoming storms and wind, enemies boarding the ship, and fire outbreaks.:*Details on the duties of muda-muda; controlling the ships rudder, guarding the weapons, defending the ship in warfare. They also responsible as the personal guards to nakhoda in ports.:*Procedures for the crew who guarded the ships tupai (the main of access point between deck and hold).:*Procedures on supplies (food) for the awak-awak.:*It was established that the nakhoda was responsible for providing a loan to whoever required it. This is subject to certain procedures and processes, including the repayment terms and tax levied. For example, it is stated that the person who borrows is normally tied to an agreement for three years, three months, there days.Of the kiwis, or travelling merchants - in the 15th century Melaka, a system of commenda was well developed, whereby merchants would send goods in another mans ship, either in the care of some of his agents, travelling as kiwis, or entrusted to the nakhoda for a fixed <b>return.</b> The <b>clause</b> outlines the responsibilities of a kiwi especially in matters related to rental rates and rights to a petak (a partition for storing goods). The duties of the kiwi to look after the petak he rented and the time period allowed, are also mentioned in the clause [...] Penalties are specified for failure to fill up the rented petak within the stipulated period. A kiwi may join a ships voyage in several ways; firstly, by renting a petak, secondly, by assisting the nakhoda with a capital of three or four tahils of gold, or by making an agreement to give 3/10 of his sales to the nakhoda. Also mentioned in this clause are the responsibilities of the maula or penghulu kiwi (chief kiwi). The chief kiwi shall be entitled to half of the division of hold, in which the rice or provisions are stowed.|$|R
