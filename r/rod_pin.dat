Paynter, who patented the design) in response to Victorian Railways experiencing fatigue problems with conventional spoked wheels. Stronger Boxpok type 'B' wheels had been installed {{on a number of}} VR locomotive classes in the late 1940s, but they had the disadvantage of being relatively heavy and also restricted maintenance access to axleboxes, underslung springs, and in some cases boiler washout plugs. Boxpok wheels were proposed for the forthcoming Victorian Railways R class 4-6-4, which had a relatively heavy [...] axle load, but it had been discovered that the use of a Boxpok wheel would make coupling <b>rod</b> <b>pin</b> removal difficult. The SCOA-P wheel was developed to allow the strength of the Boxpok design but also provide the maintenance access of a conventional spoked wheel.|$|E

50|$|The 4.3L V6 has a 4.00-inch bore and a 3.48-inch stroke (101.6mm x 88.39mm), {{identical}} to the 350 cid Chevrolet V8 engine. To create a true even fire engine, Chevrolet produced a crankshaft with 30-degree offsets between each <b>rod</b> <b>pin.</b> Consequentially, rod journals were increased to a larger 2.25 inches. The connecting rods used on the 4.3L are therefore unique to this engine, being 5.7 inches in length, but having the larger 2.25-inch journals. The 4.3L also used larger valves than the 229 cid V6, with a 1.94-inch intake valve and a 1.50-inch exhaust valve (also shared with the 350).|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} the {{steering}} <b>rod</b> <b>pin</b> for research vehicles has been presented in the article. The aim of described research has been the estimation of values for the coefficient of friction between sphere surfaces of the stud and of its seat, for two cases of grease. A road test {{has been carried out}} to estimate the number of relative displacements of the surfaces of the pin and its seat, in the measuring length. The model of the pin - seat assembly has been elaborated using a finite elements method. The unit loading on the pin surface has been calculated in the model. Additionally, the scheme of the research stand for the measurement of friction moment, between mating spherical surfaces of pin and its seat, in reversing motion conditions has been presented. Research on friction moment values between surfaces of the pin and its seat {{have been made in the}} stand, for the case of pure lithium grease existence and for the case of lithium grease with the boron nitride additive. Based on calculated unit pressure loading the spherical surface of the pin and on values of measured friction moment, values of friction coefficient between mating surface of the pin and its seat have been estimated. It has been noted a nonlinear dependence of the friction coefficient against the slip speed and hysteresis phenomena. Dominika Trębac...|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "parallel synthesis" [...] {{method was}} {{developed}} by Mario Geysen and his colleagues for preparation of peptide arrays. They synthesized 96 peptides on plastic <b>rods</b> (<b>pins)</b> coated at their ends with the solid support. The pins were immersed into the solution of reagents placed in the wells of a microtiter plate. The method is widely applied particularly by using automatic parallel synthesizers. Although the parallel method is much slower than the real combinatorial one, its advantage {{is that it is}} exactly known which peptide or other compound forms on each pin.|$|R
5000|$|... 2002 {{and earlier}} engines {{featured}} a one-piece cast nodular iron crankshaft with counterweights present {{on either side}} of each crank pin. A crankshaft tone wheel was present between number 1 and number 2 connecting <b>rod</b> <b>pins,</b> and was machined such that a Hall-effect magnetic pickup mounted to the engine block could read the crankshaft's position as it rotates. 2003 and later engines switched to a two-piece crankshaft. The tone wheel was re-engineered to attach to the crankshaft using three bolts, had a tone pattern substantially different from previous engines, and was moved {{to the rear of the}} crankshaft. For this reason, these engines are generally not interchangeable between the 2002- and 2003+ model years.|$|R
50|$|The pick is {{a narrow}} <b>rod</b> or <b>pin</b> {{that can be}} used to clear the shank of debris, or to aerate tightly packed tobacco. Because it is sharp it may scratch the bowl of a pipe, and so should not be used for scraping.|$|R
5000|$|A likely {{candidate}} for {{an extreme example}} of compound articulated rod design could be the complex German 24-cylinder Junkers Jumo 222 aviation engine, meant to have — unlike an X-engine layout with 24 cylinders, possessing six cylinders per bank — only four cylinders per bank, and six banks of cylinders, all liquid-cooled with five [...] "slave" [...] <b>rods</b> <b>pinned</b> to one master rod, for each [...] "layer" [...] of cylinders in its design. After building nearly 300 test examples in several different displacements, the Junkers firm's complex Jumo 222 engine {{turned out to be}} a production failure for the more advanced combat aircraft of the Third Reich's Luftwaffe which required aviation powerplants of over 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) output apiece.|$|R
5000|$|Normally, the {{anchoring}} consists of round anchors on spherical bearings. If high axial compressive forces occur, flat tie <b>rods</b> with <b>pin</b> or universal joints are used. The {{magnitude of the}} lateral movement increases with the bending angle of both metal bellows and with {{the length of the}} intermediate pipe.|$|R
50|$|The pistons {{are made}} of light metal alloy and have three {{compression}} rings {{as well as one}} oil ring. They are connected to the crankshaft with I-shape connecting rods made of heat treatable steel. The bearings of the connecting rods {{are made of}} a lead bronze alloy and are fixed with a <b>pin.</b> Each connecting <b>rod</b> has a small oil pipe for the lubrication of it′s bearings. For weight reduction, the connecting <b>rod</b> <b>pins</b> are hollow-drilled. The crankshaft with hardened pins is supported in five bearings and is equipped with couter-weights to reduce crankshaft bearing wear. The covers of the crankshaft bearings are mounted with two pin screws each. The flywheel is flanged onto the crankshaft. On the opposite site of the crankshaft, it holds a friction- and vibration damper.|$|R

50|$|The {{royal blue}} of the Great Eastern livery, with its scarlet lining, was embellished with a copper chimney cap, and brass {{beadings}} round {{the rim of the}} safety valve casing, the front and side cab windows, {{the top and bottom of}} both cylinders of the Westinghouse brake compressor, the coupled wheel splashers, and the four openings that had been cut in subsidiary coupling rod splashers - in London and North Western Railway style - to give access to the coupling <b>rod</b> <b>pins</b> when the <b>rods</b> were up. In contrast with the blue livery was the vermilion in which the buffer beam and coupling rods were painted. Another feature of great distinction, begun by James Holden with the Claud Hamiltons, was the broad steel ring, polished bright, that encircled the smokebox door, and made it possible to dispense with the usual straps across the door. Before very long, the painted representation of the GER coat-of-arms on the driving splashers was replaced by a replica cast in relief and picked out in colour. The tenders were replaced with standard GER ones when oil firing came to an end. The cab windows were round.|$|R

40|$|Connecting <b>rod</b> and crank <b>pin</b> bearing are {{important}} components of automotive diesel engine. If these components failed, all of engine {{system would be}} shut down. In this research, these components failed during operation. Detail analysis of the failed surface showed that the failure in connecting <b>rod</b> and crank <b>pin</b> bearing was caused by improper lubrication system. Evidence of improper lubrication system was proved by the existence of black scratch and chipping on crank pin bearing which formed by high friction during operation. High friction affects performance of other pistons and therefore bolts of connecting rod experienced dynamic tension load. With repeated load during operation, crack initiated on the bolts and propagated until the bolt could not withstand the load anymore before they are finally broken...|$|R

50|$|Typical {{two-stroke}} V4s {{have four}} crank throws, or crank pins, {{instead of the}} two that most four-stroke V4s have (two connecting <b>rods</b> sharing each <b>pin).</b> This is primarily because each piston needed its own sealed crankcase volume {{for the purposes of}} efficient induction, where in some cases separate crankshafts served each bank in order to achieve this.|$|R
50|$|The support-point of the {{connection}} turns with the Earth and is depicted as freely suspended above the Earth. The plane of the pendulum swing does not turn with the support point and is not affected by the turning of the support point. The bob is free to swing in any direction {{in relation to the}} support (refer to a Charron chuck). For a pendulum at the pole, the plane of swing remains aligned with a star that the bob is swinging toward. A spot on the bob, however, turns with the support since the bob is not independent of the support point. The spot on the bob does not remain aligned with a star that the bob is swinging toward. This occurs whether the pendulum is swinging or not. If the bob is not allowed to turn with the support-point one twist of the connecting wire will occur in one day at the pole. If {{the connection}} apparatus of the pendulum to the bob and to the support were in a fixed relationship (and the connection not allowed to twist, for example, using a rigid <b>rod</b> <b>pinned</b> into place between two sides of the support), then once the plane of the pendulum swing is established in one direction, that plane would be forced to turn with the support and connection. The Earth's rotation would not be observable in relation to the pendulum swing with this type of connection.|$|R
