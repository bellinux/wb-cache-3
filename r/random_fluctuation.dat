25|$|In {{the genome}} of an organism, each gene {{is located at}} a {{specific}} place called the locus for that gene. Allelic variations at these loci cause phenotypic variation within species (e.g. hair colour, eye colour). However, most alleles {{do not have an}} observable impact on the phenotype. Within a population new alleles generated by mutation either die out or spread throughout the population. When a population is split into different isolated populations (by either geographical or ecological factors), mutations that occur after the split will be present only in the isolated population. <b>Random</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of allele frequencies also produces genetic differentiation between populations. This process is known as genetic drift. By examining the differences between allele frequencies between the populations and computing genetic distance, we can estimate how long ago the two populations were separated.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of several multi-scale {{algorithms}} {{such as the}} multi-scale finite element method (MsFEM) and the finite element heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM), {{that have been developed}} to solve partial differential equations with highly heterogeneous coefficients. Such multi-scale algorithms are often shown to correctly capture the homogenization limit when the highly oscillatory random medium is stationary and ergodic. This paper is concerned with the <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of the solution about the deterministic homogenization limit. We consider the simplified setting of the one dimensional elliptic equation, where the theory of <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> is well understood. We develop a fluctuation theory for the multi-scale algorithms in the presence of random environments with short-range and long-range correlations. What we find is that the computationally more expensive method MsFEM captures the <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> both for short-range and long-range oscillations in the medium. The less expensive method HMM correctly captures the fluctuations for long-range oscillations and strongly amplifies their size in media with short-range oscillations. We present a modified scheme with an intermediate computational cost that captures the <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in all cases. Comment: 41 page...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> obtained by a heterogeneous multi-scale first-order {{finite element method}} applied to solve elliptic equations with a random potential. We show that the <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of such solutions are correctly estimated by the heterogeneous multi-scale algorithm when appropriate fine-scale problems are solved on subsets that cover the whole computational domain. However, when the fine-scale problems are solved over patches that do not cover the entire domain, the <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> {{may or may not}} be estimated accurately. In the case of random potentials with short-range interactions, the variance of the <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> is amplified as the inverse of the fraction of the medium covered by the patches. In the case of random potentials with long-range interactions, however, such an amplification does not occur and <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are correctly captured independent of the (macroscopic) size of the patches. These results are consistent with those obtained by the authors for more general equations in the one-dimensional setting and provide indications on the loss in accuracy that results from using coarser, and hence less computationally intensive, algorithms...|$|R

Even in a near-equilibrium state, there will be stochastic fluctuations in state of the system. The most common fluctuations will be relatively small, resulting in only small amounts of organization, while larger fluctuations and their resulting greater levels of organization will be comparatively more rare. Large fluctuations would be almost inconceivably rare, but inevitably occur if a universe lasts infinitely long. Even if the universe does not have an infinitely long past, modern cosmological theories of the Big Bang do suppose that the latter occurred via stochastic fluctuations in a larger meta-universe; the paradox is retained by incorporating our brief-but-finite past into the <b>random</b> <b>fluctuation.</b>|$|E

We also investigate the fractional Fokker-Planck equation for heavy-tailed <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> We show that the fractional diffusion processes in the presence of μ-stable Lévy noise display special scaling properties in the probability distribution function (PDF). Finally, we study numerically the scaling properties of the heavy-tailed <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> by using the diffusion entropy analysis. This method is based on the evaluation of the Shannon entropy of the PDF generated by the <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations,</b> rather than on the measurement of the global width of the process. We apply the diffusion entropy analysis to extract the growth exponent β and to confirm the validity of our numerical analysis.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{and develop a}} new approach to the numerical analysis and characterization of <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> with heavy-tailed probability distribution function (PDF), such as turbulent heat flow and solar flare fluctuations. We identify the heavy-tailed <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations</b> based on the scaling properties of the tail exponent of the PDF, power-law growth of qth order correlation function and the self-similar properties of the contour lines in two-dimensional random fields. Moreover, this work leads to a substitution for fractional Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) equation that works in presence of μ-stable Lévy noise. Our proposed model explains the configuration dynamics of the systems with heavy-tailed correlated <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> We also present an alternative solution to the fractional EW equation in the presence of μ-stable Lévy noise in the steady-state, which is implemented numerically, using the μ-stable fractional Lévy motion. Based on the analysis of the self-similar properties of contour loops, we numerically show that the scaling properties of contour loop ensembles can qualitatively and quantitatively distinguish non-Gaussian random fields from Gaussian <b>random</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Phys.
