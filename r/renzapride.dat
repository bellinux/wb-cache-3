40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>renzapride,</b> a potent 5 -hydroxytryptamine type- 4 receptor full agonist and 5 -hydroxytryptamine type- 3 receptor antagonist in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: In this dose-escalating pilot study, 17 patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome received placebo, <b>renzapride</b> 2 mg o. d. and <b>renzapride</b> 2 mg b. d. sequentially for 28 days. Response was determined by radio-opaque marker measurement of overall gastrointestinal and segmental colonic transit and patients' assessment of their irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. RESULTS: <b>Renzapride</b> reduced mean overall gastrointestinal transit time (placebo, 2. 9 +/- 1. 6 days; <b>renzapride</b> 2 mg o. d., 2. 6 +/- 1. 4 days; <b>renzapride</b> 2 mg b. d., 1. 9 +/- 1. 6 days) (P = 0. 024) and accelerated segmental colonic transit, with statistically significant differences for <b>renzapride</b> 2 mg b. d. over placebo in caecum/ascending colon (P = 0. 019) and descending colon (P = 0. 022). <b>Renzapride</b> also reduced abdominal pain, {{increased the number of}} pain-free days and improved stool consistency.

In the interdigestive state, the i. v. ad-ministration of cisapride (5 mg) or <b>renzapride</b> (5 mg) adminis-tered in phase I {{resulted in a}} prompt and marked increase in plasma motilin concentration and in gastroduodenal motility. Mean plasma motilin levels during the first 30 min after cisa-pride and after <b>renzapride</b> injection were 85. 0 6 6. 5 (6 S. E.) and 96. 1 6 6. 3 pM., respectively.

40|$|Abstract 5 -Hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) {{has been}} shown to exert {{positive}} inotropic, chronotropic, and lusitropic effects and to stimulate the L-type calcium channel current (ICa) in human atrial tissue through activation of the pharmacologically defined 5 -HT 4 receptor subtype. However, the molecular nature of the receptor(s) involved in these effects is still unknown. In the present study, we report the molecular nature of a 5 -HT 4 receptor cloned from human atrium, h 5 -HT 4 A. Sequence analysis reveals that h 5 -HT 4 A displays a 93 % protein identity with the short form of the 5 -HT 4 receptor recently isolated from rat brain. h 5 -HT 4 A mRNA is expressed in human atrium but not ventricle, and is also found in brain and GI tract. h 5 -HT 4 A transiently expressed in COS- 7 cells displays a classical 5 -HT 4 pharmacological profile. However, affinities of the h 5 -HT 4 A receptor for agonists such as ML 10302, BIMU 1, <b>renzapride</b> or zacopride were 4 – 10 -fold lower than the ones found in brain. Moreover, the stimulatory patterns of cAMP formation by h 5 -HT 4 A in response to the 5 -HT 4 agonists ML 10302 and <b>renzapride</b> were very similar to the patterns of stimulation of ICa obtained in response to these compounds in human atrial myocytes.

40|$|RT–PCR {{technique}} {{was used to}} clone the human 5 -HT 4 (e) receptor (h 5 -HT 4 (e)) from heart atrium. We showed that this h 5 -HT 4 (e) receptor splice variant is restricted to brain and heart atrium. Recombinant h 5 -HT 4 (e) receptor was stably expressed in CHO and C 6 -glial cell lines at 347 and 88 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein, respectively. Expression of h 5 -HT 4 (e) receptors at the cell membrane was confirmed by immunoblotting. The receptor binding profile, determined by competition with [3 H]-GR 113808 {{of a number of}} 5 -HT 4 ligands, was consistent with that previously reported for other 5 -HT 4 receptor isoforms. Surprisingly, we found that the rank order of potencies (EC 50) of 5 -HT 4 agonists obtained from adenylyl cyclase functional assays was inversely correlated to their rank order of affinities (Ki) obtained from binding assays. Furthermore, EC 50 values for 5 -HT, <b>renzapride</b> and cisapride were 2 fold lower in C 6 -glial cells than in CHO cells. ML 10302 and <b>renzapride</b> behaved like partial agonists on the h 5 -HT 4 (e) receptor. These results are in agreement with the reported low efficacy of the these two compounds on L-type Ca 2 + currents and myocyte contractility in human atrium.

In the caudal compartment, blockade of cholinergic ganglionic transmission by hexamethonium (100 microM) and hyoscine (0. 3 microM) caused an approximately 65 % reduction in the amplitude of reflex contractions, suggesting that the remaining response was mediated by non-cholinergic transmission near the distension site. This non-cholinergic component of ganglionic transmission was insensitive to the action of methiothepin (1 microM), ondansetron (1 microM), tropisetron (1. 5 microM), DAU 6285 (1 microM) and <b>renzapride</b> (1 microM), agents that antagonize the action of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) at neural 5 -HT 1 -like, 5 -HT 3, 5 -HT 4 and putative 5 -HT 1 P receptors.

40|$|Intracellular {{recording}} {{methods were}} used to study the actions of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) on 257 myenteric neurons in the guinea pig gastric antrum. Application of 5 -HT caused three types of postsynaptic responses.

A slowly activating depolarization, accompanied by an increase in the input resistance and enhancement of the excitability, was mainly observed in after hyperpolarizing/type 2 neurons. It was suppressed by the prokinetic benzamide compound <b>renzapride,</b> while classical 5 -HT 1 - 4 receptor antagonists had no effect, suggesting the involvement of a 5 -HT 1 p receptor as described in small intestinal neurons. A long-lasting hyperpolarizing response, accompanied by a decreased input resistance, was observed in a small subset of neurons. This response seemed to be mediated by a 5 -HT 1 a receptor. Superfusion of 5 -HT caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the stimulus-evoked nicotinic cholinergic fast excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which was mediated by a presynaptic 5 -HT 1 a receptor. 5 -HT also presynaptically inhibited the slow EPSP. status: publishe...|$|E

As no studies have reported enteric neuronal 5 -HT(1 D) receptors, we used conventional intracellular recordings to characterize the actions of sumatriptan on 145 guinea-pig antral myenteric neurones. In 24 of 29 neurones with a 5 -HT(1 P) receptor-mediated depolarizing response to 5 -HT, application of sumatriptan caused a dose-dependent depolarization, accompanied by increased membrane resistance and enhanced excitability. Depolarizing responses to sumatriptan occurred both in cholinergic and in nitrergic neurones. Sumatriptan did not mimic the 5 -HT(3) receptor-mediated fast-depolarizing responses or 5 -HT(1 A) receptor-mediated inhibitory responses to 5 -HT. Sumatriptan {{had no effect on}} neurones not responding to 5 -HT. The depolarizing response to sumatriptan was inhibited by <b>renzapride,</b> but not by 5 -HT(1 - 7) receptor antagonists. We conclude that sumatriptan behaves as an agonist at the 5 -HT(1 P) receptor on myenteric neurones in the guinea-pig gastric antrum.

40|$|The {{serotonin}} 5 -HT 4 receptor {{has recently}} gained {{a lot of}} attention for its functional roles in central processes such as memory and cognition. In this study, we show that activation of the human 5 -HT 4 (h 5 -HT 4) receptor stimulates the secretion of the non-amyloidogenic soluble form of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPPα). 5 -HT enhanced the level of secreted sAPPα in a time- and dose-dependent manner in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the h 5 -HT 4 (e) receptor isoform. The increase was inhibited by the selective 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonist, GR 113808. The 5 -HT 4 selective agonists, prucalopride and <b>renzapride,</b> also increased secreted sAPPα in IMR 32 human neuroblastoma cells. The stimulatory effect of 5 -HT was mimicked by forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, and 8 -bromo-cAMP, a membrane-permeant cAMP analogue. On the contrary, inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) by H 89 potentiated the 5 -HT-induced increase in both secreted and cellular sAPPα. This phenomenon involves a novel PKA-independent stimulatory process that overcomes a PKA-dependent inhibitory one. Finally, activation of the h 5 -HT 4 (e) receptor did not modify extracellular amyloid β-protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human APP 695. Given the neuroprotective and enhancing memory effects of sAPPα, our results may open a new avenue for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is a common, chronic disorder, {{characterized by}} abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating and altered bowel habit. AIM: To conduct a systematic evidence-based review of pharmacological therapies currently used, or in clinical development, {{for the treatment}} of IBS in Europe. The safety and tolerability of these therapies are the subject of an accompanying review. METHODS: A literature search was completed for randomized controlled studies which included adult patients with IBS and an active or placebo control, assessed IBS symptoms, and were published in English between January 1980 and June 2005. The level of evidence for efficacy was graded according {{to the quality of the}} trial design and the study outcome. RESULTS: There is some evidence for improvement of individual IBS symptoms with antidiarrhoeals (diarrhoea), antispasmodics (abdominal pain/discomfort), bulking agents (constipation), tricyclic antidepressants (abdominal pain/discomfort) and behavioural therapy. In contrast, there is strong evidence for the improvement of global IBS symptoms with two new serotonergic agents: the 5 -HT 4 selective agonist tegaserod (IBS with constipation) and the 5 -HT 3 antagonist alosetron (IBS with diarrhoea). Further data are required for the 5 -HT 3 antagonist, cilansetron, and the mixed 5 -HT 3 antagonist/ 5 -HT 4 agonist <b>renzapride</b> before their utility in IBS can be appraised. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence for the efficacy, safety and tolerability of therapies currently available in Europe {{for the treatment of}} IBS. Overall, there is an absence of pharmacological agents licensed specifically for the treatment of IBS subtypes, and new agents are awaited in Europe that will allow changes in clinical practice to focus on and improve global IBS symptoms. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} identified C-terminal splice {{variant of}} the human 5 -HT 4 receptor, the h 5 -HT 4 (d) receptor, was stably expressed in a CHO cell line at 493 ± 25 [*]fmol mg− 1 protein. We analysed its pharmacological properties by measuring binding affinities and 5 -HT 4 ligand-induced cyclic AMP production. The pharmacological binding profile determined in competition studies with the specific antagonist [3 H]-GR 113808 revealed a rank order of affinity of 5 -HT 4 ligands for the h 5 -HT 4 (d) receptor that was consistent with those previously reported for other 5 -HT 4 receptor isoforms. In adenylyl cyclase functional assays, the h 5 -HT 4 (d) receptor displayed equipotent coupling for all 5 -HT 4 agonists tested (EC 50 {{in the range of}} 1 – 6 [*]nM). EC 50 values were lower than those previously obtained with the 5 -HT 4 (e) receptor stably expressed in CHO cells indicating that the 5 -HT 4 (d) receptor was more efficiently coupled to its effector than the 5 -HT 4 (e) receptor isoform. Moreover, in terms of agonist efficacy (Emax), the benzamide derivative, <b>renzapride</b> displayed full agonist properties at the h 5 -HT 4 (d) receptor (same Emax as 5 -HT) whereas it was previously shown to be a partial agonist at the h 5 -HT 4 (e) receptor. A constitutive activity of the h 5 -HT 4 (d) receptor was observed in CHO cells {{in the absence of any}} 5 -HT 4 ligand. Surprisingly, two 5 -HT 4 ligands, SB 204070 and RS 39604 which are described as highly potent antagonists in various biological models, revealed partial agonist properties at the h 5 -HT 4 (d) receptor.

Acute capsaicin application (10 μm) to the serosal {{site of the}} Ussing chamber evoked a secretory response which was blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 μm), the combined application of the NK 1 and NK 3 receptor antagonists CP- 99, 994 – 1 and SR 142801 (1 μm), and by combined application of atropine (10 μm) and the VIP receptor antagonist VIP(6 – 28) (10 μm). Functional desensitization of extrinsic primary afferents by long-term application of capsaicin significantly diminished distension-evoked secretion by 46 %. After functional desensitization by capsaicin, serosal application of gadolinium (100 μm) inhibited the distension-evoked chloride secretion by 54 %; the L-type Ca 2 + channel blocker nifedipine (1 μm) and the 5 -HT 1 P receptor antagonist <b>renzapride</b> (1 μm) had no effect. The combination of atropine and VIP(6 – 28) or the combination of NK 1 and NK 3 receptor antagonists almost abolished distension-evoked secretion. The secretory response evoked by electrical field stimulation, carbachol (1 μm) or VIP (1 μm) was not attenuated by gadolinium. Field stimulation-evoked chloride secretion was not affected by blockade of NK 1 and NK 3 receptors. Twelve per cent of DiI-labelled submucosal neurones with projections to the mucosa were immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase, substance P and calbindin and very probably represented intrinsic primary afferent neurones. Distension-evoked chloride secretion was mediated by capsaicin-sensitive extrinsic primary afferents and by stretch-sensitive intrinsic primary afferent neurones. Both the extrinsic and intrinsic afferents converge on common efferent pathways. These pathways consist of VIPergic and cholinergic secretomotor neurones that are activated via NK 1 and NK 3 receptors...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the effect of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT; serotonin) on glucose {{transport}} in isolated rat cardiac myocytes. In these cells, 5 -HT (10 - 300 microns), as well as tryptamine, 5 -methoxytryptamine and dopamine, elicited a 3 - 5 fold increase in glucose transport, as compared with control. This effect was maximal after 90 min, and was concomitant with a 1. 8 - and 1. 5 -fold increase in the amounts of glucose transporters GLUT 1 and GLUT 4 at the cell surface of the cardiomyocytes, as determined by using the photoaffinity label 3 H- 2 -N-[4 -(1 -azi- 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl) benzoyl]- 1, 3 -bis-(D-manno s- 4 -yl) propyl- 2 -amine (3 H-ATB-BMPA). In contrast, 3 - 3000 microM of the selective 5 -HT receptor agonists 5 -carboxyamido-tryptamine, alpha-methyl-serotonin, 2 -methyl-serotonin or <b>renzapride</b> failed to stimulate glucose transport. The effect of 5 -HT was not affected by (i) the 5 -HT receptor antagonists methysergide (1 microM), ketanserin (1 microM), cyproheptadine (1 microM), MDL 72222 (1 microM) or ICS 205 - 930 (3 microM), nor by (ii) the adrenergic receptor antagonists prazosin (1 microM), yohimbine (1 microM) or propranolol (5 microM), nor by (iii) the dopaminergic antagonists SCH 23390 (1 microM) or haloperidol (1 microM). The monoamine oxidase inhibitors clorgyline (1 microM) and tranylcypromine (1 microM) completely suppressed the effect of 5 -HT, whereas the control and insulin-stimulated rates of glucose transport were unaffected. Addition of catalase or glutathione diminished the 5 -HT-dependent stimulation of glucose transport by 50 %; these two factors are known to favour the degradation of H 2 O 2 (which can be formed during the deamination of amines by monoamine oxidases). Glutathione also depressed the stimulatory action of exogenously added H 2 O 2 (20 microM) by 30 %. Furthermore, in cells treated with 5 _HT, a time-dependent accumulation of 5 -hydroxy- 1 H-indol- 3 -ylacetic acid (a product of 5 -HT metabolism via monoamine oxidases) was observed, which paralleled the changes in glucose transport. In conclusion, the stimulation of glucose transport by 5 -HT in cardiomyocytes is not mediated by a 5 -HT 1, 5 -HT 2, 5 -HT 3 or 5 -HT 4 receptor, nor by an adrenergic or dopaminergic receptor, but is likely to occur through the degradation of by a monoamine oxidase and concomitant formation of H 2 O 2...|$|E
