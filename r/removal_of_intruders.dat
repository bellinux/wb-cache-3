5|$|The <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> Kammhuber as {{commanding}} officer of night air defences in September 1943 did not prevent further appeals for the reinstatement <b>of</b> <b>intruder</b> operations. His replacement as General der Nachtjagd (General of Night Fighters), was Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Joseph Schmid, commanding 1. Jagdkorps (1st Fighter Corps). Schmid had long argued for a repeat <b>of</b> <b>intruder</b> operations and first pressed for their resumption in December 1943. His proposals were rejected by Göring {{on the grounds that}} intruder operations were not his business. Schmid did not receive substantive support from other field commanders, most notably Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, who objected to the operation after meeting with Schmid in January and February 1944 on the grounds that Hitler opposed such operations and newer German radar was not to fall into Allied hands. Four months later, attitudes had not changed. Generalmajor Dietrich Peltz, commanding Angriffsführer England (Bomber Leader England) and IX. Fliegerkorps showed little interest in intruder missions either, since his remaining forces were engaged in night attacks against the Allied beachheads in Normandy. In October 1944, he finally won support from Werner Streib, Inspekteur der Nachtjagd (Inspector of Night Fighters) to press for an operation again. The plan was simple; a large force of 600—700 night fighters were to be gathered and sent out in one simultaneous operation.|$|R

In this work, we assess the effect <b>of</b> <b>intruder</b> shape on the granular drag force using discrete element modelling (DEM).

40|$|A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) {{integrates}} physical (i. e., sensor) devices with cyber (i. e., informational) {{components to}} form a situation-aware system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in real-world. It has wide application to scenarios of traffic control, environment monitoring and battlefield surveillance. This study investigates the specific problem <b>of</b> <b>intruder</b> mining in CPS: With {{a large number of}} sensors deployed in a designated area, the task is real time detection <b>of</b> <b>intruders</b> who enter the area, based on untrustworthy data. We propose a method called IntruMine to detect and verify the intruders. IntruMine constructs monitoring graphs to model the relationships between sensors and possible intruders, and computes the position and energy <b>of</b> each <b>intruder</b> with the link information from these monitoring graphs. Finally, a confidence rating is calculated for each potential detection, reducing false positives in the results. IntruMine is a generalized approach. Two classical methods <b>of</b> <b>intruder</b> detection can be seen as special cases of IntruMine under certain conditions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of IntruMine on both synthetic and real datasets and the experimental results show that IntruMine has better effectiveness and efficiency than existing methods. ...|$|R

New external disturbances that increase the physical and socio-political accessibility of SES (e. g. {{construction of a new}} road) and weak points in institutional SES of valuable common-pool resources are some of the main factors that enhance the encroachment <b>of</b> <b>intruders.</b> The irrigation system of the northwest Murcia Region (Spain) is an example used in this article of the changes in the structure and robustness of a traditional SES as a result <b>of</b> <b>intruders.</b> In this case study, farmers have traditionally used water from springs to irrigate their lands but, in recent decades, large agrarian companies have settled in this region, using groundwater to irrigate new lands. This intrusion had caused the levels of this resource to drop sharply. In an attempt to adapt, local communities are intensifying the use of resources and are constructing new physical infrastructures; consequently, new vulnerabilities are emerging. This situation seems to be heading toward the inevitably collapse of this traditional SES.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the {{penetration}} dynamics <b>of</b> <b>intruders</b> in granular beds {{is relevant}} {{not only for}} fundamental Physics, but also for geophysical processes and construction on sediments or granular soils in areas potentially affected by earthquakes. While the penetration <b>of</b> <b>intruders</b> in two dimensional (2 D) laboratory granular beds can be followed using video recording, it is useless in three dimensional (3 D) beds of non-transparent materials such as common sand. Here we propose a method to quantify the sink dynamics <b>of</b> an <b>intruder</b> into laterally shaken granular beds based on the temporal correlations between the signals from a reference accelerometer fixed to the shaken granular bed, and a probe accelerometer deployed inside the intruder. Due to its analogy with the working principle of a lock in amplifier, we call this technique Lock in accelerometry (LIA).
