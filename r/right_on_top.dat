500|$|Throughout the city, Batman {{encounters}} enemy watchtowers, guard posts, aerial drones, and explosive mines {{embedded in}} the city streets. Some drones can be hacked and turned against their allies by using the Remote Hacking Device. Arkham Knight introduces the [...] "Fear Takedown", where Batman can subdue up to five enemies simultaneously {{as long as he}} remains undetected; time is slowed after each takedown, allowing the player to target the next enemy. Hazardous items such as power generators can be used in combat for environmental attacks. Combat is rewarded with experience points, which are used to unlock gadget abilities, combat moves, and health upgrades. Batman can now access grates from afar, allowing him to roll forward and immediately get under the grate if in range instead of having to be <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of them, while also initiating multiple takedowns from within them. Some enemies carry devices capable of blocking Batman's Detective Vision.|$|E
500|$|After {{the attack}} on Southland, UB-14 broke down again and put in at Chanak to await repairs. While there on 4 September, word came of the British {{submarine}} [...] entangled in Turkish antisubmarine nets off Nagara Point. Von Heimburg, Prince Heinrich, and UB-14s cook, {{a man by the}} name of Herzig, set out in a rowboat to observe the Turkish attempts to destroy E7. After several mines that formed part of the net had been detonated to no avail, von Heimburg and his group rowed out and repeatedly dropped a plumb line until it contacted metal. Then, von Heimburg dropped a Turkish sinker mine with a shortened fuse <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of E7. After the hand-dropped mine detonated too close for the British submarine's captain's comfort, he ordered his boat surfaced, abandoned, and scuttled. Between shellfire from the Turkish shore batteries and E7s scuttling charges, von Heimburg and company narrowly escaped harm. While most sources credit E7s sinking to the Turkish efforts, author Robert Stern contends that von Heimburg and UB-14 deserve partial credit for the demise of E7.|$|E

Addressing their plight {{at the turn of}} the 1990s, [...] "Brothers Gonna Work It Out" [...] features cacophonic sound textures and a theme of unity among African Americans, with Chuck D preaching [...] "Brothers that try to work it out / They get mad, revolt, revise, realize / They're superbad / Small chance a smart brother's gonna be a victim of his own circumstance". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post writes that songs such as [...] "War at 33⅓" [...] and [...] "Fight the Power" [...] "may sound like a call to ohms and arms, but they are really a call to action ('turn us loose and we shall overcome'), a message to conscience and a plea for unity ('move as team, never move alone,' both cautionary advice and game plan)".

500|$|On 1 January 1910, Williams {{played for}} Cardiff against Bristol, while Maddocks {{played on the}} wing for Wales against France. For the match against England on 15 January, Williams was called up as a reserve. However, in a game for Cardiff against Moseley, he picked up an injury to his thigh that would necessitate a few weeks out. After the England game, which Wales lost, it was rumoured that Williams would be {{recalled}} to the wing for the match against Scotland, but his injury persisted. The Welsh defeated Scotland, and {{it was expected that}} they would field unchanged team for the final game of the tournament, against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on 12 March. Melville Baker, however, was injured playing on the left wing and opened up a place for Williams to be selected. Once again the Welsh backline was filled with Cardiff men: Bush, Spiller, Dyke, Gibbs, who took on the captain's duties, and Williams. Joe Pugsley, another Cardiff man, was in the Welsh pack. Ireland were leading by a try until just before half time, when Williams scored a try to bring Wales level. In the second half, he scored two more; Gibbs and Dyke each scored one, while Bush kicked a dropgoal, to win the game 3–19. [...] "Forward" [...] writing in the Evening Express said: [...] "Williams was <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of his form, and his cleverness in beating three or four Irishmen, including the fullback, before he scored his three tries was really splendid." ...|$|E
500|$|Priyanka Chopra {{was born}} on 18 July 1982 in Jamshedpur, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both {{physicians}} in the Indian Army. Her father was a Punjabi from Ambala. Her mother, from Jharkhand, is the eldest daughter of Ms. Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri, {{a former member of}} Bihar Legislative Assembly, and Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former Congress veteran. Chopra has a brother, Siddharth, who is seven years her junior and actresses Parineeti Chopra, Meera Chopra and Mannara Chopra are her cousins. Due to her parents' occupations the family relocated to a number of places in India, including Delhi, Chandigarh, Ambala, Ladakh, Lucknow, Bareilly, and Pune. Among the schools she attended were La Martiniere Girls' School in Lucknow and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly. In an interview published in Daily News and Analysis, Chopra said that she did not mind travelling regularly and changing schools; she welcomed it as a new experience and a way to discover India's multicultural society. Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of Leh, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of Jammu and Kashmir. She has said, [...] "I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh. My brother was just born. My dad was in the army and was posted there. I stayed in Leh for a year and my memories of that place are tremendous... We were all army kids there. We weren't living in houses, we were in bunkers in the valley and there was a stupa <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of a hill which used to overlook our valley.

500|$|At about 12:30, 280 bomber and torpedo bomber {{aircraft}} arrived {{over the}} Japanese force. , which {{had fallen out}} of formation due to engine trouble, was caught and sunk by a detachment of aircraft from [...] The Surface Special Attack Force increased speed to , and following standard Japanese anti-aircraft defensive measures, the destroyers began circling Yamato. The first aircraft swooped in to attack at 12:37. Yahagi turned and raced away at [...] in an attempt to draw off some of the attackers; it drew off only an insignificant number. Yamato was not hit for four minutes, but at 12:41 two bombs obliterated two of her triple 25mm anti-aircraft mounts and blew a hole in the deck. A third bomb then destroyed her radar room and the starboard aft 127mm mount. At 12:46, another two bombs struck the battleship's port side, one slightly ahead of the aft 155mm centreline turret and the other <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the gun. These caused a great deal of damage to the turret and its magazines; only one man survived. At 12:45 a single torpedo struck Yamato far forward on her port side, sending shock waves throughout the ship. Because many of the ship's crew who didn't go down with the vessel were killed by strafing aircraft as they swam in the oily water, the details are uncertain, but authors Garzke and Dulin record that little damage was caused. Shortly afterward, up to three more torpedoes struck Yamato. Two impacts, on the port side near the engine room and on one of the boiler rooms, are confirmed; the third is disputed but is regarded by Garzke and Dulin as probable because it would explain the reported flooding in Yamatos auxiliary steering room. The attack ended around 12:47, leaving the battleship listing ° to port; counterflooding—deliberately flooding compartments {{on the other side of}} the ship—reduced the list to °. One boiler room had been disabled, slightly reducing Yamatos top speed, and strafing had incapacitated many of the gun crews who manned Yamatos unprotected 25mm anti-aircraft weapons, sharply curtailing their effectiveness.|$|E

2500|$|Several towns were {{historically}} {{divided between}} counties, including Banbury, Burton upon Trent, Newmarket, Peterborough, Royston, Stamford, Tamworth, Todmorden and Warrington.

2500|$|Diving cliffs: The {{area around}} Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid {{out like a}} kind of grotto, with many lower-intensity attractions.

However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be {{swimming}} in or away from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers below that they could expect people to dive in right next to them - or <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of them. [...] The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions. Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating how deep the water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white {{to make it easier to}} spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes. Still operating, known as Canyon Cliffs.|$|E
2500|$|The stadium {{has also}} been criticized for its lack of fan noise. During a Sunday Night Baseball {{telecast}} in 2012, commentator and former Red Sox manager Terry Francona spoke about the different atmospheres in {{the old and new}} stadiums saying that [...] "As a visiting team, especially for the Red Sox, by the time the (national) anthem was over, you couldn't wait {{to get back in the}} dugout. Now (there is) a little different (kind) of fan sitting around down there by the dugout." [...] Games at the new stadium do not feature the same deafening crowd moments and often sound eerily silent. The lack of fan noise was noticeable in the 2012 playoffs as well, with thousands of unsold seats for Game 5 of the ALDS and Games 1 and 2 of the ALCS. [...] "This is a very easy place to play now", said Quintin Berry of the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees' ALCS opponents. [...] "Coming from Oakland, the fans there were so rowdy. It was easier to come here." [...] In his autobiography [...] "The Closer", the Yankees' longtime relief pitcher Mariano Rivera wrote these comments about the new stadium's atmosphere: [...] "It doesn’t hold noise, or home-team fervor, anywhere near the way the old place did. The old Stadium was our 10th man—a loud and frenzied cauldron of pinstriped passion, with a lot of lifers in the stands. Maybe I’m wrong, but it's hard to see that the new place can ever quite duplicate that. Derek Jeter echoed this sentiment in a September 2014 article in New York magazine, Jeter said he missed the original Yankee Stadium: [...] "It was a different feel. The new stadium, it's second to none—all the amenities. For the players, it really doesn’t get any better. The old stadium, if you were at the stadium, in the stands, the only place you could see the game was in your seat. Now there's so many suites and places people can go. So a lot of times it looks like it's empty, but it's really not. The old stadium, it was more intimidating. The fans were <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of you." ...|$|E
