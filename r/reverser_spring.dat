50|$|The stock NSX has a {{somewhat}} rearward bias in its spring and bar rates, where the rear is relatively quite stiff versus the front. This {{means that the}} lateral load transfer distribution, or the amount of load that is transferred across the front axle versus the rear while cornering, is rather rear biased. This can make the car quite lively and easy to rotate at low speed, but in higher speed corners this effect becomes more pronounced and can be a handful to manage. To reduce the tendency to oversteer, Honda fitted softer rear tires on the NSX. For the NSX-R, Honda <b>reversed</b> the <b>spring</b> bias, placing stiffer springs on the front suspension along with stiffer front sway bar. This shifts the load transfer stiffness balance farther forward, resulting in more rear grip {{at the expense of}} front grip; this has the effect of decreasing the oversteer tendency of the car, making it much more stable in high speed corners. Overall, the NSX-R uses much stiffer front sway bar along with stiffer springs than the stock NSX (21.0mm xt2.6mm front sway bar :F 3.0 kg/mm—R 4.0 kg/mm for the NSX versus F 8.0 kg/mm—R 5.7 kg/mm for the NSX-R).|$|R

In this study, we examine the influence of lakes and an important terrestrial component—forest cover—on the nutrient levels of stream water in 11 Rocky Mountain (Idaho) watersheds. Water samples were collected from the inflow and outflow of lakes with varying amounts of upstream lakes and forested area during spring runoff and summer base flow. During base flow, mean total nitrogen concentrations at the inflow of final lakes were significantly related to relative upstream lake area, increasing from 34 to 103 μg N L- 1 as upstream lake cover in the watersheds increased from 0 % to 4 %. Forest cover was not significantly correlated with total nitrogen concentrations exported from the watersheds. However, similar to other studies, inflow nitrate concentrations were negatively correlated with relative forest cover. At the scale of individual lakes, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen increased, and nitrate was significantly reduced from inflows to outflows.

The region has warm, humid summers and cold, usually moist winters. Extreme heat and cold usually occur for short periods. It is considered a temperate climate when compared with the remainder of continental Canada. [...] In the fall and winter, temperatures are moderated by the delayed cooling of the Great Lakes; [...] this effect is <b>reversed</b> in <b>spring</b> and summer when afternoon warming is tempered. The lakes' moderating effects allow for a longer growing season than areas at similar latitudes in the continent's interior; some areas exceed 200 frost-free days and have an annual mean temperature of 10°C (50°F). Both spring and fall generally consist of mild days and cool nights but are prone to drastic temperature changes over a short timespan. Annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 110cm (30–43in) and is well distributed throughout the year with a usual summer peak. Upland areas in this region have cooler conditions, generally more precipitation (especially snowfall), putting them into the Dfb climate scheme. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes, making for abundant snow in some areas (London, Goderich for example) over 2 m (80"), while some other areas are not in the direct snowbelt and receive closer to an average of 1 m (40") of snow per year.|$|R

The performance of dormant and winter-active lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) cultivars was compared under sheep grazing in 2 experiments during the cool season. The objectives were to define the cool season management required for winter-active cultivars in sheep farming systems. The ‘winter-active cultivars Matador and Rere yielded 1760 and 1220 kg DM/ha compared with 890 and 760 kg from Wairau and Saranac respectively in mid-winter, while the <b>reverse</b> occurred in <b>spring</b> when dormant cultivars yielded 50 % more than the winter active. This was related to differing levels of non-structural carbohydrates in roots, which had declined to insignificant levels in Rere and Matador by early spring. June grazing increased spring yields of Wairau by 35 % due to control of overwintering aphids, but reduced yield of Rere by 25 % due to effects on root reserves. Early September grazing greatly reduced subsequent lucerne yields at late October and early December grazings, and increased the content of weeds. Our findings show that if farmers graze winter-active lucerne with sheep in winter the advantage in production disappears in spring.

Breguet sold the Bishop another tourbillon watch, number 2436, for the same price but this one had a constant force escapement.During the period in which these watches were being sold (1808-1821), a few dozen tourbillon watches were being produced, about half with a lever escapement on a 1-minute carriage and the rest with a variety of escapements, a detent escapement on a 6-minute or 4-minute carriage, a couple with a constant force escapement and at least one with a Robin escapement.

Observations adjacent to, {{prior to and}} during the Ocean Margin EXchange (OMEX) project of 1993 – 1996 are used. They include currents measured on moorings, drogued-buoy tracks; temperature and other data from CTD profiles, especially as indicators of vertical mixing; evidence from models, particularly for turbulence causing vertical mixing. These data are combined in estimates of (seasonally dependent) mean flow, tidal currents, other current variability, exchange and mixing over the main cross-slope section studied in OMEX and in nearby and contrasted locations (aided {{by the use of}} earlier and adjacent measurements). Causative physical processes are discussed: potentially northward flow along the continental slope, effects of Goban Spur topography, eddies, wind-driven transport, cascading, tides, fronts, internal tides, internal waves, surface waves. Among these, there is evidence that • the along-slope flow, typically O(0. 05 m s− 1), is reduced or even <b>reversed</b> in <b>spring,</b> is generally weaker than at some other margin sectors owing to the non-meridional alignment and indentations in the Celtic Sea slope, and may sometimes overshoot rather than follow the depth contours around Goban Spur; • tidal currents are O(0. 2 m s− 1) on the adjacent shelf but O(0. 1 m s− 1) or less over most of Goban Spur; they increase to the southeast; • other (wind- and eddy-forced) contributions to the currents are typically O(0. 1 m s− 1) or less, except on the shelf, and decrease with depth; • wind-, tide- and wave-forced currents are probably the most consistent agents of cross-slope exchange O(1 m 2 s− 1), with topographic effects being important locally (canyons, spurs); • stratification starts intermittently until early June, becomes shallower through June and deepens by September. In 1995, one storm on 5 – 8 September roughly doubled the upper mixed-layer depth to > 40 m and reinstated maximal primary production in the upper mixed layer; • vertical mixing is intermittent, dominated by surface inputs (wind and waves); towards the southeast, internal waves of tidal origin are increasingly important for mixing across the thermocline; • in the context of nutrient provision for primary production in the upper mixed layer, diffusion through the summer thermocline appears to be small unless internal waves strongly increase mixing. ...|$|R

Green crabs persisted longer in the lowest range of salinities tested, especially if a shelter was available. Prior acclimation affected the timing of choice behaviour; the lower the salinity of acclimation the faster the time of exit from the lowest range of salinities tested, and vice versa. Estuarine green crabs exhibited endogenous locomotor activity of circatidal periodicity and were less responsive to episodes of low salinity than open shore red and green crabs. Constant low salinity initiated a rhythm of circatidal periodicity in arhythmic red and green crabs; red crabs reacted faster and were more active upon salinity change than green crabs. The amount of locomotor activity induced after prior acclimation was similar within each acclimation salinity tested.

The Abbasid prince was initially victorious, forcing Khumarawayh to flee, but was in turn defeated and fled the battlefield by the Tulunid general Sa'd al-Aysar, while much of his army was taken prisoner. Al-Aysar then tried to rebel in Damascus, but Khumarawayh swiftly suppressed his revolt and is even said to have killed the rebel himself. Khumarawayh continued to pursue a rapprochement with the Abbasid court: he treated the prisoners of war from Tawahin with exceptional clemency, giving them the choice of either staying in Egypt under his own service or returning to Iraq without ransom. This policy eventually led in December 886 to the conclusion of an agreement, whereby Khumarawayh as governor over Egypt and Syria with the right to be succeeded by his offspring, for 30 years, in exchange for an unspecified annual tribute. Between 886 and 890, Khumarawayh went on to defeat Ibn Khundaj and receive the submission of the governor of the Jazira, Ibn Abi'l-Saj. At the same time, the emir of Tarsus, Yazaman al-Khadim, accepted Tulunid suzerainty, bringing the Cilician Thughur under Tulunid control as well.|$|R
40|$|A 3 D {{hydrodynamic}} {{model of the}} Aral Sea was successfully implemented to address the complex hydrodynamic changes induced by the combined effect of hydrologic and climatic change in the Aral region. The first barotropic numerical experiments allowed us to produce a comparative description of the mean general seasonal circulation patterns corresponding to the original situation (1956 - 1960) and of the average situation for the period from 1981 to 1985, a very low river flow period. The dominant anticyclonic circulation suggested by our seasonal simulation is in good agreement with previous investigations. In addition. this main anticyclonic gyre was shown to be stable and clearly established from February to September, while winter winds led to another circulation scenario. In winter, the main anticyclonic gyre was considerably limited, and cyclonic circulations appeared in the deep western basin and in the northeast of the shallow basin. In contrast, stronger anticyclonic circulation was observed in the Small Aral Sea during winter. As {{a consequence of the}} 10 -m sea level drop observed between the two periods considered, the 1981 - 1985 simulation suggests an intensification of seasonal variability. Total water transport of the main gyre was reduced with sea level drop by a minimum of 30 % in May and up to 54 % in September. Before 1960, the study of the net flows through Berg and Kokaral Straits allowed us to evaluate the component of water exchange between the Small and the Large Seas linked with the general anticyclonic circulation around Kokaral Island. This exchange was lowest in summer (with a mean anticyclonic exchange of 222 m(3) /s for July and August), highest in fall and winter (with a mean value of 1356 m(3) /s from September to February) and briefly <b>reversed</b> in the <b>spring</b> (mean cyclonic circulation of 316 m(3) /s for April and May). In summer, the water exchange due to local circulation at the scale of each strait was comparatively more important because net flows through the straits were low. After about 20 years of negative water balance, the western Kokaral Strait was dried up and the depth of Berg Strait was reduced from 15 to 5 m. Simulation indicated a quasi-null net transport, except during the seasonal modification of the circulation pattern, in February and October. A limited, but stable, water exchange of about 100 m(3) /s remained throughout the year, {{as a result of the}} permanent superposition of opposite currents. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) is {{the most}} {{important}} of the deciduous tree fruits in terms of production and a focus of research worldwide. Today, it is cultivated widely in temperate latitudes where winter temperatures can fall below 0 &# 176;C and in high elevations in the tropics and sub-tropics such as Ethiopia. Like other deciduous fruit trees, apple trees require a certain amount of winter chilling to enter into and exit from endodormancy. Hence, temperature is surely one of the principal defining characteristics of a locations suitability for apple production. In a temperate climate, the temperature of the cold autumn and winters is sufficient low to satisfy the chilling requirement of apples, but growers would like to delay budbreak and flowering (by cultivars with high chilling requirements) to avoid damage from spring frosts. In the warmer cultivation regions of the world like Ethiopia, on the other hand, this chilling requirement is not necessarily met, resulting in delayed and irregular defoliation, uneven budburst, irregular flowering and low budburst percentages. These irregularities cause management problems later in the growing season and culminate in poor adaptation, reduced yields and quality, and altered tree architecture and future productivity of the tree. To solve these problems a better knowledge of dormancy and tree growth is needed and therefore, the aim of this thesis was twofold: to describe bud dormancy dynamics and to get insight into the genetics underlying the control of tree architecture in apple in temperate and tropical climates. Bud dormancy (both para- and endo-dormancy) dynamics was investigated for two cultivars, Golden Delicious and Gala grafted on M 9  rootstock, in areas with contrasting climatic conditions (a temperate climate  Belgium and a tropical highland  Ethiopia) for two successive years (2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12). Moreover, a validation experiment was conducted on MM 106  apple rootstock during 2010 / 11 only in Ethiopia. To evaluate dormancy, the inverse of time to 50 % budburst was determined of the terminal bud, and of both distally and proximally situated lateral buds. Experiments were done on intact shoots, on shoots without the distal shoot piece and on shoots with a distal disbudded shoot piece. Shoots and buds on shoots can have inhibitory effects on the proximal situated buds. Results show that differences in the rates of budburst were not exclusively related to the chilling requirements of the cultivars, as cultivar × environment interactions were evident. In the temperate winter climate (Belgium), terminal buds are more endodormant than laterals, a basitonic budburst gradient achieved between the lateral buds during autumn and winter; whereas this relation was <b>reversed</b> during <b>spring,</b> in which terminal buds burst earlier than lateral buds: acrotonic gradient. In mild-winter climate (Ethiopia), on the other hand, basitonic budburst tendency remained throughout the observation period, including spring. Moreover, a stronger paradormancy inhibition by the distal shoot parts and/or buds was observed in Ethiopia than in Belgium. For the study of the genetics of tree architecture, 166 genotypes of a mapped Telamon (columnar habit) and Braeburn (normal habit) population (T×B) on MM 106  rootstock, replicated 2 - 3 times per genotype both in Belgium and Ethiopia were used to examine variability of main shoot growth traits. The results were also used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for tree architecture. Each of the traits analyzed exhibits continuous phenotypic variation as typical for quantitative traits. Genotype, environment and genotype-environment interaction variances were significant for most architectural traits in the first year growth, suggesting that there was considerable variability present in the genotypes and environments analyzed. Particulary it was {{interesting to note that the}} vegetative growth characteristics of genotypes showed higher variances in Ethiopia and trees were very vigorous with less branching, implicating that the warm growing season with high incidence of solar radiation and probably the clay-rich soil in Ethiopia favors apical dominance. As expected, a number of QTL were also identified on the genetic linkage maps of Telamon and Braeburn using data from individual environments and joint data analysis. In particular, a total of 40 and 54 QTL were detected in Ethiopia and Belgium on 10 and 11 genetic linkage groups respectively. These results confirm that regulation of tree architecture is complex and further suggesting that tree architectural traits in both parents are largely, but certainly not completely governed by the alleles of the Co gene per se and are real quantitative traits. Specifically, linkage group (LG) 8 of both parents, which did not entail a significant QTL for any trait in Belgium, seemed an important LG in Ethiopia for genetic expression of base diameter, tree volume and internode number. On the other hand, LGs 2, 5 and 15, were important LGs in Belgium for expression of sylleptic branching characteristics which was not the case in Ethiopia. As phenotypes and the underlying genetic expression of quantitative traits vary greatly with development, further genetic investigation on the T×B genotypes during their second year growth was carried out in Belgium; though this was not possible in Ethiopia as most of the genotypes remained dormant during the second year growth. Similarly, the genotypic effects were highly significant (p &# 8804; 0. 001) for all traits in the second year growth in Belgium. On the other hand, fewer QTL were detected in the second year growth compared to the QTL identified in the first year. Particularly, QTL identified for the same traits were mostly different in both years and for many of the traits there was good evidence that linkage group 10 of both parents contributed to the identified QTL. Many age-specific QTL were detected as trees matured. Thus, measuring mature trees might then be the best method of detecting QTL that provide a more precise estimation of genotypic values as their phenotypic effects would accumulate over years. In conclusion, the presented results indicate that period of endodormancy is longer under conditions of low chilling and that there are also differences in paradormancy and evolution of paradormancy compared to conditions of normal chilling. This means that cultivar choice, pruning and other manipulations of trees under low chilling conditions have to be adapted compared to temperate conditions. Finally, as there is still a knowledge gap on bud dormancy under mild climates further in-depth research is imperative. Concerning the genetics of tree architecture, LG 10 seems crucial for tree architectural traits regardless of the presence or absence of the dominant Co-allele of the gene as several QTL were identified in the Braeburn parental genetic map. Moreover, results indicate that growth characteristics are under strong environmental and/or ontogenetic influence and that QTL by environment/ontogeny interactions are evident. Thus, additional research needs to be done to validate the QTL detected in the present study before any attempt to execute marker-assissted selection program. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The <b>spring</b> <b>reverse</b> {{migration}} of landbirds (i. e., birds {{flying in the}} direction opposite to be expected), within the Great Lakes region is controversial {{because it is not}} understood if the extent or reversal of flight direction in spring is truly a change in migratory patterns or a brief anomaly. It is also not clear what the fitness and community level impacts are. My objective was to determine what and how weather influences reverse migration and to determine which species and families of birds participate the most frequently in this form of flight. I examined species which are participatory (and those that are not) as well as the impacts of specific weather covariates on the abundance of landbirds and focused explicitly on the putative reverse {{migration of}} landbirds. Field sites were located at the extreme southern tip of Fish Point, Pelee Island (2010 - 2012) and Point Pelee National Park (2012), where my field assistant and I visually recorded the total number of birds observed to be reverse migrating, while identifying all birds to species or family as best possible. This study was conducted over 97 days during April 26 – May 20, in 2010 - 2012. Information pertaining to potential reverse migration has only been formally documented twice in the Great Lakes region, most recently in 1951. I undertook a descriptive analysis to compare the numbers of individuals of bird species and families. Temperate and neotropical migrants were examined, compared, and divided into sub-sets based on their geographic ranges. I identified species at risk and vagrants which I observed during reverse migrations. Based on provincial population estimates, I determined the proportion of all reverse migrants where ≥ 200 individuals were observed. A descriptive analysis was undertaken to determine differences between sites (i. e., Point Pelee and Fish Point) in the final year of surveys (2012). Species and abundance were comparatively differentiated between each site and subsequently compared. While very few birds were observed flying anything but south, a total of 61, 677 birds of 80 species was documented flying south. My results indicate temperate migrants vastly outnumbered neotropical migrants (as much as 4 : 1) and numbers of birds varied between study sites. Temperate migrants were noted to be more common (in the final study year) at Point Pelee compared to Fish Point, while neotropical migrants were more numerous at Fish Point than Point Pelee. Despite the fact that most migrant species participated in reverse migrations (i. e., of the species regularly occurring in the Pelee region at this time of year), complete absences were noted, most notably in Catharus thrushes, while species such as Rose-breasted Grosbeak and Scarlet Tanager, and families such as Tyrant Flycatchers, Vireos and Sparrows were observed to be less prevalent than anticipated. Species at risk and vagrants were noted relatively frequently during this study, suggesting that these surveys are an efficient and potentially important tool for migration monitoring in this region. Diurnal migrants, most notably Blackbirds, were observed to engage in reverse migration in higher numbers than nocturnal migrants, such as Wood Warblers. Seven weather covariates were measured and modeled with the total number of birds detected using R to determine which covariates explain the most amount of variation {{of the total number of}} birds during my surveys. I used an AICc approach to select the best model for each hypothesis. After selecting the top weather covariates with time lags according to the best (lowest) AICc values, I built general models by comparing all possible combinations of the covariates identified in the top models for each hypothesis. I included a random effect intercept for study site to discern any site difference or similarities between Point Pelee and Fish Point and specified a Poisson distribution (log-link function as implemented in the LMER package) because the data set was continuous (time-series) and count oriented. My adjusted time lag results show that most migrants tend to migrate during and ahead of inclement weather and/or periods of south winds. I also found that all identified covariates influence reverse migration to some degree. Wind direction and barometric pressure were the most significant of the covariates examined (β = 0. 718 and - 0. 213, respectively). Specifically, wind direction is the most important covariate in explaining reverse migration, with days of south winds dramatically increasing the probability of higher numbers of birds during surveys. Low barometric pressure is also important for explaining the number of observed reverse migrants; therefore, days with lower barometric pressure have a greater likelihood of increased bird observations. Based on my observations and results I theorized that while reverse migration pertains to a distinct form of flight, it is likely not an actual form of migration. This form of flight at its simplest is likely a form of reorientation, whereby migratory birds take advantage of local weather conditions by flying south for extended distances. I anticipate that this form of flight must have serious consequences for the fitness levels and life-cycles of migratory birds. Studies looking at reverse migration provide a useful tool for migration monitoring, particularly as it is an underexplored phenomenon. Observations of thousands of birds, many of which are either species at risk or vagrants, collected in an efficient manner are vital for determining population trends related to migratory birds. Continuing this study would aid on-going monitoring programs assessing bird populations passing through the lower Great Lakes region. These studies will also help us understand the impacts of climate and climate change on migratory birds...|$|R
