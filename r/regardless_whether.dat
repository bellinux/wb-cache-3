5|$|The {{chair of}} European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was {{established}} in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles Henry Plumb, {{with the goal of}} helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, <b>regardless</b> <b>whether</b> married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E

Taxes simply redistribute purchasing power, doing so in a particularly inefficient manner, reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on.|$|E

2500|$|... 9 June 2016, {{judicial}} magistrate Vijay Kumar at the Surajpur district court issued direction under section 156 (3), on a petition filed by a Bisara resident against murdered Mohammad Ikhlaq and his kin for alleged cow slaughter. On {{the night of}} September 28, police collected {{a sample of the}} meat from Akhlaq's house in Bisada and sent it to a vet for preliminary testing. These tests suggested it was mutton, but the police sent the sample to another lab in Mathura for a conclusive test. A top government official then stated that the report from Mathura also confirmed that it was mutton. The petitioner to Surajpur district court had based his plea on a report by a forensic lab in Mathura that a meat sample taken from the site of the attack allegedly belonged to “a cow or its progeny”. However, the government's inquiry confirmed that he was not storing beef for consumption. <b>Regardless,</b> <b>whether</b> the meat found in Akhlaq's home was mutton or beef has no bearing on the crime of lynching.|$|E

Since then, I have been through your country to some fifty or sixty different cities, I think.

I suppose that the poet will sing and the artist will paint <b>regardless</b> <b>whether</b> the world praises or blames. He has his own world and is independent of his fellow-men. But the handicraftsman is dependent on your pleasure and opinion. He needs your encouragement and he must have beautiful surroundings. Your people love art but do not sufficiently honour the handicraftsman. Of course, those millionaires who can pillage Europe for their pleasure need have no care to encourage such; but I speak for those whose desire for beautiful things is larger than their means.

[...] Such follow him, as shall be registerd [...] Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle, [...] Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults [...] Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense [...] God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land, [...] Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark [...] With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey [...] 340 [...] To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st [...] Left in confusion, Babylon thence call'd. [...] There in captivitie he lets them dwell [...] The space of seventie years, then brings them back, [...] Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn [...] To David, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n. [...] Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings [...] Thir Lords, whom God dispos'd, the house of God [...] They first re-edifie, and for a while [...] In mean estate live moderate, till grown [...] 350 [...] In wealth and multitude, factious they grow; [...] But first among the Priests dissension springs, [...] Men who attend the Altar, and should most [...] Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings [...] Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise [...] The Scepter, and regard not Davids Sons, [...] Then loose it to a stranger, that the true [...] Anointed King Messiah might be born [...] Barr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr [...] Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com, [...] 360 [...] And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire [...] His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold; [...] His place of birth a solemn Angel tells [...] To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night; [...] They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire [...] Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung. [...] A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire [...] The Power of the most High; he shall ascend [...] The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign [...] With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns. [...] 370 [...] He ceas'd, discerning Adam with such joy [...] Surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears, [...] Without the vent of words, which these he breathd. [...] O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher [...] Of utmost hope! now clear I understand [...] What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain, [...] Why our great expectation should be call'd [...] The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile, [...] High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes [...] Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son [...] 380 [...] Of God most High; So God with man unites. [...] Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise [...] Expect with mortal paine: say where and when [...] Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel. [...] To whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight, [...] As of a Duel, or the local wounds [...] Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son [...] Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil [...] Thy enemie; nor so is overcome [...] Satan, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise, [...] 390 [...] Disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound: [...] Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, [...] Not by destroying Satan, but his works [...] In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be, [...] But by fulfilling that which thou didst want, [...] Obedience to the Law of God, impos'd [...] On penaltie of death, and suffering death, [...] The penaltie to thy transgression due, [...] And due to theirs which out of thine will grow: [...] So onely can high Justice rest appaid. [...] 400 [...] The Law of God exact he shall fulfill [...] Both by obedience and by love, though love [...] Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment [...] He shall endure by coming in the Flesh [...] To a reproachful life and cursed death, [...] Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe [...] In his redemption, and that his obedience [...] Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits [...] To save them, not thir own, though legal works. [...] For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd, [...] 410 [...] Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd [...] A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross [...] By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life; [...] But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies, [...] The Law that is against thee, and the sins [...] Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd, [...] Never to hurt them more who rightly trust [...] In this his satisfaction; so he dies, [...] But soon revives, Death over him no power [...] Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light [...] 420 [...] Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise [...] Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, [...] Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, [...] His death for Man, as many as offerd Life [...] Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace [...] By Faith not void of works: this God-like act [...] Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd, [...] In sin for ever lost from life; this act [...] Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength [...] Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes, [...] 430 [...] And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings [...] Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel, [...] Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep, [...] A gentle wafting to immortal Life. [...] Nor after resurrection shall he stay [...] Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer [...] To his Disciples, Men {{who in his}} Life [...] Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge [...] To teach all nations what of him they learn'd [...] And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve [...] 440 [...] Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe [...] Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life [...] Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall, [...] For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd. [...] All Nations they shall teach; for from that day [...] Not onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines [...] Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons [...] Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world; [...] So in his seed all Nations shall be blest. [...] Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend [...] 450 [...] With victory, triumphing through the aire [...] Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise [...] The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines [...] Through all his realme, & there confounded leave; [...] Then enter into glory, and resume [...] His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high [...] Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come, [...] When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe, [...] With glory and power to judge both quick & dead, [...] To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward [...] 460 [...] His faithful, and receave them into bliss, [...] Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth [...] Shall all be Paradise, far happier place [...] Then this of Eden, and far happier daies. [...] So spake th' Archangel Michael, then paus'd, [...] As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire [...] Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd. [...] O goodness infinite, goodness immense! [...] That all this good of evil shall produce, [...] And evil turn to good; more wonderful [...] 470 [...] Then that which by creation first brought forth [...] Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand, [...] Whether I should repent me now of sin [...] By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce [...] Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring, [...] To God more glory, more good will to Men [...] From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound. [...] But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n [...] Must reascend, what will betide the few [...] His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd, [...] 480 [...] The enemies of truth; who then shall guide [...] His people, who defend? will they not deale [...] Wors with his followers then with him they dealt? [...] Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n [...] Hee to his own a Comforter will send, [...] The promise of the Father, who shall dwell [...] His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith [...] Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write, [...] To guide them in all truth, and also arme [...] With spiritual Armour, able to resist [...] 490 [...] Satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts [...] What Man can do against them, not affraid, [...] Though to the death, against such cruelties [...] With inward consolations recompenc't, [...] And oft supported so as shall amaze [...] Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit [...] Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends [...] To evangelize the Nations, then on all [...] Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue [...] To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles, [...] 500 [...] As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win [...] Great numbers of each Nation to receave [...] With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length [...] Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run, [...] Thir doctrine and thir story written left, [...] They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, [...] Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves, [...] Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n [...] To thir own vile advantages shall turne [...] Of lucre and ambition, and the truth [...] 510 [...] With superstitions and traditions taint, [...] Left onely in those written Records pure, [...] Though not but by the Spirit understood. [...] Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, [...] Places and titles, and with these to joine [...] Secular power, though feigning still to act [...] By spiritual, to themselves appropriating [...] The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n [...] To all Beleevers; and from that pretense, [...] Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force [...] 520 [...] On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde [...] Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within [...] Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then [...] But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde [...] His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild [...] His living Temples, built by Faith to stand, [...] Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth [...] Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard [...] Infallible? yet many will presume: [...] Whence heavie persecution shall arise [...] 530 [...] On all who in the worship persevere [...] Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part, [...] Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes [...] Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire [...] Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith [...] Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on, [...] To good malignant, to bad men benigne, [...] Under her own waight groaning, till the day [...] Appeer of respiration to the just, [...] And vengeance to the wicked, at return [...] 540 [...] Of him so lately promis'd to thy aid, [...] The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, [...] Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, [...] Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald [...] In glory of the Father, to dissolve [...] Satan with his perverted World, then raise [...] From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd, [...] New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date [...] Founded in righteousness and peace and love, [...] To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss. [...] 550 [...] He ended; and thus Adam last reply'd. [...] How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, [...] Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time, [...] Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss, [...] Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach. [...] Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, [...] Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill [...] Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe; [...] Beyond which was my folly to aspire. [...] Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best, [...] 560 [...] And love with feare the onely God, to walk [...] As in his presence, ever to observe [...] His providence, and on him sole depend, [...] Merciful over all his works, with good [...] Still overcoming evil, and by small [...] Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak [...] Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise [...] By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake [...] Is fortitude to highest victorie, [...] And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life; [...] 570 [...] Taught this by his example whom I now [...] Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. [...] To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd: [...] This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe [...] Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs [...] Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers, [...] All secrets of the deep, all Natures works, [...] Or works of God in Heav'n, Air, Earth, or Sea, [...] And all the riches of this World enjoydst, [...] And all the rule, one Empire; onely add [...] 580 [...] Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith, [...] Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love, [...] By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul [...] Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath [...] To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess [...] A Paradise within thee, happier farr. [...] Let us descend now therefore from this top [...] Of Speculation; for the hour precise [...] Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards, [...] By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect [...] 590 [...] Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword, [...] In signal of remove, waves fiercely round; [...] We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; [...] Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd [...] Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd [...] To meek submission: thou at season fit [...] Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, [...] Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, [...] The great deliverance by her Seed to come [...] (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind. [...] 600 [...] That ye may live, which will be many dayes, [...] Both in one Faith unanimous though sad, [...] With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd [...] With meditation on the happie end. [...] He ended, and they both descend the Hill; [...] Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve [...] Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't; [...] And thus with words not sad she him receav'd. [...] Whence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know; [...] For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise, [...] 610 [...] Which he hath sent propitious, some great good [...] Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress [...] Wearied I fell asleep: but now lead on; [...] In mee is no delay; with thee to goe, [...] Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, [...] Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee [...] Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou, [...] Who for my wilful crime art banisht hence. [...] This further consolation yet secure [...] I carry hence; though all by mee is lost, [...] 620 [...] Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft, [...] By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore. [...] So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard [...] Well pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh [...] Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill [...] To thir fixt Station, all in bright array [...] The Cherubim descended; on the ground [...] Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist [...] Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides, [...] And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel [...] 630 [...] Homeward returning. High in Front advanc't, [...] The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd [...] Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat, [...] And vapour as the Libyan Air adust, [...] Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat [...] In either hand the hastning Angel caught [...] Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate [...] Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast [...] To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd. [...] They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld [...] 640 [...] Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat, [...] Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate [...] With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes: [...] Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon; [...] The World was all before them, where to choose [...] Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: [...] They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, [...] Through Eden took thir solitarie way.|$|E
