40|$|Transmitters and {{receivers}} are {{the basic}} elements of wireless networks and are characterized by a number of radio-electrical parameters. The generic planning problem consists in establishing suitable values for these parameters so as to optimize some network performance indicator. The version here addressed, namely the Power Assignment Problem (pap), is the problem of assigning transmission powers to the transmitters of a wirelessnetwork so as to maximize the satisfied demand. This problem has relevant practical applications both in <b>radio-broadcasting</b> and in mobile telephony. Typical solution approaches make use of mixed integer linear programs with huge coefficients in the constraint matrix yielding numerical inaccuracy and poor bounds and cannot be exploited to solve large instances of practical interest. In order to overcome these inconveniences, we developed a two-phase heuristic to solve large instances of pap, namely a constructive heuristic followed by an improving local search. Both phases are based on successive shortest path computations on suitable directed graphs.

40|$|When radio {{broadcasting}} started in 1925, people often saw the radio as a "mix {{of science and}} religion" and described its character as "Radio-Kibun (a kind of numinous feeling) ", indicating that people had hoped the new media would connect human beings to a new world. This feeling gradually faded over the ages, but it survived as a metaphor hidden behind culture. In 1950, when the Broadcasting Law was enacted and the ban was lifted on private <b>radio-broadcasting,</b> some religious groups started their own broadcastings out of a religious belief in the medium of the radio. In this paper, the different cases of Konko-kyo and Seicho-no-ie have been chosen for analysis; the former, because it had started broadcasting very early among new religions, and the latter, because it had {{a keen sense of}} using media. The staff of Konko-kyo saw the radio as a new means of propaganda and public enlightenment, but they were torn between these two uses in practice. Considering the social need at that time, they preferred a more enlightening program rather than a propagandists one, but their members thought it something missing and criticized them strictly it. The staff therefore had to seek a more effective way to balance the two, and put this dispute to rest by employing a narrative story about healing by unwavering faith. In the case of Seicho-no-ie, Masaharu Taniguchi, the leader, had a keen interest in radio not only as the tool of propaganda but also as a symbol of connection between human and mystical metaphysical object. His metaphorical remark about the radio {{can be seen as a}} reflection of the line of thinking which had been cultivated in the religious backdrops of Oomoto, New Thought, and Spiritualism, as well as in the social background of "Radio Kibun". Through these cases, we can see that they reflect their own religious colors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUnder the {{spectrum}} of identity crisis, the village becomes, in the collective mind, the quintessence of traits of a spiritual space. Hence, the acute need of authenticity and the tendency of intensifying the journalistic approaches, reminding sometimes of the neorealist trend in cinematography. Reconstituting the present is the topic of a constant oscillation between hyperaesthetic and anti-hyperaesthetic (in {{order to avoid the}} idyllic evocation), real-imaginary (as it is and as it was the functioning of variants in which folk creations and implicitly, folk reconstitutions being considered as inevitable), objectivity- bias (negative journalism being a side of a practice that becomes more and more aggressive). The reconstitution of the present in the rural space implies difficulties in selecting the identification marks: topic, characters and symbolic space. Their approach is carried out through the respect of life ritualization, having as a central focus point the identity issue and the study of social relationships. At a brief analysis of human resources employed directly in radiophonic production at Regional Radio Romania we arrived at the following data that can give us a clue on the profile of the journalist at the regional public radio: The demographic profile of the public results from the audience surveys carried out at national level and analyzed by Gold Group of the Romanian Society of <b>Radio-broadcasting.</b> The Editorial Profile. The regional public radio and the public radio specialized in reflecting rural civilization are the promoters of keeping an archive, of maintaining the authentic musical record library with the help of which we can reconstitute the spiritual profile for the Romanian rural environment {{and with the help of}} which we can reconstruct “the social face”(Erving Goffman). Oral history has the greatest impact by radiophonic broadcasts, because it is based upon the creation of empathy, an immediate reaction to direct style. It constitutes itself as identity discourse. Identity and memory are inter-conditioned. Collective memory is a meta-memory, a complex social representation. It is a model of valuation, endowed with a role of community pedagogy (M. Halbwachs). Radiophonic broadcasts on the rural environment are a memorial story and constitute themselves in a projection of identity. Through them, through the tendency of recovery of patterns, society can avoid and win over the identity crisis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} linguistic {{technical training}} {{of members of}} the community, under a Participatory Action Research approach. We show how it can be a contributing factor to obtain an egalitarian relationship between the speaking community and the external researchers. Also, this training increases the self-sufficiency of the indigenous team, and facilitates their role as agents in research, while being an effective element to facilitate the community’s empowerment process and strengthen their agentive role in linguistic research. The project concerns the Mayangna community of North Eastern Nicaragua. The Mayangna linguists’ team, a team of indigenous linguists, had been established in the mid 1990 ’s and had been working on the collection of oral history, traditional folktales, and life stories. The team had also received linguistic training. At this point the need to consolidate the linguistic data and its analysis called for an optimization of the handling of the data. The external member of the team provided, then, the technical training for transfer and annotation of the linguistic data collected, which involved the following steps: (a) the use of (video, audio) equipment for (new) data recording, (b) the conversion of the collected data from analog to digital format, (d) the transfer of the linguistic data into ELAN software, and (c) its use for transcription and annotation. The external researcher arranged an ELAN template with the different fields relevant for the actual annotation: original text, sentence, word category, lexical meaning, inflectional information, and Spanish and English translations. The Mayangna team worked with this template in the training sessions, where the whole process (a-d above) was reviewed step-by-step. Once the training sessions were completed, the team of local linguists was able to do the actual recording, transferring and annotation tasks by themselves. These materials will be used in the bilingual educational system, in <b>radio-broadcasting</b> programs and for cultural revival activities. This experience of PAR, involving the equal collaboration {{of members of the}} Mayangna community and external researchers, provides an example of how a multi-faceted, continuous linguistic training enhances the process of decision making by the members of the speaking community, since the members of the community, as owners of the data, decide what kinds of elements are to be collected and analyzed and, eventually, what the research will focus on. Besides, this training component results in the empowerment of the language community, as it contributes to their self-sufficiency and autonomy as a linguistic team...|$|E
