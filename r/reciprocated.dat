5|$|The {{following}} year New Zealand <b>reciprocated</b> and toured Australia. Windon played twice for the New South Wales Waratahs against the touring All Blacks, {{and in one}} of the two test matches. The tour was treated as a trial for Australia's 1947–48 tour of Europe and North America that commenced later that year. Windon played 27 matches on the 36-match tour, and in all five test matches: against Scotland, Ireland, Wales, England and France.

40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors operation under the control of Vibration-Based Diagnostics monitoring systems, dwells upon the issues of usage of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors valves by various vendors and their influence on compressors’ vibroactivity. An adequate evaluation of vibroactivity of piston machines is provided by the Russian regulative database on vibration parameters. Main differences of Russian and global methods of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors health evaluation, particularly, used frequency range, are presented in the article. It is shown that the approach laid in Russian standards on <b>reciprocating</b> compressors vibration regulations, ensures true-to-life assessment of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors assemblies and details condition. The examples given in the article confirm that the criteria of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors repair correctness assessment should be the machinery health, including its vibroactivity, not just mindless usage of new components purchased from the global brands. Practical examples of operation and monitoring of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors show that Russian developments and products, particularly, scientific-methodological and standards base of Vibration-Based Diagnostics monitoring, <b>reciprocating</b> compressors monitoring systems, <b>reciprocating</b> compressors valves are highly competitive with foreign ones, and sometimes even superior to them in parameters and characteristics, which is a positive factor under the conditions of current economic situation and import substitution policy...|$|R

5|$|At the time, Diệm {{had little}} {{authority}} beyond {{the gates of}} his own palace. Bảo Đại had little confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diem resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two decades earlier, believing {{the head of state}} to be weak and ineffective. Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's ability to attract U.S. support and funding. During the transition period, the French Expeditionary Corps maintained a presence in South Vietnam. This led to tension between France and the State of Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who <b>reciprocated,</b> hoping he would fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.|$|E

50|$|The {{compression}} process occurs over approximately 2 to 2½ rotations of the crankshaft, {{compared to}} one rotation for rotary compressors, and one-half rotation for <b>reciprocating</b> compressors. The scroll discharge and suction processes occur {{for a full}} rotation, compared to less than a half-rotation for the <b>reciprocating</b> suction process, and less than a quarter-rotation for the <b>reciprocating</b> discharge process. <b>Reciprocating</b> compressor have multiple cylinders (typically, anywhere from two to six), while scroll compressors only have one compression element. The presence of multiple cylinders in <b>reciprocating</b> compressors reduces suction and discharge pulsations. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} state whether scroll compressors have lower pulsation levels than <b>reciprocating</b> compressors as has often been claimed by some suppliers of scroll compressors. The more steady flow yields lower gas pulsations, lower sound and lower vibration of attached piping, while having no influence on the compressor operating efficiency.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He <b>reciprocated</b> with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E

5|$|Banza was {{appointed}} {{minister of finance}} and minister of state in the new government. The regime first secured diplomatic recognition from President François Tombalbaye of neighboring Chad, whom Bokassa met in Bouca, Ouham. After Bokassa <b>reciprocated</b> by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at Fort Archambault, the two decided to help one another if either {{was in danger of}} losing power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials to convince them that the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, French President Charles de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the Central African Republic on 17 November 1966. To the new government, this visit meant that the French had accepted the new changes in the country.|$|E

50|$|A <b>reciprocating</b> {{electric}} motor is a motor {{in which the}} armature moves back and forth rather than circularly.

50|$|<b>Reciprocating</b> {{compressors}} {{often have}} better unloading capabilities than scroll compressors. <b>Reciprocating</b> compressors operate efficiently in unloaded mode when flow {{to some of}} the cylinders is completely cut off by internal solenoid valves. Two-stage <b>reciprocating</b> compressors are also well suited for vapor injection (or what may be called economized operation) when partially expanded flow is injected {{between the first and second}} compression stages for increased capacity and improved efficiency. While scroll compressors can also rely on vapor injection to vary the capacity, their vapor injection operation is not as efficient as for the case of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors. This inefficiency is caused by continuously changing volume of the scroll compressor compression pocket during the vapor injection process. As the volume is continuously being changed the pressure within the compression pocket is also continuously changing which adds inefficiency to the vapor injection process. In case of a two-stage <b>reciprocating</b> compressor the vapor injection takes place between the two stages, where there is no changing volume. Both scroll and <b>reciprocating</b> compressors can be unloaded from mid-stage compression, however <b>reciprocating</b> compressors are also more efficient for this mode of unloading than scroll compressors, because the unloaded port dimensions in case of scroll is limited by the internal port size, which would not be the case for a <b>reciprocating</b> compressor where unloading again occurs from between the two stages.|$|R
40|$|Background: Spinal {{cord injury}} {{patients}} walk with a flexed trunk when using <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthoses. Reduction of trunk flexion during ambulation may produce {{an improvement in}} gait parameters for <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis users. Objectives: To investigate the effect on kinematics and temporal–spatial parameters when spinal cord injury patients ambulate with an advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis while wearing a thoracolumbosacral orthosis to provide trunk extension. Study design: Comparative study between before and after use o thoracolumbosacral orthosis with the advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthoses. Methods: Four patients {{with spinal cord injury}} were fitted with an advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis and also wore a thoracolumbosacral orthosis. Patients walked along a flat walkway either with or without the thoracolumbosacral orthosis at their self-selected walking speed. Temporal–spatial parameters and lower limb kinematics were analyzed. Results: Mean walking speed, step length, and cadence all improved when walking with the thoracolumbosacral orthosis donned compared to the trunk support offered by the advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis. Hip and ankle joint ranges of motion were significantly increased when wearing the thoracolumbosacral orthosis during ambulation. Conclusion: Using an advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis when wearing a thoracolumbosacral orthosis can improve walking speed and the step length of walking as compared with walking with an advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis, probably due to the extended position of the trunk. Clinical relevance Donning the thoracolumbosacral orthosis produced a relatively extended trunk position in the advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis for all the patients included in the study, which resulted in improved gait parameters...|$|R
