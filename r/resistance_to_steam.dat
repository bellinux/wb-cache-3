40|$|Sanicro 25 is a newly {{developed}} advanced high strength heat resistant austenitic stainless steel. The material shows good <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> oxidation and flue gas corrosion, and has higher creep rupture strength than other {{austenitic stainless steels}} available today. It is thus an excellent candidate for superheaters and reheaters for advanced ultra-super critical power plants with efficiency higher than 50  %. This paper provides {{a study on the}} creep–fatigue interaction behavior of Sanicro 25 at 700  °C. Two strain ranges, 1 and 2  %, and two dwell times, 10 and 30  min, were used. The influences of dwell time on the cyclic deformation behavior and life has been evaluated. Due to stress relaxation the dwell time causes a larger plastic strain range compared to the tests without dwell time. The results also show that the dwell time leads to a shorter fatigue life for the lower strain range, but has no or small effect on the life for the higher strain range. Fracture investigations show that dwell times result in more intergranular cracking. With the use of the electron channeling contrast imaging technique, the influences of dwell time on the cyclic plastic deformation, precipitation behavior, recovery phenomena and local plasticity exhaustion have also been studied.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work completed to evaluate cladding materials {{that could serve}} as improvements to Zircaloy in terms of accident tolerance. This testing involved oxidation <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> or H{sub 2 }- 50 % steam environments at 800 - 1350 C at 1 - 20 bar for short times. A selection of conventional alloys, SiC-based ceramics and model alloys were used to explore a wide range of materials options and provide guidance for future materials development work. Typically, the SiC-based ceramic materials, alumina-forming alloys and Fe-Cr alloys with {ge} 25 % Cr showed the best potential for oxidation resistance at {ge} 1200 C. At 1350 C, FeCrAl alloys and SiC remained oxidation resistant in steam. Conventional austenitic steels do not have sufficient oxidation resistance with only {approx} 18 Cr- 10 Ni. Higher alloyed type 310 stainless steel is protective but Ni is not a desirable alloy addition for this application and high Cr contents raise concern about {alpha}{prime} formation. Higher pressures (up to 20. 7 bar) and H{sub 2 } additions appeared to have a limited effect on the oxidation behavior of the most oxidation resistant alloys but higher pressures accelerated the maximum metal loss for less oxidation resistant steels and less metal loss was observed in a H{sub 2 }- 50 %H{sub 2 }O environment at 10. 3 bar. As some of the results regarding low-alloyed FeCrAl and Fe-Cr alloys were unexpected, further work is needed to fundamentally understand the minimum Cr and Al alloy contents needed for protective behavior in these environments in order to assist in alloy selection and guide alloy development...|$|E

40|$|Molybdenum based alloy is {{selected}} {{as a candidate}} to enhance tolerance of fuel to severe loss of coolant accidents due to its high melting temperature of ∼ 2600 [*]°C and ability to maintain sufficient mechanical strength at temperatures exceeding 1200 [*]°C. An outer layer of either a Zr-alloy or Al-containing stainless steel {{is designed to provide}} corrosion resistance under normal operation and oxidation resistance in steam exceeding 1000 [*]°C for 24 [*]hours under severe loss of coolant accidents. Due to its higher neutron absorption cross-sections, the Mo-alloy cladding is designed to be less than half the thickness of the current Zr-alloy cladding. A feasibility study has been undertaken to demonstrate (1) fabricability of long, thin wall Mo-alloy tubes, (2) formability of a protective outer coating, (3) weldability of Mo tube to endcaps, (4) corrosion resistance in autoclaves with simulated LWR coolant, (5) oxidation <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> at 1000 – 1500 [*]°C, and (6) sufficient axial and diametral strength and ductility. High purity Mo as well as Mo[*]+[*]La 2 O 3 ODS alloy have been successfully fabricated into ∼ 2 -meter long tubes for the feasibility study. Preliminary results are encouraging, and hence rodlets with Mo-alloy cladding containing fuel pellets have been under preparation for irradiation at the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) in Idaho National Laboratory. Additional efforts are underway to enhance the Mo cladding mechanical properties via process optimization. Oxidation tests to temperatures up to 1500 [*]°C, and burst and creep tests up to 1000 [*]°C are also underway. In addition, some Mo disks in close contact with UO 2 from a previous irradiation program (to > 100 [*]GWd/MTU) at the Halden Reactor have been subjected to post-irradiation examination to evaluate the chemical compatibility of Mo with irradiated UO 2 and fission products.

40|$|AbstractIn severe loss of coolant {{accidents}} (LOCA), {{similar to}} those experienced at Fukushima Daiichi and Three Mile Island Unit 1, the zirconium alloy fuel cladding materials are rapidly heated due to nuclear decay heating and rapid exothermic oxidation of zirconium with steam. This heating causes the cladding to rapidly react with steam, lose strength, burst or collapse, and generate large quantities of hydrogen gas. Although maintaining core cooling remains the highest priority in accident management, an accident tolerant fuel (ATF) design may extend coping and recovery time for operators to restore emergency power, and cooling, and achieve safe shutdown. An ATF is required to possess high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> oxidation to reduce hydrogen generation and sufficient mechanical strength to maintain fuel rod integrity and core coolability. The initiative undertaken by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an ATF cladding with capability to maintain its integrity in 1, 200 – 1, 500 °C steam for at least 24 hours. This ATF cladding utilizes thin-walled Mo-alloys coated with oxidation-resistant surface layers. The basic design consists of a thin-walled Mo alloy structural tube with a metallurgically bonded, oxidation-resistant outer layer. Two options are being investigated: a commercially available iron, chromium, and aluminum alloy with excellent high temperature oxidation resistance, and a Zr alloy with demonstrated corrosion resistance. As these composite claddings will incorporate either no Zr, or thin Zr outer layers, hydrogen generation under severe LOCA conditions will be greatly reduced. Key technical challenges and uncertainties specific to Mo alloy fuel cladding include: economic core design, industrial scale fabricability, radiation embrittlement, and corrosion and oxidation resistance during normal operation, transients, and severe accidents. Progress in each aspect has been made and key results are discussed in this document. In addition to assisting plants in meeting Light Water Reactor (LWR) challenges, accident-tolerant Mo-based cladding technologies {{are expected to be}} applicable for use in high-temperature helium and molten salt reactor designs, as well as nonnuclear high temperature applications...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of two-phase concurrent flow of steam and water conducted (Verma et al., 1985) {{and a set of}} relative permeability curves was obtained. These curves were compared with semi-empirical results (Brooks and Corey, 1964) and experimental results obtained by other investigators (Johnson et al., 1959, and Osoba et al., 1951) for two-phase, two-component flow (oil/gas; gas/water; gas/oil). It was found that while the wetting phase relative permeabilities were in good agreement, the relative permeability for the steam phase was considerably higher than the relative permeabilities of the non-wetting phase (oil in oil/water and non-condensing gas in gas/oil or gas/water) in two-component systems (Figs. 1 and 2). This enhancement of steam relative permeability is attributed to phase transformation effects at the pore level in flow channels. There are two separate mechanisms by which phase transformation affected relative permeability CUTVBS (1) phase transformation in converging-diverging flow channels with hydrophilic walls can cause an enhancement of steam phase relative permeability; and (2) phase transformation along the interface of a stagnant phase and the phase flowing around it controls the irreducible phase saturation of the stagnant phase (Verma, 1986). A pore level model was considered to study the first mechanism. In this model a pore space, shown in Figure 3, is idealized as a toroidal flow channel (Fig. 4) with a throat radius r, and pore body radius rb. Flow of steam and water through the throat portion of a pore was modeled using the MULKOM simulator (Pruess, 1983). The results indicate that when steam encounters a pore throat of a highly constricted flow channel in high conductivity solid, a fraction of the flowing steam condenses upstream from the constriction, depositing its latent heat of condensation. This heat is conducted through the solid grains around the pore throat, and evaporation takes place downstream. Therefore, for a given bulk flow quality, a smaller fraction of steam actually flows through the throat segments. Since steam has much higher kinematic viscosity than liquid water, and since the throat segments are the primary contributors to the overall flow resistance in the flow channels, the phase transformation effects reduce the overall <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> flow along channels with varying cross sections. This pore-level effect manifests itself as relative permeability enhancement on a macroscopic level. However, our numerical studies indicate that for typical pores found in sandstone this effect is negligible. The second effect was studied by applying thermodynamic stability criteria to stagnant phases in pore space. Our study indicates that: (1) irreducible phase saturation for the steam phase will be negligible small when the liquid phase is flowing in the direction of lower thermodynamic pressure and temperature; and (2) irreducible phase saturation for the liquid phase will generally be negligible when steam is flowing in the direction of lower thermodynamic pressure and higher temperature. Detailed derivation of these results is given in a forthcoming report (Verma, 1986). We conclude that the enhancement of steam relative permeability observed in our experiment is due to a reduction in irreducible steam phase saturation in comparison to the irreducible phase saturations for the non-wetting phase in the oil-water and oil-gas experiments with which we have compared our results...|$|E

The mechanisms at different temperatures and loading conditions have been identified. The interactions between dislocations and precipitates and their contribution to the creep rupture strength have been discussed.

A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat) at 121°C at 100 kPa, which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10−4 for a product with a bioburden of 106 and a D-value of 2.0 minutes. Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} two decades the rubber {{division}} of BJ-Hughes, has been in the forefront of rubber technology as applied to products for the oil-well drilling industry. We welcomed the opportunities presented when we were selected to participate in the GEM program and extend our appreciation to L'Garde Inc., Department of Energy and Radian Corporation. Our first efforts, approximately 15 months ago were to duplicate the four compounds recommended by L'Garde and verify our ability to obtain equal physical properties. After some minor problems in obtaining exact duplication of the chemicals. we did succeed in matching the properties obtained by L'Garde. Aflas, a copolymer of teflon and propylene manufactured in Japan by Asahi Glass and represented by Xenox. Inc., is the basis elastomer for GEM formulation 291. Advantages of Aflas are high temperature resistance up to 550 F. (Short term), resistance to H{sub 2 }S and amine environment, acids, basis, many solvents and hydrocarbons. It also has excellent <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> and will not hydrolize when exposed to high temperature and high pressure steam. It has excellent physical properties including long term compression-set resistance at high temperature. We have submitted two products manufactured from GEM 297 to customers for evaluation. One was an accumulator bladder for a hydraulic pumping system with hot oil on one side and nitrogen on the other. However, our customer reported that its service life was no better than they experienced with epichlorhydrin. The second application was an '' 0 '' ring for sealing a bearing in a drill bit. Compound 291 was {{one of a group of}} compounds and did not perform as well as several of the others. At the present time we are not planning any further investigation of this compound unless some application would seem to require Aflas over other elastomers. Viton, which is a DuPont fluoroelastomer, forms the basis for GEM formulation 255. Although the particular viton used in the original work is no longer available, a currently available material is equal or better in all respects. Most applications of Viton involve a sealing function of some sort. Lasting sealability when exposed to high heat, pressure, and aggressive chemicals or hydrocarbons is the strong point of Viton. Compared to the earlier compound, 255 shows superior resistance to oils and organic fluids and very good resistance to hot water, steam and aqueous acids. We did extensive work with the compound, evaluating various modifications and adjusting for several possible applications. Sample products submitted to customer for evaluation include packers, stabilizers, O'rings and bladders. We have also submitted compression-set buttons and tensile slabs at prospective users request. Of these, the stabilizers and O'rings were outperformed by other materials, while results with the packers and bladders have not been completed. We feel 255 is an excellent compound and that along with our variations, these Viton materials will be very useful in future products. GEM formulation 266 (a blend of Viton and EPDM) was also the basis of extensive investigation for us. We checked many variations, including DuPonts recommendations for such blends and in general, we feel such compounds are a promising compromise for some difficult applications. So far we have submitted drill-bit O'rings which did not prove resistant enough to abrasion; and stabilizers, which are still to be evaluated...|$|E

New steels {{are being}} {{developed}} to achieve high creep strength as well as high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> oxidation in <b>steam,</b> <b>to</b> be used for new generation steam turbine components, which are expected to operate at 600 - 650 ºC {{in order to reach}} higher power generation efficiency. In particular, components such as steam pipes as well as turbine rotors, casings and blades must be resistant to the growth {{as well as to the}} exfoliation of oxides. New materials with very high creep strength have been developed by lowering the Cr content, but preliminary field test has shown an unacceptable high rate of oxidation and spalling. In recent studies carried out by our group within the framework of the COST 522 action, a number of commercially available coatings were explored for steam oxidation protection. These included materials known to have good high temperature oxidation resistance and deposited by techniques that can be employed <b>to</b> coat large <b>steam</b> turbine components either at the plant or at their location of manufacture, and also taking into consideration economical aspects. Promising results were obtained both at the laboratory scale as well as at field testing. For instance slurry aluminide coatings applied on P 92 (9 wt % Cr) are protective for at least 25, 000 h at 650 ºC (tests are still ongoing). The results presented in this paper explore the behaviour of aluminide coatings applied on different steels (P 22, P 23 and P 92). P 22 and 23 are 2 wt. % Cr steels with excellent high temperature mechanical properties and are less expensive than higher Cr materials, but nevertheless exhibit much higher steam oxidation rates. The effect of Cr as well as W on the steam oxidation rate of both coated and uncoated specimens is explored. Laboratory steam oxidation testing as well as characterization of the coatings both before and after exposure will be presented. The results have provided information regarding the mechanism of protection and degradation of these coatings as well as insight for new coating development...|$|R
