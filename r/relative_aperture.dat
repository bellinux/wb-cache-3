This form of spectrometer design offers the potential for an exceptionally compact instrument for differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) applications particularly from space (LEO, GEO orbits) and from HAPs or ground-based platforms.

These parameters included coupling efficiency, effective numerical apertures, lens radius, lens refractive index, wavelength, magnification in imaging the laser diode on the fiber, and defocus to counterbalance spherical aberration of the lens. Limiting numerical apertures in object and image space were determined under the constraint that the lens perform to the Rayleigh criterion of 0. 25 -wavelength (Strehl ratio = 0. 80).

40|$|AbstractA {{variable}} pupil generally {{regulates the}} amount of incoming light available for image formation on the retina. However, some of the semi-aquatic snakes (North American Gartersnakes, Thamnophis) that forage in relatively low light conditions reduce the pupil aperture in response to submergence underwater at the expense incoming light. Given that these snakes have all-cone retinas, reduction of incoming light because of pupillary constriction upon immersion seems counterintuitive. To test the effect of light and water on pupil aperture, three species of North American Gartersnakes (T. atratus, T. hammondii, and T. sirtalis) were exposed to nine light intensities in air and water. There was no effect of light on <b>relative</b> pupil <b>aperture</b> for any species. However, all three species showed {{a significant reduction in}} pupil aperture upon submergence underwater. The lack of a light response is surprising, and {{may be related to the}} method of accommodation in snakes. Snakes lack a ciliary muscle, and move the lens by constricting the pupil, which increases pressure in the posterior chamber and pushes the lens forward. Upon submergence, the snakes may be attempting to overcome the change in refractive index and defocus imposed by the water, by constricting the pupil. Thus, having the iris muscle involved in accommodation may preclude it from much of a light regulating function...|$|R

A long-focus lens of small aperture can be of very simple construction to attain comparable image quality: a doublet (two elements) will often suffice.

40|$|AbstractFracture {{aperture}} {{is commonly}} {{assumed to be}} a linear function of fracture length, stress, and elastic material properties. Under constant stress, fracture opening displacement may change without concurrent length or height growth if the material effectively weakens after initial linear elastic fracture growth by changes in elastic properties or by non-elastic deformation processes. To investigate the kinematics of fracture opening and its dependence on length and height growth, we reconstructed the opening history of three opening-mode fractures that are bridged by crack-seal quartz cement. Similar crack-seal cement bridges had been interpreted to form by repeated incremental fracture opening and subsequent precipitation of quartz cement. Using scanning electron microscope cathodoluminescence imaging, we determined the thickness and number of crack-seal cement layers as a function of position along fracture length and height. Observed trends in crack-seal cement layer thickness and number of fracture opening increments are consistent with non-linear fracture growth kinematics, consisting of an initial stage of fast fracture propagation <b>relative</b> to <b>aperture</b> growth, followed by a stage of slow propagation and pronounced aperture growth. Consistent with earlier fluid inclusion observations indicating fracture opening and propagation occurring over 40 – 50  m. y., we interpret the second stage of pronounced aperture growth and slow propagation to result from fracture opening strain accommodated by solution-precipitation creep and concurrent slow, possibly subcritical, fracture propagation...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>relative</b> <b>aperture</b> is {{specified}} as an f-number, {{the ratio}} of the lens focal length to its effective aperture diameter. A small f-number like 2.0 indicates a large aperture (more light passes through), while a large f-number like 22 indicates a small aperture (little light passes through). Aperture settings are usually not continuously variable; instead the diaphragm has typically 5-10 discrete settings. The normal [...] "full-stop" [...] f-number scale for modern lenses is as follows: 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, but many lenses also allow setting to half-stop or third-stop increments.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Four study {{sites were}} {{selected}} along an altitudinal gradient on Mt. Ashland in the Siskiyou Mountains of southern Oregon. The altitudinal gradient roughly corresponded to a gradient in temperature and water availability ranging from very hot and dry to cool and moist. Air and soil temperatures were continuously measured {{on each of}} the plots by recording thermographs. Periodic measurements of atmospheric humidity were taken on each plot, and daily humidity data taken by the U. S. Forest Service were also used. The environmental data were used to develop a mathematical model of daily changes in vapor concentration gradient. Measurements of diurnal patterns of xylem water potential (plant moisture stress) in young Douglas-fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) were made at intervals throughout the summers of 1969 and 1970, using the pressure bomb technique. Xylem water potential was found to be at a maximum value before dawn, and would decrease to approximately - 15 atm during the day, then recover to a maximum level the following night. This maximum value of xylem water potential is believed to roughly correspond to soil water potential over the entire root zone. The maximum, or pre-dawn, xylem water potential values gradually decreased throughout the rainless summers, from - 3 to - 5 atm in the spring to values ranging from - 12 to - 28 atm in September depending on location. The seasonal decrease in pre-dawn xylem water potential was described mathematically by an exponential function. <b>Relative</b> stomatal <b>aperture</b> was estimated by a stomatal infiltration technique. The relationship of <b>relative</b> stomatal <b>aperture</b> values to stomatal resistance was determined, where the log of stomatal resistance was found to be directly proportional to the pressure required to infiltrate the stomatal pores. The stomata of Douglas-fir were found to be open at night in the spring, but were fully closed at night during the months of July through September. Stomatal opening during the summer months was triggered only by actual sunrise [...] the pre-dawn diffuse light had no effect. It was suggested that nocturnal stomatal behavior may be influenced by phenological changes. The stomata tended to open to some maximum aperture in the morning, then would remain at that aperture or would close {{to a greater or lesser}} extent throughout the day. The rate of diurnal stomatal closure appeared to be related in some manner to pre-dawn plant moisture stress and other factors. When the soil was fully hydrated, the stomata would remain at the maximum aperture throughout the day. Later in the season, as soil moisture availability decreased (reflected in higher pre-dawn plant moisture stress), the stomata would tend to close: slowly when under moderate moisture stress, faster when under severe stress. The daily maximum stomatal aperture was found to be correlated with pre-dawn plant moisture stress. Stomatal behavior of Douglas-fir was found to be unaffected by soil temperatures greater than 2 °C. The observations on stomatal behavior were described mathematically. The models of vapor concentration deficit and stomatal behavior were incorporated into a digital computer simulation model of seasonal transpiration in Douglas-fir. Applications of the model in forestry and plant ecology are described...|$|R
