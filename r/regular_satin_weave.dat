Along the length and width of one unit cell, local strain fields can vary significantly due to the yarn interlacing pattern.

For this case, the specimens are under compressive strain initially and are under tensile strain during the later part of loading. The induced tensile strain is higher than the induced compressive strain. This could lead to failure of specimen/structure under tensile strain even though the applied load is compressive.

5000|$|<b>Satin</b> is a <b>weave</b> that {{typically}} has a glossy surface and a dull back. The <b>satin</b> <b>weave</b> {{is characterized by}} four or more fill or weft yarns floating over a warp yarn or vice versa, four warp yarns floating over a single weft yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies {{on top of the}} weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are [...] "floated" [...] over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a <b>satin</b> <b>weave</b> using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a satin, although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an experimental method {{for determining the}} local strain distribution in the plies of a thermoplastic 5 -harness <b>satin</b> <b>weave</b> composite under uni-axial static tensile load. In contrast to unidirectional composites, the yarn interlacing pattern in textile composites causes heterogeneous strain fields with large strain gradients around the yarn crimp regions. In addition, depending on the local constraints that are imposed by the surrounding plies, the deformation behaviour of the laminate inner layers may vary {{from that of the}} surface layers, which are relatively more free to deform, compared to the inner layers. In order to validate the above hypothesis, the local strains on the composite surface were measured using digital image correlation technique (LIMESS). Internal strains in the composite laminate were measured using embedded Fibre Optic Sensors (FOS). Based on the DIC results, the strain profiles at various locations on the composite surface were estimated. Using the FOS results, the maximum and minimum strain values in the laminate inner layers were evaluated. Comparison of the local strain values at different laminate positions provides an estimate of the influence of the adjacent layers on the local longitudinal strain behaviour of a <b>satin</b> <b>weave</b> composite. Part II of this paper elucidates the local strain variation computed using the meso-FE simulations.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the strain distribution in the plies of a thermo-plastic 5 -harness <b>satin</b> <b>weave</b> composite, a comprehensive experimental and numerical analysis is conducted under uni-axial static tensile load. In textile composites, depending on the local constraints posed by surrounding plies, the out-of-plane deformation behavior of a yarn crimp in the laminate inner layers is different from that of surface layers, which are relatively more free to deform compared to the inner layers. The above mentioned difference in deformation behaviour of various plies may cause the difference in the local strain behaviour for a chosen ply in the laminate. In order to validate the above hypothesis, local strain distribution on the laminate surface is quantified using digital image correlation technique. Internal strains in the composite laminate were measured using embedded fibre optic sensors. Finally, unit cell meso-FE analysis provided the substantial evidence to understand the effect of internal yarn shifting on the local strain behavior of the 5 -harness <b>satin</b> <b>weave</b> composite...|$|R
