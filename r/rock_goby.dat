Some species actively change colour and pattern for camouflage {{on a range of}} background types. Such dynamic camouflage may be particularly advantageous for species inhabiting heterogeneous habitats, such as intertidal zones, where individuals are exposed to both terrestrial and marine predators depending on tides and wave action. Most studies of dynamic pattern camouflage have focused on relatively few species, and rarely species inhabiting the intertidal zone. We used image analysis and predator (avian) vision modelling to determine if <b>rock</b> <b>gobies</b> (Gobius paganellus) change their body pattern in response to their background, and to explore how background marking size influence pattern change. <b>Rock</b> <b>gobies</b> rapidly (within 1 min) changed their pattern when placed on checkerboards with different sized squares, and on backgrounds resembling natural substrates. On backgrounds resembling natural substrates, those with a small grain size, such as sand, elicited a larger degree of pattern change than those with a larger grain size. However, despite this, the majority of fish showed little or no improvement in background matching over time. Instead, the markings elicited are characteristic of disruptive coloration, and may function primarily through breaking up the body outline rather than via improved match to the background pattern itself.

5000|$|In PÃ³voa de Varzim {{there are}} {{subtropical}} and temperate fish species. Tide pools often only exist as separate entities only {{at low tide}} and are habitats of diverse adaptable animals and algae. The most common fish in tide pools are blennies (generally called marachomba), including: Parablennius gattorugine, Parablennius pilicornis, Coryphoblennius galerita, Lipophrys pholis, and Lipophrys trigloides. Other small fish recorded locally include worm pipefish, <b>rock</b> <b>gobies</b> and snail-fish. In larger tide pools, schools of juvenile sargo seabreams, Zebra seabreams, small-headed clingfish, brilliantly-coloured and camouflaged wrasses such as the green wrasse, the Common Wrasse and the Ballan Wrasse, rocklings and juveniles of other species of fish are frequently found.|$|R
40|$|Camouflage {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of species living in {{numerous}} habitat types, offering protection from visually guided predators. This includes many species from the intertidal zone, which must cope with background types diverse in appearance and with multiple predator groups foraging at high and low tide. Many animals are capable of either relatively slow (hours, days, weeks) or rapid (seconds and minutes) colour change in order to better resemble the background against which they are found, but most work has been restricted to a few species or taxa. It is often suggested that many small intertidal fish are capable of colour change for camouflage, yet little experimental work has addressed this. Here, we test <b>rock</b> <b>gobies</b> (Gobius paganellus) for colour change abilities, and whether they can tune their appearance to match the background. In two experiments, we place gobies on backgrounds of different brightness (black or white), and of different colours (red and blue) and use digital image analysis and modelling of predator (avian) vision to quantify colour and luminance (perceived lightness) changes and camouflage. We find that gobies are capable of rapid colour change (occurring within one minute), and that they can change their luminance on lighter or darker backgrounds. When presented on backgrounds of different colours, gobies also change their colour (hue and saturation) while keeping luminance the same. These changes lead to predicted improvements in camouflage match to the background. Our study shows that small rockpool fish are capable of rapid visual change for concealment, and that this may be an important mechanism in many species to avoid predation, especially in complex heterogeneous environments...|$|R

40|$|For the {{majority}} of animals, the ability to orient in familiar locations is a fundamental part of life, and spatial memory allows individuals to remember key locations such as food patches, shelter, mating sites or areas regularly occupied by predators. This study determined if gobies collected from rocky platforms and sandy beaches differ {{in their ability to}} learn and memorise the locations of tide pools in a simulated rocky intertidal zone. Intertidal <b>rock</b> pool <b>gobies</b> show acute homing abilities and, therefore, should be expected to display superior learning and memory capabilities. In contrast, it is unlikely that natural selection would favour similar learning skills in sandy shore fishes because they simply shift back and forth with the tides. The learning abilities of gobies were tested using small replica rock platforms, containing four tide pools that retained varying depths of water at simulated low tide. Gobies were categorised as having learnt the task if they were able to consistently locate the tide pool that retained the most water at simulated low tide as the pool with the most favourable conditions. Rock pool species were able to locate the deepest pool to wait out low tide for ~ 95 % of the trials, while species from sandy shores were found in the deepest pool ~ 10 % of trials. Despite repeated stranding, sandy shore fish continued to follow the tide out. We propose that rock pool species memorised the location of rock pools during simulated high tide enabling them to relocate the best refuge for low tide. 9 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>goby</b> reproduces in spring. It nests {{in rocky}} areas near the kelp forest, Up to 7000 eggs are laid, {{in a single}} layer, under rocks and shells. The eggs (up to 7000) are laid {{in a single layer}} (2.5 mm in height) and guarded aggressively by the male. The eggs hatch in about 19 days.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>goby</b> {{is usually}} black with white blotches - {{although}} the male {{is much more}} black when guarding the eggs. The neck area lacks scales {{and there is a}} pale band on the top of first dorsal fin. Both dorsal fins lack black spots on their leading edges. This species can reach a length of 12 cm TL and has been known to live for ten years.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>goby</b> {{is found}} in the {{temperate}} East Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. Its range extends from western Scotland southwards to the Azores and Senegal, most of the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. It sometimes migrates through the Suez Canal to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. It prefers rocky sea floors below the low tidemark, although it can be found in larger rock pools in Summer. It may also live in fresh or brackish water. It can be found at depths of from 0 to 15 m.|$|E
50|$|The {{stream is}} an {{important}} seasonal freshwater artisanal fishery producing an annual catch, as of 2016, of about US$500,000 from an average weekly catch of 5 to 15kg by each fisherman. In the lower reaches of the stream, this low catch of smaller immature fish is evidence of lack of management of the fishery. Less than 1% {{to as much as}} 10% of the local population may be engaged at least part-time as fishermen, most are men. Full-time fishermen earn about US$1,000 to 2,000 per year, which is below the poverty line. Gill nets, cast nets, long lines, fish hooks and line sets, spears, traps and traditional fishing boats are used. The catch includes Snapper (Aha-an), Flagtail (Aligaman), Crab (Alimango), Red-tailed goby (Anga), Squaretail mullet (Balanak), Goby (Batinga), Silver perch (Bugaong), Otomebora Mullet (Bunak), Indo-Pacific Tarpon (Buwan-buwan), Loach goby (Dalapakan), Mountain bass (Damagan), Indian pellona (Ibis), Flathead grey mullet (Gisaw), Gourami (Gurami), Mudfish (Halu-an), Shrimp (Hipon, Goby (Iswil), Carp (Karpa), Eel (Kasili), Spotted Scat (Kikilo), Mullet (Muli), Cyprinidae (Pait), Catfish (Pantat), <b>Rock</b> <b>goby</b> (Pigok), Mangrove red snapper (Tadlungan), Tilapia. The fishing season is the dry season, November to May, in the mid and upper ranges of the stream and flood season, June to October, in its lower reaches when large fish are being washed down.|$|E

40|$|The pink muscle {{of several}} Teleosts was {{examined}} immunohistochemically using antisera specific for the myosins {{of red and}} white muscle, and histochemically using various methods for demonstrating myosin ATPase (mATPase) activity. In the catfish the pink muscle consists of 2 different layers of fibres. The superficial layer has a low mATPase activity after both acid and alkali pre-incubation, whereas the deeper layer has a high mATPase activity after acid and alkali pre-incubation, being more resistent to these conditions even than is the white muscle. In the trout the pink muscle is composed of fibres with the same mATPase activity as in the superficial pink muscle of the catfish, whereas in the <b>rock</b> <b>goby,</b> goldfish, mullet and guppy the pink muscle is like the deep pink layer of the catfish. Immunohistochemically the fibres of the pink muscle behave like the white muscle fibres except in the guppy and <b>rock</b> <b>goby</b> in which {{at the level of}} the lateral line there occurs a transition zone between red and pink fibres. The fibres of this region react with both anti-fast and (to a lesser extent) anti-slow myosin antisera, and have a mATPase activity which, going from the superficial to the deeper fibres, gradually loses the red muscle characteristics to acquire those of the main pink muscle layer...|$|E
40|$|Camouflage {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} anti-predator strategies in nature. Many animals use a combination of both morphological and behavioural means. Camouflage can be particularly challenging in heterogeneous environments, and as such some animals have evolved under selection to change colour to enable them to camouflage on a range of different background types. One such species is the <b>rock</b> <b>goby</b> (Gobius paganellus), a common rockpool fish capable of rapidly (within one minute) changing its colour and luminance (perceived lightness) when placed on different backgrounds. The <b>rock</b> <b>goby</b> provides a good model for studying rapid colour change in fish inhabiting habitats such as rocky shores that tend to be highly heterogeneous, and where fish may be exposed to both terrestrial and marine predators depending on tidal level. I used digital image analysis and a model of predator vision to quantify changes in colour, luminance, pattern, and camouflage. In chapter 2 I investigate the ability of rock gobies to match the colour of sand and algae covered rock, and test whether a fishâs previous background affects their ability to match a new one. I also tested their ability to match a range of different background brightness. Finally, I ask whether rock gobies exhibit behavioural background matching in addition to adaptive colour change. In chapter 3 I ask whether rock gobies change their body pattern in response to their visual background, and then whether the spatial frequency of more natural backgrounds influences pattern change. I found that the gobies rapidly changed colour and luminance in response to the different backgrounds and an individualâs previous background had no effect on its ability to change colour and camouflage on a new background. The level of camouflage did however differ between backgrounds whereby some colours and brightness appeared easier to match than others. Rock gobies also showed a behavioural preference for darker backgrounds over lighter ones. Moreover, gobies are capable of rapidly changing their body pattern in response to their background, with high spatial frequency substrates such as sand inducing the greatest change in pattern. This thesis shows that small rockpool fish use a combination of rapid colour and pattern change, and behaviour background choice, to camouflage themselves against their background...|$|E
40|$|Copyright Â© 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands. Basic {{biological}} {{information for}} a sublittoral {{population of the}} <b>rock</b> <b>goby</b> Gobius paganellus Linnaeus, 1758 is presented based on a 2 -year study involving 1680 specimens. The length-weight relationship was given by TW = 0. 0089 * TL^ 3, 163 (where TW= total weight in g; TL= total length in mm). Age at length data were inferred by modal analysis of the monthly length-frequency distributions. The parameters of the fitted Von Bertalanffy growth equation (with seasonal component, birth date on the 1 st of January) were L 1 = 13. 8 cm; K = 0. 73 yr^- 1; to = - 0. 22 yr; C = 0. 95; W = 0. 07. This growth rate {{is much higher than}} that described for northern Europe populations (where K is about 0. 3 yr^- 1) and is probably associated with a shorter life span. Macroscopic examination of the gonads, and analysis of the monthly values of the gonadosomatic index, indicated that reproduction occurs in winter and early spring, with a maximum in February and March, when water temperatures are lowest. Individuals become sexually mature around 6 - 7 cm TL, a size that can be reached in less than 1 year. By contrast, individuals of this goby in the British Isles mature in their second or third year. Stomach contents were mainly small benthic invertebrates, predominantly crustaceans...|$|E
