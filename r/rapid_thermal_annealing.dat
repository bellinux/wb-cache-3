The {{reason for this}} is the {{relatively}} long thermal cycles of furnaces causes dopants that are being activated, especially boron, to diffuse farther than is intended.

50|$|Nanoscale metal {{catalysts}} {{are important}} ingredients for fixed- and fluidized-bed CVD synthesis of CNTs. They allow increasing the growth efficiency of CNTs and may give {{control over their}} structure and chirality. During synthesis, catalysts can convert carbon precursors into tubular carbon structures but can also form encapsulating carbon overcoats. Together with metal oxide supports they may therefore attach to or become incorporated into the CNT product. The presence of metal impurities can be problematic for many applications. Especially catalyst metals like nickel, cobalt or yttrium may be of toxicological concern. While unencapsulated catalyst metals may be readily removable by acid washing, encapsulated ones require oxidative treatment for opening their carbon shell. The effective removal of catalysts, especially of encapsulated ones, while preserving the CNT structure is a challenge and has been addressed in many studies. A new approach to break carbonaceaous catalyst encapsulations is based on <b>rapid</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>annealing.</b>|$|E

Unique heat treatments are designed for different effects. Wafers can be heated in order to activate dopants, change film-to-film or film-to-wafer substrate interfaces, densify deposited films, change states of grown films, repair damage from ion implantation, move dopants or drive dopants from one film into another or from a film into the wafer substrate.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a detailed {{investigation of the}} deposition of ZrO 2 using a metallorganic precursor in a 300 mm wafer processing ALD system. The ZrO 2 films {{in this study were}} characterized by inline spectroscopic ellipsometry and corona-oxide-semiconductor measurements, and offline Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A growth temperature window between 215 °C and 340 °C was investigated and the thermal CVD rate was observed to increase above 265 °C, thus representing an upper temperature boundary for ALD-dominated growth. For a saturated process at 265 °C, a within-wafer non-uniformity of < 2 % for films deposited using 8 cycles or greater was obtained. An in-situ capping with TiN followed by an in-situ post-deposition <b>rapid</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>anneal</b> was also performed in order to assess the thermal stability of the deposited gate stack. For <b>rapid</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>annealed</b> films (≥ 900 °C) with a TiN cap, no significant thermally-induced chemical changes were observed while a peak in the XRD spectra attributable to tetragonal and/or cubic phase ZrO 2 was observed.

On subsequent <b>rapid</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>annealing</b> all the Tb-Fe films exhibited in-plane magnetic anisotropy.

It {{was found that}} by optimizing the microstructure, i. e., texture and morphology of the polysilicon layers, and by optimizing the post dielectric deposition anneal, very high-quality dielectric layers can be obtained. In this paper it is shown on simple capacitor structure level and full EEPROM device level that the electrical properties of interpoly dielectric layers can be improved tremendously by using deposited dielectric layers with additional <b>rapid</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>anneal.</b> Typical results are: a high charge-to-breakdown (QBD≈ 25 C/cm 2), low leakage currents and decreased charge trapping during constant current stress.

From electrical evaluation it appeared that even for deposited dielectric layers the influence of polysilicon surface roughness and corners is considerable.

40|$|Advanced {{hydrogen}} lithography {{techniques and}} low-temperature epitaxial overgrowth enable patterning of highly phosphorus-doped silicon (Si:P) monolayers (ML) with atomic precision. This approach to device fabrication has made Si:P monolayer systems a testbed for multiqubit quantum computing architectures and atomically precise 2 -D superlattice designs whose behaviors are directly {{tied to the}} deterministic placement of single dopants. However, dopant segregation, diffusion, surface roughening, and defect formation during the encapsulation overgrowth introduce large uncertainties to the exact dopant placement and activation ratio. In this study, we develop a unique method by combining dopant segregation/diffusion models with sputter profiling simulation to monitor and control, at the atomic scale, dopant movement using room-temperature grown locking layers (LL). We explore the impact of LL growth rate, thickness, <b>rapid</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>anneal,</b> surface accumulation, and growth front roughness on dopant confinement, local crystalline quality, and electrical activation within Si:P 2 -D systems. We demonstrate that dopant movement can be more efficiently suppressed by increasing the LL growth rate than by increasing LL thickness. We find that the dopant segregation length can be suppressed below a single Si lattice constant by increasing LL growth rates at room temperature while maintaining epitaxy. Although dopant diffusivity within the LL is found to remain high even below the hydrogen desorption temperature, we demonstrate that exceptionally sharp dopant confinement with high electrical quality within Si:P monolayers {{can be achieved by}} combining a high LL growth rate with a low-temperature LL <b>rapid</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>anneal...</b>|$|R
