Two uncured systems were subjected to thermal gravimetric analysis and compaction experiments. Composites were then produced in an autoclave at pressures of 1, 3 and 5 bars. Void analysis was carried out on the cured laminates by optical microscopy and void contents ranging from below 1 % to over 20 % were obtained by image analysis. The primary source of voids was shown to be <b>resin</b> <b>starvation</b> {{based on the results of}} the compaction tests. Tensile properties were shown to be strongly degraded by fabric crimp. Short beam tests revealed a 16 % decrease in interlaminar shear strength with a 3. 5 % increase in void content. Similarly, water absorption tests showed a significant increase in rate of absorption likely due to the presence of voids. The results suggest that in order for flax/epoxy prepregs to reach their full potential, the level of crimp and the evacuation of moisture during cure should be of primary concern. status: publishe...|$|E
