40|$|Abstract — Niobium-microalloyed steel {{has become}} a {{standard}} material in plate and strip for line pipe, automotive and construction use. The effects of controlled rolling parameters and microcontent Nb on the mechanical properties of medium carbon steels were studied in this work. For these purpose two steel grades, with and without niobium, was planed and after steelmaking and continuous casting, rolling process was done. Then, laboratory investigations such as microstructure, mechanical properties and grain size analysis were performed. Tensile and Charpy impact tests specimens were machined out of {{the central part of}} the <b>rolled</b> <b>billets.</b> The microstructure of the specimens was examined for each experimental condition using optical microscopy. The results indicate that, increasing the reheating temperature above the dissolution temperature of (Nb) (C, N) improved the impact energy values. By increasing the cooling rate from 0. 5 to 1. 5 °C/s both tensile strength and impact toughness were improved. High elongation percent was also observed on samples reheated at higher temperature and/or cooled with the higher cooling rates. The obtained mechanical properties were related to the characteristics of microstructural components including acicular ferrite, retained austenite, pearlite and ferrite...|$|E

40|$|In {{spline rolling}} process, the billet is mainly driven by {{frictional}} moment at initial forming stage that from starting rolling to billet/workpiece rotated half circle. If {{the rotation of}} billet is not normally driven by rolling die, then the motion between billet and rolling die is not coordinated, and then dividing precision of external spline will be reduced. Thus, the rotatory condition of <b>rolled</b> <b>billet</b> was established in this work. The rotatory condition for the rolling process of spline with even number of teeth {{is different from that}} with an odd number of teeth. However, the changing trends for both rotatory conditions are the same. The results indicated that (i) the rotatory condition can be improved when the friction between die and billet increases or the outside diameter of rolling die increases, (ii) the rotatory condition for odd number of teeth is better than that for even number of teeth, and (iii) the outside diameter of rolling die should be five times greater than the diameter of billet before rolling according to the rotatory condition. The reasonable decrement can be selected by comprehensive considering of rotatory condition and geometry of rolling die...|$|R
40|$|GRCop- 84 is a copper-chromium-niobium alloy {{developed}} by the Glenn Research Center for liquid rocket engine combustion chamber liners. GRCop- 84 exhibits superior properties over conventional copper-base alloys in a liquid hydrogen-oxygen operating environment. The Next Generation Launch Technology program has funded a program to demonstrate scale-up production capabilities of GR-Cop 84 to levels suitable for main combustion chamber production for the prototype rocket engine. This paper describes a novel method of manufacturing the main combustion chamber liner. The process consists of several steps: extrude the GR-Cop 84 powder into <b>billets,</b> <b>roll</b> the <b>billets</b> into plates, bump form the plates into cylinder halves and friction stir weld the halves into a cylinder. The cylinder is then metal spun formed to near net liner dimensions followed by finish machining to the final configuration.

40|$|Existing {{methods for}} calculating the {{residual}} life of <b>rolls</b> for <b>billet</b> continuous casting machines (BCCM) {{are based on}} the fracture mechanics principles. However, these procedures for predicting the residual life are not sufficiently reliable, which leads to considerable errors [1, 2]. One of the causes for the overestimation of the design service life of a structure is little understanding of the process of coalescence of surface cracks, which makes it impossible to assess the degree of damage to a roll in full and to ensure the operating safety [3, 4]. The main way of obtaining the information on a roll state is its technical diagnostics based on the nondestructive inspection techniques. The optical inspection of surface damage, and the assessment of the microcrack morphology in particular, is very promising [5, 6]. In order to create hardware/software tools for diagnostics of an object state, it is necessary to validate physical models, software and adequacy of identification and measurement of the damage accumulation processes [6]- The aim of the present paper is to develop the conceptual framework and scientific-methodical support for the quality control of optical inspection of surface crack network for enhancing the safety of critical-purpose elements (using a roll for BCCM as an example). A procedure for numerical analysis of the surface state of a <b>roll</b> for a <b>billet</b> continuous casting machine at the stage of coalescence of thermal fatigue cracks has been developed and implemented which is based on the identification of photo image elements.

40|$|When using continuous-cast billet in pipe rolling, it is {{expedient}} to <b>roll</b> the <b>billet</b> {{prior to}} broaching, {{so as to}} improve the structure and properties of the steel. To that end, a three-high screw-rolling mill for billet reduction has been installed at the TPA- 80 pipe-rolling unit at OAO Sinarskii Trubnyi Zavod. Introduction of the new process was associated with increase in the rejection rate on account of indentations in the pipe. These indentations {{may be attributed to}} the depression formed {{at the rear of the}} billet in reduction and the subsequent formation of metallic semicircles on broaching; the semicircles break away and enter the deformation zone. The sources of the indentations on the rolled pipe are investigated. The broaching of the billet on a screw rolling mill is mathematically simulated. Recommendations are made with a view to reducing the surface defects on pipe produced by the TPA- 80 unit with a reduction mill. © 2013 Allerton Press, Inc...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, Finite Element {{method and}} {{full-scale}} experiments {{have been used}} to study a hot forging method for fabrication of a spindle using reduced initial stock size. The forging sequence is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the hot <b>rolled</b> cylindrical <b>billet</b> is pre-formed and pierced in a closed die using a spherical nosed punch to within 20 mm of its base. This process of piercing or impact extrusion leads to high strains within the work piece but requires high press loads. In the second stage, the resulting cylinder is placed in a die with a flange chamber and upset forged to form a flange. The stock mass is optimized for complete die filling. Process parameters such as effective strain distribution, material flow and forging load in different stages of the process are analyzed. It is concluded from the simulations that minor modifications of piercing punch geometry to reduce contact between the punch and emerging vertical walls of the cylinder appreciably reduces the piercing load. In the flange chamber, a die surfaces angle of 52 ° instead of 45 ° is proposed to ensure effective material flow and exert sufficient tool pressure to achieve complete cavity filling.

40|$|During {{the heating}} for rolling, ingots and billets are {{affected}} by the chemical action of the heating atmosphere. Between the heating environment elements and steel components there are taking place chemical reactions initiated at the separation surface that may affect a layer in metal of about a few microns to a few millimeters.

40|$|Abstract: Reinforced bars (rebars) are Thermo-mechanically treated (TMT) bars hot <b>rolled</b> from steel <b>billets</b> {{produced}} from scrap melted in an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) at {{a temperature of}} about 1600 ℃ (usually 1580 ℃). Weight per meter of a low carbon steel rebar is one aspect which has been neglected by some steel producers during the tensile testing in the rod mill. Determination of weight per metre is explicitly required for a TMT rebar. Any reduction in mass will mean a lowering in capacity of the steel reinforcing bar. A series of “heat” numbers or batches of molten steel from an EAF {{for the production of}} steel sample A, (Y 10 and Y 12 rebars), were observed at a Steel plant to investigate the effect of weight per meter of reinforced bar on the mechanical properties and microstructure. The rolling speed range was 3 m/s to 14 m/s for different “heats”. Two other steel samples B and C were sourced from the local market to compare with Sample A. Samples collected from different sources on the local market, however, showed lower values of weight per meter different from the prescribed standards. This did not only affect the ultimate tensile strengths which were higher than normal but also the microstructure which deviated from the standard for this material. Sample A, did not only show a good combination of tensile strength and yield stress of 450 MPa and a maximum tensile strength of 650 MPa but also a standard pearliteferrite microstructure, while sample B and C exhibited excessive high strengths and brittle behaviour and can be prone to failure...|$|R
40|$|Operation under {{thermomechanical}} loading causes {{initiation of}} cracks {{on the surface}} of metallurgical equipment, in particular, rollers of continuous billet casting machines (CCM) [1]. Growth of these cracks results in their coalescence into a thermal cracking network. Its development unloads adjacent roller sections thus impeding their cracking. Nevertheless, a dominant crack stands apart within the network, which is formed either by individual crack extensions or by coalescence of separate cracks. The growth of this crack may lead to structural failure [2]. At present, a number of methods are used in order to identify individual fatigue cracks, however, evaluating the parameters of a network of cracks is a more complex task [3, 4]. A number of approaches are developed for analyzing the material surface cracking, however they all need to be improved further and adapted to geometric peculiarities of real cracked structures of CCM rollers [5, 6]. Thus, the purpose of this work is to develop an algorithm for identifying surface cracking with a view to describing the elements of the network of cracks and performing their quantitative analysis. A procedure for numerical analysis of the surface state of a <b>roll</b> for a <b>billet</b> continuous casting machine at the stage of coalescence of thermal fatigue cracks has been developed and implemented which is based on the identification of photo image elements.

40|$|The paper {{conducts a}} {{strength}} and weakness analysis of deformation accumulation processes {{and methods of}} deformation structure refinement of metal engineering materials. The processes used to have ultrafine-grained structure materials (submicro- and nanocrystal ones with a size of grains less than 1 μm and less than 100 nm) through the plastic deformation are called the general term ‘severe plastic deformation’ (SPD) or the term ‘mega-plastic deformation’ (MPD). The structure refinement methods using rolling process are classified. It is shown that rolling methods, as the most productive ones for the pressure metal treatment, are the most appropriate to produce large-sized, submicro- and nanostructured <b>billets.</b> <b>Rolling</b> allows production of large-sized billets, namely slabs, blooms, sheets, and wide strips on the existing rolling mills without using the special costly equipment. Processes can be broken into two main groups: - processes without changing cross section of a billet; - processes with its changing cross section. The considered processes can be also classified by a continuity degree. Lengthwise rolling, cross-screw rolling, drawing, pressing, and reverse bending belong to the processes allowing production of long components. A continuous deformation process can be possible in reverse bending, lengthwise rolling, and drawing; experiments {{are under way to}} create equipment to provide continuous extruding by Conform process. Shortcomings of the most known SPD methods (torsion under high pressure, equal channel angular pressing (ECAP), and its variations) are: - poor productivity and their complicated application to the large-sized billets; - use of the non-standard expensive equipment demanding high manufacturing accuracy; - use of lengthy- and costly-produced powder materials for nanodimensional billets, thus affecting their price; - complexity of retention of received nanodimensional structure. Possibility for producing the large-sized billets with ultrafine-grained and nanodimensional structure on the standard equipment in industrial scales is key advantage of the rolling method against the other methods of processing by pressure used to create nanostructured materials. </p...|$|R
