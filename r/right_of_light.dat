50|$|There {{are several}} {{circumstances}} where the grant of an easement may be implied, usually occurring on the conveyance of land. Where land is transferred, subject to contrary intention, existing easements are automatically conveyed under Section 62 of the Law of Property Act 1925. Additionally - and controversially {{in some cases}} - 'precarious' rights, such as licenses or personal rights may be transformed into legal easements, as demonstrated in International Tea Stores Co v Hobbs. In this case a right of way granted as a license by a land owner was transformed into an easement, following the conveyance of land into a legal estate. A limitation of Section 62 {{is that it does}} not act to imply reservation easements; for example, a land owner in common ownership of two plots of land could not claim that, after selling one plot, his remaining plot should have an easement for <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> implied. Other circumstances where easements may be implied are where they are necessary for the enjoyment of land.|$|E

5000|$|The word freeway {{was first}} used in February 1930 by Edward M. Bassett. Bassett argued that roads should be {{classified}} into three basic types: highways, parkways, and freeways. [...] In Bassett's zoning and property law-based system, abutting property owners have the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> air and access to highways, but not parkways and freeways; the latter two are distinguished in {{that the purpose of}} a parkway is recreation, while the purpose of a freeway is movement. [...] Thus, as originally conceived, a freeway is simply a strip of public land devoted to movement to which abutting property owners do not have <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> air or access.|$|R

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{analysis of the}} perception of audiovisual synchrony has shown that auditory delays are tolerated {{to a certain extent}} in synchrony judgments, but the variation of spatial separation between light and sound has brought conflicting results: While Lewald & Guski (2003) did not find a significant influence of spatial separation in synchrony judgments, Spence et al (2003) did find one in temperal order judgments. This may be due to methodological differences between synchrony and temporal order judgments, but it may also be due to spatial congruity, which was randomized by Lewald & Guski, and was confounded with spatial separation by Spence et al. (2003). The present contribution asks if audiovisual synchrony judgments are influenced (1) by the sound reproduction system, and (2) by the spatial congruity of light and sound. The results of an experiment are presented that asks participants for quick Yes/No-Responses with repect to audiovisual synchrony and varies systematically three factors: (a) the audiovisual synchrony (- 250 to + 250 ms), (b) the sound reproduction system (earphones vs. loudspeakers), and c) the spatial congruity (left and <b>right)</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and sound stimuli. The results do not show a systematic influence of spatial compatibility of the audiovisual stimuli on raw synchrony judgments...|$|E
40|$|Easement means, a right {{enjoyed by}} the owner of land over the lands of another: such as rights of way, <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> rights of support, rights to a flow of air or water etc. The {{dominant}} tenement is the land owned by the possessor of the easement, and the servient tenement is the land over which the right is enjoyed. An easement must exist for the accommodation and better enjoyment {{to which it is}} annexed, otherwise it may amount to mere licence. An easement benefits and binds the land itself and therefore countinious despite any change of ownership of either dominant or servient tenement, although it will be extinguished if the two tenemants come into common ownership. An easement can only be enjoyed in respect of land. This means two parcels of land. First there must be a 'dominant tenement' and a 'servient tenement'. Dominant tenement to which the benefit of the easement attaches, and another (servient tenement) which bears the burden of the easement. A positive easement consist of a right to do something on the land of another; a negative easement restrict the use of owner of the serviant tenement may make of his land. An easement may be on land or on the house made on land. The next classification is on easement on the ground, and the other one under the ground. An easement shall be done in accordance with the principle of restrictions. This means that the less burden the servient tenement. When there is doubt about the extent of the actual easement shall take what easier the servient tenement. The new needs of the dominant estate does not result in the expansion of servitude.

Designing school facilities to incorporate the <b>right</b> types <b>of</b> <b>light</b> at the <b>right</b> time <b>of</b> day for the right duration may improve student performance and well-being.
