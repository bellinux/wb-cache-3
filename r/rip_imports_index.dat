Using a correction based on the falling expenditure share on sampled countries, we find that the income elasticity of aggregate U.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to elucidate the epidemiology of one local community outbreak caused by DENV- 4 in Guangzhou city, China, in 2010; and to determine the molecular characteristics of the genotype II virus involved. Case presentations During September and October of 2010, one imported case, a Guangzhou resident who travelled back from Thailand, resulted in 18 secondary autochthonous cases in Guangzhou City, with an incidence rate of 5. 53 per 10, 000 residents. In indigenous cases, 14 serum samples tested positive for IgM against DENV and 7 for IgG from a total of 15 submitted serum samples, accompanied by 5 DENV- 4 isolates. With identical envelope gene nucleotide sequences, the two isolates (D 10168 -GZ from the <b>imported</b> <b>index</b> case and Guangzhou 10660 from the first isolate in the autochthonous cases) were grouped into DENV- 4 genotype II after comparison to 32 previous DENV- 4 isolates from GenBank that originated from different areas.

The source of data employed {{in this study is}} secondary data obtained from the Central bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin 2010. The statistical tool used in analyzing the data was the Permutation method for Hotelling T-Squared and Descriptive statistics. The result of the analysis showed that there exists a significant difference between monthly export and <b>import</b> commodities price <b>index</b> in Nigeria with a test statistic value of 58. 31 and a p-value of 0. 00 for 10, 000 permutations.

Hence, we conclude that export and <b>import</b> commodities price <b>index</b> in Nigeria are not equal and that <b>import</b> commodities price <b>index</b> has always been lager than export commodities price index. We advocate for more studies within the context of price statistics in Nigeria since the significance of price statistics in the economy of any nation cannot be overemphasized because they constitute a very useful tool for policy making, economic planning, analysis and monitoring.

40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of import price developments is an important but challenging issue which affects the way we look on consumers' welfare, real exchange rates and exchange rate pass-through. In this paper we propose an exact <b>import</b> price <b>index</b> which extends the approach by Broda and Weinstein (2006) who adjust price developments for changes in varieties of imported products. We relax two assumptions still underlying the Broda and Weinstein (2006) approach, thus allowing the set of imported goods and the quality to vary. This variety-, set-of-products-, and quality-adjusted <b>import</b> price <b>index</b> shows that gains from variety in European G 7 countries, although positive, are rather small compared to calculated gains from quality. Using HS 07 (vegetables) as our benchmark group of products with unchanged quality, we find significant gains from quality for Germany, France, Italy and the UK between 1995 and 2010. Although these results are not invariant to {{the choice of the}} benchmark category, they clearly stress the importance of incorporating the quality issues in empirical literature.

The consequent downward adjustment in import prices causes appreciation in the real exchange rate and lowers the excessive portion of imports (the difference between actual and theoretical amounts of imports obtained from the import demand equation). Since the early 2000 s, however, the role that new product varieties play in lowering the excessive portion of imports has declined because the impact of new products on import prices has been outweighed by the impact of the spike in primary commodity prices, which has resulted in a substantial depreciation of the real exchange rate. It is possible that this depreciation combined with relatively large excessive imports has caused the subsequent US current account deficit to stop expansion from the late 2000 s onwards. exact <b>import</b> price <b>index,</b> <b>import</b> demand equation, real exchange rate, US external imbalance,...|$|R
