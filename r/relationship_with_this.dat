Rilke changed his first name from “René” to “Rainer” at Lou's urging because she thought that name to be more masculine, forceful, and Germanic. His <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> married woman, with whom he undertook two extensive trips to Russia, lasted until 1900. But even after their separation, Lou continued to be Rilke's most important confidante until the end of his life.

[...] His <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> princess is vague at best, and the only clear part of this relationship is that Tim has made some sort of mistake which he hopes to reconcile or, if possible, erase. As one progresses through the six worlds in Braid, storyline text {{at the beginning of}} each world provides further insight into Tim's quest for the princess, and alludes to the overarching gameplay mechanic of each level. The themes evoked include forgiveness, desire, and frustration. The final level, in which everything but Tim moves in reverse, depicts the princess escaping from a knight, and working together with Tim to surpass obstacles and meet at her home. Tim is suddenly locked out of the house, and, as time progresses forward, reversing Tim's actions, the events show the princess running from Tim, setting traps that he is able to evade, until she is rescued by the knight. Tim is revealed to be the [...] "monster" [...] the princess is running from.|$|E

A month after completion of this work, in November 1892, he was offered a position as haiku editor in the paper that had published it, Nippon, and maintained a close <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> journal throughout his life. In 1895 another serial was published in the same paper, [...] "A Text on Haikai for Beginners", Haikai Taiyō. These were followed by other serials: Meiji Nijūkunen no Haikukai or [...] "The Haiku World of 1896" [...] where he praised works by disciples Takahama Kyoshi and Kawahigashi Hekigotō, Haijin Buson or [...] "The Haiku Poet Buson" [...] (1896–1897) expressing Shiki's idea of this 18th-century poet whom he identifies with his school of haiku, and Utayomi ni Atauru Sho or [...] "Letters to a Tanka Poet" [...] (1898) where he urged reform of the tanka poetry form.|$|E
2500|$|Before its {{establishment}} as a Republic, Rome {{was ruled}} by kings (Latin reges, singular rex). In Roman tradition, Rome's founder Romulus was the first. Servius Tullius was the sixth, {{and his successor}} Tarquinius Superbus (Tarquin the Proud) was the last. The nature of Roman kingship is unclear; most Roman kings were elected by the senate, as to a lifetime magistracy, but some claimed succession through dynastic or divine right. Some were native Romans, others were foreign. Later Romans had a complex ideological <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> distant past. In Republican mores and institutions kingship was abhorrent; and remained so, in name at least, during the Empire. On the one hand, Romulus was held to have brought Rome into being more-or-less at a stroke, so complete and purely Roman in its essentials that any acceptable change or reform thereafter must be clothed as restoration. On the other, Romans of the Republic and Empire saw each king as contributing in some distinctive and novel way to the city's fabric and territories, or its social, military, religious, legal or political institutions. Servius Tullius {{has been described as}} Rome's [...] "second founder", [...] "the most complex and enigmatic" [...] of all its kings, and a kind of [...] "proto-Republican magistrate".|$|E

2500|$|Later, {{coming off}} {{the heels of the}} {{conflict}} with Hannibal, Rome was preparing to embark on another military mission, this time in Greece. While they would eventually move on Philip V in the Second Macedonian War, there was considerable debate beforehand about the course Rome should take in this conflict. In the article [...] "Bellum Philippicum: Some Roman and Greek Views Concerning the Causes of the Second Macedonian War", E. J. Bickerman writes that [...] "the causes of the fateful war ... were vividly debated among both Greeks and Romans". Under the guise of protecting allies, Bickerman tells us, Rome was actually looking to expand its power and control eastward now that the Second Punic War was ended. But starting this war would not be an easy task considering those recent struggles with Carthage—many Romans were too tired of conflict to think of embarking on another campaign. As W. M. Owens writes in his article [...] "Plautus' Stichus and the Political Crisis of 200 B.C.", [...] "There is evidence that antiwar feeling ran deep and persisted even after the war was approved." [...] Owens contends that Plautus was attempting to match the complex mood of the Roman audience riding the victory of the Second Punic War but facing {{the beginning of a new}} conflict. For instance, the characters of the dutiful daughters and their father seem obsessed over the idea of officium, the duty one has to do what is right. Their speech is littered with words such as pietas and aequus, and they struggle to make their father fulfill his proper role. The stock parasite in this play, Gelasimus, has a patron-client <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> family and offers to do any job in order to make ends meet; Owens puts forward that Plautus is portraying the economic hardship many Roman citizens were experiencing due to the cost of war.|$|E
