40|$|The present {{research}} aims {{to develop a}} novel technique for creation of composite <b>riot</b> <b>helmet</b> shells with reinforcing fibre continuity for better protection against low velocity impacts. In this research an innovative, simple and effective method of making a single-piece continuously textile reinforced helmet shell by vacuum bagging has been established and discussed. This technique also includes the development of solid collapsible moulding apparatus from non-woven fibres. Angle-interlock fabric due to its good mouldability, low shear rigidity and ease of production is used in this research. Several wrinkle-free single- piece composite helmet shells have been manufactured. Low-velocity impact test on the continuously reinforced helmet shells has been carried out. For this purpose an in-house helmet shell testing facility has been developed. Test rig has been designed {{in such a way}} that the impact test can be carried out at different locations at the <b>riot</b> <b>helmet</b> shell. Low-velocity impact test has been successfully conducted on the developed test rig. The practical experimentation and analysis revealed that the helmet shell performance against impact is dependent on the impact location. The helmet shell top surface has better impact protection as compared to helmet shell side and back location. Moreover, the helmet shell side is the most at risk location for the wearer. Finite Element models were created and simulated in Abaqus software to investigate the impact performance of single-piece helmet shells at different impact locations. Models parts have been designed in Rhinoceros software. Simulated results are validated by the experimental result which shows that the helmet top position is the safest position against an impact when it is compared to helmet back and helmet side positions.

50|$|Observers {{have noted}} the militarizing of the {{policing}} of protests. Riot police are police who are organized, deployed, trained or equipped to confront crowds, protests or riots. Riot police may be regular police who act {{in the role of}} riot police in particular situations or they may be separate units organized within or in parallel to regular police forces. Riot police are used in a variety of different situations and for a variety of different purposes. They may be employed to control riots as their name suggests, to disperse or control crowds, to maintain public order or discourage criminality, or to protect people or property. In some cases, riot police may function as a tool of political repression by violently breaking up protests and suppressing dissent or civil disobedience.Riot police often use special equipment termed riot gear to help protect themselves and attack protesters or rioters. Riot gear typically includes personal armor, batons, riot shields and <b>riot</b> <b>helmets.</b> Many riot police teams also deploy specialized less-than-lethal weapons, such as pepper spray, tear gas, rifles that fire rubber bullets or plastic bullets, flashbang grenades, and Long Range Acoustic Devices (sound cannons).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. At {{the present}} there exist two {{different}} types of <b>riot</b> <b>helmet</b> shells, a thermoplastic and a composite shell. The composite shell is believed to be superior in impact performance, but more expensive and complicated in manufacturing partially {{due to the fact that}} the textile reinforcement material has to be cut into pattern pieces before they can be applied to the helmet shaped mould. However, the discontinuation of fibres is likely to reduce the level of protection and shorten the lifetime of a helmet. The aim of this research is to develop a helmet shell consisting of a single-piece of fabric without creating wrinkles and without the necessity of cutting the fabric. For this purpose, a new type of woven fabric has been developed and an apparatus has been set up to drape the fabric to a helmet shell. The helmet shell was manufactured using a single piece of Kevlar woven fabric. In parallel the finite element method is applied to investigate the shock absorption behaviour of the helmet shell made from both multi-piece and single-piece fabric reinforcements. The results show clearly the advantage of the single-piece helmet shell over its existing multi-piece counterpart...|$|R
