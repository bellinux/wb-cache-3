2500|$|Several {{devices have}} been {{developed}} that aim to objectively measure bruxism activity, either in terms of muscular activity or bite forces.

Examples include the [...] "Bruxcore Bruxism-Monitoring Device" [...] (BBMD, [...] "Bruxcore Plate"), the [...] "intra-splint force detector" [...] (ISFD), and electromyographic devices to measure masseter or temporalis muscle activity (e.g. the [...] "BiteStrip", and the [...] "Grindcare").|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Bellen has {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of novel technologies that accelerate Drosophila <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>are</b> currently used {{by the majority of}} fly labs today. Bellen was a leader in {{the development of}} P element-mediated enhancer detection which allows for discovery and manipulation of genes and was the impetus for a collaborative and ongoing project to generate an insertion collection for the community. Furthermore, Bellen and colleagues devised a new transformation technology that permits site-specific integration of very large DNA fragments, which led to the generation of a collection of flies carrying molecularly defined duplications for more than 90% of the Drosophila X-chromosome. Hundreds of Drosophila researchers utilize this collection. Most recently his lab created a new transposable element (MiMIC) that permits even more downstream manipulations via RMCE (recombinase-mediated cassette exchange), such as protein tagging and knockdown [...] and large scale homologous recombination. [...] His research constantly evolves with the changing technology {{to meet the needs of}} the Drosophila community.|$|E

Later, the family would move to San Jose, California where Mr. Olivo would work for an organization called , a job training program whose students are mostly Latino and which was funded in part by the Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers union. It was during this period, in the 1960s and 1970s, that Mr. Olivo came to be friends with Cesar Chavez. In the late 1970s, Mr. Olivo moved his family to the state of Oregon in order to found an Oregon branch of Center for Employment Training. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Mr. Olivo was involved with Colegio Cesar Chavez as both a student and as facilities manager, and he and his family also lived on the college grounds in Mount Angel, Oregon.
