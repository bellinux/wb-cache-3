40|$|Abstract: We have {{developed}} an alternative approach to the maximum likelihood method for calculating <b>recombination</b> <b>values</b> and linkage intensities. This new method is simpler than those in current use in that it obviates the need for formulae and tables. Maximum likelihood methods imply the use of iterative procedures over highly complicated estimation equations (at least second degree polynomials), whereas simplified methods use single-step procedures involving simple linear equations. The proposed method uses the frequencies of the distinguishable phenotypes {{that came from the}} union of at least one recombinant gamete with another gamete. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations for various combinations of genetic distance and offspring size. The <b>recombination</b> <b>values</b> obtained using the new method were compared with those derived by the maximum likelihood method on both simulated and experimental data. They were found to be nearly identical. The observed distribution of the <b>recombination</b> frequency <b>values</b> does not differ significantly from the Normal distribution, except for extreme values of the mean, as the Skewedness and kurtosis coefficients do not differ from zero. Our method has a similar accuracy to the maximum likelihood methods for recombination frequencies smaller than 25 cM and the difference does not increase greatly for greater frequencies...|$|R

5000|$|He is {{the first}} to show mathematically that in the {{presence}} of gene interaction natural selection always tends to enhance the linkage intensity between genetic loci or maintain the same linkage relationship. He then observed that the average <b>recombination</b> <b>value</b> per genome is generally lower in higher organisms than in lower organisms and attributed this observation to his theory of linkage modification. Recent molecular data indicate that many sets of interacting genes such as Hox genes, immunoglobulin genes, and histone genes have often existed as gene clusters for a long evolutionary time. This observation can also be explained by his theory of linkage modification. He also showed that, unlike R. A. Fisher’s argument, deleterious mutations can accumulate rather quickly on the Y chromosome or duplicate genes in finite populations. In 1969, considering the rates of amino acid substitution, gene duplication, and gene inactivation, he predicted that higher organisms contain a large number of duplicate genes and nonfunctional genes (now called pseudogenes). This prediction was shown to be correct when many multigene families and pseudogenes were discovered in the 1980s and 1990s. His notable contribution in the early 1970s is the proposal of a new measure of genetic distance (Nei’s distance) between populations and its use for studying evolutionary relationships of populations or closely related species. He later developed another distance measure called DA, which is appropriate for finding the topology of a phylogenetic tree of populations. He also developed statistics of measuring the extent of population differentiation for any types of mating system using GST measure. In 1975, he and collaborators presented a mathematical formulation of population bottleneck effects and clarified the genetic meaning of bottleneck effects. In 1979, he proposed a statistical measure called nucleotide diversity, which is now widely used for measuring the extent of nucleotide polymorphism. He also developed several different models of speciation and concluded that the reproductive isolation between species occurs as a passive process of accumulation of interspecific incompatibility mutations ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of calcium and {{magnesium}} on recombination in rice, the following experiments were made. F_ 1 plants heterozygous for Pl and lg were grown in the culture solution with various concentrations of CaO or MgO, and the <b>recombination</b> <b>value</b> was calculated from F, generation. Besides, to know {{the relation between the}} CaO and MgO concentration of solution and these contents of plant body, the contents were analyzed in a watercultured rice variety. The effect of calcium: Low concentration of CaO resulted, as shown by a chi square for heterogeniety between the low concentration and the optimal one, in the significant increases in <b>recombination</b> <b>value</b> (Tables 2 and 4). High concentration of CaO resulted, on the other hand, in a slight increase in the value, though the increment was not significant (Table 4). The effect of magnesium: Low concentration of MgO resulted in the increases in the <b>recombination</b> <b>value</b> (Tables 3 and 5). The increment was not significant in the first experiment because of an insufficient difference in the MgO concentration, however, significant in the second experiment. But the effect of magnesium on recombination was not so greater than that of calcium. High concentration of MgO brought about the same change in <b>recombination</b> <b>value</b> as the high CaO (Table 5). The CaO and MgO contents: The CaO contents of plant body were considerably altered by the MgO concentration of solution, even if the CaO concentration was identical, however, the MgO contents were hardly affected by the CaO concentration (Fig. 1). Therefore, in discussing the effect of calcium and magnesium on recombination, this fact must be considered. 1) イネの組換価におよぼすカルシウムおよびマグネシウムの影響を研究した. 2) Pl-lg連鎖を対象にして,F_ 1 をカルシウムあるいはマグネシウム濃度の異なる水耕液で育て,それらのF_ 2 から組換価を算出した. 3) カルシウムは低濃度では明らかに組換価を増加させた. 一方,高濃度でも組換価は若干増加したが,有意ではなかつた. 4) マグネシウムは低濃度では組換価を増加させた. その程度はカルシウムの場合より小さく,第 1 実験では有意な差は認められなかつた. しかし,第 2 実験では有意であつた. 高濃度では,カルシウムと同様,増加の傾向を示した. 5) 植物体のCaO含量は,水耕液のMgO濃度に影響され,CaO濃度が同一でもMgO濃度が高いとCaO含量は低くなる. これに対し,MgO含量に対するCaO濃度の影響は小さかつた. このことは,組換価におよぼすカルシウムおよびマグネシウムの影響を論ずるに際し,考慮しなければならない重要な問題を含んでいる. 6) カルシウムおよびマグネシウムは,直接染色体に作用するのではなく,生理的な役割を通じて組換価に影響をおよぼすものと考えられる...|$|E

Population sizes were eight, sixteen and forty-eight parents per generation.

In the remaining two lines there was no significant decrease in recombination value; there was, however, a significant increase in at least one subline of this group. The rapid rate of change of <b>recombination</b> <b>value</b> is most readily explained by the presence of a recombination modifying gene which is linked to the modified region.

40|$|Many linkage {{studies have}} been made since Parnell et al. (1917) {{reported}} a linkage in rice. However, the study on linkage variation in rice is few. In this paper, the effect of temperature on recombination in rice was examined. Two markers, Pl and lg, belonging to the second linkage group and three markers, dp_ 1, C and ws, belonging to the first linkage group were used. From a few day s before meiosis to heading time, F, plants heterozygous for Pl and lg were grown under controlled room of temperatures at 25, 30 and 33 ℃, and those for dp_ 1, C and ws at 25 and 33 ℃. <b>Recombination</b> <b>value</b> was calculated from F_ 2 segregation. The <b>recombination</b> <b>value</b> between Pl and lg was the highest at 25 ℃, and the heterogeneity among treatments was significant (Table 1). The values of dp_ 1 -C, C-ws and dp_ 1 -ws were also higher at 25 ℃ than at 33 ℃ (Tables 2, 3 and 4). The results disagree with those obtained in other organisms. For example, <b>recombination</b> <b>value</b> is higher at 30 ℃ than at 25 ℃ in Drosophila (Stern, 1926), and, in Sphaerocarpus, it is lower at 18 ℃ {{than at any other}} temperature of 10, 26 and 33 ℃ (Abel, 1963). It may be thought from these facts that the effect of temperature on recombination differs with different species. In order to make clear whether temperature affected crossing-over interference or not, coefficient of coincidence was calculated following relation; y_ 1 + 2 = y_ 1 + y_ 2 － 2 cy_ 1 y_ 2 where y_ 1, y_ 2, and y_ 1 + 2 are <b>recombination</b> <b>value</b> of dp_ 1 -C, C-ws and dp_ 1 -ws, respectively, and c is coefficient of coincidence. The value of c was also higher at 25 ℃ than at 33 ℃ (Table 5). It may be a noticeable phenomenon with respect to the role of temperature in the variation of recombination. 1) イネの組換価がいかなる要因によつて変異するかを明らかにするため,まず,組換価に及ぼす温度の影響を調査した. 2) Pl-lg連鎖については,F_ 1 を減数分裂期の直前より出穂始まで 25, 30 および 33 ℃の恒温室内で生育させ,それらのF_ 2 における形質の分離から組換価を算出した. dp_ 1 -C-ws連鎖の温度条件は 25 および 33 ℃とした. 3) Pl-lg組換価は 25 ℃区が 30 および 33 ℃区にくらべて大きく,その差は統計的に有意であつた. 4) dp_ 1 -C,C-wsおよびdp_ 1 -ws組換価も,Pl-lgと同じく, 25 ℃区の方が 33 ℃区より大きかつた. 5) これらの結果はイネの連鎖研究においても温度の影響を考慮すべきであることを示している. 6) 温度と組換価との関係は種によつて異なつており,とくにイネとDrosophilaでは全く逆であつた. 7) 本実験の温度範囲では組換価の変異の原因を染色体の対合程度の違いに求めることはできない. 8) 温度の違いによつて干渉の程度も変異したことは組換価の変異の機作を解明する重要な手がかりの 1 つであると考えた...|$|E
