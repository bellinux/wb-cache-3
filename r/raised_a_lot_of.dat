500|$|The {{core of the}} {{national}} park has been declared a 'biogenetic reserve' zone by the European Council with human activities such as woodcutting, grazing, hunting, fishing and access by car prohibited. In the park's buffer zone activities are also controlled in general. The most serious danger the park faced in the past were extensive fires caused by cattle breeders to create meadows for grazing. These fires have destroyed {{large parts of the}} Pinus nigra and P. heldreichii forests. However, since 1960, no fire has occurred due to improved protection measures by opening up many forest roads. [...] Furthermore, an observation post was established near Avgo peak. A potential threat for {{the national}} park is a state initiative to divert the Arkoudorema river {{for the construction of a}} hydroelectric power plant. This initiative will have a negative impact on the park since a great part of the existing forest area will be covered by water, resulting in the reduction of the core zone. Another danger is the high grazing pressure in the core area, while a number of small coal-producing units at the outskirts of the park have <b>raised</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> concern.|$|E
