50|$|Initial drying {{and firing}} of a <b>refractory</b> <b>castable</b> is a {{critical}} installation variable that can influence lining performance. Precast shapes are typically fired in a digitally-controlled furnace prior to shipment, ensuring that the refractory manufacturer's recommended bake-out schedule is closely followed. Since the shapes are fired slowly from all sides, the moisture is removed through the entire thickness of the shape in a controlled manner. Depending on the temperature to which the shape is fired, this can optimize the physical properties of the material through the entire thickness of the shape, not just the hot face surface. This results in a truly homogeneous lining. Micro-cracking within the shape, which are often introduced during field bake-out but may go unnoticed, may also be reduced since the initial firing is more controlled.|$|E
50|$|Regardless of how complex or {{sophisticated}} the <b>refractory</b> <b>castable</b> is that {{is selected}} for an application, the physical properties of the material can be drastically reduced if care is not taken during the mixing, pouring, and curing processes.

Unfortunately, lining quality is often compromised by field conditions during material placement. Precast roof panels ready for shipment. Project schedules, crew skill levels, equipment availability, job cost pressures, or other demands can sometimes influence proper refractory installation. Improper water addition, mix time variations, over- or under-vibration, and improper curing can drastically affect material quality. With precast shapes, cast in a controlled shop environment, the physical properties of a castable can be more fully optimized.|$|E

Alumina, {{with high}} melting point (2050 ºC), high {{hardness}} and mechanical strength, and excellent abrasion resistance, {{is one of the}} most common raw materials used in self-flow refractory castables (SFRC) for monolithic linings and is commercially available in various fine to coarse size classes. However, the performance of the refractory lining depends not only on the properties of its ingredients but also on its easy installation (good flowability). The aim of this work was to evaluate the relationship between the flowability index (FI) of fresh castable and the specific surface area (SSA) of its particles, which is mostly determined by the finer particles content. The results obtained showed that, by controlling the proportion between matrix and aggregate, it is possible to control the SSA of the <b>refractory</b> <b>castable</b> and find a mathematical relationship between the specific surface area and the minimum flowability index required to obtain a self-flow <b>refractory</b> <b>castable.</b> It is, thus, possible to optimize the <b>refractory</b> <b>castable</b> size composition and obtain an estimate for FI as a function of SSA.

Hence, the attention of refractory manufacturers has shifted towards unshaped refractories to substitute for conventional and shaped ones. Castables lead in all the areas among the different unshaped refractories. Refractory castables (which are used by casting method) are premixed combinations of refractory grain, matrix components, bonding agents, and additives. The proportions are varied accordingly to achieve the desired properties. Again flowability of the castables is very important for application (casting) purposes and their final performances. Better flow of any castable allows making a good lining and makes it possible too line an intricate shape.
