40|$|Various organic pore {{agents are}} used for the {{production}} of insulating <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> (IRB). Most times, the deficiencies of the respective pore agents appear to be ignored by the makers of the bricks, and the users. Sawdust, for instance, which is about the most commonly used organic pore agent is known to have high water absorption rates. This is in addition to the inability of the user to have it from one grade of wood-hard wood which is preferred. These factors amount to various drawbacks in the insulating <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> produced <b>with</b> it. In order to curb this problem, this study identified palm kernel shells (PKS) as a potential alternative pore agent in IRB bodies. The focus of the work was on the water absorption rate of PKS.

40|$|Abstract. Experimental {{studies were}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} mechanisms for circular sawing of <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> <b>with</b> diamond segmented saw blades. Three kinds of diamond segments of different hardness were fabricated for the saw blades. The vertical and horizontal force components and the spindle power were measured in sawing. Based on the measurements of force and power, the specific energy and the normal force per diamond grit were obtained. The normal force per grit in the sawing of refractory bricks {{was found to be}} only 5 % of the static compressive strength of diamonds used in the present study, but fractures of diamonds were still popular on the segment working surfaces after sawing. The power, horizontal force, and the specific energy were found to increase with segment hardness. The specific energy obtained from the measured power was basically comparable to the values obtained from a theoretical equation to calculate the specific energy associated with slurry erosion to the bond matrix of segments...|$|E
40|$|Carbon-containing {{refractory}} materials have received great attention {{over the last}} years due to their importance in the steelmaking process. The oxidation of carbon present in {{refractory materials}} at temperatures above 500 degrees C is usually accompanied by the decrease of their mechanical strength and chemical resistance. Aiming to improve the oxidation resistance of carbon-oxide refractories, the use of materials known as antioxidants has been extensively studied. In this work we evaluated the performance of MgB 2 and B 4 C antioxidants when incorporated into MgO-C bricks. We observed that the co-addition of metallic antioxidants and B 4 C or MgB 2 leads to <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> <b>with</b> enhanced hot modulus of rupture and resistance against oxidation and slag corrosion. However, the excessive addition of these antioxidants could impair the performance of the obtained bricks. Thus, when determining the optimum concentration of MgB 2 and B 4 C to be added into MgO-C refractories, one must take into consideration this behavior.

The corrosion tests confirm intensive infiltration of the slag melts into the tested <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> and formation of Cr(6 +) compounds. The molten copper partially oxidizes during corrosion test by air and penetrates into bricks. Interactions among periclase (MgO) and chromite (FeCr 2 O 4) grains with the melt Na 2 O. 2 SiO 2 and copper oxides makes possible to form several compounds (e. g. Cu 2 MgO 3, CuCrO 4, CaCrO 4, Na 2 CrO 4, MgCrO 4). Just the marked yellow spots, which were observed on the corroded brick surface after 30 days of free storage, suggest hydration of the high-temperature corrosion products. The yellow color of spots points out to chromates as Na 2 CrO 4 and MgCrO 4, which are well soluble in water. The leaching of corroded bricks in water (batch leaching {{test of a}} ratio of S (solid) : W (water) = 0. 1 taking up to 28 days) confirmed the Cr, Na, Mg and Ca ions leach-out. The pH value of solution increased up to 9 during leaching mainly {{as a consequence of}} elevated Na+ ion concentration. The Cr ion concentration rises in the solution up to 1 mmol. l- 1.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} the corrosion and wear of refractory materials is indisputable because these processes determine the viability of any high-temperature liner used in metallurgical processes. The degradation mechanism of lining materials (<b>refractory</b> <b>bricks)</b> in contact <b>with</b> corrosive gases can be studied by examining the penetration rate or the chemical corrosion that results from the circulation of the atmosphere over the refractory material (by diffusional and convective transport). During the sintering of steel containing Mn the high vapour pressure of Mn enables its sublimation during thermal cycling; therefore, Mn is incorporated into the sintering atmosphere. Although the diffusion of Mn in steel samples is beneficial, the presence of Mn in a sintering atmosphere can modify the composition of refractory components. As a result of atmosphere-refractory interactions, a new phase is formed. In this study, the changes in refractory materials {{as a function of}} exposure time to atmospheres containing Mn-(g)) at the most common sintering temperature, 1120 degrees C, were investigated.

40|$|Fifty {{crucible}} {{fragments and}} 10 {{fragments of the}} melting furnace of the forest glassworks of Südel (1723 – 1741, Ct. Luzern), were analyzed by petrographic, mineralogical and chemical techniques {{in order to assess}} the temperature reached in the melting chamber and to find out which raw materials were used to make the crucibles and the melting furnace. Since the crucibles were used in the melting furnace, the temperature estimations were based on both the crucibles and the refractory fragments, as they were parts of the same system. The temperature range in the melting chamber, estimated by the structural order of the new-formed cristobalite, points to a temperature range between 1350 and 1500 °C. However, three crucible samples recorded extreme temperatures as high as 1650 °C, suggesting very high flame temperatures for wood fuel.

40|$|<b>Refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> are {{essential}} for high-temperature applications in various industries. The fabrication of most of our daily life products consumes {{a certain amount of}} refractories. Although essential, they are often not perceived so by the public. Depending on their specific application and the position in the furnace, different types of refractories are necessary. The different types consist of a small number of naturally occurring high quality raw materials, such as dolomite, magnesite, bauxite and chromite. These raw materials have to meet strict quality specifications and account for 40 to 50 % of the refractory costs. Currently, most of the spent <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> are used for low-value applications, such as construction material, or landfilled. Therefore, reusing <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> to substitute new raw materials in the production of <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> holds large potential for adding value. Due to the variety of different brick types, the used refractories usually do not meet the strict specifications of those for new raw materials. Thus, it is necessary to sort the spent bricks into categories according to their type. A useful tool is the sensor-based sorting (SBS) technology. SBS is has been used in mineral processing for more than 30 years and is gaining more and more significance. To be able to use SBS to separate the different brick types it is necessary to find a suitable sensor, which can distinguish between the different brick types. This paper describes several tests with various sensor types to evaluate the possibility of SBS for spent <b>refractory</b> <b>brick</b> separation. The tested sensors include conventional sensors, such as near infrared spectroscopy and the promising LIBS (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy) technology. All results were obtained within the European FP 7 -project REFRASORT, which aims to develop an automated sorting equipment for <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks...</b>|$|R
