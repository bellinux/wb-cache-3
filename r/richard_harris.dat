Harris was never {{formally}} approached, but Keith was, and turned the part down. Robert Ryan was ultimately cast in the part after Peckinpah saw him in the World War II action movie The Dirty Dozen (1967). Other actors considered for the role were Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford, Van Heflin, Ben Johnson (later cast as Tector Gorch), and Arthur Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Towne Cinema Limited {{bought the}} Princess {{outright}} sometime in 1970. The chain owned several theatres in Alberta, including the Towne Cinema on 118 Avenue. The theatre reopened on Christmas Day 1971 as the Klondike Theatre after {{almost a year}} of renovations. Towne Cinema restored the original function of {{the interior of the}} building, rebuilt sections of the exterior, and installed a new marquee at a cost of $270,000.

5|$|Burges {{bought the}} lease on {{the plot of}} land in 1875. The house was built by the Ashby Brothers, with {{interior}} decoration by members of Burges's long-standing team of craftsmen including Thomas Nicholls and Henry Stacy Marks. By 1878 the house was largely complete, although interior decoration and the designing of numerous items of furniture and metalwork continued until Burges's death in 1881. The house was inherited by his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. It was later sold to Colonel T.H. Minshall and then, in 1933, to Colonel E.R.B. Graham. The poet John Betjeman inherited the remaining lease in 1962 but did not extend it. Following a period when the house stood empty and suffered vandalism, it was purchased and restored, first by Lady Jane Turnbull, later by the actor <b>Richard</b> <b>Harris</b> {{and then by the}} musician Jimmy Page.|$|E
5|$|Keate was {{followed}} by other romantic poets including William Sotheby (Ode, Netley Abbey, Midnight, 1790). Sotheby's view of the abbey was gothic; he peoples the ruins with spectral processions and ghostly Cistercians. Nor was he the only one; in 1795 Richard Warner wrote a potboiler entitled Netley Abbey, a Gothic Story in two volumes, featuring skullduggery at the abbey during the middle ages. Dark deeds before the Dissolution also appeared in the section of <b>Richard</b> <b>Harris</b> Barham's Ingoldsby Legends (1847) covering Netley. This complex satire pokes fun at the medieval church and the monks (whom he accuses of having walled up an erring nun {{in one of the}} vaults and ensuring God’s revenge upon them) and the tourists who crowded contemporary Netley, {{while at the same time}} showing appreciation of the beauty of the ruins.|$|E
