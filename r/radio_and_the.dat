The 61st Ondas Award recipients were announced on 6 November 2014, where Danish broadcaster, Danmarks <b>Radio</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Broadcasting Union received the International Television Award, for their production of the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest. The award will be handed over during the awards ceremony that will take place on 25 November 2014 at the Liceu in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|The mid-20th century {{brought new}} forms of music from Trinidad, Brazil, the United States, Cuba and the Dominican Republic to Barbados, and the Barbadian calypso style came {{to be viewed as}} lowbrow or inferior. Promoters like Lord Silvers and Mighty Dragon, however, kept the popular {{tradition}} alive through shows at the Globe Theatre, featuring pioneers Mighty Romeo, Sir Don Marshall, Lord <b>Radio</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bimshire Boys and Mike Wilkinson. These performers {{set the stage for the}} development of popular Barbadian calypso in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The press, the <b>radio,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{television}} {{also contributed}} to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstucker, Pavel Kohout, and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský, Zdenek Hejzlar, and Gustav Husak. Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held. Most importantly, this new {{freedom of the press}} and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.|$|E

5|$|Atheis was Mihardja's first novel; {{what few}} {{literary}} works {{he had written}} beforehand were mostly short stories and dramas, both those intended for the <b>radio</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stage. He never formally studied writing, instead learning how to write fiction from his experiences reading existing works, including those of André Gide, Leo Tolstoy, Vsevolod Ivanov, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. His writing style was heavily influenced by that of Gide, particularly as found in The Immoralist (1902). Malay, the language which forms the basis of modern Indonesian, was not Mihardja's native language; his earlier works had all been in Sundanese, and Mihardja had only begun regularly using Indonesian after the Japanese occupation (1942–1945), {{when he became a}} translator.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} verse, pink {{elephants}} float over the girl's bed and an animated fairy version of Madonna {{emerges from the}} picture and winks. She takes the little girl through another picture, displaying mythological and fairytale beings such as dragons, princes and unicorns {{as well as a}} castle where Madonna dances with the moon. An underwater scene with mermaids and fish follows, then a parade of all the girl's toys around her room. As the song wraps, the fairy taps on the girl and causes her to yawn. She falls asleep again and her toys go back to being as they were. The violins and the instruments gradually fade inside the <b>radio</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> song ends.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{agitation}} grew in Alaska for {{the territory}} {{to become a}} state. Alaskans could not vote in presidential elections and had a territorial legislature with limited powers. Efforts to lobby federal legislators for an Alaska statehood bill met with limited success, so prominent territorial officials decided to draft a state constitution to prove Alaska's readiness to become a state. On November 8, 1955, 55 elected delegates gathered at the University of Alaska to begin drafting a state constitution. The resulting debates lasted {{more than two months}} and caused a sensation in Fairbanks. Debates of the constitutional convention were broadcast on Fairbanks <b>radio,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Fairbanks Daily News-Miner dedicated daily reports to the progress of the convention. On February 5, 1956, the delegates signed the constitution in front of 1,000 people who crowded into the University of Alaska gymnasium. The building where deliberations took place was subsequently named Constitution Hall.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, British {{alternative}} {{rock was}} distinguished {{from that of}} the United States early on by a more pop-oriented focus (marked by an equal emphasis on albums and singles, as well as greater openness to incorporating elements of dance and club culture) and a lyrical emphasis on specifically British concerns. As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US. Since the 1980s alternative rock has been played extensively on the radio in the UK, particularly by disc jockeys such as John Peel (who championed alternative music on BBC Radio 1), Richard Skinner, and Annie Nightingale. Artists that had cult followings in the United States received greater exposure through British national <b>radio</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.|$|E
5|$|The race began {{without a}} {{formation}} lap {{and despite the}} slow speed, drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface. After three laps under the safety car, conditions were unchanged; drivers reported on the circuit's condition via <b>radio</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> race was suspended. Light rain prevented the resumption of the Grand Prix for over forty-five minutes until the marshals and road sweeping trucks removed some of the excess water and dirt on the track. Resin on the newly laid track surface had prevented water from soaking into the ground. The rain had eased slightly during the suspension. Teams were allowed to change the set-up of their cars, which were largely optimised for dry weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|There were {{attempts}} to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s, and by 2000, scenes {{had grown up}} {{as part of the}} alternative and indie music scenes in several countries. The Detroit rock scene included the White Stripes, the Von Bondies, Electric Six, the Dirtbombs, the Go, the Muggs, the Hard Lessons, Tally Hall and the Detroit Cobras. The city was also a crucial stomping ground for Ohio's the Black Keys. New York's scene included the Strokes, Interpol, Radio 4, Liars, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the <b>Radio</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Rapture. In Los Angeles & San Francisco, the scene was centered around Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the Brian Jonestown Massacre, the Dandy Warhols and the Warlocks (most of whom would later be more associated with underground psychedelic rock than the mainstream garage rock bands of the era), while bands like Silversun Pickups delivered a more poppy take on post-punk. Billy Childish and the Buff Medways from the United Kingdom, the (International) Noise Conspiracy from Sweden, and the 5.6.7.8's from Japan enjoyed underground, regional or national success.|$|E

5|$|The station {{opened in}} 1990 as 102.2 Jazz FM in London, {{and a second}} Jazz FM branded station was {{launched}} four years later in Manchester. The Manchester station became Smooth FM 100.4 in 2004, {{and was the first}} in the network of independent local radio stations to use the Smooth brand. The London station followed suit a year later. The network's parent company, GMG Radioa subsidiary of the Guardian Media Groupacquired the Saga Radio Group in the mid-2000s, and all Saga stations were given the Smooth name. After the publication of John Myers' recommendations of a regulatory overhaul in commercial <b>radio,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> passing of the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations to co-locate or discontinue local shows and broadcasts, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into a single, quasi-national station in October 2010; local news feeds were produced at GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland produced its own breakfast and drivetime shows, but carried networked programming at other times. As part of their licence agreement, the London and Manchester stations were required to continue their commitment to jazz music after dropping the Jazz FM name, and the UK's broadcasting industry regulator Office of Communications (Ofcom) stipulated they must broadcast 45 hours of jazz programming per week, but this requirement was ended shortly before the merger took place.|$|E
