50|$|Industrial {{chillers}} typically come as complete, packaged, closed-loop systems, {{including the}} chiller unit, condenser, and pump station with <b>recirculating</b> <b>pump,</b> expansion valve, no-flow shutdown, internal cold water control. The internal tank helps maintain cold water temperature and prevents temperature spikes from occurring. Closed-loop industrial chillers recirculate a clean coolant or clean water with condition additives {{at a constant}} temperature and pressure to increase the stability and reproducibility of water-cooled machines and instruments. The water flows from the chiller to the application's point of use and back.|$|E

5000|$|Recirculation systems: Since a {{tankless}} {{water heater}} is inactive when hot water is not being used, they are incompatible with passive (convection-based) hot water recirculation systems. They may be incompatible with active hot water recirculation systems and certainly use more energy to constantly heat water within the piping, defeating one of a {{tankless water heater}}'s primary advantages. On-demand <b>recirculating</b> <b>pumps</b> are often used to minimize hot water wait times from tankless water heaters and save water being wasted down the drain. On-demand <b>recirculating</b> <b>pumps</b> are activated by push-button or other sensor. A water contacting temperature probe installed at the hot water usage point signals the pump to stop. Single-cycle pumping events only occur when hot water is needed thereby preventing the energy waste associated with constantly heating water within piping.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} case, {{there is an}} obvious safety issue, because many people {{do not expect to}} {{encounter}} more than the head of water above the drain when touching a drain. For example, in a recent case, a lifeguard went to the bottom of a pool to retrieve something and his hand got stuck because of the extra pressure from the pump. When there is a <b>recirculating</b> <b>pump,</b> the risk of suction consists of the head of water, plus the suction of the pump (up to a maximum of 1 atmosphere).|$|E
50|$|Bird baths can be {{made with}} other types of materials, {{including}} glass, metals (i.e.: copper), plastics, mosaic tiles, marble, or any other material that can be outdoors and hold water. In natural landscape gardens rocks and boulders with natural or stonemason carved basins can fit in unobtrusively. Some bird baths use a <b>recirculating</b> <b>pump</b> as part of a fountain or water feature, and can include filters, a float valve-water connection for automatic refilling, or a drip irrigation emitter aimed into the bowl. Some use a solar powered pump, floating or submerged, to recirculate the water. Birds are attracted to the sight and sound of running water, with integrated or nearby fountains an important element to bring birds to the garden.|$|E
50|$|The {{liquid droplet}} {{radiator}} (LDR) system {{consists of a}} droplet generator, a collector, a heat exchanger, a <b>recirculating</b> <b>pump,</b> and a bellows-type pressure regulator (accumulator). While undergoing a reduction in pressure the saturated liquid is sprayed into space as coherent streams of tiny, discrete droplets. The droplet stream can be a column or a sheet of liquid droplets moving through space from the droplet generator to the collector. The droplets carry the waste heat generated by a space power system and radiate this waste heat directly to space during their flight by transient radiative heat transfer. The liquid droplets are collected at a lower temperature, reheated, and pumped to the droplet generator and reused to continue to remove waste heat from the thermodynamic power cycle.|$|E

50|$|A recent {{trend is}} to change the method by which the skimmer is fed 'dirty' water from the {{aquarium}} as a means to recirculate water within the skimmer multiple times before it is returned to the sump or the aquarium. Aspirating pump skimmers are the most popular type of skimmer to use recirculating designs although other types of skimmers, such as Beckett skimmers, are also available in recirculating versions. While there is a popular belief among some aquarist that this recirculation increases the dwell or contact time of the generated air bubbles within the skimmer there is no authoritative evidence that this is true. Each time water is recirculated within the skimmer any air bubbles in that water sample are destroyed and new bubbles are generated by the <b>recirculating</b> <b>pump</b> venturi apparatus so the air-water contact time begins again for these newly created bubbles. In non-recirculating skimmer designs, a skimmer has one inlet supplied by a pump that pulls water in from the aquarium and injects it with air into the skimmer and releasing the foam or air/water mix into the reaction chamber. With a recirculating design, the one inlet is usually driven by a separate feed pump, or in some cases may be gravity fed, to receive the dirty water to process, while the pump providing the foam or air/water mix into the reaction chamber is set up separately in a closed loop {{on the side of the}} skimmer. The <b>recirculating</b> <b>pump</b> pulls water out of the skimmer and injects air to generate the foam or air/water mix before returning it to the skimmer reaction chamber—thus 'recirculating' it. The feed pump in a recirculating design typically injects a smaller amount of dirty water than co/counter-current designs. The separate feed pump allows easy control of the rate of water exchange through the skimmer and for many aquarists this is one of the important attractions of recirculating skimmer designs. Because the pump configuration of these skimmers is similar to that of aspirating pump skimmers, the power consumption advantages are also similar.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the years}} that Frigidaire was owned by General Motors, it was very {{competitive}} in the automatic clothes-washing-machine business. Frigidaire engineer Kenneth Sisson, also credited with {{the design of the}} incrementing timer used on clothes washers and dishwashers for years to come, designed the Frigidaire automatic washer with the Unimatic mechanism in the late 1930s. Production of the first Frigidaire automatic clothes washers was halted due to World War II and therefore the machine was not formally introduced until 1947. The washing action of a Frigidaire automatic was unique in that the agitator pulsated up and down, a unique departure from the traditional oscillating type. The Frigidaire washers were commonly named for their mechanisms, which, in true General Motors fashion, underwent frequent changes over the years. The Unimatic was in production the longest, for any single Frigidaire mechanism, from 1947 to 1958. The Pulsamatic mechanism, unique in that it pulsated 630 times per minute, was introduced in 1955 for the lower-end models. This became the foundation for the Multimatic, introduced for the 1959 model year. The Multimatic lasted through 1964, as the Rollermatic was brought out for the 1965 lineup. The Rollermatic was unique in that instead of using an oil-filled gearcase, metal and urethane rollers transferred the power within the mechanism. This underwent a slight revision in 1970 for the new eighteen-pound capacity 1-18, which kept the same basic mechanism but differed in that it was belt-driven off of the motor and added a <b>recirculating</b> <b>pump.</b> Besides the unique action, another notable feature of these older washers was the final, high-speed spin cycle (nicknamed [...] "Rapidry"), 1140 revolutions per minute in the Unimatic, 850 in the Multimatic, and 1010 in the high-end Rollermatic models.|$|E

30|$|When {{comparing}} {{this new}} fluid flow chambers with other reported devices [4, 10], several differences are seen. Commonly, test cells {{are placed on}} a fixed surface with the culture medium flowing along. According to the method of flow generation, they can be classified into open and sealed systems. Open systems, which are hydrostatically driven, are characterised by a fluid flow that passes the stationary phase once only [36]. In sealed models, the culture medium <b>recirculates</b> <b>pump</b> driven through the system [22]. Due to their inherent system-related drawbacks such as turbulent flow generation on boundary surfaces, those flow chambers are inappropriate for laminar flow creation. However, open systems have benefits of allowing the use of different culture media in a row without ceasing the fluid shear stress. Therefore, one can easily enable or disable different stimuli by exchanging the culture medium to evaluate its cellular impact. Sealed systems such as reported in this study do not provide this option. Initially added substances within the culture medium cannot be eliminated during the experimental process. Instead, stopping the flow and draining the cells would be necessary which would cause another unwanted influence to the test cells.|$|R

In the present study, a low-resource GC×GC instrument using an electrically heated and liquid-cooled single-stage thermal modulator that requires no cryogenic materials is evaluated. The instrument also uses at-column heating, thus eliminating the need for a convection oven to house the two columns. The stainless-steel modulator tube is coated with PDMS, which can be heated to 350 °C for sample injection into the second-dimension column.

In light of this, we present a new real-time experimental setup for analysing in continuum the alpha-emitting 222 Rn and 220 Rn daughters over variable stress-strain regimes. The most innovative segment of this setup consists of the radon accumulation chamber obtained from a tough and durable material that can host large cylindrical rock samples. The accumulation chamber is connected, in a closed-loop configuration, to a gas-drying unit and to a RAD 7 radon monitor. A <b>recirculating</b> <b>pump</b> moves the gas from the rock sample to a solid-state detector for alpha counting of radon and thoron progeny. The measured radon signal is enhanced by surrounding the accumulation chamber with a digitally controlled heating belt. As the temperature is increased, the number of effective collisions of radon atoms increases favouring the diffusion of radon through the material and reducing the analytical uncertainty. The accumulation chamber containing the sample is then placed into a uniaxial testing apparatus where the axial deformation is measured throughout a linear variable displacement transducer. A dedicated software allows obtaining a variety of stress-strain regimes from fast deformation rates to long-term creep tests.

40|$|ABSTRACT Photobioreactor Design for Improved Energy Efficiency of Microalgae Production Alexander Burns The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate a new photobioreactor (PBR) design for microalgae production that retains the typical advantages of existing tubular PBRs while reducing power consumption by providing simultaneous culture circulation and gas exchange with airlift alone and no centrifugal <b>recirculating</b> <b>pump.</b> Traditional tubular PBR designs feature a compressed air supply and a centrifugal pump for culture circulation and gas exchange. Circulation and gas exchange in a closed-system PBR is necessary to keep the algae suspended and to provide sufficient mass transfer (mainly for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide). In a traditional tubular PBR sparged air keeps the culture well mixed and strips out excess dissolved oxygen in an airlift-column unit, while the centrifugal pump circulates the culture in the tubular stage and decreases the amount of air bubbles traveling into this stage; where most of the photosynthesis occurs. The PBR design proposed herein does away with the usual centrifugal pump. The air blower performs both gas exchange in the airlift columns and system-wide circulation. This builds on a previous tubular PBR design that provides circulation and gas exchange by airlift alone, which was patented by Cathcart in 2011. However, the Cathcart patent does not provide data on mixing, gas exchange, energy consumption, flow regime or biomass productivity. The new design described here builds on the Cathcart design, but includes several unique design features, such as larger diffuser columns which provide airlift-induced flow for a series of vertical PBR tubes. To perform a power consumption v analysis, a pilot-scale prototype of the new PBR design was built and operated. The prototype PBR consisted of two airlift columns attached to 9 m of vertical serpentine tubing connected to the top and bottom by standard 90 -degree PVC elbows in a U-bend fashion to each column to make a total working volume of 235 L. The airlift columns were about 1. 5 m tall and 30. 5 cm ID, while the serpentine tubes were about 0. 9 m tall and 7. 6 cm ID to make a total of five vertical tubes for every airlift column. Data collected for this prototype design suggest an average overall areal productivity (OAP) of 111 g m- 2 d- 1 (g biomass m- 2 total land area with empty space day- 1), an average illuminated surface productivity (ISP) of 14. 3 g m- 2 d- 1 (g biomass m- 2 reactor photo-stage day- 1), an average volumetric productivity (VP) of 0. 55 g L- 1 d- 1 (g biomass L- 1 reactor working volume day- 1), a specific power input in the range of 330 to 360 W m- 3 (W power needed for culture circulation and gas exchange m- 3 reactor working volume) and a specific biomass productivity (SBP) in the range of 17. 6 to 19. 1 mg kJ- 1 (mg biomass kJ- 1 energy needed for culture circulation and gas exchange) with Chlorella vulgaris as the model algae. The biomass productivity per energy input (SBP) of the new PBR design appears to be higher than that of similar designs currently described in the literature. Elimination of the centrifugal pump in a tubular PBR design is a concept worth further study for potential energy savings...|$|E

40|$|Aerosols {{that contain}} {{volatile}} species or condensable vapors may be altered {{by changes in}} temperature, pressure, and vapor concentration. When such changes occur within aerosol sampling instruments, the measured size distribution can be distorted significantly. The distortion of particle size distributions {{in a number of}} commonly used aerosol instruments, including cascade impactors, both conventional and low pressure instruments, and optical particle counters, is explored both theoretically and experimentally in this paper. Ammonium sulfate aerosols in humid atmospheres have been used to test the instruments. In a low pressure impactor in which the pressure is intentionally reduced to facilitate the collection of small particles, a water containing particle may shrink due to evaporation as the pressure is reduced.

Either of these competing effects may lead to erroneous estimates of the particle size distribution.
