5000|$|In 2008 {{discovery}} of rope burns on the studding by the spout floor window revealed {{that this was}} probably originally a pop-hole through which the brake rope would have been dropped, thus allowing the miller to operate the brake {{from the side of}} the mill exterior, rather than from behind the mill, as had been the practice in recent years. The [...] "millwrights" [...] restoration and maintenance volunteer decided to improve the authenticity of the restoration and replace the window with a pop-hole and <b>removable</b> <b>shutter.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{store is}} a large, timber framed {{building}} on stumps with a gabled galvanised iron roof and a rendered brick facade. An awning supported on cast iron posts extends over the footpath. Two plate glass show windows flank {{the entrance and}} are protected by <b>removable</b> <b>shutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other main {{differences}} included focusing drive {{built into}} the camera body for use with standard lens, <b>removable</b> back, <b>shutter</b> speed knob integral with film wind knob placed {{at the front of}} the camera body, and finished in black.|$|R
5|$|While the 1976 renovations {{prolonged}} {{the life}} of the 1930s market, by the 1990s the market was once more becoming decrepit. The covers erected in 1976 over the walkways blocked sunlight, leaving much of the market dingy and poorly lit. The walkways themselves, already narrow, were becoming even more restricted as stalls erected external displays and additional weatherproofing. <b>Removable</b> <b>shutters</b> used to secure the stalls overnight were stacked against the sides of the stalls during trading hours, causing further obstruction, while on those stalls fitted with doors the doors opened outwards to maximise the limited space inside the units. In addition, the floors of stalls followed the slope of the hill, a gradient of about 1:12, causing health problems for those market workers who had to stand at this angle for prolonged periods during the day. Norwich City Council decided that these problems needed to be addressed, and in December 2003 invited the public to choose between three proposals for a rebuilt market.|$|R
5000|$|... ==History== The Grand Theatre {{opened on}} Wednesday 20 September 1916, with a seating {{capacity}} of 1,300, with 1,000 in the stalls and 300 in the dress circle. It was opened by the Mayor of Perth, Frank Rea, with a charity fund-raising gala for wounded soldiers, {{which included a}} performance by a [...] "Soldiers Orchestra" [...] and the screening of A Yellow Streak, featuring Lionel Barrymore. The Edwardian styled theatre was built for entrepreneur Thomas Coombe, and designed by architect Richard Joseph Dennehy for a cost of Â£20,000. The main entrance fronted onto Murray Street, {{and led to a}} 15.2 m wide marble tiled and mirror-lined vestibule with a large marble staircase. The 33.6 m by 15.2 m theatre auditorium was unique in Western Australia, in that it had a windlass-operated sliding roof, and also <b>removable</b> <b>shutters</b> on the side walls to allow for cross-ventilation. It had a 7.3 m by 5.5 m screen. It also had a secondary entrance facing Barrack Street.|$|R
