The objective is to maintain the bottom hole pressure (BHP) within the pressure window formed by the reservoir pressure and fracture pressure and also to reject kicks. Practical MPD automation solutions must address the nonlinearities and uncertainties caused by the variations in mud flow <b>rate,</b> <b>choke</b> opening, friction factor, mud density, etc. It is also desired that if pressure constraints are violated the controller must take appropriate actions to reject the ensuing kick. The objectives are addressed by developing two controllers: a gain switching robust controller and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC). The robust gain switching controller is designed using H 1 loop shaping technique, which was implemented using high gain bumpless transfer and 2 D look up table. Six candidate controllers were designed {{in such a way}} they preserve robustness and performance for different choke openings and flow rates. It is demonstrated that uniform performance is maintained under different operating conditions and the controllers are able to reject kicks using pressure control and maintain BHP during drill pipe extension. The NMPC was designed to regulate the BHP and contain the outlet flow rate within certain tunable threshold. The important feature of that controller is that it can reject kicks without requiring any switching and thus there is no scope for shattering due to switching between pressure and flow control. That is achieved by exploiting the constraint handling capability of NMPC. Active set method was used for computing control inputs.

Increased inlet temperature reduced leakage. Predictions made at maximum and minimum clearances (due to centrifugal and thermal growths, machining tolerances and + or - 2 percent uncertainty in the clearance measurement) placed wide boundaries on expected flow rates.

40|$|The useful {{operating}} {{range of the}} multistage, axial-flow compressor component of a gas turbine engine limits the extent of operation of that engine. Generally, the compressor stalls or surges at low flow <b>rates</b> and <b>chokes</b> at high flow rates. Thus, any improvement in the range between these compressor aerodynamic limits is normally of benefit to the engine also. An idea for delaying the onset of rotating stall in a multistage, axial-flow compressor which involved circumferentially varying the blade setting angles of stationary blades upstream of the compressor rotors was investigated. Tests involving two low-speed, multistage, axial-flow compressors and an intermediate-speed, three-stage, axial-flow compressor were completed. Comparisons between baseline compressor (circumferentially uniform setting angles) and modified compressor (circumferentially varying setting angles) performance data were made. A variety of blade setting angle circumferential variation patterns were tested. Test results suggest that rotating stall onset in the low-speed compressors could be delayed slightly but consistently with circumferentially varying setting angles. The low-speed compressor results indicated that a small improvement in stall recovery was also possible.

Methods: All choking incidents recorded over 3 years in 3 psychiatric wards of Chutung Veterans General Hospital (total of 210 beds) were retrospectively analyzed for demographic variables, psychiatric and medical diagnoses, and drug therapy {{at the time of the}} incidents. Results: During the 3 -year period, 16 incidents were recorded, involving 11 patients at a rate of 1 incident every 451. 4 months of hospitalization per person. Men were 3 times more likely to experience choking incidents than women, and the mean age of choking patients was higher than that of all patients (59. 7 vs. 44. 4 years). Among the 16 incidents, 3 fatal cases were noted, giving an annual <b>choking</b> death <b>rate</b> of 5. 05 per 1, 000 persons hospitalized. A high re-choking rate of up to 40. 0 % was noted, and patients with organic mental disorder had 3. 4 times the choking incidence of all patients. The mean antipsychotic dosage of the choking cases was similar to that of all inpatients, but the mean hypnotic dosage of the fatal choking cases was significantly higher. Up to 62. 5 % of the choking accidents occurred at breakfast, and mantou (a type of steamed bun) was the most common food (9 / 16) that resulted in the accidents.

40|$|Observations {{indicate}} {{that there is a}} correlation between long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and core-collapse supernovae (SNe). The leading model for GRB production assumes that relativistic jets are generated by the core-collapse within the progenitor star. Charged particles undergo Fermi-acceleration within internal shocks of these jets and subsequently give rise to gamma ray emission once the jets breach the surrounding stellar envelope. Very few SNe result in the occurrence of GRBs, however, {{it has been suggested that}} a significant fraction of core-collapse SNe manage to produce mildly relativistic jets. These jets are insufficiently energetic to break through the envelope and are effectively ’choked’ resulting in a lack of observed gamma ray emission. In both the failed and successful GRB scenario, neutrino production can occur if protons are accelerated in the internal shocks of these jets. These neutrinos may be detectable by the IceCube neutrino observatory and its low energy extension DeepCore.

30|$|Among {{parameters}} affecting asphaltene precipitation, production <b>rate,</b> tubing and <b>choke</b> sizes {{have the}} most impact on precipitation process. As production rate increases from 4000 to 7000 STB/day, the length of tubing covered by asphaltene deposition enhances about 40 %; however, a decrease in the production rate to reduce this interval is not desirable. Tubing size has an inverse effect on precipitation length. As a matter of fact, in this case, as the tubing diameter increases from 3 to 7 inches, the precipitation interval reduces about 2500 ft. In addition, a greater increase in the tubing size results in more depth of precipitation initiation. The choke size results in the same effect on the depth of precipitation initiation as the production rate does because generally, an increase in choke size is directly proportional to the production rate.|$|R
30|$|Critical flow {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the pressure upstream of the wellhead is at least 70 % higher than the pressure downstream of the wellhead, or when the ratio of downstream pressure to upstream pressure is 0.588 or less. If the ratio of downstream pressure to upstream pressure is greater than 0.588, sub-critical flow conditions prevail (Beiranvand et al. 2012). When critical flow conditions prevail, the flow rate is primarily a function of upstream pressure, gas oil ratio (GOR), and the choke aperture diameter. In critical flow conditions pressure changes in the flow lines downstream of the wellhead do not affect the flow rate therein. Since the liquid production <b>rate</b> through wellhead <b>chokes</b> is affected by changes in their aperture diameter (i.e., choke size), modeling and simulating the rate of flow through chokes of various aperture diameters for specific oil/gas field conditions enables production engineers to better understand and control production flow conditions.|$|R

Mirzaei-Paiaman and Salavati (2013) investigated the effect of gas-specific gravity and oil-specific gravity on liquid flow rate.

The Border Union crossed the Caledonian main line at Kingmoor and joined the Port Carlisle line half a mile north of Canal goods station. NBR passenger trains ran into Citadel station, exercising NBR running powers over both a short section of the Port Carlisle line and the connecting Caledonian branch (both doubled to accommodate main-line traffic). Canal was used as the NBR goods station and Silloth passenger trains still ran to it because the Act giving North British running powers over the Caledonian curve into Citadel station allowed the Caledonian to charge at a <b>rate</b> which <b>choked</b> off goods and short-haul {{passenger traffic}}. In 1864, the NBR therefore proposed to build its own extension from Canal to Citadel. Opposing the Bill, Caledonian witnesses said that they had never been asked by the NBR to reduce their tolls, which they would be happy to do; when the NBR rejected the offer as they wanted independent access the Bill was thrown out. [...] After further negotiation on the reduction of tolls, from 1 July 1864 Silloth trains ran into Citadel, rather than Canal. [...] In 1865 the NBR obtained an Act to construct an their own line into Citadel, but this was for goods traffic only.

30|$|Our {{objective}} here is {{to provide}} a new model for estimating oil flow through wellhead chokes improving upon the Gilbert’s equation and derivatives of it. Based on this formula, the liquid flow rate is as a function of three parameters such as wellhead pressure, choke size, and gas–liquid ratio. Since almost all models available in the literature used these three variables to predict the flow rate, we decided to include a new parameter named basic sediment and water (BS&W) to develop a model with new parameters and better performance. Also, it is necessary to say that the temperature did not have any significant impact on the flow rate based on relevancy factor formula; not including it in the new model (Discussion section). Another novelty is that it uses a mean square error (MSE) function test as the single-objective function for the GA and Solver algorithms, and then applies the optimized formula to a testing data subset, that is evaluated in terms of a set of statistical accuracy and correlation measures. A dataset of 182 wellhead choke measurements from wells drilled in the Reshadat oil field, located offshore southwest of Iran, is used to evaluate models to predict liquid flow <b>rates</b> through wellhead <b>chokes</b> (see Appendices 1, 2 and 3 for details of the reservoir and individual data record values).|$|R

I update the analysis of bycatch risk using tow level catch data since implementation of the IFQ. The analysis indicates that expected catch <b>rates</b> of most <b>choke</b> species have declined suggesting more effective bycatch avoidance behavior. However, there remains a significant risk that vessels’ catch of some choke species can be several times median quota allocations, in part because many vessels have increased catch and effort by leasing quota pounds, but quota share ownership has remained distributed. The results underscore the importance of an efficient quota market to redistribute quota to match realized catches, but a recent analysis suggests that the quota market is not distributing quota effectively and is subject to high transactions costs.  This provides and explanation for the persistence of risk pools despite the fact that aggregate catches of overfished rockfish species and Pacific halibut have remained well below total quotas. ...|$|R

Maintaining underbalanced drilling conditions after pipe connection operation {{is required for the}} success of underbalanced drilling operations. Modeling and simulation of gas-liquid two phase flow in an UBD operation is very significant in order to accurately predict the wellbore pressure and other parameters of two phase flow. After pipe connection operation in UBD, upon restarting mud circulation system, frictional pressure influenced the BHP and the fluid slugs in the drill string are transferred into the annulus. Therefore, the hydrostatic pressure will increase and UBD pipe connection operations create a BHP vibration, which is a critical point. This particular time can reduce the benefits obtained to drill the well in an underbalanced environment. In this study, a mechanistic steady state gas-liquid two phase flow model was used to simulate the two phase flow after pipe connection operation in UBD. Simulation was carried out to predict the parameters; such as wellbore pressure, liquid holdup, and velocities of the two phases at different flow patterns, namely slug, bubble, churn, dispersed bubble, and annular flow. In order to predict wellbore pressure, a steady state model was developed to predict flow patterns, pressure gradient, and liquid holdup for gasliquid flow in vertical annulus and drill string. The model included flow pattern transition models and hydrodynamic models for individual flow pattern. The model equations along with appropriate constitutive relations formed a system of coupled drift flux, momentum, and energy equations, which were solved using the well known iterative Newton Raphson method. All model equations were implemented in a computer program named Fortran 95. The effect of gas and liquid flow <b>rates,</b> and <b>choke</b> pressure on the wellbore pressure, particularly in the BHP was evaluated numerically.

The dataset of 182 records of wellhead choke measurements spans liquid flow rates from <[*] 100 to 30, 000 stock tank barrels/day.

Initially the redesign at the stage peak efficiency point produces considerable efficiency gain, but leads to noticeably reduced <b>choked</b> mass flow <b>rate.</b> The redesign at a near <b>choked</b> mass flow <b>rate</b> point, on the other hand, leads to considerable performance deterioration at operating points with lower mass flow <b>rate,</b> though the <b>choked</b> mass flow <b>rate</b> is even increased. Subsequently, a parallel multi-point approach has been implemented. Results show that a two-point design optimization avoids unacceptable performance deterioration at off design conditions. In the fourth case a redesign is applied across all 7 blade rows of the ATC compressor at the compressor design point. All these case studies are aimed to increase isentropic efficiency whilst meeting the specified constraints. Copyright © 2008 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|A brief {{introduction}} {{is given}} {{to a range of}} well control procedures. It was found that many of the procedures rely on a set of simplifying assumptions. This is particularly true in the hand calculations for designing a well kill. This set of assumptions was used to define an analytical model. The premises of the analytical model and some of the procedures were tested in a crude kick simulator. The main objective of this thesis was to verify some of the well control procedures, and to shed light on their limitations. Particular attention was given to driller’s method for a vertical and horizontal well. Additionally, simulations were run to investigate the worst case scenarios which a well might be subjected to if well control is lost. As a means for achieving this, the previously implemented explicit numerical AUSMV scheme was used as a basis for simulations on a kicking well. However, in order to conduct realistic simulations some modifications to the scheme had to be introduced. The most important modification was the implementation of a PI-regulator, as it proved impossible simply to set the bottomhole pressure to a defined constant value in the numerical scheme. Extensive tuning of the regulator was necessary for it to perform satisfactory. In this process, a novel alternative to the classical PI-regulator was discovered. Further modifications deemed necessary: •	Improved accuracy in reading of bottomhole and choke pressures. •	Implementation of additional topside parameters (pit gain, drillpipe pressure) •	A more realistic friction model. •	Changing the liquid component of the system from water to drilling fluid (altering the liquid density). •	A chokeline and riser for simulation on subsea wells. •	Opening up for wellbore deviation. •	A Darcy relation for influx where influx size and mass rate depends on downhole pressure differential. This is important for drilled kicks or connection kicks. •	Additionally, a choke model was implemented in the model, but it has not been used in the simulations. The choke model depicts the backpressure as a function of fluid density, flow <b>rate</b> and <b>choke</b> opening. By use of the crude kick simulator, simulations were run for a vertical and a horizontal well. The results obtained by the kick simulator were compared to hand calculations. The main discovery was that although the hand calculations produce slight errors, the errors exclusively functions as additional safety margins with respect to downhole pressure differential. It was also found that a gas bubble migrating in a shut-in annulus subjects the well to higher loads than the gas filled well scenario...|$|R
40|$|In Diesel engines, the {{internal}} flow characteristics in the fuel injection nozzles, {{such as the}} turbulence level and distribution, the cavitation pattern and the velocity profile affect significantly the air-fuel mixture in the spray and subsequently the combustion process. Since the possibility to observe experimentally and measure the flow inside real size Diesel injectors is very limited, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations are generally used to obtain the relevant information. The work presented within this thesis {{is focused on the}} study of cavitation in real size automotive injectors by using a commercial CFD code. It is divided in three major phases, each corresponding to a different complementary objective. The first objective of the current work is to assess the ability of the cavitation model included in the CFD code to predict cavitating flow conditions. For this, the model is validated for an injector-like study case defined in the literature, and for which experimental data is available in different operating conditions, before and after the start of cavitation. Preliminary studies are performed to analyze the effects on the solution obtained of various numerical parameters of the cavitation model itself and of the solver, and to determine the adequate setup of the model. It may be concluded that overall the cavitation model is able to predict the onset and development of cavitation accurately. Indeed, there is satisfactory agreement between the experimental data of injection <b>rate</b> and <b>choked</b> flow conditions and the corresponding numerical solution. This study serves {{as the basis for the}} physical and numerical understanding of the problem. Next, using the model configuration obtained from the previous study, unsteady flow calculations are performed for real-size single and multi-hole sac type Diesel injectors, each one with two types of nozzles, tapered and cylindrical. The objective is to validate the model with real automotive cases and to ununderstand in what way some physical factors, such as geometry, operating conditions and needle position affect the inception of cavitation and its development in the nozzle holes. These calculations are made at full needle lift and for various values of injection pressure and back-pressure. The results obtained for injection rate, momentum flux and effective injection velocity at the exit of the nozzles are compared with available CMT-Motores Térmicos in-house experimental data. Also, the cavitation pattern inside the nozzle and its effect on {{the internal}} nozzle flow is analyzed. The model predicts with reasonable accuracy the effects of geometry and operating conditions. Patouna, S. (2012).

40|$|Turbocharging the {{internal}} combustion engine {{is one of the most}} effective ways to reduce the fuel consumption and fulll the green house gas emissions requierements. Nevertheless, this techinque has some limitations that need to be addressed in order to improve the turbocharger performance. The range of use of the compressor is restricted by the surgeline at low massow <b>rates</b> and the <b>choke</b> line at high massow rates. The compressor map gives valuable information of the compressor stable operating points. However, due to the space constraints in an engine compartiment, complex pipes are needed to integrate all the components correctly leading to a dierence in the compressor preformance from measurments to in-situ congurations. Computational Fluid Dynamics is a powerful tool to predict compressor maps in a shorter time and less laborious way compared to experimental measurements and obtaining data in the whole domain. The compressor map of a turbocharger compressor was calculated using a steady-state RANS approach and the Moving Reference Frames technique to handle the rotating parts of the machine, validating the method with experimental data. The 　ow eld from near optimal e-ciency points to near surge was assessed identifying a strong swirling back　ow at odesign conditions responsible for the e-ciency and pressure ratio drop. The eect of a 90 º bent pipe upstream the compressor inlet was studied. Two counter-rotating vortices were observed to form after the bend and vanishing under the eect of the wheel rotation in evey case. It was shown that the 　ow structures introduced by the bend can be benecialat near surge condition, mitigating the rotating back　ow and improving the e-ciency and pressure ratio of the compressor at this particular case...|$|R
