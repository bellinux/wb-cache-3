5|$|Cancer {{develops}} following {{genetic damage}} to DNA and epigenetic changes. These changes affect the normal {{functions of the}} cell, including cell proliferation, programmed cell death (apoptosis) and DNA repair. As more damage accumulates, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> increases.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{damage in}} DNA can cause cancer. Several {{antioxidant}} enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase etc. protect DNA from oxidative stress. It {{has been proposed}} that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with DNA damage and subsequently the individual's <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer,</b> plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E

5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} supernova at {{the distance}} of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star {{it is unlikely to}} directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer,</b> among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E
25|$|The highest {{detection}} of radiation outside of Fukushima peaked at 40 mSv. This represents {{a much lower}} level then the amount required to increase a persons <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> 100 mSv represents {{the level at which}} a definitive increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> occurs. Radiation above this level increases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer,</b> and after 400 mSv radiation poisoning can occur, but is unlikely to be fatal.|$|E

40|$|Could {{it really}} be that aspirin {{increases}} the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> pancreatic <b>cancer,</b> as {{suggested in the}} article by Schernhammer et al. (1) ? In many ways, aspirin has been a wonder child of chronic disease prevention. The drug is very effective in the secondary (chemo) prevention of cardiovascular disease and may also {{have a role in}} primary cardiovascular prevention (2). For neoplasia, clinical trials have recently established that aspirin can reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> sporadic colorectal adenomas (3 – 5), just as other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause regres-sion of adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis (6, 7). Ep-idemiologic data also suggest that use of aspirin and other NSAIDs may reduce <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> the stomach and esoph-agus (8, 9).
