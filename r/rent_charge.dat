She noted the memorials to the Wynnes as well as a tablet marking Edward Wynne's [...] "munificence": she recorded that he had donated [...] in 1722 and a <b>rent</b> <b>charge</b> of £2 to endow the living, and that £800 was also received from Queen Anne's Bounty.

500|$|The {{church was}} at one time an ecclesiastical {{dependency}} (or [...] "daughter church") of St Cybi's, Holyhead. The right of patronage (the power to appoint the rector of Holyhead and its associated churches {{and the right to}} receive income from the church) was bequeathed to Jesus College, Oxford, in 1648. The college was the patron of the parish until 1920, when the Welsh Church Act 1914 came into force and the Church in Wales was disestablished. In 1849, the writer Samuel Lewis noted that the college and Queen Anne's Bounty (a fund to support poor clergy) had recently each paid £400 for a new parsonage. He also recorded that the college received a <b>rent</b> <b>charge</b> of £476 and 8 shillings each year from the parish instead of receiving the tithes. The college donated £200 towards the restoration work in 1871.|$|E

6000|$|But {{even the}} {{break-up}} of 8,000,000 acres, {{though it may}} make us safe for food, will only increase our country population by 250,000 labourers and their families (a million souls)--a mere beginning towards the satisfaction of our need. We want in operation, before demobilisation begins, a great national plan {{for the creation of}} good small holdings run on co-operative lines. And to this end, why should not the suggestion of tithe redemption, thrown out by Mr. Prothero, on pages 399 and 400 of [...] "English Farming: Past and Present," [...] be adopted? The annual value of tithes is about £5,000,000. Their extinction should provide the Government with about 2,500,000 acres, enough at one stroke to put three or four hundred thousand soldiers on the land. The tithe-holders would get their money, landlords would not be prejudiced; the Government, by virtue of judicious choice and discretionary compulsion, would obtain the sort of land it wanted, and the land would be for ever free of a teasing and vexatious charge. The cost to the Government would be £100,000,000 (perhaps more) on the best security it could have. [...] "Present conditions," [...] I quote from the book, [...] "are favourable to such a transaction. The price of land enables owners to extinguish the <b>rent</b> <b>charge</b> by the surrender of a reasonable acreage, and the low price of Consols enables investors to obtain a larger interest for their money." [...] For those not familiar with this notion, the process, in brief, is this: The Government pays the tithe-holder the capitalised value of his tithe, and takes over from the landlord as much land as produces in net annual rent the amount of the tithe-rent charge, leaving the rest of his land tithe-free for ever. There are doubtless difficulties and objections, but so there must be to any comprehensive plan for obtaining an amount of land at all adequate. Time is of desperate importance in this matter. It is already dangerously late, but if the Government would turn-to now with a will, the situation could still be saved, and this unique chance for re-stocking our countryside would not be thrown away.|$|E

5000|$|Believing {{that the}} talent and {{selfishness}} of individuals {{must be taken}} into account, Gesell called for free, fair business competition, with equal chances for all. This included the removal of all legal and inherited privilege. Everyone should rely only on their abilities to make a living. In the [...] "natural economic order" [...] which Gesell recommended, the most talented people would have the greatest income, without distortion by interest and <b>rent</b> <b>charges.</b> The economic status of the less-talented would improve because they would not be forced to pay interest and <b>rent</b> <b>charges.</b> According to Gesell, this would result in less difference between the poor and the rich. Furthermore, greater average incomes would mean that the poor would have a greater chance of escaping poverty, in part because other poor people would have greater disposable income and spending power.|$|R
