25|$|Many {{long-established}} words, such as disgusted, degrade, and refresh, do not <b>require</b> a <b>hyphen</b> {{because they}} are fully fused {{to the point that}} their first syllable is barely even thought about as having a prefix function. Many other words, such as prewashed or repainted, may not be quite so fully fused (the prefix function may be slightly more prominent in consciousness), but nonetheless they <b>require</b> no <b>hyphen,</b> because (1) most readers recognize the closed-up word as a familiar one and thus have no trouble parsing the syllables, and (2) if all such words were hyphenated, the many hyphens throughout the text would seem superfluous.|$|R
2500|$|ISO 8601 {{permits the}} hyphen (-) {{to be used}} as the minus (...) {{character}} when the character set is limited. In contrast, RFC 3339 explicitly <b>requires</b> the <b>hyphen</b> (-) symbol to represent negative offsets and does not allow for use of the minus (...) symbol.|$|R
25|$|Compounds {{are created}} with {{acronyms}} {{by the following}} rules: those from the first group take other elements with a hyphen (e.g. URH-adás ‘UHF broadcast’), and proper name types of the second group behave the same way (e.g. Kermi-ellenőrzés ‘control by Kermi’). The common name types of the second group, however, can be written as one word with other elements, except if they <b>require</b> a <b>hyphen</b> because of length (e.g. tévéközvetítés ‘TV transmission’).|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} pronouns {{that act as}} {{subjects}} of a sentence, and from the stressed object pronouns which are employed after prepositions, Portuguese has several clitic object pronouns used with nonprepositional verbs, or as indirect objects. These can appear before the verb as separate words, as in ela me ama ("she loves me"), or appended to the verb after the tense/person inflection, as in ele amou-a ("he loved her") or ele deu-lhe o livro ("he gave her/him the book"). Note that Portuguese spelling rules (like those of French) <b>require</b> a <b>hyphen</b> between the verb and the enclitic pronoun.|$|R
2500|$|Words {{for which}} prefix {{hyphenation}} is least subjective, {{to the point}} that closed-up style is widely rejected, are of several classes. One such class consists of a few words that <b>require</b> a <b>hyphen</b> to distinguish them from other words that would otherwise be homographs, such as recreation (fun or sport) versus [...] (the act of creating again), retreat (turn back) versus [...] (give therapy again), and [...] (not in ion form) versus unionized (organized into trade unions). The other classes are those in which the prefix is applied to (1) a proper (capitalized) noun or adjective ( [...] , [...] ); (2) an acronym ( [...] , [...] ); or (3) a number ( [...] , [...] ).|$|R
50|$|Words {{for which}} prefix {{hyphenation}} is least subjective, {{to the point}} that closed-up style is widely rejected, are of several classes. One such class consists of a few words that <b>require</b> a <b>hyphen</b> to distinguish them from other words that would otherwise be homographs, such as recreation (fun or sport) versus re-creation (the act of creating again), retreat (turn back) versus re-treat (give therapy again), and un-ionized (not in ion form) versus unionized (organized into trade unions). The other classes are those in which the prefix is applied to (1) a proper (capitalized) noun or adjective (un-American, de-Stalinisation); (2) an acronym (anti-TNF antibody, non-SI units); or (3) a number (pre-1949 diplomacy, pre-1492 cartography).|$|R
5000|$|A {{prominent}} sovereigntist was René Lévesque, {{who helped}} found the Parti Québécois (PQ) with like-minded separatists. The PQ proposed [...] "sovereignty-association", a proposal for Quebec to be a sovereign nation-state while <b>requiring</b> (hence the <b>hyphen)</b> an economic partnership with what remained of Canada. The PQ had intended to declare independence upon forming government, citing the principle of parliamentary supremacy. This was changed in the party platform after internal lobbying by Claude Morin to a referendum strategy to better allow such a declaration to be internationally recognized.|$|R
50|$|Players {{should decide}} on an English {{dictionary}} {{to be used}} during the game. An allowable word must appear as an entry in that dictionary or {{as one of the}} listed inflected forms of an entry word. Words must also use at least two cards. The makers of Quiddler have established several restrictions on the words used in a game. No proper nouns may be used. Capitalized adjectives, such as Iraqi and Scottish, may be used. Prefixes and suffixes by themselves are not allowable words. Words <b>requiring</b> a <b>hyphen</b> for proper spelling, such as ex-wife and twenty-two are also not allowed. The Quiddler rules disallow abbreviations, but do not differentiate between various forms. Players need to decide for themselves (or follow the example of the game dictionary) if they will allow acronym-derived words such as laser and NATO. The rules contain no restrictions on English words with accented letters, such as née, though the deck contains no such letters. Players must also decide for themselves if they will allow shortened word forms such as ad (for advertisement) and math.|$|R
