The series is particularly popular in South Korea, where a successful electronic sports scene has been established.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} population of bacteria that exhibit {{a very high}} degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing {{of a large number}} of isolates of E. coli and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, this has not been done, largely due to its medical importance, and E. coli <b>remains</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genes in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.|$|E

5|$|By 1986 the Flames landed {{forwards}} Doug Risebrough, Lanny McDonald, and Dan Quinn, defenceman Al MacInnis, and goaltender Mike Vernon. Finishing {{second in}} the Smythe with a 40–31–9 record (the only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points), the Flames swept the Winnipeg Jets {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, setting up a showdown with the Oilers. Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season, and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row. However, the Flames upset the Oilers in seven games—the only time that the Flames defeated the Oilers in a playoff series during the decade. The series-winning goal came when an errant clearing attempt by Steve Smith ricocheted off goaltender Grant Fuhr's leg and into his own net. The goal <b>remains</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> legendary blunders in hockey history.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s she was {{attending}} art {{classes at the}} Art Students League of New York, and in 1941 she had her first solo exhibition. A student of Hans Hofmann and Chaim Gross, Nevelson experimented with early conceptual art using found objects, and dabbled in painting and printing before dedicating her lifework to sculpture. Usually created out of wood, her sculptures appear puzzle-like, with multiple intricately cut pieces placed into wall sculptures or independently standing pieces, often 3-D. A unique feature of her work is that her figures are often painted in monochromatic black or white. A figure in the international art scene, Nevelson was showcased at the 31st Venice Biennale. Her work is seen in major collections in museums and corporations. Nevelson <b>remains</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important figures in 20th-century American sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over {{extended periods of}} time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today <b>remains</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> widely kept domestic animals.|$|E

5|$|In Game1, Herb Pennock {{pitched the}} Yankees to a 2–1 {{win over the}} Cards. In Game2, pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander evened the Series for St. Louis with a 6–2 victory. Knuckleballer Jesse Haines' shutout in Game3 gave St. Louis a 2–1 Series lead. In the Yankees' 10–5 Game4 win, Babe Ruth hit three home runs, a World Series record equaled only four times since. According to {{newspaper}} reports, Ruth had promised a sickly boy named Johnny Sylvester to {{hit a home run}} for him in Game4. After Ruth's three-homer game, the boy's condition miraculously improved. The newspapers' account of the story is disputed by contemporary baseball historians, but it <b>remains</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous anecdotes in baseball history. Pennock again won for the Yankees in Game5, 3–2.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln Castle {{is a major}} castle {{constructed}} in Lincoln, England, during the late 11th century by William the Conqueror {{on the site of}} a pre-existing Roman fortress. The castle is unusual in that it has two mottes. It is only one of two such castles in the country, the other being at Lewes in Sussex. Lincoln Castle remained in use as a prison and law court into modern times, {{and is one of the}} better preserved castles in England; the Crown Courts continue to this day. It is open to the public as a museum. Lincoln Castle <b>remains</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> impressive Norman castles in the United Kingdom. It is still possible to walk around the immense Norman walls which provide a magnificent view of the castle complex, together with panoramic views of the cathedral, the city, and the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|The Gedi ruins {{were first}} {{discovered}} by colonialists in 1884 after a British resident of Zanzibar, Sir John Kirk, visited the site. However, the ruins remained obscured until their subsequent rediscovery in the 1920s, when the site began to gain {{attention from the}} British East African government. Initial excavations at Gedi began in the late-1940s, and the site today <b>remains</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> intensely studied Swahili Coast settlements. The significance of the ruins has been largely {{used to assess the}} sites role within the region in association with other sites to provide insight into the development of Swahili culture, the organization of Indian Ocean trade, the introduction and spread of Islam, and the political and economic ties between Swahili communities through their cultural remains and their spatial relationships.|$|E
