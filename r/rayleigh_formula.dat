Seasonal temperature, salinity and sound velocity variations are found only in the upper layer of the Black Sea. Below 125 m, seasonal variations are insignificant.

40|$|We derive {{formulas}} for the Coulomb matrix {{within the}} full-potential linearized augmented-planewave (FLAPW) method. The Coulomb matrix {{is a central}} ingredient in implementations of many-body perturbation theory, such as the Hartree-Fock and GW approximations for the electronic self-energy or the random-phase approximation for the dielectric function. It is represented in the mixed product basis, which combines numerical muffin-tin functions and interstitial plane waves constructed from products of FLAPW basis functions. The interstitial plane waves are here expanded with the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>formula.</b> The resulting algorithm is very efficient {{in terms of both}} computational cost and accuracy and is superior to an implementation with the Fourier transform of the step function. in order to allow an analytic treatment of the divergence at k = 0 in reciprocal space, we expand the Coulomb matrix analytically around this point without resorting to a projection onto plane waves. Without additional approximations, we then apply a basis transformation that diagonalizes the Coulomb matrix and confines the divergence to a single eigenvalue. At the same time, response matrices like the dielectric function separate into head, wings, and body with the same mathematical properties as in a plane-wave basis. As an illustration we apply the formulas to electron-energy-loss spectra (EELS) for nickel at different It vectors including k = 0. The convergence of the spectra towards the result at k = 0 is clearly seen. Our all-electron treatment also allows to include transitions from 3 s and 3 p core states in the EELS spectrum that give rise to a shallow peak at high energies and lead to good agreement with experiment.

The analysis {{does not take into}} account the viscosity of the medium nor any other deviation from its 2 ̆ 2 ideal 2 ̆ 2 behavior. Numerical calculations are not given. Attention is paid mainly to the mathematical formalism. In section 1 the problem is mathematically stated by means of the velocity potential in the form of a boundary value problem in connection with the wave equation. A new argument is given as to why the time factor exp (-iwt) is preferred in theoretical considerations. Section 2 contains a brief sketch of the derivation of the now already classical <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>formula,</b> together with some critical remarks. Section 3 is devoted to energy considerations. The definitions of acoustic impedance and radiation characteristic are given. In addition formulae are derived by means of which they can be computed in the case of any prescribed source distribution. In section 4 the general formulae are applied to a circular membrane, oscillating with azimuthal and radial nodal lines. In section 5 King's theory of the circular disc oscillating with uniform amplitude is very much extended. The theory can be developed in terms of cylindrical wave functions. It is possible to express the velocity potential as a definite integral involving Bessel functions. It is shown that the reactive part of the acoustic impedance of any harmonically vibrating membrane of whatever amplitude distribution is always negative. This part can be calculated by integrating the radiation pattem over complex space directions. Section 6 shows expansions in spherical wave functions, applied to the radiation field of a membrane oscillating with nodal lines. King's statement that the theory of Backhaus regarding certain expansions in spherical coordinates does not hold is shown to be erroneous. For the sake of completeness the theory of section 6 is worked out in detail in the case of the Rayleigh plate. This is to be found in section 7.

40|$|Electromagnetic Levitation (EML) is a {{valuable}} method for measuring the thermo-physical properties of metals - surface tensions, viscosity, thermal/electrical conductivity, specific heat, hemispherical emissivity, etc. – beyond their melting temperature. In EML, {{a small amount of}} the test specimen is melted by Joule heating in a suspended AC coil. Once in liquid state, a small perturbation causes the liquid envelope to oscillate and the frequency of oscillation is then used to compute its surface tension by the well know <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>formula.</b> Similarly, {{the rate at which the}} oscillation is dampened relates to the viscosity. To measure thermal conductivity, a sinusoidally varying laser source may be used to heat the polar axis of the droplet and the temperature response measured at the polar opposite – the resulting phase shift yields thermal conductivity. All these theoretical methods assume that convective effects due to flow within the droplet are negligible compared to conduction, and similarly that the flow conditions are laminar; a situation that can only be realised under microgravity conditions. Hence the EML experiment is the method favoured for Spacelab experiments (viz. TEMPUS). Under terrestrial conditions, the full gravity force has to be countered by a much larger induced magnetic field. The magnetic field generates strong flow within the droplet, which for droplets of practical size becomes irrotational and turbulent. At the same time the droplet oscillation envelope is no longer ellipsoidal. Both these conditions invalidate simple theoretical models and prevent widespread EML use in terrestrial laboratories. The authors have shown in earlier publications that it is possible to suppress most of the turbulent convection generated in the droplet skin layer, through use of a static magnetic field. Using a pseudo-spectral discretisation method it is possible compute very accurately the dynamic variation in the suspended fluid envelope and simultaneously compute the time-varying electromagnetic, flow and thermal fields. The use of a DC field as a dampening agent was also demonstrated in cold crucible melting, where suppression of turbulence was achieved in a much larger liquid metal volume and led to increased superheat in the melt and reduction of heat losses to the water-cooled walls.

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} diffraction {{problem is}} formulated {{in terms of}} either the electric or magnetic Hertz potential. This approach is equivalent to traditional methods based on the vector form of Green's theorem, but it is less widely known. The components of the Hertz potentials are independent, and each satisfies a scalar wave equation. The formal solutions for these components are therefore given by two equations {{referred to as the}} <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>formulas,</b> which are familiar from scalar diffraction theory. A physical interpretation of the Rayleigh solution shows that the diffracted wave may {{be thought of as a}} superposition of elementary, electromagnetic Huygens wavelets. Depending on the type of Green's function that is chosen, these wavelets have the same form as fields radiated by dipoles of different orientations (D-theory) or by special types of quadrupoles (Q-theory). Using techniques which are well known from scalar theory, it is shown that the diffracted wave can be represented as an angular spectrum of electromagnetic plane waves, and that this description is equivalent to the Q-theory approach. The use of approximate, Kirchhoff-type boundary conditions in the Hertz potential formalism is investigated. When these boundary conditions are used in the D-theory, the diffracted wave is found to be identical with the results of more traditional theories that apply the boundary conditions directly to the fields in the aperture. Using these boundary conditions in the Q-theory yields different results, because they are applied to the Hertz potentials rather than to the fields themselves. The differences between the two approaches are most apparent when the aperture is small in comparison with the wavelength. To determine which theory is more appropriate for Kirchhoff-type boundary conditions, an experiment to measure the diffraction from subwavelength-diameter pinholes is performed. The Q-theory shows better agreement with the results. It is also determined that the best agreement is obtained when the magnetic rather than electric Hertz potential is used...|$|R
