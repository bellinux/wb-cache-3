5000|$|The Nabors team base camp, {{known as}} Rig 99, {{is located in}} Northeastern British Columbia near {{the foothills of the}} Rocky Mountains. It {{consists}} of two wells located 100 metres apart. The Nabors equipment was flown in by the largest helicopter in the world, the Russian Mil Mi-26, nicknamed Корова (pronounced Kor-oh-vah, which means Cow) by its crew, in 65 loads. According to <b>Rig</b> <b>Manager</b> Denny Milan over 20 years of Research and Development went into the components of Rig 99, which he described as [...] "a giant Lego set." ...|$|E
5000|$|The KS Endeavor jackup rig {{exploded}} on January 16, 2012, while drilling an exploration well for Chevron in the Funiwa field in Nigeria. The explosion {{resulted in the}} death of two of the 154 workers on board and a fire that burned for 46 days before the well was sealed on June 18. According to a Reuters news report, workers on the KS Endeavor were ignored by Chevron when they requested evacuation due to concerns of increasing smoke billowing from the drilling borehole. A senior worker said the blowout was triggered by a massive build-up of pressure. A witness said that rig engineers advised Chevron to stop drilling and evacuate staff but Chevron told them to continue with drilling. Expecting an explosion, the <b>rig</b> <b>manager,</b> one of the two that later died, kept the lifeboats at hand and ready for use. A witness reported: [...] "This is the reason so many of us survived because we were all aware {{that it was going to}} happen, but just didn't know when."In an email response to Reuters, Chevron said it did not receive requests to evacuate the rig and that staff on board had the right to call a halt to work if they believed conditions were unsafe.|$|E
50|$|On September 22, 1988, Ocean Odyssey {{suffered}} a blowout while operated by ODECO (now Diamond Offshore Drilling) on hire to ARCO (now {{a subsidiary of}} BP), drilling the 22/30b-3 well on a prospect in the North Sea. The ultimate direct cause of the incident was {{a failure of the}} subsea wellhead equipment after a prolonged period of well control. During the resulting fire the radio operator, Timothy Williams, was killed. He had been ordered from the lifeboats and back to the radio room by the <b>rig's</b> <b>manager,</b> who failed to countermand the order when the rig was evacuated.|$|R
5000|$|Buzbee said clients’ {{settlements}} {{related to}} the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico exceeded $150 million. Buzbee represented 19 rig workers, the last of whom settled her injury claims 22 months after the accident. In 2011, Buzbee alleged that <b>rig</b> <b>managers</b> were aware of serious problems before the explosion and that Transocean forced rig workers to sign statements before they were rescued. Buzbee questioned company claims about safety test records lost when the rig went down. Buzbee currently represents thousands of claimants, including hotel and resort owners and fishermen, who allege spill-related property damage and lost revenue.|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe <b>rig</b> <b>manager</b> on Snorre B, a {{semisubmersible}} {{production and}} drilling rig for Statoil, has expressed {{the need for}} a subsea standalone vehicle that can perform specific tasks when the conventional remote operated vehicles (ROV) is not capable of diving due to rough weather. This is seen especially during the winter season. Having a vehicle in standby at the subsea location, during all-weather situations, will enable critical work to be performed on the subsea structures and increases safety, such as operating valves during emergencies. By analyzing the ROV operation that have been affected by bad the weather, the main restrictions was fond in the launch and recovery of the ROV system, due to the large wave forces acting on the system during this operation. If the standard launch and recovery system for the ROV could be removed or altered, a new system could be designed. It was found that if the hangar and vehicle where to be placed on the seabed during calm weather conditions and they could remain there for longer periods during rough weather, this would decrease down time during a possible malfunction. The standalone system would need to remove the weather depended components in order to work during rough periods. This was achieved by changing out the way the ROV communicates and receives electrical power. By receiving power from subsea structures, and signals from a high weather tolerant piggyback solution, the standalone system can be operated during any storm the rig`s umbilical and risers can take. The standalone components, which consist of a hangar and the vehicle, is connected through different types of tethers; power and signal tether, optical fiber tether, and wireless connection. These connection types give the vehicle the means for reaching and completing the required types of operations...|$|E
