While young, he was looked after by his grandfather. At the age of 15, Chakotay visited Earth with his father, who sought to find his tribe's ancestral home in Central America and the descendants of the <b>Rubber</b> <b>Tree</b> People. He was resistant to this, and instead dreamed of going into space and had heroes such as John Kelly, a pioneering astronaut in the early 21st century. He chose to enter Starfleet Academy against his father's wishes, and his entry was sponsored by Captain Sulu. He attended Starfleet Academy from 2344 to 2348, where he engaged in the sport of boxing. After graduating, he was assigned to a starship. One of his earliest away missions resulted in a diplomatic incident on Ktaria VII, and he was also on the team that made first contact with the Tarkannans.|$|E

25|$|South America {{remained}} {{the main source}} of the limited amounts of latex rubber used during much of the 19th century. The trade was heavily protected and exporting seeds from Brazil was a capital offense, although no law prohibited it. Nevertheless, in 1876, Henry Wickham smuggled 70,000 Pará <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> seeds from Brazil and delivered them to Kew Gardens, England. Only 2,400 of these germinated. Seedlings were then sent to India, British Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), Singapore, and British Malaya. Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber. In the early 1900s, the Congo Free State in Africa was also a significant source of natural rubber latex, mostly gathered by forced labor. Liberia and Nigeria started production.|$|E
25|$|Many {{other plants}} produce forms of latex rich in {{isoprene}} polymers, {{though not all}} produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará. Some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most {{are more difficult to}} tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example gutta-percha (Palaquium gutta) and chicle from Manilkara species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (Ficus elastica), Panama <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> (Castilla elastica), various spurges (Euphorbia spp.), lettuce (Lactuca species), the related Scorzonera tau-saghyz, various Taraxacum species, including common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and Russian dandelion (Taraxacum kok-saghyz), and perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic properties, guayule (Parthenium argentatum). The term gum rubber is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.|$|E
25|$|The Lincoln Park Conservatory offers year-round {{displays}} of plants {{from many different}} climates around the world. Today's conservatory was built in stages from 1890 to 1895. It consists of a vestibule, four display halls and fifteen propagating and growing houses. The vestibule and Palm House were built and {{opened to the public}} in 1892 and contain giant palms and rubber trees, including a 15m (50ft) fiddle-leaf <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> planted in 1891. In the Palm House, one can also find Garden Figure, a sculpture by Frederick Hibbard. The Fern Room or Fernery was opened in 1895. It contains plants of the forest floor, primarily a vast collection of ferns. The Tropical Room was originally called the stove house. Opened in 1895, it contained an assortment of tropical plants suspended from bark-covered walls. It is now called the Orchid Room and has a collection of approximately 25,000 natural species. The Display House is used for seasonal flower and plant exhibits. A docent program run by the Chicago Park District and Lincoln Park Conservancy provides free tours of the Conservatory and its outdoor gardens from 1-4 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays and from 9 to Noon on Saturdays.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the influence of intercropping 'Conilon' coffee (Coffea canephora) with <b>rubber</b> <b>trees</b> on coffee tree microclimate, nutrition, growth, and yield. <b>Rubber</b> <b>trees</b> were planted in two double rows 33 m apart, with 4 x 2. 3 m spacing between plants. Treatments consisted of the distances from the coffee plants to the rubber trees: 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 m. Measurements of atmospheric variables (temperature, irradiance, and relative humidity), leaf nutrient concentration, internode length of plagiotropic and orthotropic branches, individual leaf area, chlorophyll content, and yield were performed. Intercropping promotes changes in the microclimatic conditions of coffee plants close to <b>rubber</b> <b>trees,</b> with reduction of temperature and irradiance level and increase in air relative humidity. The proximity of the coffee <b>tree</b> to the <b>rubber</b> <b>trees</b> promotes the elongation of the plagiotropic and orthotropic branches and increases the individual leaf area; however, it does not affect leaf concentrations of N, K, Mg, Fe, Zn, and B in 'Conilon' coffee and {{does not have a}} negative impact on yield...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} drought {{conditions}} on the water relations of <b>rubber</b> <b>trees</b> is important because the trees could shed leaves while they are being continuously tapped. The aim of this work was to study the effect of soil drought and the tapping of latex on the water relations of <b>rubber</b> <b>trees.</b> This study distinguished between untapped trees and trees affected by tapping activity. The experiment was conducted on 14 - 15 year-old <b>rubber</b> <b>trees</b> from the clone, RRIM 600, at the Chachoengsao Rubber Research Center (CRRC). Climatic measurement, soil water content, predawn and midday leaf water potential, stand transpiration and percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC) were measured from January 2009 to January 2010, especially in the dry season. Under drought conditions, during the rainy season, stand transpiration and predawn leaf water potential decreased in response to soil drought in August. The midday leaf water potential and PLC did not change following soil water stress. In the dry season, the plant water status was related to climatic variables and soil drought. The results indicated that drought induces {{a reduction in the}} plant water status of <b>rubber</b> <b>trees.</b> Tapping activity did not have a marked infl uence on the water balance of the <b>rubber</b> <b>trees.</b> However, tapping reduced the sap fl ux density and stomatal conductance; thus, attention must be paid to tapping in the dry season, particularly in dry areas.

25|$|One of the Nauruans' {{methods to}} reach {{self-sufficiency}} was to exploit their gardens to the fullest. They cultivated many edible plants and were soon imitated by the Japanese, {{who began to}} farm every space available. They grew eggplant, corn, pumpkin, and sweet potato. Still lacking sufficient output, they created pumpkin plantations, using half drums filled with night soil which had been collected from the population by forced Chinese workers. This method {{turned out to be}} extremely productive in Nauru's tropical weather, but as a result, dysentery spread, killing several people. Swarms of flies appeared around the plantations, and the smell was unbearable. Toddy, brewed with the sap of coconut trees, was a valuable dietary supplement and at times the only food available. All the trees used for toddy were inventoried and allocated to the population, three for each Japanese, two for a Pacific Islander, and one for a Chinese. They were used {{to such an extent that}} they were no longer able to produce coconuts. After learning that <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> fruit was edible, the Japanese forbade the Islanders from gathering it, and started eating it themselves.|$|E

Many crop plants were introduced by or through these gardensoften in association with European botanical gardens such as Kew or Amsterdamand included cloves, tea, coffee, breadfruit, cinchona, sugar, cotton, palm oil and Theobroma cacao (for chocolate). During these times, the rubber plant was introduced to Singapore. Especially in the tropics, the larger gardens were frequently associated with a herbarium and museum of economy. The Botanical Garden of Peradeniya had considerable influence on the development of agriculture in Ceylon where the Para <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> (...) was introduced from Kew, which had itself imported the plant from South America. Other examples include cotton from the Chelsea Physic Garden to the Province of Georgia in 1732 and tea into India by Calcutta Botanic Garden. The transfer of germplasm between the temperate and tropical botanical gardens was undoubtedly responsible for the range of agricultural crops currently used in several regions of the tropics.|$|E
