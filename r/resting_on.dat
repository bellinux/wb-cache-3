5|$|Timema {{walking sticks}} are night-feeders who spend daytime <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> the leaves or bark {{of the plants}} they feed on. Timema colors (primarily green, gray, or brown) and {{patterns}} (which may be stripes, scales, or dots) match their typical background, a form of crypsis.|$|E

50|$|The pulpit <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> {{a central}} column, raised on an {{octagonal}} pedestal. This central column <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> sculptures {{of animals and}} telamons and is surrounded by six columns of different height, three of which <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> a lion, while the other three <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> octagonal bases. The columns came from remains at Ostia. The Corinthian capitals support trefoil Gothic arches, richly decorated with Prophets and Evangelists in the spandrels. These arches are separated by sculptures of St. John the Baptist, St. Michael and the Virtues and, surprisingly, a nude Hercules.|$|R

5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
5|$|A small example {{excavated}} {{from underneath}} the Late Preclassic levels of Structure E3-1 at Chalchuapa in El Salvador may date to the Middle Preclassic. Three potbelly monuments were found <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> a large terrace in Santa Leticia in El Salvador, a site near Chalchuapa consisting of various mounds and platforms. These monuments were large and especially obese. Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 were important in securely dating the potbelly style of sculpture. The El Salvador potbellies conform to the Monte Alto style of boulder sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{the top end}} of a clarinet's {{range is}} difficult, since many {{advanced}} players can produce notes well above the highest notes commonly found in method books. G6 is usually the highest note clarinetists encounter in classical repertoire. The C above that (C7 i.e. <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> the fifth ledger line above the treble staff) is attainable by advanced players and is shown on many fingering charts, and fingerings as high as A7 exist.|$|E

5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> the sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up}} the front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|In the {{north-east}} are two {{homes of}} early wealthy merchants and shipowners connected with Kirkcaldy's harbour. The Merchant’s House or Law’s Close at 339–343 High Street; {{once owned by}} the Law family, {{is one of the}} best surviving examples of a sixteenth-century town house in Scotland. Sailors' Walk, at 443–449 High Street; consists of two seventeenth-century houses, <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> foundations dating back to around 1460. These two houses were once divided into four dwellings; three of which were owned by the Oliphant family and the fourth by James Ferguson of Raith.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids {{generally}} have weak legs that are set back, and many species move around on land by <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> the breast and pushing themselves forward, {{often with the}} help of their wings. The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below). The feet of shearwaters are set far back on the body for swimming and are of little use when on the ground.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge is}} 1898 ft long and {{consists}} of seven 230 ft deck arch spans and nine deck girder sections. The roadbed is 27 ft wide, and the structure is 34 ft wide overall. Piers 1 and 8, at the ends, <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> solid rock. The intermediate piers <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> driven timber pilings. Piers 2, 4, 5 and 7 <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> 180 vertical piles, while piers 3 and 6, required to resist lateral thrust, have 260 piers driven at an angle.|$|R
50|$|There are two menisci in the knee. They sit {{between the}} thigh bone and the shin bone. While {{the ends of}} the thigh bone and the shin bone have a thin {{covering}} of soft hyaline cartilage, the menisci are made of tough fibrocartilage and conform to the surfaces of the bones they <b>rest</b> <b>on.</b> One meniscus <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> the medial tibial plateau; this is the medial meniscus. The other meniscus <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> the lateral tibial plateau; this is the lateral meniscus.|$|R
5|$|Solitary in nature, the Atlantic torpedo {{is often}} seen <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> or half-buried in the {{substrate}} during the day, becoming more active at night. Large and well-defended from attack, it seldom falls prey to other animals. Known parasites of the Atlantic torpedo include the tapeworms Calyptrobothrium occidentale and C. minus, Grillotia microthrix, Monorygma sp., and Phyllobothrium gracile, the monogeneans Amphibdella flabolineata and Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the copepod Eudactylina rachelae. Some accounts suggest that this ray {{may be able to}} survive out of water for up to a day.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Helgoland {{received}} four twin gun turrets between 1909–12, although their exact type is unknown. Battery Kaiser Wilhelm II {{was built to}} protect the port of Zeebrugge in Occupied Flanders during World War I. It consisted of four guns in concrete barbettes mounted on Bettungsschiessgerüst (BSG) (firing platforms). These manually powered mounts rotated on a pivot {{at the front of}} the mount and the rear was supported by rollers <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> a semi-circular rail. They were equipped with a gun shield and capable of all-around fire. They were manned by sailors from Naval Artillery Regiment (Matrosen Artillerie Regiment) 1.|$|E
5|$|The mosques at Gedi {{contained}} {{wells and}} washing facilities, {{which would have}} been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used for the call to prayer, which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms flanking the central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north walls in the direction of Mecca.|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} RAM 14000 is almost complete, {{with the left}} side only lacking {{a piece of the}} maxilla. However, the skull was split down the middle by erosion, {{possibly}} when it was <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> the bottom of a river bed. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a trapezoid in shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{south-western}} promontory of Dun Mingulay {{features the}} remains of an Iron Age fort {{and there is a}} pre-historic site at Crois an t-Suidheachain near the western landing place at Aneir {{at the southern end of}} Mingulay Bay, which may have been a stone circle. In 1971 a 2,000-year-old Iron Age midden was found <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> sand near the ‘Village’ overlooking the Bay. A stone 'pebble hammer' was discovered nearby in 1975, but it has not been possible to date the find. Skipisdale may also contain Iron Age remains.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} best-understood mansio {{was built on}} a stone base about 130CE. It was at least two storeys high and fronted by a {{colonnade}} with a tiled roof, probably supported on wooden columns. In {{the centre of the}} colonnade, a large door formed the main entrance to the interior of the building. Through the entrance hall was a colonnaded atrium or courtyard with a plastered floor, the central area probably being open to the sky and perhaps containing a herbaceous garden. Timber posts <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> these foundations {{around the edges of the}} colonnade supported a balcony above.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> {{a sloping}} lot that forms an embankment {{along the sides}} and the Fore Street entrance of the building.
