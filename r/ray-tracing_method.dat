Each neutron is assigned a count rate which is modified on each interaction with the instrument, like the reflection at or transmission through a (super)mirror plate. The trajectory is discarded if the neutron does not hit the subsequent component or gets absorbed. Some components (e.g. sample environment) can multiply neutron trajectories by splitting the neutrons into several possible final states and assigning the appropriate probability to each of them, thus keeping the total neutron intensity either constant or decreasing if neutrons are lost.|$|E

However, the lowest applicable frequency has not been cleared. In this paper, the FDTD method has been applied to analyze the site attenuation of a compact anechoic chamber from 30 MHz to 250 MHz, and this has been compared with the calculated one by the <b>ray-tracing</b> <b>method</b> to evaluate the lowest frequency where the <b>ray-tracing</b> <b>method</b> could be applied. The compact anechoic chamber, where the absorbers are placed on the all walls, has been used for the calculation. For FDTD analysis, the dipole antenna and the absorber have been modeled by using the large cell, whose size is larger than the diameter of the antenna element. For verification, the site attenuation of a compact anechoic chamber has been measured and compared with the calculated values by the FDTD method and the <b>ray-tracing</b> <b>method.</b> As the results, the calculated values by the <b>ray-tracing</b> <b>method</b> have larger deviation than the ones by the FDTD method when the frequency is less than 180 MHz...|$|E
