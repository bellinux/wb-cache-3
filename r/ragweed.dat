5|$|The {{shores of}} Lake Cahuilla {{developed}} arrowweed, tules and willowweed, with mesquite at {{distance to the}} shoreline. Land plants identified in Lake Cahuilla sediments include evening primroses, pine, Polypodiaceae, <b>ragweed,</b> saltbushes, Selaginella sinuites and sunflower. Many of these are represented by pollen. The Pleistocene lake and adjacent lagoons featured charophytes of the genus Chara.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{was sent}} to the Lovelace Clinic and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to undergo {{extensive}} physical examinations and to submit to a battery of psychological tests. He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered from hay fever, but was permitted to continue when it was determined that his allergies would not be a problem due to the absence of <b>ragweed</b> pollen in space. On April 13, 1959, Grissom received official notification that he had been selected as one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds {{from a wide variety of}} annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, <b>ragweed,</b> mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E

25|$|<b>Ragweed</b> pollen is {{a common}} allergen. A single plant may produce about a billion grains of pollen per season, and the pollen is transported on the wind. It causes {{about half of all}} cases of pollen-associated {{allergic}} rhinitis in North America, where ragweeds are most abundant and diverse. Common culprits are common <b>ragweed</b> (A. artemisiifolia) and great <b>ragweed</b> (A. trifida).|$|E
25|$|Arizona {{was once}} {{regarded}} as a haven for people with pollen allergies, although several <b>ragweed</b> species grow in the desert. However, as suburbs grew and people began establishing irrigated lawns and gardens, more irritating species of <b>ragweed</b> gained a foothold and Arizona lost its claim of freedom from hay fever.|$|E
25|$|In Denmark, {{decades of}} rising {{temperatures}} cause pollen to appear earlier and in greater numbers, {{as well as}} introduction of new species such as <b>ragweed.</b>|$|E

50|$|Also, {{interest}} is great in preventing {{the spread of}} this plant because its pollen is a significant human allergen. It {{is one of the}} most familiar allergenic <b>ragweeds,</b> and residents of different regions begin to experience allergic symptoms as the plant spreads into the area.|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>ragweeds</b> it is monoecious, {{with each}} {{inflorescence}} bearing heads of pistillate (female) flowers below {{a cluster of}} staminate (male) flowers. The inflorescence is spiny, especially when in fruit. The fruit is a spherical, woolly bur about half a centimeter long covered in hooked spines.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ragweed</b> pollen is {{notorious for}} causing {{allergic}} reactions in humans, specifically allergic rhinitis. Up {{to half of}} all cases of pollen-related allergic rhinitis in North America are caused by ragweeds.|$|E
25|$|Where {{herbicides}} {{cannot be}} used, mowing may be repeated about every three weeks, as it grows back rapidly. In the past, <b>ragweed</b> was usually cut down, left to dry, and then burned. This method is used less often now, {{because of the}} pollution caused by smoke. Manually uprooting <b>ragweed</b> is generally ineffective, and skin contact can cause allergic reaction. If uprooting is the method of choice, it should be performed before flowering. There is evidence that mechanical and chemical control methods are actually no more effective {{in the long run}} than leaving the weed in place.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{people often}} mistakenly blame the {{conspicuous}} goldenrod flower for allergies. Since this plant is entomophilous (its pollen is dispersed by animals), its heavy, sticky pollen {{does not become}} independently airborne. Most late summer and fall pollen allergies are probably caused by <b>ragweed,</b> a widespread anemophilous plant.|$|E
5000|$|Garage is Cross Canadian <b>Ragweed's</b> seventh album. A limited release {{special edition}} {{included}} a bonus DVD containing six videos, one chronicling the band's 10th anniversary.

25|$|The {{vigorous}} {{growth of}} oats tends to choke out most weeds. A few tall broadleaf weeds, such as <b>ragweed,</b> goosegrass, wild mustard, and buttonweed (velvetleaf), occasionally create a problem, as they complicate harvest and reduce yields. These {{can be controlled}} with a modest application of a broadleaf herbicide, such as 2,4-D, while the weeds are still small.|$|E
25|$|Stillwater {{is known}} as the home of red dirt music, a mixture of folk, country, blues and rock.

25|$|Ragweeds are {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} genus Ambrosia in the aster family, Asteraceae. They are distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, especially North America, where the origin and center of diversity of the genus are in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Several species have been introduced to the Old World and some have naturalized and have become invasive species. <b>Ragweed</b> species are expected to continue spreading across Europe {{in the near future}} in response to on-going climate change.|$|E
25|$|Allergic {{diseases}} are strongly familial: identical twins {{are likely to}} have the same allergic diseases about 70% of the time; the same allergy occurs about 40% of the time in non-identical twins. Allergic parents {{are more likely to have}} allergic children, and those children's allergies are likely to be more severe than those in children of non-allergic parents. Some allergies, however, are not consistent along genealogies; parents who are allergic to peanuts may have children who are allergic to <b>ragweed.</b> It seems that the likelihood of developing allergies is inherited and related to an irregularity in the immune system, but the specific allergen is not.|$|E
25|$|The {{region of}} this early {{agriculture}} {{is in the}} middle Mississippi valley, from Memphis north to St. Louis and extending about 300 miles east and west of the river, mostly in Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The oldest archaeological site known in the United States in which Indians were growing, rather than gathering, food is Phillips Spring in Missouri. At Phillips Spring, dating from 3,000 BCE, archaeologists found abundant walnuts, hickory nuts, acorns, grapes, elderberries, <b>ragweed,</b> bottle gourd, and the seeds of Cucurbita pepo, a gourd with edible seeds that is the ancestor of pumpkins and most squashes. The seeds found at Phillips Spring were larger than those of wild C. pepo. The agency for this change was surely human manipulation. Humans were selecting, planting, and tending seeds from plants that produced larger and tastier seeds. Ultimately, they would manipulate C. pepo to produce edible flesh.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ragweeds</b> are annual and {{perennial}} {{herbs and}} shrubs. Species may grow {{just a few}} centimeters tall or well exceed four meters in height. The stems are erect, decumbent or prostrate, and many grow from rhizomes. The leaves may be arranged alternately, oppositely, or both. The leaf blades come in many shapes, sometimes divided pinnately or palmately into lobes. The edges are smooth or toothed. Some are hairy, and most are glandular.|$|R
50|$|Many music festivals include {{representatives of}} the Red Dirt sound. These include FarmFest, WoodyFest, Calffry, Shrinefest, and others. In 2007, Cross Canadian <b>Ragweed's</b> Red Dirt Round Up in Fort Worth, Texas had 15,000 in attendance. In August 2008, the 4th annual Red Dirt Festival {{was held at the}} Grape Ranch Winery in Okemah, Oklahoma. The festival brings {{together}} wine tasting, camping and Red Dirt music. The winery teamed up with the Red Dirt Rangers to present the festival.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ragweeds</b> are monoecious, most {{producing}} inflorescences {{that contain}} both staminate and pistillate flowers. Inflorescences {{are often in}} the form of a spike or raceme made up mostly of staminate flowers with some pistillate clusters around the base. Staminate flower heads have stamens surrounded by whitish or purplish florets. Pistillate flower heads have fruit-yielding ovules surrounded by many phyllaries and fewer, smaller florets. The pistillate flowers are wind pollinated, and the fruits develop. They are burs, sometimes adorned with knobs, wings, or spines.|$|R
