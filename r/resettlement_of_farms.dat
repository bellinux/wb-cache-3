50|$|Several farms on {{the west}} coast of Lewis were indeed re-settled, just in time to {{forestall}} land raids there, but in spring 1921 Coll and Gress were again raided, and again Leverhulme responded by halting his developments. The government thus felt released from its undertaking not to invoke compulsory powers. Faced with this official determination, Leverhulme conceded to <b>resettlement</b> <b>of</b> the entire <b>farms</b> <b>of</b> Coll and Gress, and part of Orinsay in the south of Lewis, rather than lose them piecemeal by legal action.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947, Grigory Arutyunov, then First Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia, {{managed to}} persuade the Council of Ministers of the USSR to issue a decree {{entitled}} Planned measures for the <b>resettlement</b> <b>of</b> collective <b>farm</b> workers and other Azerbaijanis from the Armenian SSR to the Kura-Arax lowlands of the Azerbaijani SSR. According to the decree, between 1948 and 1951, the Azeri community in Armenia became partly subject to a [...] "voluntary resettlement" [...] (called by some sources a deportation) to central Azerbaijan {{to make way for}} Armenian immigrants from the Armenian diaspora. In those four years some 100,000 Azeris were deported from Armenia. This reduced the number of those in Armenia down to 107,748 in 1959. By 1979, Azeris numbered 160,841 and constituted 5.3% of Armenia's population. The Azeri population of Yerevan, that once formed the majority, dropped to 0.7% by 1959 and further to 0.1% by 1989.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} article based on rare archival {{materials}} {{for the first time}} used in scientific circulation the author examines the issues of cultural and domestic arrangement of migrant kolkhozes (collective farms) in the North Caucasus region in the period of agriculture collectivization. The author highlights the key activities of regional authorities in the sphere of cultural development within these collective farms. It is stated that cultural arrangement <b>of</b> <b>resettlement</b> <b>of</b> collective <b>farms</b> in the 1930 s was far from ideal. But taking into account state importance <b>of</b> the <b>resettlement</b> campaign, the authorities managed to achieve certain positive changes. An integral part of the cultural life {{of the people of the}} red army was its political and ideological component, due to the high level of politicization of public life in the USSR in 1930 s. The red army collective farms were equipped with schools, nurseries and kindergartens, clubs and cinemas but these institutions were poorly organized. The article points out that labour of the red army settlers had little common features with <b>farms</b> <b>of</b> the local people. Community production activities and everyday leisure are, on the contrary, marked by the similarity of lifestyle. The mass spread of literacy stimulated the reader’s interest – immigrants in their leisure hours read the newspapers, magazines and books, mainly fiction. The author examines the everyday life of immigrants, and it is largely substantiated by their social moods which contributed to the formation of the red army collective farms. The author came to the conclusion that the daily life of settlers was largely due to their social disadvantage. Food and accommodation, working conditions were at a very low level. For most of them, life and work in the Kuban Cossack villages was a daily test of their physical and moral forces and was not much different from the life of the Kuban collective farmers...|$|R
