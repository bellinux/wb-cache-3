40|$|We {{characterize}} {{the relation between}} corporate asset structure and capital structure by exploiting variation in the salability <b>of</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>assets.</b> Theory suggests that tangibility increases borrowing capacity because it allows creditors to more easily repossess a firm's <b>assets.</b> <b>Tangible</b> <b>assets,</b> however, are often illiquid. We show that the redeployability <b>of</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> is a main determinant of corporate leverage (beyond traditional measures of asset tangibility). Our analysis uses an instrumental variables approach that incorporates measures {{of supply and demand}} for various types <b>of</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> (e. g., machines, land, and buildings). Consistent with a credit supply-side view of capital structure, we find that asset redeployability is a particularly important driver of leverage for firms that are likely to face credit frictions (small, unrated, and low payout firms). Additional tests show that asset redeployability facilitates borrowing the most during periods of tight credit. Our work contributes new evidence to capital structure models that are based on contract incompleteness and limited enforceability. It does so characterizing a well-defined channel through which credit frictions affect firm financial decisions...|$|R

30|$|Gracia & Mira (2014) {{found that}} in order to {{overcome}} the problem of external financing constraints, financially constrained firms prefer to hold more <b>tangible</b> <b>assets.</b> Almeida & Campello (2010) tested the external financing â€“ cash flow relationship through collateral channel and find that the cash flow coefficient is more positive for financially constrained firms as compared to unconstrained firms. Similar results are also presented by BernankeÂ et al., (1996) and Kiyotaki & Moore (1997). Their findings also support the macroeconomic literature, showing that more collaterals help relax external financing constraints.

30|$|There is also {{an intense}} debate {{on the role of}} credit {{multiplier}} in establishing the external financing â€“ cash flows relationship. The credit multiplier is considered as an additional instrument, which makes the relationship between cash flows and external funds less negative. Financially constrained firms suffer more from adverse selection costs than the financially unconstrained firms do. Therefore, creditors require more loan guarantees, mainly in terms <b>of</b> pledging <b>tangible</b> <b>assets,</b> in order to save their contracts while lending to financially constrained firms. Thus, financially constrained firms are likely to invest excess of their internal funds in <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> such as plant, property, and equipment. Possession <b>of</b> more <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> makes easy for financially constrained firms to acquire external funds. Several previous studies including Campello & Hackbarth (2012), Almeida & Campello (2007), Bernanke et al. (1996), and Kiyotaki & Moore (1997) have suggested that the tangibility of assets increases the capability of financially constrained firms to seek new funds. Almeida & Campello (2007) provided evidence that firms increase their <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> when they are in periods of positive income shocks which in turn increase firmsâ€™ capacity for new credit and as a result more <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and so on. Almeida & Campello (2010) and Gracia & Mira (2014) demonstrated that financially constrained firms are more sensitive to increase the holdings <b>of</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>assets.</b> Therefore, the credit multiplier effect is expected to be more prominent in case of financially constrained firms than for unconstrained firms.|$|R
40|$|Revaluation <b>of</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>assets,</b> {{namely the}} {{determination}} of fair value is required to provide a fair image of its financial position and performance.

The accumulated depreciation to the revaluation date may be recalculated {{in proportion to the}} change of the gross asset value or it can be removed from the gross asset value. The entity may record reserves, expenses and corresponding revenues, depending on the plus or the minus of the value.
