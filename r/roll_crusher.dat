40|$|Comminution is {{the process}} in which by {{activity}} of mechanical forces the dispersion state of solid material is being changed. The dispersion state is definitely determined by the granulometric compoÂ¬sition particle (size distribution).

The breaking of individual particles is the most efficient comminution method because the energy losses owing to friction and unproductive tension in the instant of breakage are avoided.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{airborne}} respirable dust generated from break- age of different coals varies widely. This {{research was conducted}} to identify the facets of airborne respirable dust liberation from the coal product. Laboratory crushing experiments were conducted {{on a range of}} low to high volatile bituminous coals to investigate the various factors influencing airborne respirable dust generation. Bituminous coal samples from 8 mines (5 U. S. and 3 Polish) were uniformly prepared and processed through a double <b>roll</b> <b>crusher</b> located in a low air velocity wind tunnel. Experimental factors studied included inherent coal seam constituents, specific energy of crushing, product size characteristics, dust cloud electrostatic field, and specific quantity of airborne respirable dust generated. The results of this investigation build upon previously published results, which indicated that a combination of several factors are associated with the generation of airborne respirable dust. One factor involved is the effect of coal rank, described by the inherent moist fuel ratio, on the product size characteristics, defined by Schuhmann size function parameters. However, since coals of high moist fuel ratio (high rank) are generally more extensively cleated, it is suggested in the present work that the degree of cleating is directly responsible for the quantity of respirable-sized particles produced in the crushed product material for eastern U. S. coals. This is implied by the relationship of ash content and at least one mineral constituent (pyrite, determined from pyritic sulfur analysis) to the percentage of airborne respirable dust. To validate this hypothesis, a description is offered that is based on known coal petrography. Another key factor is the effect of air dry loss moisture in the coal seam on the breakage-induced electrostatic field of airborne dust. The air dry loss moisture factor appears to control the amount of airborne respirable dust that is liberated from the product. The resultant effect of these factors is that different percentages of coal particles smaller than 10 25 m are dispersed as airborne respirable dust with a well-defined peak in the normalized airborne respirable dust for a narrow range of air dry loss moisture - ash ratios. A clear delineation of coals, based on well-known proximate analysis characteristics, that generate the most respirable dust appears to be possible. It was also shown that the dust-generating characteristics of coals could be reasonably described by both the moist fuel rati...|$|E

40|$|Airborne dust {{generation}} {{is one of}} the byproducts of coal mining, processing, and handling. The amount of airborne total dust (ATD, respirable size and larger) and airborne respirable dust (ARD) generated is of primary interest for designing the level of engineering controls needed for adequate dust abatement. Laboratory crushing experiments were conducted in a wind tunnel with a <b>roll</b> <b>crusher</b> to identify relationships among crushing parameters, product size, coal rank properties, and airborne dust generation. Through the first series of experiments, the effect of primary and secondary breakage processes on both product size and airborne dust generation was examined. Through a second series of experiments, the effect of coal rank properties on product size and airborne dust generation was studied using a uniform crushing process with secondary breakage. Laboratory results indicate that secondary breakage of a particular coal notably increases the specific amount of ATD generated, while negligibly impacting the specific amount of ARD generated. A strong positive relationship was identified between the specific amounts of ATD and ARD generated during the primary breakage process (with minimal secondary breakage), but a negligible relationship was observed between the same two variables when secondary breakage was introduced into the crushing process. This indicates that most of the ATD and ARD is generated from the primary breakage, while secondary breakage has a more of an influence on generating additional amounts of larger sized ATD. Additional experiments involving the uniform crushing of eight different bituminous coals showed that the coal rank, expressed as the inherent moist fuel ratio (MFR = fixed carbon =(volatile x inherent moisture)), had diverse relationships between the product size created and the amount of airborne dust generated. As bituminous coal rank or MFR increased, the amount of coal product fines < 250 gm increased while the mass percentage of ATD and ARD liberated from these < 250 25 m product fines decreased. Air dry loss (ADL) moisture in the coal was found to be inversely related to the dust cloud electrostatic field, influencing dust liberation from the coal product fines. Since the MFR was directly related to the dust cloud electrostatic field, opposite the ADL-electrostatic field relationship, the diverse relationships between the product size created and the amount of dust liberated from the < 250 25 m product fines were explained. Finally, 12 to 14 times more ATD was generated as compared to the ARD generated during these experiments. These results should provide a fundamental basis for initial estimation of the airborne dust loading requirements of engineering control methods for coal crushing...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In general, cold-cured {{flexible}} foams {{have a high}} {{content of}} closed cells during a foaming process because of a high reactivity of foaming components and curing at a low temperature. Cold-cured flexible foams require a mechanical method such as <b>roll</b> <b>crushing</b> or vacuum crushing to open a high content of closed cells for preventing shrinkage and cracking of foam after demolding. But this mechanical crushing process can yield foams with poor properties and reduce productivity on account of increasing costs for utilities, electricity, manpower and repair. A noncrushing foam system developed by Kumho Mitsui Chemicals Inc. (hereafter referred to as ââKMCIââ) is a new cell opening technology that makes complete cell opening during the foaming process. Thus, this technology results in no shrinkage and cracking after demolding. In addition the noncrushing foam system makes possible manufacturing automotive seat cushions having an open cell structure and excellent cell stability compared to conventional foam by minimizing the degree of cross-linking density and increasing urea linkage. Our new technology {{has been used to}} make seat cushion at Hyundai Motor Company in Korea since 1999. We expect that the noncrushing foam system will be applied in various flexible foam applications and will contribute to improvement of productivity and seat cushion quality...|$|R
