25|$|The {{script that}} Cruise {{approved}} {{called for a}} final showdown to take place {{on top of a}} moving train. The actor wanted to use the famously fast French train the TGV but <b>rail</b> <b>authorities</b> did not want any part of the stunt performed on their trains. When that was no longer a problem, the track was not available. De Palma visited railroads on two continents trying to get permission. Cruise took the train owners out to dinner and the next day they were allowed to use it. For the actual sequence, the actor wanted wind that was so powerful that it could knock him off the train. Cruise had difficulty finding the right machine that would create the wind velocity that would look visually accurate before remembering a simulator he used while training as a skydiver. The only machine of its kind in Europe was located and acquired. Cruise had it produce winds up to 140 miles per hour so it would distort his face. Exterior shots of the train were filmed on the Glasgow South Western Line, between New Cumnock, Dumfries and Annan. Most of the sequence, however, was filmed on a stage against a blue screen for later digitizing by the visual effects team at Industrial Light & Magic.|$|E
2500|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad's MP54 was a {{class of}} {{electric}} multiple unit railcars. The class was initially constructed as an unpowered, locomotive hauled coach for suburban operations, but were designed with the capacity to be rebuilt into self-propelled MU as electrification plans were realized. The first of these self-propelled cars were placed in service with the PRR subsidiary Long Island Rail Road with DC propulsion in 1908 and soon spread to the Philadelphia-based network of low frequency AC electrified suburban lines in 1915. [...] Eventually the cars came to be used throughout the railroad's electrified network from Washington, DC to New York City and Harrisburg, PA. The ubiquitous cars became a commuting tradition during their long years of service in several major cities. and were known as [...] "red cars" [...] or [...] "red rattlers". [...] The cars ran in service with the PRR until the Penn Central merger in 1968 at which point they were already being marked for replacement by new technology railcars such as the Budd M1 and Pioneer III. [...] After the bankruptcy of the Penn Central the remaining MP54's found themselves being operated by Conrail under contract with local commuter <b>rail</b> <b>authorities.</b> [...] The last MP54 cars were retired in 1980-81 while engaged in Philadelphia suburban service with SEPTA.|$|E

In 1970 <b>rail</b> <b>authorities</b> briefly considered adding new tracks to existing lines, however this idea was quickly abandoned and the idea of construction of a brand new line was revived. The line was planned to be a two-track, high speed connection, designed to carry both express passenger trains and heavy freight trains. Construction of several overpasses was planned, to avoid intersecting with roads. Speeds up to 250 km/h were projected for passenger trains, and a maximum weight up to 5,000 gross tons for freight trains.|$|E

50|$|After {{many years}} of discussions between the local council and <b>rail</b> <b>authorities,</b> the station was {{relocated}} in 1983, to a site outside the town, on a new section of track which linked the Melbourne and Stratford lines, without the need to run {{in and out of}} the original station. This formed a rail triangle for a short period of time. The goods facilities were first to be moved, on 28 September 1983, using part of the Sale - Stratford line as the base of the yard. The last train ran to the old station on 12 November 1983, with the new station officially opening on 4 December the same year. The last remnant of the railway line arriving directly into Sale was abolished in 1985, when parts of the former Port of Sale spur line were removed. Full signalling was not provided until 1987. Station staff were withdrawn in 1993, but have since been restored.|$|E
50|$|The Gerogery level {{crossing}} accident was a vehicle-train crash that occurred at Bells Road on the Olympic Highway, where it crossed the Main Southern railway in Gerogery, New South Wales, Australia.

There had been a continuing series of crashes at the level crossing prior to the fatal crash, resulting in the local road and <b>rail</b> <b>authorities</b> installing perceptual countermeasures such as warning signs and enhanced road markings in attempts to provide more information to drivers of the crossing location and characteristics and to influence vehicle approach speeds.|$|E
50|$|Skånetrafiken {{has been}} criticised, {{particularly}} in 2007, {{for not being}} sufficiently quick and decisive in response to increases in patronage.

There was more criticism during 2009/2010 for crowding in the Malmö station which was being rebuilt. Skånetrafiken claims to have made changes in internal decision procedures to catch these problems more quickly in the future. The Malmö Central station has no room for more trains until a new tunnel is opened in the winter 2010-2011. It is not possible to rent or buy any old train for the traffic to Denmark, since both <b>rail</b> <b>authorities</b> have many requirements meaning custom made trains must be bought.

50|$|By 1888, {{and early}} railway line from Boksburg to Braamfontein would pass a tin shed at a station spot {{that would be}} called Park, named after the Krugers Park {{just north of the}} stop. Krugers Park would later be known as Old Wanderers. By 1889/1890 the stop was now called Park Halt on the Boksburg/Braamfontein line. The line was run by the De Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg Maatschappy (ZASM) and was known as the Rand Steam Tram which transported coal from the collieries at Boksburg to the yards at Braamfontein. It would later be {{extended}} westwards to Krugersdorp and eastwards from Boksburg to Springs.The Netherlands-South African Railway Company (De Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg Maatschappy) (NZASM) was a railway monopoly granted by the South African Republic (ZAR) government for construction and management of railways in the Transvaal and was formed on 21 June 1887. The backers were Labouchere Oyens in the Netherlands and Robert Warschauer and Die Berliner Handelsgesellschaft of Berlin, Germany. The NZASM planned to build a railway from Pretoria to the border of Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique), the aim being to have an independent link to the Indian Ocean, bypassing British territory in the Cape and Natal. The project fell short of funding, and after money was loaned to the ZAR by the Cape government, they were able to obtain a further loan from Rothchilds, but with the condition they Cape <b>rail</b> <b>authorities</b> were allowed to continue the Cape line through the Orange Free State to Johannesburg and set the rate for a period of three years.The second train line to reach Johannesburg would therefore be from Cape Town with the first train arriving on 15 September 1892. In 1893, Pretoria was finally connected to Johannesburg via a railway with the lines lowered from ground level closer to the station for public safety while to improve the connection to northern part of the town, a road bridge was constructed over the lines at King Georges Street and a pedestrian bridge built {{at the north end of}} Twist Street. This was soon followed by the ZAR's project to connect Pretoria to Delagoa Bay, with the first train arriving in Johannesburg from Lourenco Marques (Maputo) on 2 November 1894. The Colony of Natal would be connected to the goldfields on 2 January 1896 when the first train arrived in Johannesburg from Durban.|$|E
