50|$|The Milwaukee Sentinel, {{begun in}} 1837 as a weekly {{published}} by city co-founder Solomon Juneau, {{passed through the}} hands of several owners before being sold to the Hearst Corporation in 1924. Hearst operated the Sentinel until 1962, when, following a long and costly strike, it abruptly announced {{the closing of the}} paper. Although Hearst claimed that the paper had lost money for years, The Journal Company, concerned about the loss of an important voice (and facing questions about its own dominance of the Milwaukee media market), agreed to buy the Sentinel name, subscription lists, and goodwill associated with the name. In 1995 the Journal and Sentinel were consolidated. The new Journal Sentinel then became a seven-day morning paper. In 1964, Journal Communications bought a part interest in Perry Printing, a commercial printer specializing in printing magazines, catalogs and free-standing inserts for publications. A decade later, in 1974, it purchased the remaining shares of the company. In 1995, it sold the operation (which by then had about 1000 employees and sales of $123 million) to the Milhous Group of California. In 1968, the Midwestern <b>Relay</b> <b>cable</b> transmission division of the Journal Company was developed out of broadcast-related expertise; in 1991, Midwestern Relay acquired Norlight, a fiber-optic private carrier, and adopted the Norlight name. On February 26, 2007 Journal Communications sold the regional telecommunications provider to privately held Q-Comm Corp of Delaware. Upon closing the transaction, Q-Comm terminated Jim Ditter, who had been president of Norlight since 1995, and chief financial officer Mike Garvey. What is now known as the Journal Community Publishing Group began in Waupaca, Wisconsin in 1972 as a publishing and printing company called Add Inc. A majority interest was purchased by Journal Communications in 1981, and the remainder in 1986. In June 2007, Journal Communications sold off its JCP interests in Louisiana, Ohio, Connecticut and Vermont. The sales brought in a combined $30 million.|$|E

50|$|Another {{consequence}} of the divestiture was in how both national broadcast television (i.e., ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS) and radio networks (NPR, Mutual, ABC Radio) distributed their programming to their local affiliated stations. Prior to the breakup, the broadcast networks relied on AT&T Long Lines' infrastructure of terrestrial microwave <b>relay,</b> coaxial <b>cable,</b> and, for radio, broadcast-quality leased line networks to deliver their programming to local stations. However, by the mid-1970s, the then-new technology of satellite distribution offered by other companies like RCA Astro Electronics and Western Union with their respective Satcom 1 and Westar 1 satellites started to give the Bell System competition in the broadcast distribution field, with the satellites providing higher video & audio quality, as well as much lower transmission costs.|$|R

50|$|The {{tower was}} {{operated}} remotely from Portland, Oregon and {{was capable of}} sending telegraph message {{as far away as}} Asia and Europe. The eight smaller towers were 1500 ft from the central tower. Utilizing short-wave radio signals, the station would transmit point-to-point to regional transmitters such as in San Francisco, California or directly to ships at sea. On site was also a large concrete building 60 ft by 80 ft and 20 ft tall. In addition to this, on July 9, 1923, KEK began operation. The Marine receiving station was licensed to Hillsboro but was located in a building on Council Crest in Portland and the main office was in the Postal Building in downtown Portland.

5000|$|Prior to Gambier-Parry's {{appointment}} to reform communications, SIS agents had depended upon coded telegrams <b>relayed</b> by <b>cable.</b> Before {{the onset of}} war in 1939, he attempted to establish the necessary communications facilities for the Secret Intelligence Service. One wireless facility was set up at Woldingham, Surrey, England. Covert transceivers were designed and built at MI6 workshops in Barnes, London. In addition, the Foreign Office agreed to have emergency transceivers, staffed by MI6 agents, sent to missions on the continent. However, Gambier-Parry's efforts were frustrated by the unwillingness of some heads of overseas missions to take them, {{based on the belief}} that their use was contrary to the Vienna Convention. The hesitance on the part of the Secret Intelligence Service to use radio communication resulted in a substantial lack of experience in clandestine wireless communication at the outbreak of war in 1939. [...] Nonetheless, in 1940 he was one of the triumvirate of senior SIS officers who devised the British resistance network, linked by powerful wireless sets.|$|R
50|$|Before {{utilizing}} microwave <b>relay</b> and coaxial <b>cables,</b> AT&T used {{lines for}} long distance service. In 1911, the system connected New York to Denver. The introduction of repeater towers allowed such connections to reach across North America. In the 1930s the company experimented with long-distance coaxial cable. The first long-distance L-carrier coaxial link in 1936 connected Philadelphia and New York City. With improved klystrons {{and other devices}} devised for World War II, it was quickly determined that relay networks were easy to build, especially over mountainous regions and rough terrain. Coaxial systems connected all major US cities, but the primary links used microwaves.|$|R

Previous researches of relay allocations have obtained certain achievements. However, there are many studies [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] which require relays to know instantaneous CSI, and [13, 14] did not consider the performance of multiuser system. Compared with the traditional model, the cooperative model in which <b>relays</b> use the <b>cable</b> to receive signal instead of wireless medium has not been paid more attention, but still has important significance.|$|R
