50|$|As {{with any}} other <b>RF</b> <b>device,</b> the {{performance}} of an RF module will depend {{on a number of}} factors. For example, by increasing the transmitter power, a larger communication distance will be achieved. However, this will also result in a higher electrical power drain on the transmitter device, which will cause shorter operating life for battery powered devices. Also, using a higher transmit power will make the system more prone to interference with other RF devices, and may in fact possibly cause the device to become illegal depending on the jurisdiction. Correspondingly, increasing the receiver sensitivity will also increase the effective communication range, but will also potentially cause malfunction due to interference with other RF devices.|$|E
40|$|Given {{the wide}} use of Radio Frequency (RF) devices for {{applications}} ranging from data networks to wireless sensors, {{it is of}} interest to identify the types of RF devices that are located in an environment. For example, one could be on campus at a university and would want to prevent their <b>RF</b> <b>device</b> from interfering with other devices. There are currently two techniques {{that are used to}} identify RF devices in the environment, which are known as passive and active fingerprinting. These fingerprinting techniques require that the <b>RF</b> <b>device</b> comply to some transmission standard (IEEE 802. 11) and can therefore only be used to identify a subset of RF devices. ^ We propose an approach that can theoretically be used to identify any <b>RF</b> <b>device.</b> The proposed approach is used to determine sources of nonlinearities and identify filters that are present in the <b>RF</b> <b>device.</b> In our approach, a probe signal is transmitted to the <b>RF</b> <b>device.</b> The <b>RF</b> <b>device</b> retransmits or reradiates a return signal in response to the probe signal. The properties of the return signal are measured and these properties can be shown to contain distinct information that is inherent to sources of the nonlinearities and the filters of the <b>RF</b> <b>device.</b> This information constitutes features {{that can be used to}} identify the <b>RF</b> <b>device.</b> ^ In an effort to identify sources of nonlinearities, we will analyze the output signal obtained from a RF circuit model when the input is either a two-tone probe signal or a windowed linear chirp probe signal. It will be shown that the power spectral density of the output signal contains distinct features caused by nonlinearities in the RF circuit. These features are used to identify the nonlinearity and consequently the <b>RF</b> <b>device.</b> In addition, we will analyze the output signal from the bandpass filter in the RF circuit when the input is either a windowed linear chirp probe signal or a linear chirp probe signal. ^ In this dissertation, we will use simulations to verify our methods. For each simulation, several RF circuit models are considered, where each circuit model contains a unique nonlinearity and bandpass filter. The features are classified using statistical pattern recognition techniques. Some of our results indicate that our simulation approach needs further investigation to validate it against actual measurement data. ...|$|E

40|$|ISBN 978 - 1 - 4244 - 5834 - 9 International audienceThe paper {{discusses}} {{a variety}} of sensors to enable a built-in test in RF devices. The list of sensors includes dummy circuits, process control monitors, DC probes, an envelope detector, and a current sensor. Dummy circuits and process control monitors are simple circuits that do not tap into the signal path of the <b>RF</b> <b>device.</b> Instead, they monitor the device {{by virtue of being}} subject to the same process variations. Their outputs form an alternative measurement pattern which can be mapped to the performances of the device using a typical alternate test flow. The rest of the sensors are physically connected to the <b>RF</b> <b>device,</b> thus they can detect random catastrophic defects within it and, as an auxiliary benefit, they can improve the accuracy in predicting its performances. The degradation that these sensors incur is carefully assessed and the <b>RF</b> <b>device</b> is co-designed with them to correct for the losses. The operation and test efficiency of the sensors is demonstrated for the case of an RF LNA using post-layout simulations...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rapid {{progress}} in the technology for skin rejuvenation has allowed for shorter post-treatment times than ever before. An example of such technology is the radiofrequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>device,</b> which offers nonablative skin rejuvenation, particularly for skin tightening and wrinkle reduction. OBJECTIVE: Medical devices that emit RF energy produce {{a change in the}} electrical charges of the treated skin creating an electron movement, and the resistance of the tissue to the electron movement generates heat. This article examines the mechanism of action of a new bipolar <b>RF</b> <b>device,</b> which emits RF energy through a handpiece with a bipolar electrode configuration, and assesses the clinical histological and immunohistochemical results on a sample group of patients who underwent a cycle of sessions with this device. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients affected with periocular wrinkles, glabellar wrinkles, slackness of the cheeks with accentuation of the nasogenian furrow, striae distensae at the scapulohumeral joint, abdomen, and gluteal-trochanteric areas, or acne scars were included. These patients underwent a cycle of 6 to 8 sessions with 2 -week intervals with the new bipolar <b>RF</b> <b>device</b> undergoing photographic monitoring before treatment {{and at the end of}} the cycle of sessions. In addition, 15 patients from the sample group were subjected to 2 biopsies, one at the start of treatment and the other 3 months after the last treatment. RESULTS: All the patients showed improvement in treated imperfections from the second session onward, and they expressed their satisfaction at the end of the treatment cycle. The most notable clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical results were observed in the patients with abdominal striae distensae. In most cases, the temporary side effects observed consisted of rashes and ecchymosis. Two patients reported the formation of blisters on the treated area caused by excessively high RF settings. CONCLUSION: The new bipolar <b>RF</b> <b>device</b> proved to be effective, noninvasive, and easy to use. The improvement in the treated areas is progressive and continues to be apparent several months after the last session.

Such questions relate to the amount of electromagnetic energy (EME) that people are exposed to from devices such as mobile phones, cordless phones, Wi-Fi and cordless routers, both individually and due to their cumulative exposure. The present study tested such RF EME levels in 20 suburban homes in Melbourne, Australia, assessing EME levels from devices in isolation, as well as from their cumulative exposure. Overall, measurements were very low, with the highest level for a particular home less than 1 % of national exposure limits.
