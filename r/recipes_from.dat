5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for <b>recipes</b> <b>from</b> her friends and relations. Those she had found most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas <b>recipes</b> <b>from</b> Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks.|$|E
5|$|John Nott's The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary (1723), {{still with}} rather few {{precedents}} to go by, chose an alphabetical treatment for its <b>recipes,</b> <b>from</b> Al to Zest.

Bills of fare are given for each month of the year.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} French Revolution, dishes like bouchées la Reine gained prominence. Essentially royal cuisine {{produced}} by the royal household, this is a chicken-based recipe served on vol-au-vents created {{under the influence of}} Queen Marie Leszczyńska, the wife of Louis XV. This recipe is still popular today, as are other <b>recipes</b> <b>from</b> Queen Marie Leszczyńska like consommé la Reine and filet d'aloyau braisé à la royale. Queen Marie is also credited with introducing lentils to the French diet.|$|E
5|$|The food {{section is}} {{supplemented}} {{on the web}} by properties for home cooks and for out-of-home dining. New York Times Cooking (cooking.nytimes.com; also available via iOS app) provides access to more than 17,000 recipes on file as of November 2016, and availability of saving <b>recipes</b> <b>from</b> other sites around the web. The newspaper's restaurant search (nytimes.com/reviews/dining) allows online readers to search NYC area restaurants by cuisine, neighborhood, price, and reviewer rating. The New York Times has also published several cookbooks, including The Essential New York Times Cookbook: Classic Recipes for a New Century, published in late 2010.|$|E

5|$|Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use {{of heavy}} sauces and leaned toward lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose {{function}} is {{to add to the}} flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to <b>recipes</b> <b>from</b> Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.|$|E

He also gave {{his opinion of}} the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of some remedies, and gave details of where particular ingredients came from {{and how they were}} prepared. He favoured proven remedies which had been tested through experience, cautioning that compounds could have unexpected or much stronger effects than might be expected from the effects of the individual components.|$|E
25|$|However, early {{records of}} kimchi do not mention garlic or chili pepper. Chili peppers, now a {{standard}} ingredient in kimchi, had been unknown in Korea {{until the early}} seventeenth century. Chili peppers originated in the Americas, introduced to East Asia by Portuguese traders. The first mention of chili pepper is found in Jibong yuseol, an encyclopedia published in 1614. Sallim gyeongje, a 17‒18th century book on farm management, wrote on kimchi with chili peppers. However, {{it was not until}} the 19th century that the use of chili peppers in kimchi was widespread. The <b>recipes</b> <b>from</b> early 19th century closely resemble today's kimchi.|$|E
