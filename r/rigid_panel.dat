25|$|The {{convertible}} {{featured a}} removable rigid section over the passengers and a folding textile rear section with heatable rear glass window. Power operated, lowering the top required unlatching two header catches, power lowering the top, exiting the car (or reaching {{over to the}} right side latch), and folding down the rigid section manually. Mazda introduced with the convertible the first integral windblocker, a <b>rigid</b> <b>panel</b> that folded up from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching the passengers — thereby extending the driving season for the car in open mode. The convertible also featured optional headrest mounted audio speakers and a folding leather snap-fastened tonneau cover. The convertible assembly was precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body assembly as a complete unit — a first in convertible production.|$|E

50|$|The Roll Out Solar Array, {{known as}} ROSA, is a solar array {{designed}} by NASA. This {{new type of}} solar array provides much more energy than the old solar arrays. Traditional solar panels used to power satellites can be bulky with heavy panels folded together using mechanical hinges. When launching into space, mass and volume are everything, and ROSA is 20 percent lighter and four times smaller in volume than <b>rigid</b> <b>panel</b> arrays. It is a flexible and rollable solar array like a measuring tape wound on its spool. The new solar array design rolls up to form a compact cylinder for launch with significantly less mass and volume, potentially offering substantial cost savings {{as well as an}} increase in power for satellites. Being smaller and lighter than the traditional solar panels, ROSA has a center wing made of a flexible material which support the strings of photovoltaic cells that churn out electrical energy. Both the sides of the wing have a narrow arm that extends through the length of the wing to provide support to the array, called a high strain composite boom. The booms look like split tubes made of a stiff composite material, flattened and rolled up lengthwise.The array does not need any motor to unfurl.This is achieved using the energy stored in the booms that is released as each boom transitions from a coil shape to a straight support arm. Those solar wings are then deployed due to strain energy in rolled booms that are present at the two ends of the structure.|$|E

50|$|The {{hospital}} {{was equipped with}} Deployable Medical System (DEPMEDS) equipment, which could be set up in various configurations. The major components of a combat support hospital were the expandable tactical shelters, TEMPER Tents, and the military vans. The expandable tactical shelter was a <b>rigid</b> <b>paneled</b> metal unit that could be unfolded to become an enclosed air conditioned shelter for use as an operating room, central material services, pharmacy, laboratory, blood bank, radiology, or biomedical maintenance. The TEMPER (Tent Extendible Modular Personnel) tent featured an aluminum frame and fabric outer skin, which could be quickly assembled and disassembled without, tools. The standard ward was 20 feet by 64 feet, consisting of 8 8-by-20 foot TEMPER sections. The MILVAN was a <b>rigid</b> <b>paneled</b> metal storage and transportation container, which was allocated to the functional sections of the hospital. When operational, the combat support hospital could provide climate and environmental control equivalent to that found in any fixed hospital.|$|R

40|$|Several {{types of}} solar cell/coverslide {{combinations}} were launched into synchronous orbit. The cells were 2 and 10 ohm-cm crucible-grown silicon with thicknesses of 0. 2 and 0. 3 mm. Coverslides were fused silica, ranging in thickness from 0. 15 to 1. 52 mm. The cells were mounted on two panels, one a rigid aluminum honeycomb structure, giving essentially infinite backshielding; {{the other was}} a thin Kapton-fiberglass substrate, offering minimal protection to the rear surface of the cells. The current-voltage curves of the cells were measured. Correction of cell electrical output to standard temperature and solar intensity was performed, using empirical radiation-dependent corrections. It is found that the cells on the flexible panel degrade much more rapidly than predicted, while the <b>rigid</b> <b>panel</b> cells follow the predictions fairly well. The anomalous behavior of the flexible panel cells is attributed to the deposition of a contaminant on the cell coverslides...|$|E
