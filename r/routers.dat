5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core <b>routers,</b> edge <b>routers</b> and <b>routers</b> for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core <b>routers</b> {{was when it}} entered the market for edge <b>routers,</b> by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge <b>routers,</b> because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The product family was discontinued later that year.|$|E
5|$|Juniper Networks {{designs and}} markets IT {{networking}} products, such as <b>routers,</b> switches and IT security products. It started out selling core <b>routers</b> for ISPs, and expanded into edge <b>routers,</b> data centers, wireless networking, networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices.|$|E
5|$|By 2004, Juniper {{controlled}} 38% of {{the core}} router market. By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% {{share of the market}} for enterprise, edge and core <b>routers</b> respectively. Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge <b>routers</b> along with Cisco.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the four <b>router</b> types, OSPF uses the terms designated <b>router</b> (DR) and backup designated <b>router</b> (BDR), which are attributes of a <b>router</b> interface.|$|R
50|$|Backup {{designated}} router: A backup designated <b>router</b> (BDR) is a <b>router</b> {{that becomes}} the designated <b>router</b> {{if the current}} designated <b>router</b> has a problem or fails.

5|$|In January 2001, Cisco {{introduced}} {{a suite of}} router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share. According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products. Cisco's <b>routers</b> were not expected to erode Juniper's growing share of the market, but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's <b>routers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Juniper is {{the third}} largest market-share holder overall for <b>routers</b> and {{switches}} used by ISPs. According to analyst firm Dell'Oro Group, it is the fourth largest for edge <b>routers</b> and second for core <b>routers</b> with 25% of the core market. It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24.8% share of the firewall market. In data center security appliances, Juniper is the second-place market-share holder behind Cisco. In WLAN, where Juniper holds a joint development and marketing agreement with Aruba Networks, it holds a more marginal market share. Juniper provides technical support and services through the J-Care program.|$|E

30|$|In {{the paper}} [42, 43], the {{previous}} access <b>router</b> will cache incoming Interests once the mobile host is moving. When attaching {{to the new}} access <b>router,</b> the mobile host will issue an Interest containing locators of both its pervious and new access <b>router</b> to the previous access <b>router.</b> Then, the previous <b>router</b> sends related cached Interests to the mobile host based on the locator of the new access <b>router.</b> Finally, the mobile host returns the corresponding Datas by the new and previous access <b>router.</b> The work [44] focuses on the fast handover of both mobile consumers and producers. Before handovers, the previous access <b>router</b> sends a control packet to the next access <b>router,</b> carrying {{the identification of the}} next access <b>router</b> and the content name. This control packet will be terminated at the next access <b>router</b> or the on-path <b>router</b> located at the intersection between the control packet path and content delivery path. Then, for the consumer, the related PIT should be modified to guide Datas back to the next access <b>router,</b> while for the producer, the corresponding FIB is revised to direct Interests to the next access <b>router.</b>|$|R

25|$|A <b>router</b> may {{be mounted}} {{upside down in}} a <b>router</b> table or bench. The <b>router's</b> base plate is mounted to the {{underside}} of the table, with a hole allowing the bit to protrude above the table top. This allows the work to be passed over the <b>router,</b> rather than passing the <b>router</b> over the work. This has benefits when working with smaller objects and makes some <b>router</b> operations safer to execute. A <b>router</b> table may be fitted with a fence, fingerboards and other work-guiding accessories to make the operation safer and more accurate.|$|R
25|$|The <b>router</b> type is an {{attribute}} of an OSPF process. A given physical <b>router</b> may {{have one or}} more OSPF processes. For example, a <b>router</b> that is connected {{to more than one}} area, and which receives routes from a BGP process connected to another AS, is both an area border <b>router</b> and an autonomous system boundary <b>router.</b>|$|R
5|$|Juniper Networks {{originally}} {{focused on}} core <b>routers,</b> {{which are used}} by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge <b>routers,</b> which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper {{has been focused on}} developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy for allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.|$|E

A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments, just as chameleons and cephalopods do. The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and <b>routers.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Router</b> syslogs are {{messages}} that a <b>router</b> logs {{to describe a}} wide range of events observed by it.

However, <b>router</b> syslog messages are essentially free-form text with only a minimal structure, and their formats vary among different vendors and <b>router</b> OSes. Furthermore, since <b>router</b> syslogs are aimed for tracking and debugging <b>router</b> software/hardware problems, they are often too low-level from network service management perspectives. Due to their sheer volume (e. g., millions per day in a large ISP network), detailed <b>router</b> syslog messages are typically examined only when required by an on-going troubleshooting investigation or when given a narrow time range and a specific <b>router</b> under suspicion.

5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more <b>routers</b> that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E
5|$|Juniper Networks had $3.8 {{million in}} annual revenue in 1998. By the {{following}} year, its only product, the M40 router, was being used by 50 telecommunications companies.
