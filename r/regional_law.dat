5|$|Scots law has a basis {{derived from}} Roman law, {{combining}} features of both uncodified civil law, {{dating back to}} the Corpus Juris Civilis, and common law with medieval sources. The terms of the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 guaranteed the continued existence of a separate legal system in Scotland from that of England and Wales. Prior to 1611, there were several <b>regional</b> <b>law</b> systems in Scotland, most notably Udal law in Orkney and Shetland, based on old Norse law. Various other systems derived from common Celtic or Brehon laws survived in the Highlands until the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|A new four-lane Gunningsville Bridge {{was opened}} in 2005, {{connecting}} downtown Riverview directly with downtown Moncton. On the Moncton side, the bridge connects with {{an extension of}} Vaughan Harvey Boulevard {{as well as to}} Assumption Boulevard and will serve as a catalyst for economic growth in the downtown area. This has become already evident as an expansion to the Blue Cross Centre was completed in 2006 and a Marriott Residence Inn opened in 2008. The new <b>regional</b> <b>law</b> courts on Assumption Blvd opened in 2011. Construction has begun on a new downtown 8,500 seat multipurpose events centre and arena {{on the site of the}} former Highfield Square shopping centre. This arena will open in 2018. On the Riverview side, the Gunningsville Bridge now connects to a new ring road around the town and is expected to serve as a catalyst for development in east Riverview.|$|E

25|$|The Flag of Sicily, {{regarded}} as a regional icon, was first adopted in 1282, after the Sicilian Vespers of Palermo. It is characterised {{by the presence of}} the trinacria (triskelion) in its middle, the (winged) head of Medusa and three wheat ears. The three bent legs are supposed to represent the three points of the island Sicily itself. The colours, instead, respectively represent the cities of Palermo and Corleone, at those times an agricultural city of renown. Palermo and Corleone were the first two cities to found a confederation against the Angevin rule. It finally became the official public flag of the Regione Siciliana in January 2000, after the passing of an apposite <b>regional</b> <b>law</b> which advocates its use on public buildings, schools and city halls along with the national Italian flag and the European one.|$|E
25|$|The Aosta Valley is {{nowadays}} {{the only}} {{region of the}} Franco-Provençal area where this language is still widely spoken as native by all age ranges of the population. Several events have combined to stabilize the language (Valdôtain dialect) in this region since 1948. An {{amendment to the constitution}} of Italy changed the status of the former province to an autonomous region which gives the Aosta Valley special powers to make its own decisions. Residents saw the region's economy expand and the population increase from 1951 to 1991, which encouraged them to stay and continue long-held traditions. The language is now explicitly protected by an Italian presidential decree and a federal law. Further, a <b>regional</b> <b>law</b> passed by the government in Aosta requires educators to promote knowledge of Franco-Provençal language and culture in the school curriculum. Several cultural groups, libraries, and theatre companies are fostering a sense of ethnic pride with their active use of the Valdôtain dialect as well (EUROPA, 2005).|$|E

40|$|Russian Federation {{consists}} of 89 Federated units, namely republics, provinces (in Russian - krai), regions (in Russian - oblast), two federal cities (Moscow and Saint-Petersburg), autonomous region and autonomous districts. Federated units are divided in municipalities. Along with the Federal Constitution there are fundamental laws in Federated units (republics have constitutions, all other units have charters). Municipalities (the level of local government) have charters. Each level {{has its own}} system of government. And at each level a referendum might be held. Local government approved their regulations on local referenda. <b>Regional</b> <b>laws</b> on referendum and local government regulations on referendum should be consistent with these requirements of the federal law, and local regulation should not contradict both Federal and regional legislation. Therefore, if <b>regional</b> <b>laws</b> were adopted before the mentioned Federal Law entering into force, their parts contradicting with the Federal Law should be amended. In any case, only those provisions of <b>regional</b> <b>laws</b> and local regulations can be used and enforced that conforms to the Federal legislation...|$|R

50|$|The {{historical}} book Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus, {{which is}} dated to the 13th century, describes the Danish kings' attempts at legislation. One {{of the first}} examples of Danish legislation was 'Vederloven' from the 1180s, that regulated the personal army of the king, {{also known as the}} Housecarls. This was superseded by a series of <b>regional</b> <b>laws,</b> first Scanian Law, later Jyske Lov and Sjællandske Lov. Generally, the <b>regional</b> <b>laws</b> are based on Casuistry.

This survey questions whether such complex and inextricable procedures are really necessary or just the result of compromise and historical stratification, which are making them basically incomprehensible to voters.
