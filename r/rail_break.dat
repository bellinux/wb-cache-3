40|$|Abstract: Based on turnout/bridge {{interaction}} {{principle and}} {{finite element method}} (FEM), an integrated turnout/beam/pier model of jointless turnout on ballasted track was established to analyze the influences of expansion joint on stress and deformation of the turnout. The results are concluded as follows: whether the rail expansion joint is set in front of or behind the turnout, expansion additional force of stock rail will be reduced greatly {{at the end of}} the beam; so do the expansion displacement of switch rail and nose rail, the stress of displacement restrictor and spacer block, <b>rail</b> <b>break</b> gap and the longitudinal force of one rail after the other rail broke. But when the expansion joint is set in front of the turnout, the pier’s longitudinal force of continuous beam bridge and the simply supported beam bridge (within the expansion range of the device) increase greatly. When the device is close to the turnout, longitudinal relative displacement of the stock rail to the girder also increases a lot. By comparison, it is more favorable to set the expansion joint behind the turnout, or to set the device at the both ends of the continuous beam, or to set the device at the ends of continuous beam rather than in the center of the span...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} fatigue related {{issues in the}} field of railway mechanics. In {{particular}} <b>rail</b> <b>breaks</b> and deterioration of insulating joints are investigated. The study is largely motivated by plans to increase allowed axle loads in Sweden. The aim is to deliver operational results, as well as exemplify how practical problems in railway mechanics can be assessed by computer based simulations. In the first appended paper the influence of wheel flat impacts on the growth of rail cracks and subsequent <b>rail</b> <b>breaks</b> is analyzed. This calls for an analysis of the dynamic train [...] track interaction combined with a fracture mechanics analysis of crack growth and fracture. To account for high frequency excitations due to wheel flat impacts the in-house code DIFF is employed for the analysis of train [...] track interaction. Stress intensity factors for rail cracks are derived using FE-simulations. Added loading due to restricted thermal contraction of all-welded rails is included. Risks of <b>rail</b> <b>breaks</b> for specified crack sizes and temperatures are evaluated as functions of impact load magnitudes. In addition crack growth rates are quantified. Simulation results indicate that wheel flats increase the risk of <b>rail</b> <b>breaks,</b> but have a limited influence on rack growth rates. The latter is due to the infrequent occurrence of wheel flats and the fact that these need to impact in a rather narrow region to cause any considerable influence on the crack growth rate. In the second paper deterioration of insulated joints is analyzed by 3 D FE-simulations. Repeated negotiations of a loaded wheel over an insulating joint is simulated. To obtain realistic material responses, an advanced constitutive model is employed. The simulations indicate the accumulated strain (ratcheting) to be the dominant damage mechanism. In a parametric study the influence of insulating gap, axel load, frictional force, and coefficient of maximum friction in the wheel [...] rail interface is assessed. In particular the frictional force (traction/braking) is found to have a major influence on joint deterioration.

40|$|The current report briefly compares some {{operational}} experience of cracked and broken rails from China, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, UK and USA. Four key questions are addressed: 1. Is the critical crack length, i. e. {{the length of}} a surface initiated crack that causes a <b>rail</b> <b>break</b> (reasonably) constant in an international perspective? 2. Is it (reasonably) constant over a line? 3. Can the depth when a rolling contact fatigue crack deviates to a transverse propagation be estimated? 4. Is it (reasonably) constant in an international perspective? The answers can briefly be summarized as 1.

40|$|Degradation is an {{on-going}} {{process in}} systems, equipments and components subjected to various stresses and adverse operating conditions. The factors influencing the degradation process may adversely affect the system or component performance. A study {{of these factors}} will {{provide a basis for}} making correct decisions concerning corrective and preventive measures. Such a study is also useful for reliability analysis of the degrading systems/components for making maintenance decisions or for initiating measures for changes in the design. Many times {{it is not possible to}} implement design changes due to complexities and cost considerations, as in the case of railway infrastructures, etc. In such situations operational reliability is assured through effective maintenance actions. Knowledge of the technical condition of components is important to achieve the optimal maintenance policy in order to minimize the total system risk. A methodology for rail defect prioritization and risk assessment is developed to support the decision- making process during the effective scheduling of the inspection frequency based on the type of defect and its risk of developing into a <b>rail</b> <b>break.</b> The present research work also demonstrates an application of reliability analysis to improve system reliability based on design changes. This has been illustrated with an example from a manufacturing industry. The objective is achieved using cost-benefit analysis in combination with failure data and root cause analysis. The analysis of failure data with the different cost elements involved in the operation and maintenance of the complex systems is presented as a basis for choosing between alternative designs. Furthermore, an optimization model has been developed to estimate the optimum inspection frequency required at the minimum maintenance cost based on the technical condition of the component. The model has been validated by a case study of an offshore oil and gas platform. The consequences of not choosing the right distribution have also been discussed in the thesis. The concept of the virtual failure state has been introduced to estimate the failure distribution of highly critical components. The factors influencing the degradation process have been identified and studied in detail. A framework for classification of rail failure data has also been developed for rail life estimation using reliability analysis. In short, the thesis discusses the application of reliability analysis and cost modeling techniques to support the decision-making process in operation and maintenance activities and demonstrates its usefulness in real life.

40|$|Rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks are a {{widespread}} problem that impairs the service life of railway rails and wheels, with an associated {{high cost of}} labour and capital expenditure for remediation. Severe RCF cracks cause serious safety issues as they can turn down at a larger propagation angle into the rail potentially leading to a <b>rail</b> <b>break.</b> Rail grinding can effectively eliminate RCF cracks if they are detected when they are small enough to be removed. Alternating current field measurement (ACFM) {{is one of the}} electromagnetic (EM) techniques {{that can be used for}} defect detection and sizing in the rail industry. ACFM has been reported to be more accurate in providing length and depth information than conventional UT for small RCF cracks and is less sensitive to lift-off than eddy current methods. The aim of the present research is to analyse the response of ACFM signals to single and multiple RCF cracks in railway rails using experimental measurements and FE based modelling tools, focusing on the influences of crack vertical angle and multiple cracks (number, spacing, size, uniformity) on the ACFM signal to improve the accuracy of dimension predictions. A novel method (using the Bz signal) is proposed to determine the vertical angle of the RCF cracks, which then allows the crack vertical depth to be determined from the pocket length (standard output from ACFM measurements) and therefore the appropriate amount of rail grinding to remove the RCF cracks. It was found that the vertical angle influences the pocket length determined from the measured ΔBxmax/Bx value when the cracks are shallow (vertical angles < 30 °), therefore greater accuracy can be obtained when compensating the ΔBxmax/Bx value using the determined vertical angle. It is shown that the variations of crack surface length, crack inner spacing and crack number for multiple cracks also influence the ΔBxmax/Bx values determined for multiple cracks. The influences of asymmetrical crack shapes on crack sizing are discussed, in general it has been found that for accurate sizing of RCF cracks using a single ACFM scan the cracks should be regular, where the assumption of semi ellipse shapes is appropriate. The methods developed in the project were assessed using calibration samples (machined cracks with different sizes and vertical angles) and rails removed from service containing single and multiple RCF cracks. It was found that the new approach proposed in this work allowed the vertical angle to be predicted well for single and multiple RCF cracks (difference to measurements < 14. 3...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{deliverable}} is {{an improved}} model for the influence of vehicle conditions on the loading and subsequent deterioration of rails. In particular, this report focuses on: 1. 	Wear data from SUROS twin-disc tests with CORUS 260 and premium grade pearlitic rail steels (CORUS 400, VA 350 and VA 400), and metallurgical analysis (micro-hardness and shear strain measurement) of section disc samples. 2. 	The effect of wheel hardness on rail wear rate, and vice versa: findings from the academic literature, and observations from InnoTrack SP 4 SUROS twin-disc tests. 3. Development, calibration and validation of Newcastle University’s wear and crack initiation model (dynarat, a. k. a. the ‘brick’ model) : a. development of material models {{for each of the}} tested rail steels; b. calibration of the wear model against the results of the CORUS 260 dry tests; and c. validation of the wear model against the results for the premium grade steels. 4. 	Wear modelling (using the calibrated wear model) of wheel-rail contact on top of the rail head, focussing on the effects of load and traction; develop a method for quickly estimating wear. 5. 	The effect of out-of-round (OOR) wheels on wear and crack initiation. Wear-Hardness Correlation Four pearlitic rail steels were tested against VAS R 7 wheel steel. Three twin-disc tests were performed for each rail steel: 5000 cycles dry; 5000 cycles dry followed by 5000 cycles wet (i. e., water-lubricated); and 15000 cycles dry. In general, the harder the rail disc material becomes at the surface, the harder the wheel disc material becomes at the surface. Rail disc wear decreases when rail steel hardness increases. In wet tests, wheel disc wear rate drops as rail disc hardness increases. In the system as a whole (i. e., considering both wheel and rail discs), using harder CORUS 400 and VA 400 rail steels lowers the total wear rate. From a review of the academic literature, there is no conclusive finding that harder rails wear wheels more, or vice versa. In general, harder materials wear less, but material hardness is not the only determining factor of wear performance; microstructure and strain-hardening behaviour are critical factors, and rolling contact fatigue performance is equally important. However, as a fairly general rule: →	To reduce system wear, harder steel grades should be used for both wheel and rail. Wear Model Development, Calibration and Validation The mixed (dry-wet) SUROS tests caused severe rolling contact fatigue, affecting hardness readings and wear rates, but the dry tests have provided an excellent resource for wear model development and calibration. Test specimens have been sectioned and analysed. Microhardness measurements have suggested a possible softening effect at very small strains, and a new strain-hardening equation is used to fit to the strain-hardness data {{for each of the four}} steels. Wear model calibration has led to a number of core developments to the model itself. The wear rate predictions for the premium grade rail steels match measured values (approximately) for the 5000 cycles dry tests, but over-predict the wear rate for the 15000 cycles dry tests by a factor of 2 - 3. (The dry-wet test predictions do not match, but are not expected to, since the ratcheting wear model does not account for major surface deterioration caused by significant surface cracking.) → Following major development, the wear model has been calibrated successfully for CORUS 260 rail steel under dry contact conditions. →	The wear model has been partly validated for the premium grades. Additional test work and metallurgical analysis should lead to improved material hardening models. Effect of Vehicle Characteristics: Rail Wear Predictions The wear model, calibrated for CORUS 260 and dry contact, was used to study the effect on rail wear of vehicle characteristics through their effect on the wheel-rail contact. The patch was assumed to be elliptical and the pressure distribution to be Hertzian; in addition, the contact was assumed to be on the top the rail, suitable for straight track, not curves, and the traction to be longitudinal only. Traction coefficient has a significant effect on the wear rate. For distributed traction systems the traction coefficient may often be about 0. 1, i. e., an average wear rate of about 0. 75 nm/cycle. For locomotives the traction coefficient may be 0. 3 or even higher, i. e., an average wear rate of 1. 5 nm/cycle or more. →	There was a very clear linear trend of wear rate against peak contact pressure (for the range of pressures studied). → Wear equations, giving wear rate for a given pressure and traction coefficient, have been extrapolated which can be used for quick estimation of rail wear. Out-of-Round Wheels The effect of pressure variation (with wavelengths above about 20 mm) on rail wear rate was studied by considering each wheel pass as an independent event. Wear simulations were thus performed by varying the normal load with each passing wheel, and the predictions compared with the constant average-load case. No significant difference was observed. →	Out-of-round pressure variations do not affect rail wear significantly. The effect of periodic variation of wheel-rail contact patch pressure on propagation of semi-circular cracks up to 12 mm radius (i. e., penetrating to a depth of about 6 mm at 30 °angle to the surface) was studied using the ‘ 2. 5 D’ Green’s-function-based model. The following conclusions were reached: → For pressure variations with a wavelength less than about 2 mm, the maximum pressure should be used to calculate crack growth rate. →	For pressure variations with a wavelength greater than about 20 mm, there is no advantage to modelling pressure variation within a single load pass, and that modelling successive wheel passes with different static pressures would be sufficient. → Out-of-round wheels with roughness features between these two wavelengths would accelerate crack propagation, but would require more detailed modelling. Rail crack growth and rail breaks For an analysis of long crack growth and rail breaks numerical simulations validated and calibrated towards full-scale field tests featuring flatted wheels have been employed. The main conclusions from the simulations were the detrimental influence of rail temperature and low ballast stiffness (where hanging sleeper(s) is an extreme case. The influences of the most important parameters have been quantified. The results are presented in Annexes 4, 5 and 6 and summarized in Section 6. 2. The main conclusions and operational recommendations are: →	Critical crack sizes (i. e., crack sizes for which fracture is likely) for rail head and foot cracks depend significantly on the temperature (or rather the temperature below the stress free temperature). For cold conditions, critical crack sizes of roughly 1 and 3 cm are found for rail foot and rail head cracks respectively. → Crack growth rates are significantly increased close to fracture. Consequently, operationally allowed crack sizes need to be much smaller. Exactly how much smaller depends on the accuracy of inspections (i. e., how small cracks can with certainty be detected) and inspection intervals. To guide in this decision, crack growths evaluated for different operational conditions and presented in Annex 6 can be employed. →	A decrease in the assured largest crack size after an inspection (i. e., the size of a crack that with full certainty can be found at an inspection) will have a major influence on the needed length of the inspection intervals. →	Low ballast stiffness will normally lead to higher rail bending moments. To avoid this influence the ballast stiffness per half sleeper should be kept above some 30 MN/m. Hanging sleepers will remove the beneficial effect of high ballast stiffness and should be avoided. In particular this seems to be the case for high-speed operations (200 km/h in the current study). →	It is recommended to combine the mitigation of a hanging sleeper with an inspection for rail head and rail foot cracks. →	The temperature will have a very significant effect on both crack growth rates and risk of final fracture. To this end it is recommended that the magnitude of allowed wheel–rail impact forces be related to the temperature. Further, inspection intervals need to be significantly reduced during cold periods. Guidance in defining alarm limits and inspection intervals can be obtained from the results presented in Annex 6. →	Due to the significant increase in crack growth rates in cold climate, it is recommended that there is an inspection before a cold period to minimize the occurrence of larger cracks that may propagate to fracture. →	The wheel–rail impact force will have an effect on the risk of fracture. To establish alarm limits is a balance between allowed forces and allowed crack sizes. Due to this, a higher alarm limit can be allowed if shorter crack sizes are assured (e. g., by more frequent inspections). →	It is wise to introduce multiple alarm levels for several reasons: o A wheel that induces a high impact load is likely to cause damage on the vehicle (in the wheel, in the roller bearing, etc.). This may lead to increased costs and operational disturbances. o Also, wheels that induce impact loads below an alarm limit corresponding to rail breaks may cause smaller, arrested cracks to start growing. In particular, this is likely to be an issue for rail head cracks where a higher load may cause a crack to deviate transversally, which eventually may lead to a <b>rail</b> <b>break.</b> o The introduction of low-level alarms is likely to give the maintenance organisation improved possibilities of planning and optimising maintenance procedures. If only a one-level alarm exists there is an obvious risk that a vehicle that just passes the limit may fail in a subsequent control where operational conditions are slightly different. This will, obviously, result in unnecessary costs and operational disturbances. o For the same reason as outlined above, it is recommended that the low-level alarm limit is gradually decreased over a period before the introduction of “cold climate” alarm limits...|$|E

To this end, the current study focuses on wheel load management with the aim to establish wheel load monitoring and mitigation actions (in terms of limits on allowable wheel defects) that minimize traffic disruptions.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{continuous}} increase of axle loads, tonnage, train speed, and train length which has increased both the productivity in the rail sector and the risk of <b>rail</b> <b>breaks</b> and derailments. <b>Rail</b> operating risks have been increasing due to the increased number of axle passes, sharper curves, wear-out of rails and wheels, inadequate rail-wheel grinding and poor lubrication and maintenance. Rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and wear are significant problems for railway companies. In 2000, the Hatfield accident in the UK killed 4 people, injured 34 people and led to the cost of £ 733 million (AUD$ 1. 73 billion) for repairs and compensation. In 1977, the Granville train disaster in Australia killed 83 people and injured 213 people. These accidents were related to rolling contact fatigue, wear and poor maintenance. Studies on rail wear and lubrication, rolling contact fatigue and inspection and rail grinding analyse and assess the asset condition to take corrective and preventive measures for maintaining reliability and safety of rail track. Such measures can reduce the operational risks and the costs by early detection and prevention of <b>rail</b> failures, <b>rail</b> <b>breaks</b> and derailments. Studies have so far been carried out in isolation and have failed to provide a practical solution to a complex problem such as rail-wheel wearfatigue-lubrication-grinding-inspection for cost effective maintenance decisions.

Originally called the [...] "American Society for Testing Materials" [...] in 1902, it became the [...] "American Society for Testing and Materials" [...] in 1961 before it {{changed its name to}} “ASTM International” in 2001 and added the tagline [...] "Standards Worldwide". In 2014, it has changed the tagline to [...] "Helping our World Work better". Now, ASTM International has offices in Belgium, Canada, China, Peru, and Washington, D.C.|$|R
2500|$|Smalls {{applied the}} {{emergency}} brakes {{as soon as}} he saw the vehicle. After the crash, he went back into the burning train several times to rescue passengers. [...] "He did everything he could," [...] said Anthony Bottalico, head of Association of Commuter Rail Employees, the labor union which represents Metro-North workers. Despite that, the train knocked Brody's SUV [...] up the tracks, which dislodged more than [...] of the third <b>rail,</b> <b>breaking</b> it into thirteen [...] segments, most of which accumulated in the front car's passenger compartment, and then into the second car. The New York Daily News reported that injuries from them were responsible for most of the deaths on the train.|$|R
50|$|ASTM International {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{voluntary}} standards development organizations in the world. It sets technical standards for materials, products, systems, and services. ASTM International standards have an important role in the information infrastructure that guides design, manufacturing and trade internationally. ASTM International, originally known as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), was formed over a century ago, when a group of engineers and scientists got together to address frequent <b>rail</b> <b>breaks</b> in the burgeoning railroad industry. Their work led to standardization on the steel used in rail construction, ultimately improving railroad safety for the nation. As the century progressed and new industrial, governmental and environmental developments created new standardization requirements, ASTM responded with consensus standards that have been widely adopted internationally.|$|R
40|$|This study {{covers the}} {{parametric}} variations of vehicle and track characteristics to inform on {{the requirements for}} an optimum and yet pragmatic control of longitudinal rail weld profile. A statistical study {{has been carried out}} using a large set of measured weld profiles (arbitrary mix of flash butt welds and aluminothermic welds) in order to establish relationships between degradation mechanisms and the longitudinal geometry of the finished weld. The potential benefits which would be expected from improved controls over the welded profile, with respect to not only rail running surface damage but also susceptibility to <b>rail</b> <b>breaks</b> and ballast degradation, are demonstrated. Finally, recommendations for the review of the geometric controls of finished weld geometry in the relevant Euro Norms are made...|$|R
50|$|Spike mauls are akin to sledge hammers, {{typically}} weighing from 8 to 12 lb with 30 to 36 in-long handles.They have elongated double faced {{hardened steel}} heads. The head is typically over 12 in long {{to allow the}} user to drive spikes {{on the opposite side}} of the <b>rail</b> without <b>breaking</b> the handle.|$|R
60|$|No {{more was}} said by either, but holding fast to {{whatever}} came to hand, the two Rovers {{worked their way}} forward {{until they reached the}} rail where Dick had been standing. They now saw that the foretopmast had come down, hitting the <b>rail</b> and <b>breaking</b> it loose for a distance of several feet.|$|R
2500|$|Work {{continued}} at {{the newly established}} Short Brothers works on the Isle of Sheppey, and was complete upon McClean's return from China. The Bariquand et Marre engine was not yet available, so a [...] engine taken from a Nordenfelt car was installed. However, at more than [...] in weight, when a first attempt at flight was made in September, the engine failed to propel the machine even {{as far as the}} end of the launching rail. The Bariquand et Marre engine arrived in October, and McClean made three attempts at flight on 2, 3 and 6 November, almost succeeding in becoming airborne, but on the last attempt he applied full up-elevator, and the machine stalled and fell back on the launch <b>rail,</b> <b>breaking</b> the undercarriage and propellers: it was not repaired. McClean's next aircraft was a copy of the Wright Model A built under license by Short Brothers.|$|R

The stop is located in an area where the light <b>rail</b> temporarily <b>breaks</b> from its street-level tracks and runs on a separate grade around the Mt. Hope and Greenwood Cemeteries.|$|R
40|$|Joints in {{railway track}} are {{vulnerable}} to failure, so most modern rail is welded. However, many signalling systems rely on sections of rail being electrically isolated from adjacent sections so insulated joints are necessary. At these joints several millimetres of insulation material, an “end post”, separates {{the ends of the}} rails. To support the rail two pieces of steel (known as fish-plates) are bolted {{on either side of the}} rail web. All steel components are separated from each other by insulation material. Conventional designs of rail joints are known to suffer from a range of failure modes: bolt failures, <b>rail</b> <b>breaks,</b> fish-plate failure, insulation degradation, and lipping (in which plastic flow in the rail ends bridges the gap between the rail ends). To assist in developing improved designs accelerated test procedures and sophisticated finite element models have been developed; this paper describes both. Results from physical testing and numerical modelling are presented and compared...|$|R
40|$|Rail players {{around the}} world have been {{increasing}} axle loads to improve the productivity of freight and heavy haul operations. This has increased the risk of surface cracks at curves because of rolling contact fatigue. Rail grinding has been considered an effective process for controlling these cracks and reducing risks of <b>rail</b> <b>breaks.</b> The complexity of deciding the optimal rail grinding intervals for improving the reliability and safety of rails is because of insufficient understanding of the various factors involved in the crack initiation and propagation process. This paper focuses on identifying the factors influencing rail degradation, developing models for rail failures and analyzing the costs of various grinding intervals for economic decision making. Various costs involved in rail maintenance, such as rail grinding, downtime, inspection, rail failures and derailment, and replacement of worn-out rails, are incorporated into the total cost model developed in this paper. Field data from the rail industry have been used for illustration...|$|R
