40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} {{intracellular}} current pulses on the membrane of smooth muscle {{cells of the}} guinea pig vas deferens at rest and during transmission was studied. Two main response types were identified: active <b>response</b> <b>cells,</b> in which a spike was initiated in response to depolarizing currents of sufficient strength and duration; passive <b>response</b> <b>cells,</b> in which depolarizing currents gave only electrotonic potential changes. These cells were three times more numerous than the active <b>response</b> <b>cells.</b> During {{the crest of the}} active response the input resistance fell by about 25 % of the resting value. Comparison of the active response with the action potential due to stimulating the hypogastric nerve showed that the former was smaller in amplitude and had a slower rate of rise and higher threshold. Electrical coupling occurred between the smooth muscle cells during the propagation of the action potential. Depolarizing current pulses had no effect on the amplitude of the excitatory junction potential (E. J. P.) in passive <b>response</b> <b>cells,</b> but in general did decrease its amplitude in active <b>response</b> <b>cells.</b> These results are discussed with respect to the mechanism of autonomic neuroeffector transmission...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is proposed {{that describes the}} colonization of host tissues by a contagious pathogen and the early nonspecific immune response, {{the impact of the}} infection on the performances of the host, and the spread of the infection in the population. The model obeys specific biological characteristics: Susceptible hosts are infected after contact with an infected one. The number of pathogenic units that invade a susceptible host is dependent on the infectious dose provided by the infected host and on the ability of the susceptible host to resist the invasion. After entry in host, pathogenic changes over time are expressed as the difference between the intrinsic logistic growth rate and the Holling type II kill rate provided by the immune <b>response</b> <b>cells.</b> Hosts have different ability to restrict reproduction of the pathogen units. The number of <b>response</b> <b>cells</b> actively recruited to the site of infection depends on the number of the pathogenic units. <b>Response</b> <b>cells</b> are removed after having killed a fixed number of pathogenic units. The effects of the number of pathogenic units on the performances of the host depend upon its levels of tolerance to the deleterious effects of both pathogenic and <b>response</b> <b>cells.</b> Pre-infection costs are associated to tolerance and resistance levels. Estimates of most biological parameters of the model are based on published experimental studies while resistance/tolerance parameters are varied across their allowable ranges. The model reproduces qualitatively realistic outcomes in response to infection: healthy response, recurrent infection, persistent infectious and non-infectious inflammation, and severe immunodeficiency. Evolution across time at the animal and population levels is presented. Effects on animal performances are discussed with respect to changes in resistance/tolerance parameters and selection strategies are suggested...|$|R

40|$|SummaryCandida albicans is a dimorphic fungus {{responsible}} for chronic mucocutaneous and systemic infections.  Mucocutaneous immunity to C.  albicans requires T helper 17 (Th 17) cell differentiation that {{is thought to}} depend on recognition of filamentous C.  albicans. Systemic immunity is considered T cell independent. Using a murine skin infection model, we compared T helper <b>cell</b> <b>responses</b> to yeast and filamentous C.  albicans. We found that only yeast induced Th 17 <b>cell</b> <b>responses</b> through a mechanism that required Dectin- 1 -mediated expression of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) by Langerhans cells. Filamentous forms induced Th 1 without Th 17 <b>cell</b> <b>responses</b> due {{to the absence of}} Dectin- 1 ligation. Notably, Th 17 <b>cell</b> <b>responses</b> provided protection against cutaneous infection while Th 1 <b>cell</b> <b>responses</b> provided protection against systemic infection.

40|$|Abstract Background The nonhuman primate {{model of}} glaucomatous optic {{neuropathy}} most faithfully reproduces the human disease. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to investigate whole genome transcriptional changes occurring at the optic nerve head during primate experimental glaucoma. Results Laser scarification of the trabecular meshwork of cynomolgus macaques produced elevated intraocular pressure that was monitored {{over time and}} led to varying degrees of damage in different samples. The macaques were examined clinically before enucleation and the myelinated optic nerves were processed post-mortem to determine the degree of neuronal loss. Global gene expression was examined in dissected optic nerve heads with Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. We validated a subset of differentially expressed genes using qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immuno-enriched astrocytes from healthy and glaucomatous human donors. These genes have previously defined roles in axonal outgrowth, immune <b>response,</b> <b>cell</b> motility, neuroprotection, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Conclusion Our findings show that glaucoma is associated with increased expression of genes that mediate axonal outgrowth, immune <b>response,</b> <b>cell</b> motility, neuroprotection, and ECM remodeling.

METHODS: HIV- 1 -specific T <b>cell</b> <b>responses</b> were evaluated in 65 chronically HIV- 1 -infected untreated subjects by interferon- gamma flow cytometry with peptides spanning the clade C consensus sequence. RESULTS: The magnitude of HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 + T <b>cell</b> <b>responses</b> correlated significantly with CD 4 + <b>cell</b> <b>responses,</b> but the percentage of CD 8 + T cells directed against HIV- 1 (median, 2. 76 %) was always {{greater than that of}} CD 4 + cells (median, 0. 24 %). Although CD 8 + T <b>cell</b> <b>responses</b> were equally distributed among Gag, Pol, and the regulatory and accessory proteins, Gag was the dominant target for CD 4 + <b>cell</b> <b>responses.</b> There was no consistent relationship between virus-specific CD 8 + or CD 4 + <b>cell</b> <b>response</b> and viral load. However, the median viral load in subjects in whom Gag was the dominant CD 8 + T cell target was significantly lower than that in subjects in whom non-Gag proteins were the main target (P=. 007). CONCLUSIONS: Gag-specific responses dominate the CD 4 + T <b>cell</b> <b>response</b> to HIV, whereas CD 8 + T <b>cell</b> <b>responses</b> are broadly distributed, which indicates differential immunogenicity of these cells against HIV- 1.
