5000|$|The Iloca was a 35mm {{rangefinder}} camera {{produced from}} 1952 to 1959 by Wilhelm Witt of Hamburg. Models designated [...] "Rapid" [...] had a <b>rapid</b> <b>winding</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1936: Ihagee Kine Exakta (Germany): first {{production}} 35 mm SLR, first system SLR, first {{interchangeable lens}} camera with bayonet lens mount. This was {{exhibited at the}} Leipzig Spring Fair in March and was in production by April 1936. Had left-handed shutter release and <b>rapid</b> film <b>wind</b> thumb <b>lever,</b> folding waist level finder and 12 to 1/1000 second focal-plane shutter. Well-integrated design with excellent interchangeable lenses and good accessory system. Fewer than 30,000 Kine Exaktas were made before World War 2 stopped production in 1940. Production of improved models re-started {{after the war and}} Exakta was among the best known 35 mm SLR brands through the 50s.|$|R

50|$|The Contaflex Rapid was {{introduced}} in 1958 and had a slightly longer body, a built-in accessory shoe, a <b>winding</b> <b>lever</b> and a rewind crank. It was the meterless version.|$|R
5000|$|The Zorki 4 came in 2 {{variants}} {{the original}} {{which uses a}} thumb wheel to advance to film and cock the shutter. The Zorki 4k included a <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> for easier operation.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{adopted and}} further {{developed}} the SLR. In 1952, Asahi developed the Asahiflex and in 1954, the Asahiflex IIB. In 1957, the Asahi Pentax combined the fixed pentaprism and the right-hand thumb <b>wind</b> <b>lever.</b> Nikon, Canon and Yashica introduced their first SLRs in 1959 (the F, Canonflex, and Pentamatic, respectively).|$|R
50|$|The SR-T 101 {{was also}} made {{available}} in black. The top cover and the base plate are finished in black enamel while most metal parts are black chromed, but the <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> is black anodised. The parts still chromed, {{to name the}} most obvious ones, include the shutter-release button, the mirror lock-up knob, the depth-of-field preview button and the lens-release button.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} cameras ever {{produced}} for left-handers was the half-frame Yashica Samurai. Cameras predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> and commonly used selection buttons, switches and dials controlled by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972 Canon made {{a special}} Modification of the F-1 called the [...] "High Speed Motor Drive Camera". It had a fixed {{pellicle}} (semi transparent) mirror, the motor drive motors were a permanent attachment (the camera's <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> was removed - {{making it impossible}} to use without the motor drive) and was powered by 20 AA batteries! Maximum speed was 9 frame/sec - the fastest available at the time. Its use at the 1972 Olympics in Japan produced fantastic sequential shots that were previously impossible to achieve.|$|R

40|$|Meteorological {{stations}} in Northwest China {{are surrounded by}} large proportions of cultivated land. The relations between the change of surface wind speed and the cultivated land fractions (CF) within a 4 km radius at 135 meteorological stations over arid Northwest China are investigated. Stations with larger CF experienced larger declines in surface wind speed from 1960 to 2007. Compared with the wind speed variation in the Tibetan Plateau where agricultural development is negligible, stations with low CF show similar variation, whereas the wind speed at stations with large CF illustrates a sharp decrease in the 1970 s- 1980 s, during which irrigated agriculture developed rapidly. The observed wind speed at the station surrounded by irrigated fields in the Jingtai Irrigation District, shows a <b>rapid</b> <b>wind</b> speed decrease {{during the same period}} when the irrigated area expanded. By contrast, <b>rapid</b> <b>wind</b> decrease is not observed at a nearby station with minimal influence of agricultural development...|$|R
5000|$|The FT's {{exposure}} control system was a [...] "center-the-needle" [...] system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving vertically {{at the lower}} {{right side of the}} viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in, open aperture, TTL, full-scene averaging, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the actual camera settings. The photographer would adjust the shutter speed to freeze or blur motion and/or the lens aperture f-stop to control depth of field (focus) until the needle was centered between two pincer-like brackets. The needle array was duplicated in a window next the top-mounted film rewind crank to allow {{exposure control}} without looking through the viewfinder. The meter was turned on by pulling the film <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> out to the standby ready position and turned off by pushing it back flush against the camera.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} study about wind analysis techniques for <b>rapid</b> <b>wind</b> visualisation {{in the early}} design stage. It develops protocols for rapid visualisation and evaluation of wind phenomena around groups of buildings and complex architectural and urban windbreak screen morphologies for feedback into design. Interaction between wind and buildings produces aerodynamic phenomena, affecting the comfort level of pedestrian areas in urban environments. For this reason, architects have incorporated, in the design process, wind analysis technologies and expert consulting, to anticipate the possible wind effects that could require mitigation measures and even modifications in the final form of a project. In this sense, wind analysis in the earlier stage of the design process is a strategy that allows architects to consider wind in the conceptual designs of a project and to develop more sophisticated strategies to interact with and mitigate wind phenomena. Examples of the integration of wind visualisation in the early design stage are the CFD-PST (computational fluid dynamics - performance sketch tools), which {{have been developed to}} facilitate basic and preliminary wind analyses, conducted by architects, in the first stage of the conceptual design process. Previous research has addressed their impact in the design process and architects&# 039; practice (including other analysis and simulation programs) with comparisons between programs and interviews with architects. However, the performance of CFD-PST in resolving the problem of <b>rapid</b> <b>wind</b> visualisation for architects has not been well evaluated in more complex scenarios than those originally proposed, for instance, with multiple buildings or with wind porous architectural screens or in comparison with other techniques such as physical visualisation methods. The aim of this research is to investigate, through empirical wind visualisation studies and architectural explorations of windbreaks, the CFD-PST and other techniques for <b>rapid</b> <b>wind</b> visualisation, in order to evaluate their efficacy for architects&# 039; practice in the early design stage. The results of this research present an evaluation of these wind visualisation technologies as a clear hierarchy of efficacy for rapid feedback, regarding requirements of visualisation complexity and extension of generation process. In addition, the study suggests architectural protocols for rapid visualisation and feedback in design process workflows. Finally, this research examines design rules of aerodynamic features, through <b>rapid</b> <b>wind</b> visualisation, to improve architectural exploration of windbreak design, for outdoor microclimatic control...|$|R
5000|$|Early Kine Exaktas had a fixed waist-level viewfinder, {{but later}} models, {{starting}} with the Exakta Varex, had an interchangeable waist- or eye-level finder. Examat and Travemat Through-the-lens metering prisms were introduced in the mid-1960s. Most controls—including the shutter release and the film <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> - are on the left-hand side, unlike most other cameras. The film is transported {{in the opposite direction}} to other 35mm SLRs. In classic Exaktas—made between 1936 and 1969—two film canisters can be used, one containing unexposed film and a second into which is wound the exposed film. A sliding knife built {{into the bottom of the}} camera can be used to slice the film so that the canister containing the exposed film can be removed while preserving the unexposed film in the main canister. The knife was omitted in the Exakta VX500, one of the last [...] "official" [...] Exakta cameras.|$|R
5000|$|Any {{vertical}} structure like a mast {{is subject to}} dynamic swaying stress from <b>wind,</b> which <b>levers</b> immense force {{at the base of}} the mast.

50|$|The Realist 45 also {{differs from}} the Kodak Stereo Camera in several ways: the Realist 45 film {{transport}} features a swing-out <b>lever</b> that allows <b>rapid</b> <b>winding,</b> a handy feature for those wishing {{to take a lot}} of shots quickly. Unlike the Kodak, the Realist 45 has a top-mounted focusing knob that moves the film plane in a fashion similar to the standard Realist. There is a depth-of-field scale built into the knob which goes up to f/16. The top-mounted exposure counter counts up rather than down, like the Kodak counter.|$|R

Structural analysis, blade properties, and cost and weight analysis are described...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{advances to}} the derivation of operational GOES winds at NOAA/NESDIS. NOAA/NESDIS and the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) {{continue to work}} closely {{to improve the quality}} of Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) derived from the GOES-I/M series of satellites. Efforts have been aimed at improving the wind algorithms and processing strategies while developing new products. This paper will summarize work with <b>rapid</b> scan <b>winds,</b> 3. 9 um cloud-drift winds, clear-air water vapor winds, GOES- 12 winds, and the encoding of the winds into BUFR.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study on}} basic ideas {{to control a}} wind turbine by an electronic controller and a synchronous generator. We assume that a wind turbine has a blade of fixed pitch angle. The aerodynamic properties of a blade are given by a torque coefficient which {{is assumed to be}} a function of a tip speed ratio only. Over a rated wind speed, the wind turbine is in stall state. In stall state, the wind turbine becomes unstable. To maintain the stall state, the rotational speed of the blade is adjusted quickly by an electronic controller. We estimate the response time needed for the controller by a motion equation and torque coefficient. We also estimate the maximum torque of a generator needed for stall control and controlling the wind turbine safely for <b>rapid</b> <b>wind</b> change at high wind speed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{maximum power point}} {{tracking}} (MPPT) control system for wind-generator (WG) power applications is presented. The power electronics part consists of a boost DC/DC converter, a DC/AC three phase inverter and two control units: one controlling the boost converter ensuring the MPPT process and one controlling the inverter enabling the grid-connection and power flows control. The presented MPPT controller combines the benefits of two of the most commonly applied trends in the MPPT processes namely: The tracking method based on the optimum power versus speed characteristic and the perturbation and observation (P&O) of the output power method. Simulation and experimental results illustrate that the proposed hybrid control system can cope efficiently with difficulties arising from the separate use of the aforementioned techniques i. e. problems of detuning due to parameter changes or miscalculations encountered in the fixed optimum power characteristic tracking process, and P&O method deficiencies in <b>rapid</b> <b>wind</b> changes or fault recovery.

5000|$|The R9 was an {{evolutionary}} step from the R8 and appears superficially very similar; {{enough so that}} some have opined {{that it should have}} been simply a Mark II of the R8, or in Leica nomenclature, an [...] "R8.2".2 The silver top-plate color available on the R8 was replaced by an 'Anthracite' color on the R9; black remained available. Another external change was the addition of an LCD frame counter on the top plate between the <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> and the shutter-speed dial. The mode selector dial gained a lock, after many R8 user complaints that it was too easily moved from the desired setting when handling the camera. The rear LCD display gained a backlight so it could be viewed in dim lighting. The mass of the R9 was reduced by 100g (to 790g) from the R8, achieved by switching to a magnesium casting for the top plate (formerly zinc alloy) and substituting aluminum for steel at the bottom plate's frame. Electronic changes included the ability to tune the sensitivity of matrix metering in steps of 0.1 EV independently of the other metering modes, and several improvements to the flash support. Metz's HSS (High Speed Sync) flash mode was now supported, allowing fill flash at shutter speeds greater than the X-sync speed by the use of many repeated small flashes of the electronic flashgun. This mode could be used from 1/360 to the camera's shortest 1/8000 of a second shutter speed. Also improved was the use of fill-flash at slower shutter speeds and wider apertures, by enabling lower-power illumination modes on modern Metz equipment. The manual flash exposure compensation ability in Program mode was improved, and AE lock was now possible in all automated modes.|$|R
40|$|Wind power {{generation}} reduces our reliance {{on fossil fuels}} and can thus reduce environmental pollution. However, <b>rapid</b> <b>wind</b> power development has caused various issues related to power grid restructuring. A high proportion of the generating capacity of northeast China is based on {{combined heat and power}} (CHP), whose inflexible response to the peak regulation of power grids hinders the ability to accommodate wind power; thus, wind power curtailment is prevalent. Electric boilers can directly consume the excess wind power to supply heat during low load periods and thus mitigate the heat supply stress of CHP units. Therefore, electric boilers improve the power grid’s ability to accommodate additional wind power. From a regional power grid perspective, this paper discussed the feasibility of such a strategy for increasing the ability to accommodate wind power during the heat supply season. This paper analysed the optimum electric boiler capacity configuration of a regional power grid based on various constraint conditions, such as the heat-power balance, with the objective of maximising the associated social benefits. Using the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei power grid as an example, the optimum electric boiler capacity of the studied power grid is approximately 1100 MW...|$|R
40|$|Airborne C band {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) data were collected during the Norwegian Continental Shelf Experiment (NORCSEX) carried out in March 1988. Unique signature variations in the SAR backscatter due to upper ocean circulation features and wind fronts were found. It is documented that a current jet of 0. 3 m s- • with a shear of about 0. 3 x 10 - 3 s- • is correlated with a narrow, bright curved line in the backscatter. In comparison a <b>rapid</b> <b>wind</b> shift of 9 m s- • resulted in a sharp transition from dark to brighter backscatter regions. The corresponding profiles of backscatter modulation across these features are expressed by a peak of about 2 dB {{in contrast to a}} steplike increase of 5 - 8 dB. This suggests that SAR image expressions of upper ocean circulation features and wind fronts can be distinguished and classified. On the basis of this classification, we attempt to quantify the dominating marine geophysical variables. This method for systematic interpretation of SAR images should be further validated with the use of airborne or satellite data such as from the first European Space Agency remote sensing satellite, ERS 1. 1...|$|R
40|$|We conduct {{numerical}} simulations {{based on}} a model of blowing snow to reveal the long-term properties and equilibrium state of aeolian particle transport from 10 ^- 5 m to 10 m above the flat surface. The numerical results are as follows. (i) Time-series data of particle transport are divided into development, relaxation, and equilibrium phases, which are formed by <b>rapid</b> <b>wind</b> response below 10 cm and gradual wind response above 10 cm. (ii) The particle transport rate at equilibrium is expressed as a power function of friction velocity, and the index of 2. 35 implies that most particles are transported by saltation. (iii) The friction velocity below 100 μm remains roughly constant and lower than the fluid threshold at equilibrium. (iv) The mean particle speed above 300 μm {{is less than the}} wind speed, whereas that below 300 μm exceeds the wind speed because of descending particles. (v) The particle diameter increases with height in the saltation layer, and the relationship is expressed as a power function. Through comparisons with the previously reported random-flight model, we find a crucial problem that empirical splash functions cannot reproduce particle dynamics at a relatively high wind speed...|$|R

This is a problem for statistical short term forecasts, which must be trained on a long record of historical power production-exactly what is missing for a new farm. Focus {{of the study was to}} analyse development of the offshore wind power forecast (WPF) quality from beginning of operation up to one year of operational experience. This paper represents a case study using data of the first German offshore wind farm "alpha ventus" and first German commercial offshore wind farm "Baltic 1 ".
