Under the complementary measures, two key tyre-related proposals are listed:- Setting tyre rolling resistance limits and publicly available grading in the EU for tyres fitted on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. - Compulsory fitting of accurate tyre pressure monitoring systems. Additionally, under the drafting of a new tyre regulatory framework, the tyre industry is under pressure to bring further down tyre/road noise limits for all categories of tyres put on the European market. The European Tyre Industry has continuously pushed technological improvements towards products offering increased safety performances while reducing its possible environmental impacts. The rolling resistance of tyres is in itself {{a key factor in}} determining vehicle fuel consumption. Depending on the type of road and driving style, rolling resistance represents 20 % of the total force on a light duty vehicle.

The friction coefficient is expressed as the product of a 'dry' friction coefficient by a function expressing the actions of water. It was stated that this function is a product of four weighting functions expressing respectively the water intrusion - due to the speed and the water depth - and the water drainage - thanks to the road surface macrotexture and the tire <b>tread</b> <b>depth.</b> It was shown that existing friction models are a special case of the proposed model. The model was calibrated by friction measurements issued from an exhaustive test campaign conducted at Ifsttar's test track. The test program includes 2 commercial tire types, 3 road surfaces, 6 speeds, 3 water depths and 3 tire <b>tread</b> <b>depths.</b> It was shown that the model fits remarkably well experimental data, except for very high water depth (8 mm) at high speed (over 80 km/h). Considering the fact that these conditions induce mechanisms like dragging that are not considered in the model and that the water depths used by friction monitoring devices generally are lower than 1 mm, it was considered that the proposed model is satisfactory. Discussions are made in terms of using the model for monitoring purposes or for harmonization of friction devices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of load {{carrying}} methods, stair slopes and walking speeds on heart rate and walking postures. Nine participants climbed up and down stairs with various stair slopes (24 °, 30 ° and 36 °), walking speeds (72, 96, and 132 steps per minute), and using different load carrying methods (empty loads, backpack, and hand-held). The effects of these factors on heart rate, Borg-RPE and flexion angles of knee joints, hip joints and trunk angles were investigated. This study demonstrated that increased stair slopes and walking speed were associated with increased heart rate and RPE. The heart rate for empty loads subjects was lowest, followed by backpack load and hand-held load. Climbing stairs with larger inclination was associated with smaller knee joint flexion angle and larger trunk and hip joint flexion angle. In conclusion, it is easier for subjects to carry a load of the same weight up stairs by backpack than by hand. However, the stair slope should be less than 30 °. Thus, the standard fixed stair slope (30 ° of stair slope) on recommended for riser height and <b>tread</b> <b>depth</b> are 160 mm (6. 5 inches) and <b>tread</b> <b>depth</b> 280 mm (11 inches) ...|$|R

50|$|Proper vehicle safety {{requires}} specific {{attention to}} inflation pressure, <b>tread</b> <b>depth,</b> and general {{condition of the}} tires. Over-inflated tires {{run the risk of}} explosive decompression (they may pop). On the other hand, under-inflated tires have a higher rolling resistance and suffer from overheating and rapid tread wear particularly on the edges of the tread. As tire tread decreases, there is more traction between the tire and the road resulting in better grip. However, there is an increased risk of hydroplaning, so as the tire wears the performance in the dry generally improves, but gets worse in the wet. Tires worn down past their safety margins and into the casing run the very real risk of rupturing. Also, certain combinations of cross ply and radial tires on different wheels of the same vehicle can lead to vehicle instability, and may also be illegal. Vehicle and tire manufacturers provide owners' manuals with instructions on how to check and maintain tires.|$|R
