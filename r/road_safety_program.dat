The numbers of road accidents are increasing {{at an alarming}} rate in India. Thus, there is an urgent need for a systematic approach to improve <b>road</b> <b>safety.</b> <b>Road</b> <b>safety</b> improvement <b>program</b> is a systematic approach to reduce the injuries, fatalities, deaths and loss of public properties because of road accidents. In order to develop an effective <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> improvement <b>program,</b> it is required to collect relevant data and analyze accident record so that hazardous locations can be identified. Further, it is required to conduct studies on identified safety hazardous locations to identify remedial measures to reduce severity and number of accidents. Further, as {{it is not possible to}} implement all remedial measures identified due to limited resources available, it is also required to determine urgency of the safety measures identified. Literature review indicated that the comprehensive accident record, essential for formulating <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> improvement <b>program</b> is not available. Hence, hardly any meaning full analysis is done to find out the accident hazardous location, vulnerable road users involved in accidents, causes of accident etc. which are so essential for identifying preventing measures. This study highlights the deficiencies in the present state of the art and also presents some basic concepts so that systematic approach for formulation of a <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> improvement <b>program</b> in India can be developed.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 22 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 14 - 16 July 2003 "National issues affecting the movement of people and goods - strategic approaches", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: The results achieved by Victoria’s approach to road safety over {{the last ten years}} have been recognised and applauded locally, nationally and internationally. The integration of high levels of enforcement combined with high levels of public awareness via mass media campaigns has seen significant changes in road user behaviour. Supporting the enforcement and public awareness campaigns with targeted education and road safety engineering combined with effective and transparent evaluation of all aspects of the strategy made up Victoria’s <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>program.</b> Safety First. But how relevant is the Safety First model in third world and developing nations? Since 1998, Victoria has been involved in introducing the principals of Safety First into the Province of KwaZulu-Natal in the Republic of South Africa. ASIPHEPHE (Zulu for “Let us be Safe”) is the KwaZulu-Natal Road Safety Project that is based on Safety First. During the same time frame, the National Department of Transport was introducing the National <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>program</b> - Arrive Alive. Whilst Asiphephe was limited to KwaZulu-Natal, the interaction with Arrive Alive was dynamic and often tense. This paper examines the results of the introduction of Safety First, in the context of Arrive Alive, into a foreign environment with particular reference to the sustainability of the program in that environment. This evaluation has shown limited success in the transfer of skills, knowledge and understanding of the theory and practice of the Victorian Road Safety Strategy leading {{to the conclusion that the}} Victoria Solution, as such, cannot be transposed onto foreign environments without significant review and adaptation based on local expectations and conditions.

The current study evaluated the effectiveness of a road safety intervention by measuring attitudes toward unsafe driving behaviors and risk perception. A sample of high school students (n = 133) participated in a road safety intervention program focusing on attitudes and risk perceptions of young people as novice drivers, pre-drivers, and passengers. This sample was compared with a matched sample of students who did not take the program (n = 172) on their attitudes and perceived risk toward unsafe driving, both prior to the program (T 1), immediately after the program (T 2), and at 6 -week follow-up (T 3). While no changes in attitudes toward unsafe driving were found for the control group, the intervention group reported riskier attitudes toward unsafe driving behaviors from T 1 to T 2 and T 3. No differences were found from T 1 to T 3 in perceived risk toward unsafe driving for either the intervention or control groups. Implications of the study include encouraging a higher rate of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>program</b> evaluations, leading to better understanding of the effectiveness of road safety intervention programs and how they may be designed and delivered to ensure lower engagement in unsafe driving behaviors by young drivers.

40|$|Although 40 % of all crashes in Louisiana are {{on local}} roads, local road safety {{improvement}} programs {{have not received}} the attention needed to reduce crashes. Local road crash countermeasures {{are an important part}} of the overall efforts to reduce crashes and their severity in Louisiana. The efforts to develop a local <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>program</b> are hampered by the lack of appropriate risk assessment that enables local agencies to reduce crashes using low cost countermeasures. This paper provides a methodology that can be used by local agencies to deploy countermeasures based on a risk assessment and optimization to meet a fixed budget. First, a statistical model is presented to assess the risk of local road segments taking into account AADT and geometric features of the road segment or intersection. Secondly, low cost countermeasures are recommended for individual road segments and costs for improvements are assessed. Thirdly, a score which allows the ranking of road projects is developed for each road segment. This score incorporates the risk associated with the observed number of crashes, the benefits of improvements, and the total cost of a project.

40|$|Qualitative {{research}} into culture often {{relies on the}} perceptions and experiences of informants. A model method for improving transfer of Western road safety knowledge and expertise to low income countries recommends use of educated or expert informants to identify factors influencing road safety in the country, including cultural factors such as attribution of crash causation. However, such informants {{are likely to be}} high status, and may not provide reliable information about the crash cause attributions of ordinary members of society.

The other study addressed the experience of men with a spinal injury from a road crash and their carers, and involved interviews with educated higher status Thais, and translated interviews with the injured men and their carers. The secondary analysis of transcripts from each study, selected in order to facilitate valid comparison, showed that higher status Thai informants were accurate in their presumptions about attribution of crash causes at village level, although there were indications that this was based on inference rather than knowledge. There was also evidence that these attributions were interpreted by the informants as a lack of knowledge among an older generation which would disappear with better education in the new generations.

40|$|Young {{drivers are}} overrepresented in motor vehicle crash rates, and their risk {{increases}} when carrying similar aged passengers. Graduated Driver Licensing strategies have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing fatalities among young drivers, however complementary approaches may further reduce crash rates. Previous studies {{conducted by the}} researchers have shown that there is considerable potential for a passenger focus in youth road safety interventions, particularly involving the encouragement of young passengers to intervene in their peers’ risky driving (Buckley, Chapman, Sheehan & Davidson, 2012). Additionally, this {{research has shown that}} technology-based applications may be a promising means of delivering passenger safety messages, particularly as young people are increasingly accessing web-based and mobile technologies. This research describes the participatory design process undertaken to develop a web-based <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>program,</b> and involves feasibility testing of storyboards for a youth passenger safety application. Storyboards and framework web-based materials were initially developed for a passenger safety program, using the results of previous studies involving online and school-based surveys with young people. Focus groups were then conducted with 8 school staff and 30 senior school students at one public high school in the Australian Capital Territory. Young people were asked about the situations in which passengers may feel unsafe and potential strategies for intervening in their peers’ risky driving. Students were also shown the storyboards and framework web-based material and were asked to comment on design and content issues. Teachers were also shown the material and asked about their perceptions of program design and feasibility. The focus group data will be used as part of the participatory design process, in further developing the passenger safety program. This research describes an evidence-based approach {{to the development of a}} web-based application for youth passenger safety.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about young people, road safety and risk and the {{construction}} of meanings in a school-based intervention. This thesis provides a detailed examination of ‘Fit to Drive’, a <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>program</b> targeting year 11 students in secondary schools in Victoria. Despite significant road toll reductions since 1990, young drivers continue to have more casualty crashes than any other group of drivers on the road (TAC 2012). The continued over-representation of young drivers in road crashes has given rise to targeted public policy and education interventions aimed at reducing the involvement of young people in road trauma, aiming to change behaviours which are understood to put young people at risk on the roads. In this thesis I analyse how Fit to Drive works as a schools-based intervention targeting the problem of young people, road use and risk. Recognising that ‘risk’ as a concept is central to discourses of road safety, I consider the complex understandings surrounding the notion of risk, and its connection to ways of ‘knowing’ young people. Drawing on road safety literatures, as well as socio-cultural analyses, I explore the way ‘risk’ is employed within Fit to Drive, and the ways that notions and understandings of ‘risk’, ‘risk-taking’, and ‘at-risk’ inform and shape the discourse of young people and road use. This thesis explores the ways in which Fit to Drive works to generate particular knowledges about road use and young people, {{and the degree to which}} young people are engaged in the construction of those knowledges. This thesis therefore aims to explore the ideas, beliefs and attitudes about risk and road use expressed by young people participating in the Fit to Drive workshops, alongside an examination of the specific characteristics of the program that create the conditions for new understandings in its ‘target group’ and that contribute to its effectiveness as a schools-based intervention. Road safety education research and interventions have tended to focus on the design of programs based on behaviour change theory, incorporating road safety research to target unsafe road user behaviours and attitudes (Buckley, Reveruzzi & Watson 2012). Whilst recognising that Fit to Drive incorporates key features of behaviour change models, such as participatory (peer-led) facilitated discussion, the development of personal strategies and practice of resistance and assertiveness skills, in this thesis I am interested in exploring and analysing the qualitative, aesthetic, dimensions of the program that create the conditions in which meaning making (in relation to road safety) occurs. I draw upon theoretical approaches from phenomenological and narrative research traditions in order to develop an understanding of the elements that are essential to the ‘quality’ of the Fit to Drive program experience. I provide an analysis of the individual elements and modes of engagement - the activities, the different modes of delivery, the role of narratives, group encounters and visual images – how they work, and the way they work together in the context of the school setting to achieve a meaningful impact. In broad terms, the thesis contributes to knowledge about the factors that contribute to successful health promotion interventions in the school setting...|$|E
