40|$|Abstract Background Independent {{luciferase}} reporter assays and fluorescent translocation assays {{have been}} successfully used in drug discovery for several molecular targets. We developed U 2 transLUC, an assay system in which luciferase and fluorescent <b>read-outs</b> can be multiplexed to provide a powerful cell-based high content screening method. Results The U 2 transLUC system {{is based on a}} stable cell line expressing a GFP-tagged FOXO transcription factor and a luciferase reporter gene under the control of human FOXO-responsive enhancers. The U 2 transLUC assay measures nuclear-cytoplasmic FOXO shuttling and FOXO-driven transcription, providing a means to analyze these two key features of FOXO regulation in the same experiment. We challenged the U 2 transLUC system with chemical probes with known biological activities {{and we were able to}} identify compounds with translocation and/or transactivation capacity. Conclusion Combining different biological <b>read-outs</b> in a single cell line offers significant advantages over conventional cell-based assays. The U 2 transLUC assay facilitates the maintenance and monitoring of homogeneous FOXO transcription factor expression and allows the reporter gene activity measured to be normalized with respect to cell viability. U 2 transLUC is suitable for high throughput screening and can identify small molecules that interfere with FOXO signaling at different levels. </p...|$|R
