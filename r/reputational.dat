25|$|Explicit {{extrinsic}} {{rewards and}} punishments {{have been found}} to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and <b>reputational</b> incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt <b>reputational</b> concerns and simply pointing out that there are <b>reputational</b> benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to <b>reputational</b> concerns is better than doing no good at all.|$|E

25|$|Both {{indirect}} reciprocity {{and costly}} signaling {{depend on the}} value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak <b>reputational</b> cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real <b>reputational</b> effects. Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of <b>reputational</b> concerns.|$|E

25|$|Some critics {{believe that}} CSR {{programs}} are undertaken by companies {{to distract the}} public from ethical questions posed by their core operations. They argue that the <b>reputational</b> benefits that CSR companies receive (cited above as a benefit to the corporation) demonstrate the hypocrisy of the approach. Moreover, some studies find that CSR programs are motivated by corporate managers' personal interests {{at the cost of}} the shareholders so they are a type of an agency problem in corporations.|$|E

25|$|Nehru's {{withdrawal}} from the plebiscite option came a major blow to all concerned. Scholars have suggested that India was never seriously intent on holding a plebiscite, and the withdrawal came to signify a vindication of their belief. Scholar Mahesh Shankar argues {{that the reason for}} the withdrawal was Nehru's disillusionment with the aggressive attitude and militaristic posture of Pakistan which would be apparently strengthened by the 1954 US-Pakistan Pact. These factors made the strategic and <b>reputational</b> costs of continued concessions to Pakistan unacceptable to India.|$|E
25|$|Large {{negative}} earnings surprises {{may have}} legal and <b>reputational</b> costs to managers. Firstly, managers {{can be held}} personally liable if shareholders sue the firm for failing to disclose negative earnings news promptly. Secondly, money managers may choose not to hold, and analysts may choose not to follow, the stocks of firms whose managers have reputations for withholding bad news. This may contribute to managers' voluntary disclosure of information related to negative earnings surprises: quarterly earnings announcements containing large negative earnings surprises are preempted by voluntary disclosures more frequently than are other earnings announcements.|$|E
25|$|People may compete over {{getting the}} {{benefits}} of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The <b>reputational</b> benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.|$|E
25|$|The events {{generated}} {{criticism and}} a general distrustful attitude toward the sport of professional cycling from media and public opinion. The doping allegations also resulted in several team sponsors threatening to retire their support if events advanced further. Some media such as German TV channels ARD and ZDF left the Tour once the first scandals broke. Following the Tour's conclusion, the sport's governing bodies spoke out about ways to combat the prevalence of doping in cycling and key team sponsors elected to withdraw their support due to the <b>reputational</b> damage caused by the scandals.

After the end of the Tour, The Times of London ranked it 4th in its list of the top 50 sporting scandals.|$|E
25|$|His {{experience}} {{in the region and}} in particular his perceived Labour sympathies at that time led to Clement Attlee appointing him Viceroy of India on 20 February 1947 charged with overseeing the transition of British India to independence no later than 30 June 1948. Mountbatten's instructions emphasised a united India {{as a result of the}} transference of power but authorised him to adapt to a changing situation in order to get Britain out promptly with minimal <b>reputational</b> damage. Soon after he arrived, Mountbatten concluded that the situation was too volatile for even that short a wait. Although his advisers favoured a gradual transfer of independence, Mountbatten decided the only way forward was a quick and orderly transfer of independence before 1947 was out. In his view, any longer would mean civil war. The Viceroy also hurried so he could return to his senior technical Navy courses.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the {{difficulty}} in measurement, {{the amount of money}} laundered each year is in the billions of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments. As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the <b>reputational</b> risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been large scale criminal enterprises. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern War on Drugs. In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as adjunct to the financial crime of terrorist financing in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come from, and terrorist financing relating to where the money is going to).|$|E

Rail contributor Pip Dunn said that WCRC refused to talk to journalists when negative stories concerning the company were being reported, yet was happy to when publicising a charter it was running. On 28 May, WCRC issued a press release apologising for the distress, disappointment and inconvenience caused by the incident and events arising from it. It also thanked the ORR and others for assistance and support given. It stated that it was giving full assistance to the RAIB in respect of its investigation into the SPAD.|$|E

2500|$|Successful fund {{governance}} {{firms have}} been criticized by their competitors in ‘boutique’ firms for having too many directorships or being “rubber stamp” directors. [...] However, independent empirical research has consistently revealed these allegations as counterfactual. Some studies have used the number of directorships held by a director {{as a proxy for}} the <b>reputational</b> capital of the director - arguing that <b>reputational</b> incentives are particularly pronounced for professional hedge fund directors, and that directors who sit on more boards and the boards of better performing funds should be of higher quality. Thus, hiring a director who can be credibly perceived as being more independent could provide valuable certification for the fund. Busy professional directors are more common among funds that derive higher benefits from external certification and monitoring, and their departure from the board is associated with outflows of investor capital. This result is inconsistent with directors serving as uninformative (or most nefariously, pro-management) rubber-stamps and inconsistent with the theory that funds prefer rubber-stamp directors who face more time constraints, making them too busy to monitor the manager.|$|E

College presidents, academic deans and deans of admission do not know enough about other institutions to make meaningful comparisons. This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S.

2500|$|All {{directors}} owe {{the same}} fiduciary duties and directors each have {{joint and several}} liability so in reality ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards is a marketing aphorism and distinction without a difference. [...] Independent research has found that professional firms of quality directors have large <b>reputational</b> investment with high incentive to perform well and consistently outperform proprietorships. [...] This research found that “directors from a top ten firm are almost twice as likely as directors from smaller firms to obtain a new directorship.” [...] This implies that directors are even more likely to be hired when their firm has a larger client base, and thus more <b>reputational</b> capital to protect. The single firm focus is counterfactual to the risk analysis. Unquestionably the area of greatest risk within any fund is within its investment portfolio. [...] Enormous authority over the fund affairs is often entrusted to the investment manager as a single individual, from a single firm, yet it would be universally accepted to be counterproductive and inefficient to appoint another manager from a different firm to manage the same portfolio at the same time, or another auditor from different firm to audit the same fund at the same time.

[...] Hill then argues that, [...] "by contrast, 1 percent of the U.S. News ratings formula is assigned to student-to-faculty ratios, which many faculty members and students consider {{the most important factor in}} educational experience." [...] Hill states that the members of the Annapolis Group will offer the same information in an alternative, free, format which will not rank schools, as, [...] "an educational experience can't be reduced to one number, a school's so-called rank. The simplicity of a rank is understandably more appealing than spending hours poring over college catalogues and visiting campuses, but myriad complex variables can't be reduced to a single number." [...] Instead, Hill asks students and parents to [...] "compare schools on a variety of factors [...] they should visit campuses and go on what feels like a good match rather than relying on filtered or secondhand information.
