40|$|International audienceNonpolar (11 - 20) (Ga,In) N multi-quantum wells {{have been}} studied by polarized, {{temperature}} dependent photoluminescence (PL). A non monotonic temperature dependence {{of the difference in}} PL peak energies recorded for E parallel to c or E perpendicular to c, and of the polarization ratio is observed. We interpret these effects by first an orthorhombic distortion of the crystal and an increased electron-hole exchange energy <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>GaN.</b> This increase is in agreement with calculations on the effect of confinement on the exciton exchange splitting...|$|E

40|$|We {{utilized}} time-integrated and time-resolved photoluminescence of a-axis and c-axis {{gallium nitride}} nanowires to elucidate {{the origin of}} the blue-shifted ultraviolet photoluminescence in a-axis <b>GaN</b> nanowires <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> c-axis <b>GaN</b> nanowires. We attribute this blue-shifted ultraviolet photoluminescence to emission from surface trap states as opposed to previously proposed causes such as strain effects or built-in polarization. These results demonstrate the importance of accounting for surface effects when considering ultraviolet optoelectronic devices based on GaN nanowires. GaN nanowires {{have been the subject of}} intense research lately due to the many potential applications (lasers, lightemitting diodes, modulators, detectors, etc.) 1 - 3 and interesting properties 4, 5 that they possess. Because GaN has a wurtzite crystal structure, which is an anisotropic crystal structure, many of its properties are dependent upon crystal orientation. For example, the photoluminescence (PL) of GaN nanowires in the ultraviolet (UV) has been observed to depend on the growth direction of GaN. 4,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{successful}} fabrication of a GaN-on-Si high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) with a 1702 V breakdown voltage (BV) and low current collapse. The strain and threading dislocation density were well-controlled by 100 pairs of AlN/GaN superlattice buffer layers. <b>Relative</b> <b>to</b> the carbon-doped <b>GaN</b> spacer layer, we grew the AlGaN back barrier layer {{at a high}} temperature, resulting in a low carbon-doping concentration. The high-bandgap AlGaN provided an effective barrier for blocking leakage from the channel to substrate, leading to a BV comparable to the ordinary carbon-doped GaN HEMTs. In addition, the AlGaN back barrier showed a low dispersion of transiently pulsed ID under substrate bias, implying that the buffer traps were effectively suppressed. Therefore, we obtained a low-dynamic on-resistance with this AlGaN back barrier. These two approaches of high BV with low current collapse improved the device performance, yielding a device that is reliable in power device applications...|$|R
40|$|The optical {{properties}} of GaN nanocolumn structures containing InGaN quantum disks are investigated by optical microphotoluminescence spectroscopy using pulsed lasers, and cathodo- luminescence. The results are analyzed {{in the context}} of current theories regarding an inho- mogeneous strain distribution in the disk which has been theorized to generate lateral charge separation in the disks by strain induced band bending, an inhomogeneous polarization field distribution, and Fermi surface pinning. Simulations of the strain distribution for the relevant materials and structures are also performed, and the results analysed. It is concluded from ex- perimental measurements that no extreme lateral separation of carriers occurs in the quantum disks under investigation. Internal field screening by an increased carrier density in the QDisks at higher excitation densities is observed via a blue-shift of the emission and a dynamically changing decay time. Other possible explanations for these effects are discussed and discounted. Microphotoluminescence studies are also carried out on a single GaN nanocolumn struc- ture that has been removed from its growth substrate and dispersed onto a patterned grid. An analysis of the dynamics of the carriers in the nanocolumn is presented. Suppression of the GaN luminescence from the area of the column {{in the vicinity of the}} InGaN QDisk in addition to a delayed emission from the QDisk <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> the <b>GaN</b> is observed.

40|$|The crystal {{qualities of}} InAlN nearly lattice-matched (LM) <b>to</b> <b>GaN</b> with {{different}} thicknesses {{have been investigated}} by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Moreover, the degradation was found to be governed by the threading dislocations (TDs) propagation from the underlying GaN layer, rather than by the misfit strain between InAlN and GaN.
