50|$|As a rule, <b>reaction</b> <b>wood</b> is {{undesirable}} in any structural application, {{primarily as}} its mechanical properties {{are different from}} normal wood: it alters the uniform structural properties of timber. <b>Reaction</b> <b>wood</b> can twist, cup or warp dramatically during machining. This movement can occur during the milling process, making it occasionally dangerous to perform certain operations without appropriate safety controls in place. For instance, ripping a piece of <b>reaction</b> <b>wood</b> on a table saw without a splitter or riving knife installed can lead to kick back of the stock. <b>Reaction</b> <b>wood</b> also responds to moisture differently from normal wood.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Three {{samples of}} {{different}} wood densities of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) were cooked by the kraft process. The yields and the Kappa numbers were studied {{to establish the}} rates and the energies of activation of the pulping and delignification <b>reactions</b> respectively. <b>Wood</b> properties did not show significant effects on the pulping reactions compared {{to the effects of}} time and temperature. However, their influences on delignification was greater than on pulping reactions. The intermediate density wood sample which had the lowest amount of lignin and the highest amount of sapwood underwent the most delignification and showed the highest yields. Heartwood penetrability affected the pulping reactions in the beginning stages and became less effective at higher temperatures and longer cooking times. Fluoro-metric analysis was used to measure the lignin in the waste liquors and linear relationships between fluorescent intensities and cooking tithes were found at 165 ° and 175 °C. These results agreed with the relationships of Kappa numbers to cooking times for each wood sample. A non-linear relationship between fluorescent intensities of waste liquors to cooking times were found at 185 °C which may be due to lignin condensation <b>reactions.</b> <b>Wood</b> density influenced the physical strength properties of handsheets.

In 1948, Maurice M.

30|$|Although it is {{not easy}} to define classes of {{pyrolysis}} and gasification reactions, such reactions may be generally divided into two stages, i.e., primary pyrolysis and secondary pyrolysis <b>reactions</b> [7]. <b>Wood</b> constituent polymers decompose into volatile and char (solid carbonized material) intermediates in the primary pyrolysis stage, which are then degraded further in the secondary pyrolysis reaction stage.

30|$|Because some ionic liquids are {{reported}} {{to be able to}} dissolve cellulose [17], much attention has been focused on reactions between ionic liquids and wood (which is made up of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) [18 – 28]. 1 -Ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([C 2 mim][Cl]) was found to liquefy all the above-mentioned constituents of wood [29]. The polymers solubilized in [C 2 mim][Cl] are depolymerized to low-molecular-weight compounds such as glucose, mannose, levoglucosan, and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural. It was also revealed that the atmosphere in the reaction system affects the <b>reaction</b> behavior of <b>wood</b> in ionic liquids [30].

30|$|A {{number of}} studies on {{application}} of ionic liquids to cellulose [6] have been reported after the discovery that some ionic liquids can dissolve cellulose [7].

5000|$|The Viking shipbuilders had no written {{diagrams}} or standard written design plan. The shipbuilder {{pictured the}} longship before its construction, {{based on previous}} builds, and the ship was then built from the keel up. The keel and stems were made first. The shape of the stem was based on segments of circles of varying sizes. The keel was an inverted T shape to accept the garboard planks. In the longships the keel {{was made up of}} several sections spliced together and fastened with treenails. The next step was building the strakes [...] - [...] the lines of planks joined endwise from stern to stern. Nearly all longships were clinker (also known as lapstrake) built, meaning that each hull plank overlapped the next. Each plank was hewn from an oak tree so that the finished plank was about 25 mm thick and tapered along each edge to a thickness of about 20 mm. The planks were radially hewn so that the grain is approximately at right angles {{to the surface of the}} plank. This provides maximum strength, an even bend and an even rate of expansion and contraction in water. This is called in modern terms quartersawn timber, and has the least natural shrinkage of any cut section of wood. The plank above the turn of the bilge, the meginhufr, was about 37 mm thick on very long ships, but narrower to take the strain of the crossbeams. This was also the area subject to collisions. The planks overlapped by about 25 mm-30 mm and were joined by iron rivets. Each overlap was stuffed with wool or animal hair or sometimes hemp soaked in pine tar to ensure water tightness. At midlength, where the planks are straight, the rivets are about 170 mm apart, but they were closer together as the planks sweep up to the curved bow and stern. There is considerable twist and bend in the end planks. This was achieved by use of both thinner (by 50%) and narrower planks. In more sophisticated builds, forward planks were cut from natural curved trees called <b>reaction</b> <b>wood.</b> Planks were installed unseasoned or wet. Partly worked stems and sterns have been located in bogs. It has been suggested that they were stored there over winter to stop the wood from drying and cracking. The moisture in wet planks allowed the builder to force the planks into a more acute bend, if need be; once dry it would stay in the forced position. At the bow and the stern builders were able to create hollow sections, or compound bends, at the waterline, making the entry point very fine. In less sophisticated ships short and nearly straight planks were used at the bow and stern. Where long timber was not available or the ship was very long, the planks were butt-joined, although overlapping scarf joints fixed with nails were also used.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{book is a}} {{fundamental}} reference source on <b>reaction</b> <b>wood</b> for wood scientists and technologists, plant biologists, silviculturists, forest ecologists, and anyone involved in the growing of trees and the processing of wood. It brings together our current understanding of all aspects of <b>reaction</b> <b>wood,</b> and is the first book to discuss both compression wood and tension wood. Trees produce <b>reaction</b> <b>wood</b> to maintain the vertical orientation of their stems and the optimum angle of each branch. They achieve this by laying down fibre cell walls in which differences in physical and chemical structure from those of normal fibres are expressed as differential stresses across the stem or branch. This process, while of obvious value {{for the survival of}} the tree, causes serious problems for the utilisation of timber. Timber derived from trees containing significant amounts of <b>reaction</b> <b>wood</b> is subject to dimensional instability on drying, causing twisting, bending and splitting. It is also difficult to work as timber, and for the pulp and paper industry the cost of removing the increased amount of lignin in compression wood is substantial. This has both practical and economic consequences for industry. Understanding the factors controlling <b>reaction</b> <b>wood</b> formation and its effect on wood structure is therefore fundamental {{to our understanding of the}} adaptation of trees to their environment and to the sustainable use of wood.

40|$|Gravistimulation of tree stems affects wood {{development}} by unilaterally inducing wood with modified properties, called <b>reaction</b> <b>wood.</b> Commonly, it also stimulates cambial growth on the <b>reaction</b> <b>wood</b> side. Numerous experiments involving applications of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) or IAA-transport inhibitors {{have suggested that}} <b>reaction</b> <b>wood</b> is induced by a redistribution of IAA around the stem.
