500|$|Fielding's plays do not prophesy that he {{will become}} a major novelist, but the {{direction}} of his theatrical career does suggest concerns that increasingly led him away from pure representation [...] Fielding's separation from the theatre was a forced one, but the expulsion was fortunate, freeing him from a relationship and commitment that had always been in some sense against the grain [...] Fielding's way is not <b>really</b> <b>very</b> dramatic, either in novels or in plays; he never developed stage-likely objective correlatives, having reserved his artistic energy for the examining process in which the action is rerun again and again, reviewed, considered, nearly masticated.|$|E
500|$|In the 1977 {{edition of}} their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler {{described}} Extra Texture as [...] "another lugubrious offering" [...] and concluded: [...] "the needle of the listener's personal Ecstatograph points sullenly towards zero throughout." [...] Harrison's pleas for tolerance and understanding, like his self-deprecation {{on the album}} sleeve, seemed to backfire. Writing in 1981, Bob Woffinden found that the album showed signs that Harrison was [...] "no longer so scornful of his audience" [...] compared with Dark Horse. Woffinden wrote of the songs that [...] "plead plaintively with critics not to judge too severely": [...] "In this different context, such pleas are more sympathetic. Very well, then, we will not. Extra Texture wasn't <b>really</b> <b>very</b> good musically... but it did have some appealing qualities, and barely any disagreeable ones." ...|$|E

It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle.

[...] While {{he noted that the}} [...] "end of the world" [...] scenario was very common, he said that it had never [...] "been quite so pleasingly complex" [...] and that [...] "even if there are several plot holes, it's difficult to get too worried about them when the story packs such a strong emotional wallop". Den of Geek's Simon Brew also gave the episode a positive review, writing [...] "if you were awaiting a simple, easy-to-explain blockbuster of a Doctor Who series finale, you simply didn't get it here. Instead, if you were looking for something <b>really</b> <b>very</b> ambitious, often quite confusing, yet ultimately far more satisfying, then 'The Big Bang' absolutely hit the mark." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Gary Cole's return was highly praised, {{as well as}} the scene in which Sarah imitates the face Chuck makes when the Intersect has a [...] "flash". HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Cole's return was as much fun as I hoped it would be - in some ways, even better than his first appearance in season two's 'Chuck vs. the Delorean,' where I liked Sarah and Jack's interaction but thought the actual con job was a bit thin. 'Chuck vs. the Wedding Planner' had its own flaw in the section where Sarah and Chuck are illegally using government resources to catch the con woman and wind up getting more government 'help' than they bargained for... But once Jack turned up in Burbank to help his daughter and her schnook of a fiance be heroes and get back in the good graces of General Beckman, 'Wedding Planner' was <b>really</b> <b>very</b> strong, both as a comedy piece (loved Yvonne Strahovski's accent as she impersonated Daphne) and another story about Sarah's colorful but ultimately sad past." ...|$|E

The George Martin score to the film is <b>really</b> <b>very</b> nice, and two tracks by George Harrison redeem the first side. Both [...] are superb pieces, considerably more enthralling than the most draggy All Together Now, a rather wet track." [...] In a review for International Times, Barry Miles considered Martin's score [...] "superbly produced" [...] and, of the songs, wrote only of [...] "It's All Too Much", which he described as, variously, [...] "Endless, mantric, a round, interwoven, trellised, tessellated, filigreed, gidouiled, spiralling" [...] and [...] "Happy singalong music". Writing in their book [...] (1975), NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler bemoaned the commercial considerations {{that resulted in a}} full soundtrack album, saying that the four new songs [...] "would have made a superb EP".|$|E

500|$|Michael {{had shown}} the office a [...] "work in progress" [...] {{cut of the}} film years ago, but the {{employees}} all mistook it for a comedy, and Michael was so offended by their laughing that he shut down the screening. Everyone is very eager to see Michael's film, albeit only because they all appear in it, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) warns everyone {{to be mindful of}} how sensitive Michael is and not laugh. However, Pam is unable to keep herself from crying out in horror when she sees her mother cast in the film as a scantily clad nurse, and Jim (John Krasinski) fails to fully suppress his laughter at [...] "The Scarn" [...] scene, so Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away. Michael asks Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) what she thought and she does not seem impressed. Michael gets angry at her because he considers the film his [...] "dream", and he then offers the rest of the office the opportunity to finish seeing the film, which they happily accept. While watching, Michael begins noting how the film is not <b>really</b> <b>very</b> good; he steps outside and tells Holly that it is a bad film but also one that people are having fun watching. They sit down and laugh {{with the rest of the}} office through the film's conclusion.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{receiving}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} the critics, the country-rock style of Sweetheart of the Rodeo {{was such a}} radical departure from the band's previous sound that large sections of the group's counterculture following were alienated by its contents, resulting in the lowest sales of any Byrds album up to that point. Barry Gifford, in the August 1968 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, said of the album: [...] "The new Byrds do not sound like Buck Owens & his Buckaroos. They aren't that good. The material they've chosen to record, or rather, the way they perform the material, is simple, relaxed and folky. It's not pretentious, it's pretty. The musician-ship is excellent." [...] Gifford added that [...] "The Byrds have made an interesting album. It's <b>really</b> <b>very</b> uninvolved and not a difficult record to listen to. It ought to make the 'Easy-Listening' charts. 'Bringing it all back home' has never been an easy thing to do." [...] Rolling Stone praised the album in its September 1968 issue, with Jon Landau writing: [...] "The Byrds, in doing country as country, show just how powerful and relevant unadorned country music is to the music of today." [...] Landau added that [...] "they leave just enough rock in the drums {{to let you know that}} they can still play rock & roll." [...] In a 1969 article for The New York Times, Robert Christgau described Sweetheart of the Rodeo as [...] "a bittersweet tribute to country music".|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Cardinale portrayed a sultry nightclub {{singer and}} young mother in Valerio Zurlini's Girl with a Suitcase. As {{a result of}} her own {{experience}} of early motherhood, Cardinale naturally conveyed the concerns of a teenaged mother, identifying fully with the character of Aida. Such was her psychological involvement that she needed several months to overcome her apprehensions and prepare for the part. Zurlini chose her for such a difficult role against everyone's advice, as she was not yet considered a [...] "real" [...] actress, nor was she (yet) one of the most celebrated Italian beauties. However, he was very close and supportive of Cardinale during the production, and a true friendship developed between the two, based on a deep mutual understanding. Cardinale remarked: [...] "Zurlini {{was one of those who}} really love women: he had an almost feminine sensitivity. He could understand me at a glance. He taught me everything, without ever making demands on me. ... He was <b>really</b> <b>very</b> fond of me." [...] Cardinale was warmly praised by the critics for her performance in Girl with a Suitcase, Dennis Schwartz considering her to have been at her [...] "charming best". Later in 1961, Cardinale starred as a brothel owner opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo in Bolognini's La Viaccia. Both Girl with a Suitcase and La Viaccia were presented at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. At the time, Cardinale was not considered comparable to the two divas of Italian cinema, Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, but several newspapers and magazines including Paris Match began to consider her to be a credible young rival to Brigitte Bardot. Cardinale's 1961 appearances also included Henri Verneuil's French comedy Les Lions sont lâchés, and Auguste in which she had a cameo role.|$|E

500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was <b>really</b> <b>very</b> little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what all the fuss is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "In My Eyes" [...] {{utilizes}} tingling synths.

[...] Luke O'Neill of The Boston Globe {{said that the}} song showcases [...] "the tension-and-catharsis approach Robyn is capable of achieving with her vocals." [...] The second track, [...] "Include Me Out" [...] {{was referred to as}} [...] "digitised stop-start funk". The song begins with the line, [...] "It is <b>really</b> <b>very</b> simple, just a single pulse repeated at a regular interval", which according to O'Neill described [...] "the main sonic trick employed on a lot of her dance-ready songs." [...] On the song, Robyn plays a party-starter that is [...] "repping matriarchs and cross-dressers alike" [...] with the line [...] "This one's for the granny, take a bow... Come on all you trannies, click your heels for me." [...] "Hang with Me", carries a [...] "fierce, club-wrecking beat", with [...] "relentlessly energetic bass" [...] and synth arpeggios. Lyrically, the song speaks of trust in a relationship, with lines such as [...] "Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said that the song views [...] "the perspective of someone who's a bit too tightly buttoned-up to let her defences down." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Love Kills" [...] was described as a [...] "discofied, sharp-edged" [...] song, with fierce vocals and [...] "haunting Pet Shop Boys flourishes." [...] "We Dance to the Beat" [...] is a techno song, with an [...] "apocalyptic, big-beat". It features a [...] "sort of spoken-word hype-up jam" [...] that was compared to [...] "Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do". The song features lines such as [...] "We dance to the beat of your brains not evolving fast enough" [...] and [...] "We dance to the beat of bad kissers clicking teeth." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{not clear}} whether the Department of State or Lodge was {{enthusiastic}} about the political change in Saigon at the time, but if they were not, they were handed a fait accompli. A CIA report from Saigon soon after the seizure of power told the State Department that [...] "It {{is safe to say that}} Khánh's group will be essentially pro-American, anti-communist and anti-neutralist in general orientation." [...] As far as Harkins was concerned, with US policy committed to maintaining leadership in the hands of senior military officers, there were no other apparent options; he told General Taylor, [...] "One thing is for sure with this coup. We've gone through all the eligible general officers." [...] For his part, Lodge chose not to warn the junta, to which the embassy had pledged their support, as to the imminent plot, despite being well aware of it. He said in a cable a few days after the coup that [...] "General Khánh's coup was extremely disconcerting at first blush", but that the lack of public reaction to the overthrow of Minh indicated that Khánh's actions were not something to be alarmed about. He wrote that the progress of history was often made in many phases by different individuals or groups, using the analogy that in an American political party, the people who manage the primary campaigns are different from those who run the national elections, while the officer-holders are entirely separate. Lodge speculated that while Minh and his generals were successful in removing Diệm—something Lodge strongly encouraged—they may not be the ideal administrators of a nation themselves. With respect to the prospects of defeating the communists, he said [...] "Our side knows how to do it; we have the means with which to do it; we simply need to do it. This requires a tough and ruthless commander. Perhaps Khánh is it." [...] Blair said that Lodge's habit of looking for American parallels to Vietnamese situations hindered his judgment, pointing out that Khánh's rule merely saw more instability and chaos. At the end of February, Lodge was still positive and cabled Washington to say that [...] "I continue to be favorably impressed by him. He is <b>really</b> <b>very</b> much more able than the Minh, Don, Kim group and, of course, he is so far above Diệm and Nhu that there is no comparison." ...|$|E
