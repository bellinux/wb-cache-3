40|$|A <b>control</b> <b>room</b> {{is defined}} as a {{functional}} entity with an associated physical structure, where the operators carry out the centralized control, monitoring and administrative responsibilities. Emergency <b>control</b> <b>room</b> acts as an alternative <b>control</b> <b>room</b> for the purpose of shutting down or maintaining the facility in a safe shutdown state when the main <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is uninhabitable. The mission of emergency <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is to provide the resources to bring the plant to a safe shutdown condition after an evacuation of the main <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> An evacuation of the main <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is assumed when there is no possibility to accomplish tasks involved in the shutdown except reactor trip. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a specific approach for the design of the emergency <b>control</b> <b>room</b> of a nuclear reactor used to produce radioisotope.

New generation <b>control</b> <b>rooms,</b> along with modernized <b>control</b> <b>rooms,</b> will rely more heavily on automation and computerized procedures. Of particular importance to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is the impact such modernizations or new technologies will have upon operator performance and reliability in these safety-critical <b>control</b> <b>room</b> environments. One specific area of interest is the effect that various complexities in the <b>control</b> <b>room</b> have on operator performance and reliability. This research identifies various definitions of complexity and characterizes complexity in the nuclear power plant (NPP) domain, focusing on the common complexity dimensions of number, variety, and interconnections. Based on this characterization of complexity, a comprehensive list of complexity sources within the NPP <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is presented, along with a novel approach to describe complexity source interconnections.
