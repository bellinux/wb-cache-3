However, the external air supply and the tubes limit the mobility. Electric prototypes solve the problem above, yet they have to sacrifices the controllability by reducing the number of actuators to lower the self-weight. In this paper, an all actuated electric prototype is designed and three questions in the design of mechanism and motion control system are solved. Firstly, the internal batteries and motors increase the self-weight and requires greater driving torque. Servo motors are used to replace the DC motors for higher torque-weight ratio. Secondly, wireless modules are mounted on the independent struts to communicate between the discrete electric devices. Thirdly, the ratio of the elastic and nonelastic part of the cables and the elastic coefficient of the cables is taken into consideration to guarantee both the deformability and stability...|$|R

40|$|SummaryHelicases move on DNA via an ATP binding and {{hydrolysis}} mechanism {{coordinated by}} well-characterized helicase motifs. However, the translocation along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and the strand separation of double-stranded (dsDNA) may be loosely or tightly coupled.

The crystal {{structure of the}} Dda-ssDNA binary complex reveals a domain {{referred to as the}} “pin” that was previously thought to remain static during strand separation. The pin contains a conserved phenylalanine that mediates a transient base-stacking interaction that is absolutely required for separation of dsDNA.

40|$|The Flying Princess is a Boeing Jetfoil, one of {{a family}} of {{commercial}} waterjets built by Boeing Marine Systems, a division of The Boeing Company, Seattle, Washington. The new Jetfoil offers a number of advantages over earlier hydrofoils, a major one being a smooth ride in rough waters. NASA technology contributed to jolt-free passenger comfort. Hydrofoils skim the surface at speeds considerably greater than those of conventional ships because there is little friction between hull and water. Hulls are raised above the water by the lift of the foils, which resemble and function like an airplane wing. The foils are attached to the hull by <b>rigid</b> <b>struts,</b> which ordinarily cause a vessel operating in coastal seas to follow the contour of the waves. In wind-whipped waters, this makes for a rough ride. Seeking to increase passenger acceptance, Boeing Marine System engineers looked for ways to improve rough-water ride quality. Langley Research Center conducts continuing ride quality research. Initially, it was aimed at improving aircraft ride; it was later expanded to include all modes of transportation. Research includes studies of vibration, acceleration, temperature, humidity, passenger seats and posture, and the psychological aspects of passenger reaction to vehicle ride.

40|$|A brief {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made of the landing-impact characteristics of a 1 / 9 -scale dynamic model of a winged space vehicle. The landing tests were made by catapulting a free model onto a hard; surface runway and onto water. The model had a conical fuselage and a flat - plate wing with a basic delta planform and 75 deg sweepback of the leading edge. The use of yielding-metal shock absorbers and various landing-gear arrangements was investigated during landing impact. The basic landing gear consisted of a dual rubber-tired nose wheel and twin main skids aft of the center of gravity near the wing tips. landing motion and acceleration data were obtained over a range of landing attitudes, gross weights, and initial sinking speeds. Brief tests were made with an alternate nose-wheel location. An all-skid configuration also was briefly evaluated for hard-surface and water landings. The landing gear employing yielding struts for impact-energy absorption during hard-surface landings resulted in accelerations of approximately 5 1 / 2 g near the nose gear over a range of landing parameters. Replacing the nose wheel and tire with a skid did not significantly change the accelerations.

40|$|Microtubules {{have been}} {{proposed}} to function as <b>rigid</b> <b>struts</b> which oppose cellular contraction. Consistent with this hypothesis, microtubule disruption strengthens the contractile force exerted by many cell types. We have investigated alternative explanation for the mechanical effects of microtubule disruption: that microtubules modulate the mechanochemical activity of myosin by influencing phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (LC 20). We measured the force produced by a population of fibroblasts within a collagen lattice attached to an isometric force transducer. Treatment of cells with nocodazole, an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, stimulated an isometric contraction that reached its peak level within 30 min and was typically 30 - 45 % of the force increase following maximal stimulation with 30 % fetal bovine serum. The contraction following nocodazole treatment {{was associated with a}} 2 - to 4 -fold increase in LC 20 phosphorylation. The increases in both force and LC 20 phosphorylation, after addition of nocodazole, could be blocked or reversed by stabilizing the microtubules with paclitaxel (former generic name, taxol). Increasing force and LC 20 phosphorylation by pretreatment with fetal bovine serum decreased the subsequent additional contraction upon microtubule disruption, a finding that appears inconsistent with a load-shifting mechanism. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of LC 20 is a common mechanism for the contractions stimulated both by microtubule poisons and receptor-mediated agonists. The modulation of myosin activity by alterations in microtubule assembly may coordinate the physiological functions of these cytoskeletal components...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn-stent neoatherosclerosis is {{characterized}} by the delayed appearance of markers of atheroma in the subintima, but the pathophysiology underlying this new disease entity remains unclear. Methods and resultsWe collected 20 human coronary artery stents by removal from explanted hearts. The mean duration of stent implantation was 34 months. In all samples, neoatherosclerosis was detected, particularly in peristrut areas. It consisted of foam cells and cholesterol clefts, with or without calcification, associated with neovascularization. Iron and glycophorin-A were present in peristrut areas, as well as autofluorescent ceroids. Moreover, in response to neoatherosclerosis, tertiary lymphoid organs (tissue lymphoid clusters) often developed in the adventitia. Some of these features could be reproduced in an experimental carotid stenting model in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet. Foam cells were present in all samples, and peristrut red blood cells (RBCs) were also detected, as shown by iron deposits and Bandeiraea simplicifiola isolectin-B 4 staining of RBC membranes. Finally, in silico models were used to evaluate the compliance mismatch between the <b>rigid</b> <b>struts</b> and the distensible arterial wall using finite element analysis. They show that stenting approximately doubles the local von Mises stress in the intimal layer. ConclusionsWe show here that stent implantation both in human and in rabbit arteries {{is characterized}} by local peristrut microhemorrhages and finally by both cholesterol accumulation and oxidation, triggering together in-stent neoatherosclerosis. Our data indicate that these processes are likely initiated by an increased mechanical stress due to the compliance mismatch between the rigid stent and the soft wall...|$|R

A baseline geometric model was developed, with ADLPIPE computer code, Version 2 ElA, 1984. Several seismic analyses were performed by iteration with the maximum number of snubbers reduced to obtain a support configuration having acceptable anchor and support loads as well as acceptable piping stresses. A thermal analysis was performed at an operating temperature of 965 {degrees}F (518 {degrees}C) to qualify the piping system following the replacement of some seismic snubbers with rigid supports. A series of displacements from flow- or pump-induced vibration were measured. These vibrations, on the order of tens of seconds or minutes apart, were not continuous and steady, but rather of a series of forced displacements that rapidly damped out to zero. A scoping evaluation of the effect of the vibration found that the calculated stress is within limits. Results of the stress analysis of the piping with snubber reduction are qualified in accordance with ASME, Section III, Class 1, requirements. Nearly 67 % of the snubbers in loop 1 of the SHL piping system may be eliminated or replaced with <b>rigid</b> <b>struts</b> at the same location and orientation. The effects of inelastic strain accumulation, creep-fatigue damage and interaction, and elastic follow-up are evaluated by comparison to the results of inelastic analysis.

40|$|In {{the actual}} state of SHAM test {{analysis}} the key {{results can be}} summarized as follows: - the design of all configurations proved to be conservative, since all stesses were limited to the allowable values. Forces in supports were partly under- and partly overestimated. - The piping system could be exposed to at least 300 % of the design loads in 5 different support configurations. The HDR-configuration which was not designed for seismic loads withstood a 200 % SSE load without any damage or global residual deformation. - The Energy Absorbers behaved in all aspects as expected. The replacement of 6 snubbers by only 3 Energy Absorbers was sufficient to keep pipe stresses within the limits. - The replacement of all snubbers by Seismic Stops kept the pipe stresses within the allowable limits. - The stiff NRC-configuration was tested up to 8 times the design loads. In the 600 % SSE test 3 snubbers failed. They were not replaced for the 800 % SSE tests, during which another snubber failed from o verloading. Nevertheless, the pipe was not damaged and showed no global plastic deformation. - The flexible support configuration designed by Siemens/KWU could be exposed to 8 times the design loads without any problems. - In the highest stressed points of the pipe strain ranges of 1. 5 % were measured and residual strains accumulated to 1. 2 %. - Seismic margins of <b>rigid</b> <b>struts</b> are clearly greater than the expected factor of 3 to 4.

40|$|The study {{toward the}} design of a {{magnetostrictive}} generator for vibration-to-electrical energy conversion in helicopter is presented in this report. Terfenol-D, a giant magnetostrictive material is used. A brief overview of magnetostriction including Terfenol-D properties is given. The generator uses vibrations as input. These vibrations are studied for different possible locations in helicopter. The main and tail rotors are the principal origins of vibrations in a helicopter. Currently, lead-lag dampers are used between the rotor and the rotor blades to damp vibrations. The proposal is to replace these dampers by a magnetostrictive generator to damp and produce electrical power simultaneously. The third location studied is between the pylon and the airframe. The generator could be put between the gearbox and the airframe instead of the existing <b>rigid</b> <b>struts.</b> Forces, amplitudes, vibration frequencies and mechanical power have been evaluated at each location. This study reveals that a damping system is always necessary in order to preserve the active material (Terfenol-D rod) of the transducer. The damping system adapts the input vibration level to the Terfenol-D rod properties. In all three locations the force and strain amplitude have to be adjusted. Thereafter an energy analysis is utilized to select the best location. Maximizing the mechanical power absorbed by the Terfenol-D, the magnetostrictive generator will produce the highest electrical power. It was demonstrated that the location between the pylon and the airframe is the best with respect to available mechanical power to be transformed to the electrical power. Finally, the Terfenol-D is considered as a tunable passive vibration absorber. In this case, the priority is to absorb all the vibration and not maximize the electrical power...|$|R
40|$|Matthews, an {{industrial}} designer and medical engineer, led the RCA’s workpackage in a multidisciplinary research project {{to develop a}} new neck brace to improve safety and comfort for people with spinal injuries. He worked in partnership with clinicians from the University of the West of England, the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, the Great Western Ambulance Service, and the Bath Institute for Medical Engineering, under the National Institute for Health Research’s i 4 i programme. If it is suspected that an individual has fractured a neck vertebra in a fall or accident, ambulance staff fit a cervical collar to immobilise the neck in order to avoid further injury. Current solutions can be ineffective at limiting head movement; they may also increase blood pressure in the head by restricting the return of blood to the body. Matthews studied the complete patient journey, analysing the anatomy of the upper chest, neck and head, and the way that existing collars are used. The evidence collected formed the basis of a brief for the design and development of a better neck brace. Based on the principle of creating a band around the crown of the patient’s head and supporting it through <b>rigid</b> <b>struts</b> bearing on the chest and shoulders, a number of basic prototype structures were made and tested. The resulting patented low-cost ‘Kensington Collar’ has a front frame, adjustable for height and width, that attaches to a rear support, providing better neck immobilisation, unimpeded return blood flow, greater patient comfort, easy fitting for the clinician and clear access for examinations and x-ray imaging.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of living cells are commonly {{described in terms}} of the laws of continuum mechanics. The purpose of this report is to consider the implications of an alternative approach that emphasizes the discrete nature of stress bearing elements in the cell and is based on the known structural {{properties of}} the cytoskeleton. We have noted previously that tensegrity architecture seems to capture essential qualitative features of cytoskeletal shape distortion in adherent cells (Ingber, 1993 a; Wang et al., 1993). Here we extend those qualitative notions into a formal microstructural analysis. On the basis of that analysis we attempt to identify unifying principles that might underlie the shape stability of the cytoskeleton. For simplicity, we focus on a tensegrity structure containing six <b>rigid</b> <b>struts</b> interconnected by 24 linearly elastic cables. Cables carry initial tension ("prestress") counterbalanced by compression of struts. Two cases of interconnectedness between cables and struts are considered: one where they are connected by pin-joints, and the other where the cables run through frictionless loops at the junctions. At the molecular level, the pinned structure may represent the case in which different cytoskeletal filaments are cross-linked whereas the looped structure represents the case where they are free to slip past one another. The system is then subjected to uniaxial stretching. Using the principal of virtual work, stretching force vs. extension and structural stiffness vs. stretching force relationships are calculated for different prestresses. The stiffness is found to increase with increasing prestress and, at a given prestress, to increase approximately linearly with increasing stretching force. This behavior is consistent with observations in living endothelial cells exposed to shear stresses (Wang & Ingber, 1994). At a given prestress, the pinned structure is found to be stiffer than the looped one, a result consistent with data on mechanical behavior of isolated, cross-linked and uncross-linked actin networks (Wachsstock et al., 1993). On the basis of our analysis we concluded that architecture and the prestress of the cytoskeleton might be key features that underlie a cell's ability to regulate its shape...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{analytic}} method {{based on}} finite-element method (FEM) for the rolling gaits of tensegrity robots. By analyzing forces during the rolling motions, the following {{problems can be}} solved. First, {{the relation between the}} actuator combinations (AC) and the rolling directions is discovered for controlling the rolling motions. Second, the influence of the driving parameters on the deformations is found out for obtaining the optimized control strategy. Third, the influence of the material parameters on the rolling motions is achieved as guidance to design physical robots. Tensegrity robots were proposed as novel mobile robots based on tensegrity structures that consist of discrete <b>rigid</b> <b>struts</b> and continuous elastic cables. The tensegrity structures process the shock resistance ability and high deformation capacity, and can be used to build lightweight mobile robots. The tensegrity robots can generate multiple gaits and multiple deformations. Rolling gaits are more stable than jumping and more efficient than crawling. Aiming at rolling gaits, to solve the three problems mentioned earlier, force analysis is required. The internal forces of the tensegrity structures always keep balance to maintain the shape of the structures, however, as the structures are highly coupled, the variation of one force will change the rest of the forces and generates feedback effects to this force. As the number of the forces increase with the growing number of struts, the force analysis becomes more and more complicated. The existing exhaustive experimental method can obtain the relation between the AC and the rolling directions through massive experiments, but this method cannot tell the influence of the driving parameters on the deformations and the experiment results based on certain robots are not suitable for other robots without analyzing the influence of the material parameters. In this paper, an analytic method based on FEM is introduced. A six-strut tensegrity model is used as an example to test the feasibility of the method. Experiments on a physical robot are performed to verify the reliability of the computation results...|$|R

2500|$|The first glider to {{be named}} the Hols der Teufel was the {{influential}} Djävaler Anamma, designed by Alexander Lippisch in 1923. The name {{was associated with the}} cursing of two Swedish students in the Wasserkuppe workshops whose favourite phrase it was. [...] It translates into German as Hols der Teufel. Its key structural feature was an A-frame which carried wire braced wings and linked to a flat girder rear fuselage. [...] It later evolved through the Schneider Grunau 9 into the very popular Zögling, which avoided the controversial [...] "skullsplitter" [...] forward member of the A-frame with a vertical strut behind the pilot, and was related to the secondary RRG Prüfling glider that replaced wire bracing with <b>rigid</b> lift <b>struts.</b> [...] The Hols der Teufel of 1928, designed by Lippisch and Hans Jacobs, possibly with the assistance of Alexander Schleicher had the Zögling girder frame and the strut braced wings, making it very different from its ancestral namesake.|$|R
40|$|Porous SiC {{samples were}} {{prepared}} with {{three types of}} wood (poplar, pine, big cone pine) by simply embedding the wood char-coal in a powder mixture of Si and SiO 2 at 1600 and 1700 o C. The basic engineering properties such as density, porosity, pore size and distribution, and strength were characterized. The samples showed full conversion to mostly β-SiC with good retention of the cellular structure of the original wood. More <b>rigid</b> SiC <b>struts</b> were developed for 1700 o C. They showed similar bulk density (0. 5 ~ 0. 6 g/cm 3) and porosity (81 ~ 84 %) irrespective {{of the type of}} wood. The poplar sample showed three pore sizes (1, 8, 60 µm) with a main size of 60 µm. The pine sample showed a single pore size (20 µm). The big cone pine sample showed two pore sizes (10, 80 µm) with a main size of 10 µm. The bend strength was 2. 5 MPa for poplar, 5. 7 MPa for pine, 2. 8 MPa for big cone pine, indi-cating higher strength with pine...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{have been carried}} out {{to examine the effects of}} triplestarting helical grooves on the drag of fixed circular cylinders and the vortex-induced vibration of elastically supported cylinders. For the elastically supported cylinder, the Reynolds number varied from 1. 3 x 104 to 4. 6 x 104, whilst for the fixed cylinder from 3. 1 x 104 to 3. 75 x 105. A comparative approach which allows direct comparisons of the results was adopted where two cylinders of identical dimensions and physical properties with or without helical surface grooves were tested in exactly same experimental set-ups. In the elastically supported cylinder tests, the cylinders were attached to a vertically cantilevered supporting rod and towed in a towing tank. Both the in-line and cross-flow vibrations were permitted. In the fixed cylinder tests, the cylinders were supported on <b>rigid</b> vertical <b>struts</b> and towed horizontally in the same towing tank. It is found that for the case investigated the helical grooves were effective in suppressing the vortex-induced cross-flow vibration amplitudes with the peak amplitude reduced by 64 %. Drag reductions of up to 25 % were also achieved in the sub-critical Reynolds number range tested in the study for the fixed cylinders...|$|R
40|$|Described is a {{foldable}} expandable pallet for Space Station interface attachments {{with a basic}} square configuration. Each pallet {{consists of}} a series of struts joined together by node point fittings to make a <b>rigid</b> structure. The <b>struts</b> have hinge fittings which are spring loaded to permit collapse of the module for stowage transport to a Space Station in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle, and development on orbit. Dimensions of the pallet are selected to provide convenient, closely spaced attachment points between the node points of the relatively widely spaced trusses of a Space Station platform. A pallet is attached to a strut at four points: one close fitting hole, two oversize holes, and a slot to allow for thermal expansion/contraction and for manufacturing tolerances. Applications of the pallet include its use in rotary or angular joints; servicing of splints; with gridded plates; as instrument mounting bases; and as a roadbed for a Mobile Service Center (MSC) ...|$|R
