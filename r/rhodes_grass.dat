5|$|While a small {{minority}} of cockroaches are associated with human habitats and viewed as repugnant by many people, a few species are of conservation concern. The Lord Howe Island wood-feeding cockroach (Panesthia lata) is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Scientific Committee, but the cockroach may be extinct on Lord Howe Island itself. The introduction of rats, the spread of <b>Rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> (Chloris gayana) and fires are possible reasons for their scarcity. Two species are currently listed as endangered and critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, Delosia ornata and Nocticola gerlachi. Both cockroaches have a restricted distribution and are threatened by habitat loss and rising sea levels. Only 600 Delosia ornata adults and 300 nymphs are known to exist, and these are threatened by a hotel development. No action has been taken to save the two cockroach species, but protecting their natural habitats may prevent their extinction. In the former Soviet Union, cockroach populations have been declining at an alarming rate; this may be exaggerated, or the phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic. One species of roach, Simandoa conserfariam is considered extinct in the wild.|$|E

40|$|Management of {{metabolic}} hydrogen ([H]) in the rumen {{has been}} identified as an important consideration when reducing ruminant CH 4 emissions. However, little is known about hydrogen flux and microbial rumen population responses to CH 4 inhibition when animals are fed with slowly degradable diets. The effects of the anti-methanogenic compound, chloroform, on rumen fermentation, microbial ecology and H 2 /CH 4 production were investigated in vivo. Eight rumen fistulated Brahman steers were fed a roughage hay diet (<b>Rhode</b> <b>grass</b> hay) or roughage hay:concentrate diet (60 : 40) with increasing levels (low, mid and high) of chloroform in a cylcodextrin matrix. The increasing levels of chloroform resulted in an increase in H 2 expelled as CH 4 production decreased with no effect on dry matter intakes. The amount of expelled H 2 per mole of decreased methane, was lower for the hay diet suggesting a more efficient redirection of hydrogen into other microbial products compared with hay:concentrate diet. A shift in rumen fermentation towards propionate and branched-chain fatty acids was observed for both diets. Animals fed with the hay:concentrate diet had both higher formate concentration and H 2 expelled than those fed only roughage hay. Metabolomic analyses revealed an increase in the concentration of amino acids, organic and nucleic acids in the fluid phase for both diets when methanogenesis was inhibited. These changes in the rumen metabolism were accompanied by a shift in the microbiota with an increase in Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio and a decrease in Archaea and Synergistetes for both diets. Within the Bacteroidetes family, some OTUs assigned to Prevotella were promoted under choloroform treatment. These bacteria may be partly responsible for the increase in amino acids and propionate in the rumen. No significant changes were observed for abundance of fibrolytic bacteria, protozoa and fungi, which suggests that fibre degradation was not impaired. The observed 30 % decrease in methanogenesis did not adversely affect rumen metabolism and the rumen microbiota was able to adapt and redirect [H] into other microbial end-products for both diets. However, it is also required dietary supplements or microbial treatments to capture the additional H 2 expelled by the animal to further improve rumen digestive efficiency...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, soybean (Glycine max (L.)

Field studies were conducted over 2 years at the University of Queensland farm, Gatton, Australia, to assess the effect of row spacing and seeding rate on the competitiveness of soybeans with a model weed, <b>Rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> (Chloris gayana Kunth). The experiment was conducted in a split-split plot design, replicated three times. Main plots comprised two seeding rates (40 and 80 kg ha- 1), subplots two row spacings (25 and 75 cm), and sub-subplots four <b>Rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> infestation periods (weedy from planting to maturity, weedy from 3 weeks after planting (WAP) to maturity, weedy from 6 WAP to maturity, and weed-free from planting to maturity). The results showed that seed rate did not influence <b>Rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> biomass or soybean yield. Soybean yield was greater and <b>Rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> biomass was less in the 25 -cm rows than the 75 -cm rows. For the 25 -cm rows, <b>Rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> biomass in the plots infested beyond 3 WAP was 81 - 89 % less than in the season-long weedy plots, whereas for the wider row crop, this reduction was only 60 - 75 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT 	This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess the intake and digestibility of low quality <b>rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> (Chloris gayana) hay cv. Callide offered to sheep. Four rumen fistulated sheep were assigned to four dietary treatments with 21 days for each period namely, <b>rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> hay was fed alone ad lib. (treatment 1), <b>rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> hay was supplemented with 200 g/d oven-dried leucaena (treatment 2), <b>rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> hay was supplemented with 200 g/d leucaena plus 8 g/d urea (treatment 3) and <b>rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> hay was suplemented with 200 g/d leucaena plus 150 g/d sucrose (treatment 4). This experiment used a latin square design and variables measured were dry matter, organic matter intake and digestibilities of OM, NDF and N by the method of total collection, N balance, ruminal parameters such as rumen pH and ammonia, and rumen microbial protein synthesis. Differences between means were analysed by the General Linear Model procedure of the Statistical Analysis System. The results showed that although leucaena supplementation increased total DM intake total OM and digestible OM intake did not change. Supplementation increased ammonia-N concentration, N balance and efficiency of microbial N synthesis, especially with urea (P< 0. 05). It can be concluded that leucaena supplementation of 16 % of DMI may need additional N source such as urea for better microbial N synthesis, however the need for ruminally fermentable organic matter may not be required unless rumen ammonia-N is not limiting...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} growing stages of <b>Rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> (17, 27, 40, 54, 79 and 108 days of regrowth) on ingestive behaviour of grazing goats, an experiment measuring chemical composition and in vitro organic matter digestibility of harvested and unharvested parts of the herbage was conducted using two oesophageal fistulated female goats. Organic matter intake per bite (OMI/TB) and digestible organic matter intake per bite (DOMI/TB) by the goats was also estimated. In addition the relation between organic matter intake per harvesting bite (OMI/HB) and mastication bites per harvesting bite (MB/HB) was discussed. The results obtained were as follows: 1. Grazing goats tended to harvest the part of higher crude protein content and lower cell wall constituents of <b>Rhodes</b> <b>grass,</b> and also tended to harvest the part of higher organic matter digestibility of the herbage. 2. Until 54 days of regrowth (booting stage) OMI/TB and DOMI/TB increased and showed maximum value of 0. 025 g and 0. 017 g respectively, and decreased afterwards. 3. Concerning OMI/HB, it markedly increased until 54 days of regrowth and gradually decreased afterwards. Though MB/HB tended to increase until 79 days of regrowth (heading stage), it showed little change between 79 and 108 days of regrowth. The authors suggested that these results were mainly caused by the progress of lignification in <b>Rhodes</b> <b>grass.</b> From {{the results of this}} experiment, grazing goats tended to show selective grazing on <b>Rhodes</b> <b>grass</b> pasture and their ingestive behaviour was affected by growing stages of the herbage. 放牧山羊の採食行動に及ぼすローズグラス生育段階(再生 17, 27, 40, 54, 79 及び 108 日日) の影響について,食道フィステル装着山羊 2 頭を用い,採食部と残食部の化学成分及びin vitro有機物消化率,ひと噛み当たりの有機物摂取量(organic matter intake per bite,OMI/TB) 及びひと噛み当たりの可消化有機物摂取量(digestible organic matter intake per bite,DOMI/TB) を指標として追究するとともに,ひと噛み取り当たりの有機物摂取量(organic matter intake per harvesting bite,OMI/HB) 及びひと噛み取り当たりの咀しゃく数(mastication bites per harvesting bite,MB/HB) との関連についても検討を加えた. 得られた結果は次のとおりである. 1. 供試ローズグラス採食部の粗蛋白質含量及びin vitro有機物消化率は残食部のそれらと比べ高い値を示したが,採食部の細胞壁構成成分含量は残食部のそれと比べ低い値を示した. 2.

OMI/HBは再生 54 日目まで顕著に増加し,以後若干低下した. しかし,MB/HBは生育の後期において変化が認められなかった. このことについては供試草の採食部リグニン含量の増加が茎葉の硬化に影響を及ぼしたものと考えられる. 以上の結果から,放牧山羊は供試革を選択採食するとともに,ローズグラスの生育段階によって放牧山羊の採食行動は影響を受けることが認められた...|$|E
30|$|Firstly a dynamic, {{stochastic}} {{simulation model}} of a <b>Rhodes</b> <b>Grass</b> farming was developed to evaluate the economics of investments in desert farming and economic sustainability. The model was designed to characterize agriculture parameters and economical complexities of a <b>Rhodes</b> <b>Grass</b> farming within a partial budgeting framework by examining the cost and benefit streams for ten years coinciding with investment in desert farming and high risk areas. The second aim {{of the study was}} to develop the model to test the effect of underground water recharge on NPV at new locations at Hanfeet and Dawkah compared to basic model at Salalah. The @Risk 5.7 (Student Version for Academic Use) from (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, New York) add-in for Excel was utilized to account for the stochastic nature of key variables in the Monte Carlo simulation model.|$|E
