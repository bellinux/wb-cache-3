In practice, however, it is possible to notice expressions like "state support" or "state aid", which are equivalents for the Czech term "public support". I explore the given concept in the international law, European and Czech legislations. Subsequently, I compare it with the laws of Poland and the Slovak Republic. The crucial part of the doctoral thesis focuses on <b>investment</b> <b>aids</b> aimed at the tool of discounts on income taxes, which is evaluated both from the perspective of legal theory and practice. Finally, I scrutinize the case law of the European and Czech courts, which represent the basis, and there is also a comparison with the historical development of the evaluation criteria for compatibility of state aids.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the effects of <b>regional</b> <b>investment</b> {{incentives}} - a main component of regional policy in West Germany - on <b>regional</b> factor demand (<b>investment</b> and labor), growth and convergence of per capita income for the period 1978 to 1989. Demand for investment and labor arise from a model of cost minimization at given output with a putty-clay production function. The production function allows for regional technical efficiency. To model the output effect on factor demand an auxiliary output function is specified. In estimating the functions attention is given to the short-run dynamics and the long-run behaviour of factor demand by error-correction models. The empirical long-run relationships are then used to simulate the effects of <b>regional</b> <b>investment</b> incentives. In contrast to most studies for other countries the empirical results provide evidence that regional policy in Germany induces not only additional investment but also creates positive employment effects. However, the effects of <b>regional</b> <b>investment</b> incentives on growth and convergence of labor productivity are negligible. ...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the sources of funding of <b>regional</b> <b>{{investments}}.</b> Financing the investments by own resources is very difficult and maybe even impossible.

The results of the analysis shows that proportion of European subsidies on capital expenditure is significantly different between regions. The amount of share is between 23 - 99 %. European subsidies are mainly used for large investments, especially in investments in transport infrastructure. Regions usually utilize subsidies only from the regional operational programs.

40|$|This study updates earlier {{estimates}} of the sensitivity of <b>regional</b> <b>investment</b> flows in the Philippines to fiscal incentives - income tax holidays and other fiscal inducements provided by government. All other factors held constant, the strength and significance of the investment-inducing effect of a given set of incentives can be gleaned from the size and significance of proxies used for incentives in investment regression equations. Using regional data, the regressions confirm that proxy variables for incentives are not good predictors for <b>regional</b> <b>investment</b> in the Philippines. The results reinforce previous empirical findings that, consistent with international evidence {{on the power of}} incentives, the power of incentives to influence patterns of <b>regional</b> <b>investment</b> within the Philippines is also weak. This reinforces the policy implications of Reside's (2006) paper - rather than waste resources providing ineffective investment subsidies, each region in the country {{would be better off if}} the Philippine government streamlined fiscal incentives, raised a sufficient amount of taxes and then procured the productivity-enhancing public goods (access to good. education and infrastructure) that really mattered more for investment and investors...|$|R

The way the scheme was implemented, exemplifies the subventionist logic of income assistance, and underlines some standing characteristics in Greek agricultural policy.

40|$|Spending on {{productive}} {{infrastructure is}} seen as an important contributor to long term economic growth. Several authors have documented a downward trend in public investment during the last three decades and warned about its possible detrimental effects on the economy. A not well-realized fact is that productive infrastructure investment is mostly provided by sub-national governments. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the effect of revenue decentralization on the provision of infrastructure at the sub-national level. We estimate the effects of revenue decentralization and earmarked grant financing on the level of sub-national infrastructure investment in 20 European countries over the period 1990 - 2009. The findings are compared to those obtained when using sub-national investment in redistribution, for which the theory predictions are different. To account for the high auto-correlation in the dependent variable, we apply a dynamic panel data approach. In particular, we use a Corrected Least Squares Dummy Variable (LSDVC) estimator with the lagged dependent variable included to account for the dynamic character of the dependent variable. The empirical analysis shows that decentralisation in terms of tax shares increases public investment in infrastructure; public investment in redistribution is not significantly affected by decentralisation. The positive link between total <b>regional</b> <b>investment</b> and decentralisation suggests that decentralisation on <b>regional</b> infrastructure <b>investment</b> is additional and does not go hand in hand with a considerable reduction in other types of <b>regional</b> <b>investment,</b> such as health, education or safety. As to investment grants, they have a positive impact on both types of <b>regional</b> <b>investment.</b> The negative interaction between investment grants and decentralisation for <b>regional</b> infrastructure <b>investment</b> suggest that the impact of tax decentralisation on <b>regional</b> infrastructure <b>investment</b> declines with increasing receipts of <b>investment</b> grants by <b>regional</b> governments. This result is intuitive. As the significance of the tax-decentralisation parameter suggests, higher regional decision autonomy leads to more investment in infrastructure. Attempts to undermine the power of regions through the backdoor - e. g. by introducing conditional transfers - will at least partly offset the positive effect of decentralisation...|$|R
