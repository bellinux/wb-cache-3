25|$|Areas {{affected}} were Park Street, Beck Isle, Bridge Street, Potter Hill, The <b>Ropery,</b> Hungate, Vivis Walk and Undercliff. Flooding in 2006 caused {{extensive damage}} to {{properties in the}} Market Place {{as well as the}} above areas.|$|E
25|$|Pile's {{mother and}} or father {{apparently}} did not appreciate his shipbuilding disposition and preferred him {{to work in a}} <b>ropery.</b> This employment however did not last long, as he ended his engagement by running away from it after six weeks. His family must have relented as it is recorded that he served his time as a shipwright with his father.|$|E
25|$|Maritime {{activities}} include a popular yacht club and {{a rapidly growing}} Gig boat club with three boats., which now competes in the world championships. Most Mondays and Thursdays the local Ilfracombe Sea Cadets meet near the harbour, in what was the old rope making factory on <b>Ropery</b> Road. There is also a kayak and canoeing club and a large sub-aqua club.|$|E
50|$|In 1887, the town's {{businesses}} were {{listed as a}} marine engine, chain cable and anchor manufacturer, shipbuilding yards, <b>roperies,</b> salt-works, and an earthenware and stained glass manufacturer. Fishing was also a major employer. The Smiths Dock Company was another major employer for many years, eventually closing in 1987.|$|R
50|$|Ropes {{were made}} in fields but ropemakers bought or rented thin long strips of land. It was the sale of these thin strips, one by one at {{different}} times, that led to long thin streets with few interconnections. The streets themselves were not used in manufacture, the <b>roperies</b> pre-dated the streets.|$|R
50|$|Royal Dockyards were {{generally}} established close to harbours or anchorages where Royal Navy ships were based. In {{addition to their}} docks and slips they had various specialist buildings on site: storehouses, woodworking sheds, metal shops and forges, <b>roperies,</b> pumping stations (for emptying the dry docks), administration blocks and accommodation for the resident officers.|$|R
25|$|Pickering {{station has}} been its {{terminus}} since 1965 when the Malton-Pickering route connecting to the York to Scarborough main line was closed. Before the station became a terminus, the double-track railway took up the space now occupied by The <b>Ropery</b> (a road) and the car park to the east. Trains run daily from mid-March to early November and on selected dates through the winter. Trains are mostly steam-hauled; however in some cases heritage diesel engine is used. At {{the height of the}} running timetable, trains depart hourly from each station. During the summer months, steam services extend to the seaside town of Whitby. Passenger numbers have topped 350,000 in recent years.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy Dockyard was {{initially}} located around Dockyard Creek, and occupied {{several of the}} dockyard buildings formerly used by the Knights of Malta. By 1850 the facilities included storehouses, a <b>ropery,</b> a small steam factory, victualling facilities, houses for the officers of the Yard, and most notably a dry dock – {{the first to be}} provided for a Royal Dockyard outside Britain. Begun in 1844, the dry dock was opened in 1847; ten years later it was extended to form a double dock (No. 1 and No. 2 dock). Allegedly, marble blocks from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, were used for the construction of these docks.|$|E
500|$|Industries {{associated}} with the sea developed throughout the East End, including rope making and shipbuilding. The former location of roperies can still be identified from their long straight, narrow profile in the modern streets, for instance <b>Ropery</b> Street near Mile End. Shipbuilding was important from the time when Henry VIII caused ships to be built at Rotherhithe {{as a part of}} his expansion of the Royal Navy. On 31 January 1858, the largest ship of that time, the SS Great Eastern, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was launched from the yard of Messrs Scott Russell & Co, of Millwall. The [...] vessel was too long to fit across the river, and so the ship had to be launched sideways. Due to the technical difficulties of the launch, after this, shipbuilding on the Thames went into a long decline. Ships continued to be built at the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company at Blackwall and Canning Town until the yard closed in 1913, shortly after the launch of the Dreadnought Battleship HMS Thunderer (1911).|$|E
50|$|Woollen {{manufacture}} {{was formerly}} the chief industry, {{and there was}} some silk weaving, but since the 1770s cotton manufacture superseded wool as the principal business, with associated minor trades—size works, slipper works, dye works, foundries, reed and heald manufactories, <b>roperies,</b> saw-mills and cornmills. Stone was also extensively quarried in the vicinity, as well as there being small collieries.|$|R
50|$|Merchants {{that worked}} on the docks needed houses close by. Therefore, houses were {{constructed}} in Hanover Street first, followed by Duke Street and then Bold Street. The fields {{that were in the}} area earlier were also developed quickly into houses. Although there had been port-related industrial activity in the area, with <b>roperies</b> occupying the site of what is now Bold Street to supply the sailing ships, this intensified along with a demand for residential properties so that the merchants could be located close to their business interests.|$|R
25|$|In 1669, Thomas Neale {{became a}} local landowner, buying some land {{reclaimed}} from the river, and gained Shadwell parish status. In addition, Neale built 289 homes, a mill, and a market, and also established a waterworks on large ponds, {{left by the}} draining of the marsh. The area had been virtually uninhabited and he developed the waterfront, with houses behind as a speculation., {{and in doing so}} provided fresh water for Shadwell and Wapping. Shadwell became a maritime hamlet with <b>roperies,</b> tanneries, breweries, wharves, smiths, and numerous taverns, built around the chapel of St Paul's. Seventy-five sea captains are buried in its churchyard; Captain James Cook had his son baptised there. Shadwell's new houses were built in an orderly fashion, so that the streets ran between Ratcliff Highway and Wapping Wall. In 1674, Shadwell had a population of around 8,000. The prosperity in this period has been linked to the road connections into London, which were maintained by wealthy taxpayers from Middlesex, Essex, Kent and Surrey.|$|R
2500|$|John Wesley, {{the founder}} of Methodism, preached in Gainsborough several times between 1759 and 1790. The town's first Methodist chapel opened in Church Lane in 1788, moving to a new site in North Street in 1804 (and rebuilt there as St Stephen's in 1966). The Primitive Methodists became {{established}} in the town in 1819, with chapels in Spring Gardens (1838), Trinity Street (1877) and <b>Ropery</b> Road (1910). [...] St Thomas' Church in Cross Street caters for the town's Roman Catholics.|$|E
2500|$|Gainsborough has {{a long-standing}} history of industry. [...] The town was the {{manufacturing}} base of Marshall, Sons & Co., a major boiler manufacturer founded by William Marshall in 1848. William Marshall died in 1861 (and {{was buried in}} the cemetery on <b>Ropery</b> Road). His business became one of the new joint stock companies run by his sons James and Henry. The company occupied Britannia Ironworks, a 16-acre site and the biggest in Europe when built. From Marshall’s Works steam engines went all over the world until it closed in the 1980s.|$|E

His brother Alan Mustard plays for Chester le Street CC at <b>Ropery</b> Lane and helped the side win the 45 over National Knock out competition in 2009 defeating Spencer CC from london in the final at The County Ground in Derby.|$|E
50|$|The Ropewalks site {{comprises}} the south western {{component of the}} Duke Street conservation area, {{as well as two}} warehouses on College Lane and Bluecoat Chambers on School lane. The location {{was one of the first}} areas in the city to develop when Liverpool was an emerging port, with Bluecoat Chambers being the oldest surviving building in Liverpool city centre, dating back to 1715. Its proximity to the Old Dock, the world's first enclosed wet dock, meant it was the location of the city's first property speculators who built both warehousing and residential premises along Duke St, Hannover St, and Bold St. The area soon developed a cosmopolitan feel being home to various types of people including sea captains, merchants, traders and artisans. Today the area is known as Ropewalks, a reference to the large number of <b>roperies</b> present in the area when Liverpool was one of the busiest ports in the world during the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|R
