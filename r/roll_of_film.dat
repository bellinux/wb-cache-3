5|$|Regarding {{the aerial}} imagery that the U.S. report said {{suggested}} a lower death toll, the South Korean investigators, drawing on accounts from survivors and area residents, {{said that at}} least 62 bodies had been taken away by relatives, or buried in soldiers' abandoned foxholes, {{in the first days}} after the killings, and others remained inside one underpass tunnel, under thin layers of dirt, out of sight of airborne cameras, and awaiting later burial in mass graves. In addition, South Korean military specialists questioned the U.S. reconnaissance photos, pointing out irregularities, including the fact that the No Gun Ri frames had been spliced into the <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>film,</b> raising the possibility that they were not, as claimed, from August 6, 1950, eight days after the killings.|$|E

Trout compares {{the potential impact of}} the photos to the Profumo affair.On his way to sell the images, he loses the <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> whilst arguing at a phone box with the Meldrews and subsequently pursues them across the Algarve to retrieve it. He suffers a number of disasters both related and unrelated to Victor and Margaret's own misfortunes, only to find that the film had actually fallen into the lining of his jacket and had been with him for much of his journey. He lost it in the door of the Meldrews' car. Retrieving the roll after a brief spell in hospital, Trout attempts to leave the Algarve in a taxi but is involved in a car crash.|$|E

500|$|On May 26, 1989, Joan [...] "Jo" [...] Rogers, 36, and her daughtersMichelle, 17, and Christe, 14 {{left their}} family dairy farm in Willshire, Ohio, for a {{vacation}} in Florida. They had never before left their home state. Authorities believe that the women became lost on June 1, during the return drive from Orlando to Willshire, and had decided to take an extra vacation day in Tampa. While looking for their hotel they encountered Chandler, who gave them directions, and offered to meet them again later to take them on a sunset cruise of Tampa Bay. The Rogers women had left Orlando around 9:00a.m. and checked into the Days Inn on Route 60 at 12:30p.m. Photographs, developed from a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> in a camera found in Rogers' hotel room, showed Michelle sitting on the floor; the last photo was a shot taken from the hotel balcony showing the sunset beginning over Tampa Bay, confirming the women were alive, and had not left their hotel room as the sunset began. They were last seen alive at the hotel restaurant around 7:30p.m. It is believed they boarded Chandler's boat by the dock on the Courtney Campbell Causeway (part of Route 60) between 8:30p.m. and 9:00p.m., {{and that they were}} dead by 3a.m. Chandler may have used {{the fact that he was}} born in Ohio to lure them into feeling a connection to him. Chandler knew the women were not from Florida because he saw the Ohio license plates on their car.|$|E
2500|$|Charlie Cole, {{working for}} Newsweek {{and on the}} same balcony as Stuart Franklin, hid his <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> {{containing}} Tank Man in a Beijing Hotel toilet, sacrificing an unused <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> and undeveloped images of wounded protesters after the PSB raided his room, destroyed the two aforementioned rolls of film and forced him to sign a confession to photography during martial law, an imprisonable offence. Cole was able to retrieve the roll and have it sent to Newsweek. He was awarded the 1990 World Press Photo of the Year and the picture was featured in Life [...] "100 Photographs That Changed the World" [...] in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Next, Gimlin and Patterson {{rounded up}} Patterson's horses, which {{had run off}} in the {{opposite}} direction, downstream, before the filming began. Patterson got his second <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> from his saddlebag and filmed the tracks. Then the men tracked [...] "Patty" [...] for either one mile or three miles (5km), but [...] "lost it in the heavy undergrowth". They went to their campsite three miles south, picked up plaster, returned to the initial site, measured the creature's step-length, and made two plaster casts, one each of the best-quality right and left prints.|$|E

2500|$|The cover artwork {{features}} a blurred {{drawing of a}} bear's head against an orange background. The cover concept originated when Stipe showed cover artist Chris Bilheimer a balloon he wanted {{to serve as the}} album cover, and told him to [...] "play around with". Bilheimer changed the color of the balloon, which was originally green. He also had to re-photograph the bear head. When he was down to the last few frames on a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>film,</b> he took a few photos without bothering to focus the shots, which he and Stipe ended up liking the best.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982 Cattrall played P.E. teacher Miss Honeywell in Porky's, {{followed}} {{two years}} later by {{a role in the}} original Police Academy. In 1985 she starred in three films: Turk 182, City Limits and Hold-Up, the last with French star Jean-Paul Belmondo. In 1986, she played Kurt Russell's brainy flame in the action film Big Trouble in Little China. In 1987, her lead role in Mannequin proved a huge success with audiences. One of her best-known film roles is that of Lieutenant Valeris in Cattrall assisted in developing the character by designing her own hairstyle and even helped come up with the name. Near the end of filming, Cattrall had a photographer shoot a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> on the Enterprise bridge set, in which she wore nothing but her Vulcan ears. After finding out about the unauthorised photo session, Leonard Nimoy had the film destroyed.|$|E
2500|$|Franck {{was well}} known for her documentary-style {{photographs}} of important cultural figures such as painter Marc Chagall, philosopher Michel Foucault and poet Seamus Heaney, and of remote or marginalized communities such as Tibetan Buddhist monks, elderly French people, and isolated Gaelic speakers. Michael Pritchard, the Director-General of the Royal Photographic Society, observed: [...] "Martine was {{able to work with}} her subjects and bring out their emotions and record their expressions on film, helping the viewer understand what she had seen in person. Her images were always empathetic with her subject." [...] In 1976, Frank took one of her most iconic photos of bathers beside a pool in Le Brusc, Provence. By her account, she saw them from a distance and rushed to photograph the moment, all the while changing the <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> in her camera. She quickly closed the lens just at the right moment, when happened to be most intense.|$|E
50|$|On {{the sixth}} floor the library houses a large {{collection}} of historical Canadian newspapers stored on <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> going back to, in some cases, the late 19th century. There are special printers which can print the images which are stored on film.|$|R
50|$|Step two, the {{scanning}} to film, is the rote {{part of the}} process. This is the mechanical step where lasers print each of the newly created frames of the 24p video, stored on computer files or HD videotape, onto <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>film.</b>|$|R

6000|$|The picture, {{which was}} {{entitled}} [...] "The Sacrifice," [...] proved--to use Patsy's words--"a howling success." [...] On Monday afternoons the little theatres are seldom crowded, so Mr. Merrick's party secured choice seats {{where they could}} observe {{every detail of the}} photography. The girls could not wait for a later performance, so eager were they to see themselves in a motion picture, nor were they disappointed to find they were a mere incident in the long <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E
