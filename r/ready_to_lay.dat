25|$|The state's {{principal}} {{argument was}} that the plaintiffs raised no substantial federal question because Gobitis settled the constitutional questions raised by the flag-salute expulsions. The state's brief quoted extensively from Justice Frankfurter's Gobitis opinion. Given the clear indications that at least five justices were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> aside the Gobitis precedent, there was little else the state's lawyers could do. The American Legion's amicus curiae brief filed {{in support of the}} state's appeal did little more than duplicate the West Virginia argument.|$|E
25|$|Copulation is {{typically}} {{initiated by the}} male bringing an attractive prey item to the female. With both giving begging calls, they approach until they are side by side. The male then raises and swings his body left and right a few times, and passes the prey to the female, followed by the actual copulation. The gatherings of neighbour groups (see above) cease when nesting is underway, and when the eggs are nearly <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay,</b> the male guards his partner closely, perching higher than her to watch for threats and frequently feeding her. This apparently ensures her physical well-being rather than preventing extra-pair copulations, as neighbouring males will stray through each other's territory to snatch a quick fling with the resident females. In this, they have almost a one-in-three chance of success, and consequently the average grey shrike nest is very likely to contain offspring {{of more than one}} male. Females may deposit their eggs in neighbours' nests, but this seems to occur more rarely; in general, mated females are fairly reclusive after their eggs have started developing. A full clutch of eggs can be produced by a female in about 10–15 days.|$|E
25|$|The colony cycle for {{southern}} yellowjackets is fairly variable. Many annual colonies begin in late May or early June when the queen infringes {{on a small}} V. maculifrons colony (about 85% of colonies begin in this parasitic takeover, while only 15% of colonies are independent). Whereas workers do not survive the winter in annual colonies, the queen does survive, and in the spring, when she is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> more eggs, she scouts for small V. maculifrons and V. vidua colonies {{to serve as the}} host colony. These “takeovers” can often be violent as evidenced by many dead queens found in the nests. This violence tends to be conspecific, meaning that multiple V. squamosa queens are fighting for control of the host nest or for control of the polygynous nest. A successful usurpation constitutes the beginning of the parasitic relationship between a V. squamosa colony and a V. maculifrons colony. These colonies are built around the host nest, thus increase the size of the initial host nest. The queen begins the building process by constructing queen cells and laying eggs that will hatch larvae. The larvae enter the pupal phase after about a month. Once more of these female workers have been produced (late July or early August), the colony size begins to grow significantly as worker cell construction begins. This period from July to August is the major growth period during which up to 4000 workers could be producing cells. Workers build smaller 4.0- to 5.0-mm-wide cells, while the queens build “queen cells” which are about 7.0mm wide. Most nests have their maximum number of queen and worker combs between October and December, the end of the seasonal colony cycle. As the season ends, the queen hibernates so she can, in many cases, begin a new colony the next year.|$|E

The discovery of medullary bone tissue within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations.|$|R

500|$|In nymphs {{and adults}} {{of the family}} Ixodidae, the [...] is {{prominent}} and projects forwards from the body, a feature not present in the Argasidae. The eyes {{are close to the}} sides of the scutum, and the large spiracles are located just behind the coxae of the fourth pair of legs. The hard, protective scutellum, characteristic of this family, covers the whole dorsal surface in males but is restricted to a small, shield-like structure behind the capitulum in females and nymphs. They differ, too, in their life cycle; Ixodidae that attach to a host bite painlessly and generally unnoticed, and they remain in place until they engorge and are ready to change their skin; this process may take days or weeks. Some species drop off the host to moult in a safe place, whereas others remain on the same host and only drop off once they are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> their eggs.|$|E
500|$|With the {{approval}} of the specifications, TsKB-17, the heavy-ship design bureau, began work on the sketch design to be submitted for approval to the Council of Ministers {{before the start of the}} technical design could begin. By March 1949, four alternatives had been completed, differing mainly in the arrangement of the 130mm guns and the boiler layout. The bureau preferred one layout and the Navy and the Shipbuilding Ministry concurred so the bureau began the technical design, without formal approval, in order to be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down the first two ships in the third quarter of 1950 as already scheduled. However, when Stalin reviewed the sketch design in September 1949, he rejected it, ordering a smaller, faster ship capable of [...] TsKB-17 was able to produce a preliminary technical design that met Stalin's demands by the end of the year, an amazingly fast amount of time for what should have been a very involved process. The most likely explanation is that the designers retained as much of their original work as possible and found room for the more powerful turbines and more numerous boilers necessary to attain Stalin's specified speed by deleting the two rear twin 130mm turrets, and their magazines, as revealed by a comparison of the 1949 and 1951 sketches.|$|E

6000|$|From my own {{experience}} I begin to doubt most potently of the authenticity of many of Homer's stories.

But I disclaim all such unprincipled liberties: let me but have truth and the law on my side, and no man would fight harder than myself, but since the various records I consulted did not warrant it, I had too much conscience to kill a single soldier.

50|$|Flightless auk, Nataralces maritimus: a flightless, semiaquatic, penguin-like auk of the Arctic {{that comes}} {{in a number of}} {{different}} subspecies. Subspecies range in heights of 45-60 centimeters. The flightless auk is the first of countless numbers of seabird species to arrive when pelagic fish come northwards through the northern island barrier to feed on the algae-eating zooplankton in spring. During winter the flightless auks rarely come ashore or climb onto the pack ice, where they are quite defenseless. They retain their eggs until they are almost <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> hatch and <b>lay</b> them in the open water. Flightless auks first evolved at the northernmost tip of the Northern Continent and, as they became established, spread both east and west, forming their chain of subspecies in a ring around the Arctic Ocean. Throughout most of the ring each subspecies is able to breed with the neighboring ones, but where the ends of the chain overlap, no interbreeding is possible and these populations must be regarded as separate species.|$|R
