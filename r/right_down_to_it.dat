40|$|South Africa {{has been}} a {{democracy}} for ten years in 2004 {{and it has been}} eight years since government endorsed local economic development (LED) as part of its strategy to transform institutions and society. The blue print for LED is applicable on all spheres of government, from provincial governments <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> municipalities. <b>It</b> seems that uncertainty exists as to what LED is all about. To add to the lack of clarity, LED objectives duplicate national government objectives for the economy, which fall within the specific functional areas of national government departments. This article explores the progress made with LED, by the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality (CTMM). Assuming that it may serve as a proxy for LED activities by other municipalities, the article offers a critique on the LED programme at CTMM, with important suggestions on how LED may be improved. The most important is that municipalities should make a conscious effort to engage communities in their LED programmes and follow at least an international model such as the one suggested by the World Bank. Municipalities should also attempt to utilise valuable resources effectively by not duplicating programmes in the functional areas of economic development by national departments...|$|R

With Pitman at the helm as one of the prime songwriters, the band began to branch out from their closely associated brand of psychedelic pop to a hard-edged take on blues rock. Pitman's twangy instrumentals and soulful vocals were, in part, a reason for their direction change. More importantly, the band had been lacking a hit single and had hopes that expressing their versatility would appeal to their fan base.

50|$|The {{details of}} the theory contend that around two million years ago, Homo sapiens (not Homo erectus) left Africa and {{dispersed}} across the Middle East, into Europe, North and South America and Asia, <b>right</b> <b>down</b> through <b>to</b> Australia. <b>It</b> was thus argued by Thorne that all humans have originated from this initial, single journey. The theory then explains that the sub-species of the hominids (Homo erectus and Homo antecessor) are {{the basis for the}} different human physical attributes of the modern age, such as tall, slender southern traits and short, stocky northern characteristics. Fundamental to this argument is the ability of such hominids to sexually reproduce with a member of the opposite sex from any of the different hominid races (Thorne used learnings from his own extensive animal studies as substantiation here). As time progressed, this behaviour is likely to have migrated outwards and further reproduction with different hominids has, according to Thorne's theory, created the races found today.|$|R
40|$|Auricular {{acupuncture}} is {{a diagnostic}} and treatment {{system based on}} normalizing the body’s dysfunction through stimulation of definite points on the ear. Rudimentary forms of acupuncture which probably arose during the Stone Age have survived {{in many parts of}} the world <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> present day. <b>It</b> was used in the ancient Egypt, Rome, Greece and all the Mediterranean area. It is a microacupuncture technique similar to reflexology, and was first described in France in 1950 by Paul Nogier who is considered the Father of modern ear acupuncture. It was speculated that the technique works because groups of pluripotent cells contain information from the whole organism and create regional organization centers representing different parts of the body. Nevertheless stimulation of a reflex point in the ear seems relieve symptoms of distant pathologies. Modern research is confirming the efficacy of ear acupuncture for analgesia and anxiety related disease, while tobacco dependence and other substance abuse still need confirmation. Actually main methodological problems with auricular acupuncture are that exist too many maps with little agreement regarding point location in the ear, and that the correspondence or reflex systems does not correlated with modern knowledge of anatomy and physiology...|$|R
