This paper {{introduced}} fingerprint {{recognition to}} protect USB Key’s <b>pin</b> <b>number.</b> <b>Pin</b> <b>number</b> is easily stolen and sometimes it’s {{too hard to}} keep in mind. To overcome these problems, a fingerprint key based USB Key <b>pin</b> <b>number</b> protection system has been proposed. Using biometric like fingerprint to protect USB Key <b>pin</b> <b>number</b> improves security and convenience of users. And the fingerprint key is generated by user’s fingerprint and several random points. That avoids user’s privacy information disclosure because it’s hard to restore the template in calculation. With the development of mobile payment {{and more and more}} mobile devices are beginning to equip with fingerprint recognition module, the combination of fingerprint and USB Key has a good prospect and portability. ...|$|R

The primary step of this project is to verify currently scanned fingerprint with the fingerprint which is registered in the bank during the account opening time. If the two fingerprints get matched, then a message will be delivered to the user’s mobile which is the random 4 digit <b>pin</b> <b>number</b> to access the account. For every transaction new <b>pin</b> <b>numbers</b> will be send to the user’s mobile thus there will not be fixed <b>pin</b> <b>number</b> for every transaction.

The advancement of ATMs reflects the enhancing technology of the time. The use of ATM card is increasing and blooming day by day among the humans, which is further giving rise to malicious attacks on bank accounts via ATM cards because of less security & authentication techniques. To resolve this problem, dissertation will focus at concept of a chip / micro chip that will be provided by the bank along with ATM card confidentially to the possessor / owner itself. The micro chip will be embedded into the hand of possessor, at the same time when ATM card will be given by the bank. This chip inserted inside the owner of ATM card will work with the ATM card. When possessor will swipe ATM card into machine, as soon as the ATM card will get accepted, a random <b>PIN</b> <b>number</b> will get generated and this <b>PIN</b> <b>number</b> will get transferred to the chip inside possessor via radio waves. The chip will transfer this random <b>PIN</b> <b>number</b> to the brain of possessor via nerves and senses in few seconds. The random <b>PIN</b> <b>number</b> will only be known by the possessor and cannot be copied by attackers. This will reduce ATM attacks and frauds to a great extent...|$|R

40|$|Abstract— 1 This paper {{studies the}} {{security}} requirements for remote authentication and communication in smart grid systems. Though smart card based authentication techniques {{have been a}} successful solution for addressing key management challenges in several cryptographic authentication systems, {{they may not be}} applicable to smart grid systems. For example, in order to unlock the credentials stored in tamper-resistant components (which could either be integrated in smart meters and collectors or be separate components that could be inserted into smart meters and collectors), one generally needs to input a password or <b>PIN</b> <b>number</b> to the smart meters or collectors. Since most smart meters and collectors are unattended, they could be maliciously modified or impersonated. Thus there is no trusted platform for the device owners or service provider agents to input the <b>PIN</b> <b>number.</b> Furthermore, the tamper resistant components (either integrated or separated) that hold the secret credentials could be easily accessed by an attacker and offline dictionary attacks could be easily mounted against these devices to retrieve the password or <b>PIN</b> <b>number.</b> In this paper, we review the security requirements for smart grid authentication systems and propose trust models for smart grid remote authentication systems. Finally, we propose secure authentication protocols within these trust models to defeat the common attacks such as offline dictionary attacks. I...|$|R

Whilst the focus has shifted from physical security in the past to cyber security in the present, physical security for protecting assets may be just as important for many business organisations. This research looks at 700 genuine alarm PIN codes chosen by users to arm and disarm alarm systems in a commercial environment. A comparison is made with a study of millions of <b>PIN</b> <b>numbers</b> unrelated to alarms to compare the results in order to allow a prediction of the alarm codes utilised in these systems. Results show that <b>PIN</b> <b>number</b> for alarm codes are often chosen differently than other <b>PIN</b> <b>numbers</b> and an analysis of the alarm codes gives an indication of how users choose codes. The codes are ranked in various groupings and results show that a non-sequential brute force attack against an alarm system using the results of this study greatly reduce the number of codes tried by an attacker before a disarming code is discovered. The results can be used to assist users in choosing codes that are less predictable than the codes that are often chosen today...|$|R

In this entire processing system, providing a secured transaction with efficient verification is what more important. An instance cheque clearance system is proposed comprising of an unmanned customer and an operator station, and means for providing communication with secure transaction. The customer station includes an OMR scanner to scan a given cheque and a cash dispenser to withdraw the cash. Secure means are provided for enabling the operator to verify {{the identity of the}} cheque bearer by recognizing MICR number, Cheque number, Signature and amount through various techniques. This will be later implemented through MATLAB[Matrix Laboratory]. OCR[Optical Character Recognition] is a method of verifying the cheque number,amount and the MICR [Magnetic Ink Character Recognition] number. Our main aim is to detect whether the cheque is valid or not by verifying the signature and account payee which can be validated using binarization. For customer the signature is fed into the process in which the original images are resized to a specified size and there images are converted to binary values which will be compared with the original signature stored in the bank database. A secret <b>pin</b> <b>number</b> is given by the cheque bearer to check drawer for a secure transaction. The validation process is done using java. This <b>pin</b> <b>number</b> is generated from a kit where the secret number for each cheque is has been saved in a PIC microcontroller as well as the bank database. A keypad is connected to an LCD [Liquid Crystal Display] to which the user can type the cheque number and view its corresponding <b>PIN</b> <b>number</b> in the display.
