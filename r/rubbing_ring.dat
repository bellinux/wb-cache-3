Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Rub-impact between rotors and stators is a widely studied phenomenon due to its deleterious effects on rotating machinery. When large amplitudes of vibration are developed in rotors due to either imbalance or triggered instabilities, the possibility of contact between the rotor elements and static components of these machines will always arise. Therefore, <b>rub</b> <b>rings</b> or rotordynamic bumpers are incorporated to protect hardware, such as seals, compressor blades and bearings by preventing abnormal contact conditions of parts in motion with stators. In this project, flexibly supported <b>rub</b> <b>rings</b> have been tested to evaluate their capability to reduce the amplitude of vibration developed by a rotor running throughout its first critical speed. New materials with improved characteristics against wearing and suitable coefficients of friction were selected to build the <b>rub</b> <b>rings.</b> Materials with low coefficients of friction for the <b>rub</b> <b>rings</b> were used in an attempt to avoid the generation of dry friction whirl, which is a deleterious operating condition of rotating machinery undergoing rubbing effects. For the <b>rub</b> <b>rings</b> support, a material made out of woven metal strands was used. This material has shown promising characteristics providing predictable stiffness and damping for other applications such as bearing dampers. The testing of the proposed bumper design, carried out for different rotor configurations, showed a particular rotor response characteristic. For most of the cases the bumper reduced the rotor response amplitude at its critical speed during the coast-downs. However, for the run-ups the bumper performed in a less regular and effective manner. After investigating some of the bumper design aspects that would cause this characteristic it was concluded that the system was showing a behavior such as has been described in the literature for vibrating systems with a hardening spring characteristic. Computer simulations support the experimental results and this explanation. The mathematical model is a single-wheel rotor mounted on flexible supports with the wheel surrounded by a flexibly supported stator simulating the presence of the bumper...|$|R
40|$|Fibers can {{be readily}} {{fabricated}} {{into a variety of}} seal configurations that are compliant and responsive to high speed or lightly loaded systems. A linear, circular, or contoured brush seal system is a contact seal consisting of the bristle pattern and hardened interface. When compared to a labyrinth seal, the brush seal system is superior and features low leakage, dynamic stability, and permits compliant structures. But in turn, the system usually requires a hardened smooth interface and permits only limited pressure drops. Wear life and wear debris for operations with static or dynamic excitation are largely undetermined. A seal system involves control of fluid within specific boundaries. The brush and <b>rub</b> <b>ring</b> (or <b>rub</b> surface) form a seal system. Design similitudes, a bulk flow model, and <b>rub</b> <b>ring</b> (interface) coatings are discussed. The bulk flow model calculations are based on flows in porous media and filters. The coatings work is based on experience and expanded to include current practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} (+/-) - 1 -O-octadecyl- 2 -acetyl-glyceryl- 3 -phosphorylcholine (octadecyl-AGPC) were studied in {{three types of}} aortic {{vascular}} smooth muscle preparations, namely, strips, <b>rubbed</b> and unrubbed <b>rings,</b> and an atrial preparation in normotensive rats. In the resting tension state, octadecyl-AGPC did not elicit significant contractions in either <b>rubbed</b> or unrubbed <b>ring</b> preparations at concentrations lower than 1 X 10 (- 4) M. However, at a concentration of 3 X 10 (- 4) M, octadecyl-AGPC markedly contracted both types of ring preparations. This contractile response was partially antagonized by pretreatment with reserpine and completely blocked by phentolamine (1 X 10 (- 6) M). In preparations contracted with noradrenaline (NA), octadecyl-AGPC elicited biphasic responses in intact ring preparations; an initial relaxation followed by contraction. Octadecyl-AGPC induced only a slight contraction in strips and a slight relaxation in the <b>rubbed</b> <b>ring</b> preparation. Octadecyl-AGPC did not elicit any significant effect on chronotropy or inotropy at concentrations up to 3 X 10 (- 5) M. When the concentration was 1 X 10 (- 4) M, octadecyl-AGPC produced significant positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on spontaneously beating right and electrically driven left atrial preparations, respectively. Both effects were blocked by propranolol (5 X 10 (- 8) M); reserpine pretreatment antagonized only the chronotropic response. In [3 H]-dihydroalprenolol [(3 H]-DHA) binding studies, octadecyl-AGPC had a Kd of 427. 85 microM and thus was much less potent than isoprenaline (Kd = 465. 10 nM) or propranolol (Kd = 4. 4 nM) in displacing [3 H]-DHA in rat cardiac membrane preparations.

Secondly, while breaking in newly installed piston rings, a minute amount of wear must occur between rings and cylinder wall in order to seat the rings properly, and ensure a gas-tight seal.

40|$|A ring is {{not just}} a piece of jewelry that {{indicates}} commitment, endless unity and loyalty; it is a symbol that has a chain of common meanings intertwined with similar features in different geographies. It is seen that rings in myths, epics, legends, fairy tales and folk stories provide features such as power, control, wisdom, youth, earthly and spiritual prosperity, good fortune, invisibility, shape changing, talking with plants and animals. Heroes wearing these rings that protect the human soul from the evil will not suffer in any way. In the stories of the west, it is often mentioned about cursed rings that effects its owner in a bad manner and brings only bad luck. These rings, located in places that can be associated with the underground such as the ground, the hole, the cave and the water bed, are given to the heroes by supernatural beings or wise men. Supernatural beings, such as demons or giants, are trapped in these rings, many of which are magical, as slaves of the rings at an unknown time. When the hero <b>rubs</b> his <b>ring,</b> reverses it, puts it in his mouth; when he hits the ring or whistles to it, the slave of the ring comes out and asks the hero for his wish. This wish is carried out by the slave right after the hero tells the slave what he wishes. In this article, many examples from the Chinese myths to the Arabic tales, from the Babylonian Talmud to the descriptions of Scandinavian, Celtic, Welsh, French and Spanish culture have been examined {{in order to determine the}} characteristics of the rings mentioned in folkloric tales. In addition, many examples of Turkish folk literature from Dede Korkut to Anatolian tales were also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the stability {{analysis of a}} system composed of rotating beams on a flexible, circular fixed ring, using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. The model displayed has been fully developed within the rotating frame by use of an energy approach. The beams considered possess {{two degrees of freedom}} (dofs), a flexural motion as well as a traction/compression motion. In-plane deformations of the ring will be considered. Divergences and mode couplings have thus been underscored within the rotating frame and in order to simplify understanding of all these phenomena, the dofs of the beams will first be treated separately and then together. The dynamics of radial rotating loads on an elastic ring can create divergence instabilities as well as post-critical mode couplings. Moreover, the flexural motion of beam <b>rubbing</b> on the <b>ring</b> can also lead to mode couplings and to the locus-veering phenomenon. The presence of rubbing seems to make the system unstable as soon as the rotational speed of the beams is greater than zero. Lastly, the influence of an angle between the beams and the normal to the ring's inner surface will be studied with respect to system stability, thus highlighting a shift frequency phenomenon...|$|R

2500|$|Pupa. Suspended by {{the tail}} and a band that encircles it much nearer the head than is usual with Papilio pupae.

Head {{somewhat}} angular and tuberculated; two of the abdominal segments each with a prominent dorsal pair of pointed tubercles. Colour usually light brown, with a strongly contrasting saddle of old gold. (After Davidson & Aitken) - Mr T. A. Sealy (Proc. Ent Soc. 1875 p.9) states- [...] "The pupa possesses the power of making a curious noise like pha-pha!, and makes it very loudly when touched; the noise is accompanied (perhaps produced) by a short contraction of the abdominal segments. I thought {{at first it was}} merely produced by the <b>rubbing</b> of one <b>ring</b> of the pupa-case against the next, but the sound did not resemble a mere frictional sound, it was more like the sound of a rush of air through small holes. I tried to produce it with a dead chrysalis but failed: the pupa sometimes contracted on being touched without making the noise, and appeared unable to make the noise until some time was given to allow it to recover its vigour." [...] Messrs. Davidson and Aitken have also noticed this power in the pupa, but they speak of it [...] "as a husky squeaking noise, produced apparently by friction of the abdominal rings." ...|$|R

[...] Aladdin fearlessly replied: [...] "Deliver me from this place!" [...] whereupon the earth opened, and he found himself outside. As soon as his eyes could bear the light he went home, but fainted on the threshold. When he came to himself he told his mother what had passed, and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the garden, which were, in reality, precious stones. He then asked for some food. [...] "Alas! child," [...] she said, [...] "I have nothing in the house, but I have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it." [...] Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp instead. As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might fetch a higher price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what she would have. She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly: [...] "Fetch me something to eat!" [...] The genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve silver plates containing rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine. Aladdin's mother, when she came to herself, said: [...] "Whence comes this splendid feast?" [...] "Ask not, but eat," [...] replied Aladdin. So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin told his mother about the lamp. She begged him to sell it, and {{have nothing to do with}} devils. [...] "No," [...] said Aladdin, [...] "since chance hath made us aware of its virtues, we will use it, and the ring likewise, which I shall always wear on my finger." [...] When they had eaten all the genie had brought, Aladdin sold one of the silver plates, and so on until none were left. He then had recourse to the genie, who gave him another set of plates, and thus they lived for many years.|$|R
6000|$|To {{have worn}} a large scallop shell in my {{hat in the}} streets of London might have been deemed ostentatious, to say nothing of {{carrying}} a staff like a long pole; and wearing sandals might have proclaimed rather that I had not come from Jerusalem but from Letchworth, which some identify with the New Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God. Lacking such attributes, I passed through South England as one who might have come from Ramsgate or from anywhere; and the only symbol left to me of my pilgrimage was a cheap ring of metal coloured like copper and brass. For on it was written in Greek characters the word [...] "Jerusalem," [...] and though it may be less valuable than a brass nail, I do not think you can buy it in the Strand. All those enormous and everlasting things, all those gates of bronze and mosaics of purple and peacock colouring, all those chapels of gold and columns of crimson marble, had all shrivelled up and dwindled down to that one small thread of red metal round my finger. I could not help having a feeling, like Aladdin, that if I <b>rubbed</b> the <b>ring</b> perhaps all those towers would rise again. And there was a sort of feeling of truth in the fancy after all. We talk of the changeless East; but in one sense the impression of it is really rather changing, with its wandering tribes and its shifting sands, in which the genii of the East might well build the palace or the paradise of a day. As I saw the low and solid English cottages rising around me amid damp delightful thickets under rainy skies, I felt that in a deeper sense it is rather we who build for permanence or at least for a sort of peace. It is something more than comfort; a relative and reasonable contentment. And there came back on me like a boomerang a rather indescribable thought which had circled round my head through most of my journey; that Christendom is like a gigantic bronze come out of the furnace of the Near East; that in Asia is only the fire and in Europe the form. The nearest to what I mean was suggested in that very striking book Form and Colour, by Mr. March Philips. When I spoke of the idols of Asia, many moderns may well have murmured against such a description of the ideals of Buddha or Mrs. Besant. To which I can only reply that I do know a little about the ideals, and I think I prefer the idols. I have far more sympathy with the enthusiasm for a nice green or yellow idol, with nine arms and three heads, than with the philosophy ultimately represented by the snake devouring his tail; the awful sceptical argument in a circle by which everything begins and ends in the mind. I would far rather be a fetish worshipper and have a little fun, than be an oriental pessimist expected always to smile like an optimist. Now {{it seems to me that}} the fighting Christian creed is the one thing that has been in that mystical circle and broken out of it, and become something real as well. It has gone westward by a sort of centrifugal force, like a stone from a sling; and so made the revolving Eastern mind, as the Franciscan said in Jerusalem, do something at last.|$|R
6000|$|Next {{morning the}} Sultan {{looked out of}} the window toward Aladdin's palace and rubbed his eyes, for it was gone. He sent for the Vizier and asked what had become of the palace.
