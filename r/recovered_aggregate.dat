At the same time, however, the fine-grained collection of user locations raises serious privacy concerns, as this can reveal sensitive information about the users, such as, life style, political and religious inclinations, or even identities. In this paper, we study the feasibility of crowd-sourced mobility analytics over aggregate location information: users periodically report their location, using a privacy-preserving aggregation protocol, so that the server can only <b>recover</b> <b>aggregates</b> [...] i. e., how many, but not which, users are in a region at a given time. We experiment with real-world mobility datasets obtained from the Transport For London authority and the San Francisco Cabs network, and present a novel methodology based on time series modeling that is geared to forecast traffic volumes in regions of interest and to detect mobility anomalies in them. In the presence of anomalies, we also make enhanced traffic volume predictions by feeding our model with additional information from correlated regions. Finally, we present and evaluate a mobile app prototype, called Mobility Data Donors (MDD), in terms of computation, communication, and energy overhead, demonstrating the real-world deployability of our techniques.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of Methanosarcina mazei {{was controlled}} by magnesium, calcium, and substrate concentrations and by inoculum size; these factors allowed manipulation of the morphology and interconversions between pseudosarcinal aggregates and individual, coccoid cells. M. mazei grew as aggregates in medium with a low concentration of catabolic substrate (either 50 mM acetate, 50 mM methanol, or 10 mM trimethylamine) unless Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + concentrations were high. Growth in medium high in Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and substrate (i. e., 150 mM acetate, 150 mM methanol, or 40 mM trimethylamine) converted pseudosarcinal aggregates to individual cocci. In such media, aggregates separated into individual cells which continued to grow exclusively as single cells during subsequent transfers. Conversion of single cells back to aggregates was complicated, because conditions which supported the aggregated morphology (e. g., low calcium or magnesium concentration) caused lysis of coccoid inocula. We <b>recovered</b> <b>aggregates</b> from coccoid cells by inoculating serial dilutions into medium high in calcium and magnesium. Cells from very dilute inocula grew into aggregates which disaggregated on continued incubation. However, timely transfer of the aggregates to medium low in calcium, magnesium, and catabolic substrates allowed continued growth as aggregates. We demonstrated {{the activity of the}} enzyme (disaggregatase) which caused the dispersion of aggregates into individual cells; disaggregatase was produced not only during disaggregation but also in growing cultures of single cells.

40|$|The {{increasing}} attention {{being paid}} to environmental problems has recently aggravated the difficulty of <b>recovering</b> <b>aggregates</b> from quarries for civil engineering purposes and, {{at the same time}} has made the regulations for the management of waste dumps even more restrictive. The use, after adequate treatment, of building demolition wastes, for civil engineering realizations, may bring economic and environmental advantages due to the lesser need for their transportation to the dumps, to the reduced occupation of spaces destined for authorized dumps, and to the considerable savings in traditional quarry materials. Experimental studies were initially performed on these materials in order to verify the possibility of using them as aggregate for the creation of layers of road pavements without the addition of binders. Then these raw materials were used in the field of earth constructions and for the constitution of some layers of road pavements with extremely encouraging results. We refer about an experimental study that makes it possible to consider using them also for the manufacture of bitumen-treated base course with good mechanical strength characteristics. The results were satisfactory and allowed to state that a huge fraction of traditional aggregate may be replaced with recycled material. It is worth noting that regulations assumed to be respected are those relating to main roads, with normal or heavy traffic.

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the assembly {{processes of the}} capsid proteins of canine parvovirus (CPV) in mammalian and insect cells. In CPV-infected cells empty capsids assembled within 15 min, and then continued to form over the following 1 h, while full (DNA-containing) capsids were detected only after 60 min, and those accumulated slowly over several hours. In cells expressing VP 1 and VP 2 or only VP 2, empty capsid formation was also efficient, but was slightly slower than that in infected cells. Small amounts of trimer forms of VP 2 were detected in cells expressing wild type capsid proteins, but were not seen for mutants containing changes that prevented capsid assembly. CPV capsids accumulated in the cell nucleus, but mutant VP 1 and VP 2 proteins that did not assemble became distributed throughout the nucleus and the cytoplasm, irrespective of whether they were expressed as VP 1 and VP 2, or as VP 2 only. Urea or pH treatment of empty capsids released dimer, trimer, or pentamer capsid protein combinations, while treatment of full capsids consistently released trimer and, in some cases, pentamer forms. When wild type or assembly-defective VP 2 genes were expressed from recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells, most of the protein was <b>recovered</b> as noncapsid <b>aggregates,</b> and only a small proportion assembled into capsids. Both the assembled capsids and the noncapsid aggregates were seen primarily in the cytoplasm of the insect cells. The VP 2 expressed in insect cells that was <b>recovered</b> in <b>aggregates</b> had an isoelectric point of about pH 6. 3, while that recovered from assembled capsids had a pI of about 5. 2, similar to that seen for the VP 2 of capsids recovered from mammalian cells...|$|R

The most severe form of laboratory compaction in terms of potential aggregate degradation, i. e.

The results of aggregate degradation have been determined by comparing the aggregate gradation in terms of retained aggregate per individual sieve size before and after compaction.

Mice were generated to express TauRD in two forms, differing in their propensity for beta-structure and thus in their tendency for aggregation ("pro-aggregant" or "anti-aggregant") (Mocanu et al., 2008). Only pro-aggregant mice show pronounced changes typical for Tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (aggregation, missorting, hyperphosphorylation, synaptic and neuronal loss), {{indicating that the}} beta-propensity and hence the ability to aggregate is {{a key factor in}} the disease.

The mice are normal in neuromotor tests. However, pro-aggregant Tau(RD) mice are strongly impaired in memory and show pronounced loss of long-term potentiation (LTP), suggesting that Tau aggregation specifically perturbs these brain functions.

Previous research and real-world applications have demonstrated the cost savings potential of reusing <b>aggregate</b> <b>recovered</b> from forest roads during decommissioning. These cost savings can effectively subsidize decommissioning projects, sug-gesting an economic benefit associated with improving environmental benefit. We present a mixed integer, multiple objective formulation to identify the efficient trade-off surface between conflicting economic and environmental criteria, where environmental benefit {{is defined as the}} hazard weighted length of roads decommissioned. We compare nondominated frontiers identified with and with-out the opportunity to recycle aggregate. Our results suggest that aggregate recycling promotes a synergistic relationship between cost savings (subsidy) and environ-mental performance, where subsidies generally increase with increasing environmental performance. Effective sub-sidy values can reach 31 % of total expenditure, at the maximum level of environmental benefit. Transportation managers are therefore able to recover and reuse a nonrenewable resource, {{while at the same time}} promoting economic and environmental efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The middle Cambrian -Furongian {{transitional}} interval {{was a time}} {{of significant}} biotic and environmental changes. Strata of this age in Scania, southern Sweden, contain two interlayered biofacies, a normal one dominated by trilobites and an anomalous one dominated by phosphatocopines (small bivalved arthropods). In places these biofacies are separated by intervals barren of fossils. In a phosphatocopine facies without trilobites in the upper Agnostus pisiformis Zone at Andrarum we <b>recovered</b> scattered fossil <b>aggregates</b> with a homogeneous composition of tightly packed and stacked phosphatocopines. These aggregates are interpreted as coprolites produced by an undetermined predator, possibly the chaetognath-like protoconodont animal or some other softbodied metazoan. The so-called barren intervals of Scania are not necessarily barren of fossils, but only trilobites, brachiopods, and other skeletal elements with a calcium-carbonate composition. The phosphatocopine facies with coprolites in the uppermost part of the A. pisiformis Zone correlates with the trilobite mass extinction {{at the top of the}} Marjumiid Biomere in Laurentia and immediately prior to the onset of the Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion (SPICE), inferring a global shift in the oceanic chemistry that in Scania favoured phosphatocopines over the more common, trilobite-dominated faunas...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The DVB-H {{standard}} is proposed to disseminate videos to mobile devices. However, packet loss is inevitable {{due to the}} broadcasting nature. To deal with this issue, DVB-IPDC suggests incorporating another wireless network for data retransmission. This paper takes a WiMAX network as an example in DVB-IPDC and models its channel as repetitive frames. During each frame, mobile devices sends their recovery requests of lost packets to a WiMAX base station and the base station adopts network coding to broadcast these packets. This paper then formulates a prioritized network coding (PNC) problem that asks how the base station uses at most τ coded packets in each frame such that it can <b>recover</b> the maximum <b>aggregate</b> number of lost packets while minimize the aggregate number of packets discarded due to out of deadlines. We develop a solution using XOR coding, which constructs a weighted bipartite graph to calculate the benefit to broadcast each coded packet. Then, the solution tries to maximize the overall benefit by finding a maximum-weighted τ dominating set. The contribution {{of this paper is}} to propose a new PNC problem in DVB-IPDC systems and develop an efficient PNC solution. Index Terms—digital video broadcasting (DVB), network coding, packet recovery, WiMAX, wireless network. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{induction}} of a {{signaling pathway}} is characterized by transient complex formation and mutual posttranslational modification of proteins. To faithfully capture this combinatorial process in a mathematical model is an important challenge in systems biology. Exploiting the limited context on which most binding and modification events are conditioned, {{attempts have been made}} to reduce the combinatorial complexity by quotienting the reachable set of molecular species into species aggregates while preserving the deterministic semantics of the thermodynamic limit. Recently, we proposed a quotienting that also preserves the stochastic semantics and that is complete in the sense that the semantics of individual species can be <b>recovered</b> from the <b>aggregate</b> semantics. In this paper, we prove that this quotienting yields a sufficient condition for weak lumpability (that is to say that the quotient system is still Markovian for a given set of initial distributions) and that it gives rise to a backward Markov bisimulation between the original and aggregated transition system (which means that the conditional probability of being in a given state in the original system knowing that we are in its equivalence class is an invariant of the system). We illustrate the framework on a case study of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) /insulin receptor crosstalk...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional culture {{systems are}} an ideal in vitro model being capable of {{sustaining}} cell functionalities {{in a manner}} that resembles the in vivo conditions. In the present study, we developed an ultrasound trap-based technique to rapidly produce HepG 2 hepatocarcinoma cell aggregates within 30 min. Enhanced junctional F-actin was observed at the points of cell-cell contact throughout the aggregates. HepG 2 aggregates prepared by the ultrasound trap can be maintained in culture on a P-HEMA-coated surface for up to 3 weeks. The cells in these aggregates proliferated during the initial 3 days and cell number was consistent during the following maintenance period. Albumin secretion from these HepG 2 <b>aggregates</b> <b>recovered</b> after 3 days of aggregate formation and remained relatively stable for the following 12 days. Cytochrome P 450 - 1 A 1 activity was significantly enhanced after 6 days with maximal enzyme activity observed between 9 and 18 days. In addition, comparison experiments demonstrated that HepG 2 aggregates generated by the ultrasound trap had comparable functional characterizations with HepG 2 spheroids formed by a traditional gyrotatory-mediated method. Our results suggest that HepG 2 aggregate cultures prepared through the ultrasound trap-based technique may provide a novel approach to produce in vitro models for hepatocyte functional studies...|$|R
