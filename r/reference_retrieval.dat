40|$|A {{close look}} at {{developments}} and opportunities as they existed in late 1985 led {{to the belief that}} we were at the threshold of a creative convergence of two separate movements. The advances in understanding the problems and needs of end user searching of IR systems seemed transferable to OPAC use, and some online catalogs, as they evolved, were beginning to incorporate the more sophisticated keyword and Boolean search methods common in the conventional IR systems. The transformation of the library catalog into a diverse, online information resource had begun. The promise was clear: OPACs could be better library catalogs than their predecessors, and OPACs could be both powerful and usable interactive retrieval systems. Today, we must recognize that much of this promise is being fulfilled.

The role of information in evidence-based practice (EBP) is discussed, together with questions of how advanced information systems and technology (IS&T) can contribute to the establishment of a broader perspective for EBP. The author examines the development, validation and use of a variety of sources of evidence and knowledge that go beyond the well-established paradigm of research, clinical trials, and systematic literature review. Opportunities and challenges in the implementation and use of IS&T and knowledge management tools are examined for six application areas: reference databases, contextual data, clinical data repositories, administrative data repositories, decision support software, and Internet-based interactive health information and communication. Computerized and telecommunications applications that support EBP follow a hierarchy in which systems, tasks and complexity range from <b>reference</b> <b>retrieval</b> and the processing of relatively routine transactions, to complex "data mining" and rule-driven decision support systems...|$|E

Study Design and Setting A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO, and CINAHL was performed from inception to January 2011.

To keep abreast of current research the scientist and engineer can use a multitude of information sources. In this study the problem of information use is analysed and a theoretical framework is developed and applied in several case-studies of formal and informal communication. The case-studies include surveys among scientists, engineers and social scientists in different R&D-settings. Information about research is looked upon as a fundamental resource for R&D activities. It is demonstrated that information use and communication behavior are related to research productivity. However the use of both written and oral information sources is limited by barriers related to the individual user, his position in the social structure of the research community and organisation {{as well as the}} availability of information resources. In order to improve the use of knowledge it is necessary to integrate the information and documentation functions with the planning and conduct of research.

40|$|Background: Reference {{accuracy}} of {{articles published in}} the biomedical literature {{is determined by the}} presence of citation and quotation errors. A recent review demonstrated that the median citation error rate per biomedical journal was 39 %, and the median quotation error rate per journal was 20 %. Reference accuracy in pediatric orthopaedic articles has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. Methods: Two hundred references from twenty articles published in four peer-reviewed orthopaedic journals were randomly selected for assessment of citation and quotation accuracy. Full-text copies of all original references were obtained by interlibrary loan methods and reviewed directly to establish citation accuracy. The presence of citation errors was determined by a single investigator. The relevance of citation errors was determined by assessing the ease of <b>reference</b> <b>retrieval</b> through PubMed. Quotation accuracy was determined by two examiners who reviewed each of the twenty articles and 200 references to compare the claims made for the references in the article against the data and opinions expressed in the actual reference. Results: The total citation error rate across all of the journals was 26 % (fifty-one of 200 references) with a 95 % confidence interval of 16. 5 % to 37. 3 %. The median citation error rate per journal was 27 % (range, 10 % to 38 %). Although citation errors were common, most were of minimal significance, as 196 of the 200 references could be retrieved with ease from PubMed.

Traditional <b>reference</b> <b>retrieval</b> was also conducted. Language was limited to Chinese and English. We identified 37 RCTs that used warming needle moxibustion as an intervention and they were assessed with the Consolidated Standards for Reporting of Trials Statement 2010 (CONSORT 2010) and Standards for Reporting Interventions Controlled Trials of Acupuncture 2010 (STRICTA 2010). ResultsOf the 37 reports, only seventeen (45. 95 %) mentioned the random allocation of sequence methods, nine used unacceptable methods, and only one (2. 70 %) gave {{the description of the}} mechanism of allocation concealment. One study (2. 70 %) mentioned blinding, one (2. 70 %) had a sample size calculation, and twenty-three (62. 16 %) used reasonable statistical methods.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} ground-based remote-sensing ozone total column amounts (OTC) from spectral signatures at 3040 and 4030 cm − 1. These spectral regions are routinely measured by the NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) ground-based FTIR (Fourier transform infraRed) experiments. In addition, they are potentially detectable by the TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network) FTIR instruments. The ozone retrieval strategy presented here estimates the OTC from NDACC FTIR high-resolution spectra with a theoretical precision of about 2 and 5 % in the 3040 and 4030 cm − 1 regions, respectively. Empirically, these OTC products are validated by inter-comparison to FTIR OTC <b>reference</b> <b>retrievals</b> in the 1000 cm − 1 spectral region (standard reference for NDACC ozone products), using an 8 -year FTIR time series (2005 – 2012) taken at the subtropical ozone supersite of the Izaña Atmospheric Observatory (Tenerife, Spain). Associated with the weaker ozone signatures at the higher wave number regions, the 3040 and 4030 cm − 1 retrievals show lower vertical sensitivity than the 1000 cm − 1 retrievals. Nevertheless, we observe that the rather consistent variations are detected: the variances of the 3040 cm − 1 and the 4030 cm − 1 retrievals agree within 90 and 75 %, respectively, with the variance of the 1000 cm − 1 standard retrieval. Furthermore, all three retrievals show very similar annual cycles. However, we observe a large systematic difference of about 7 % between the OTC obtained at 1000 and 3040 cm − 1, indicating a significant inconsistency between the spectroscopic ozone parameters (HITRAN, 2012) of both regions. Between the 1000 cm and the 4030 cm − 1 retrieval the systematic difference is only 2 – 3 %. Finally, the long-term stability of the OTC retrievals has also been examined, observing that both near-infrared retrievals can monitor the long-term OTC evolution, consistent with the 1000 cm − 1 reference data. These findings demonstrate that recording the solar absorption spectra in the 3000 cm − 1 spectral region at high spectral resolution (about 0. 005 cm − 1) might be useful for TCCON sites. Hence, both NDACC and TCCON ground-based FTIR experiments might contribute to global ozone databases...|$|R
