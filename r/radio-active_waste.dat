40|$|Abstract: Crushed {{claystone}} {{produced by}} excavation of repository openings has been investi-gated as backfill/seal material. The raw coarse-grained claystone {{can be used}} for backfilling repo-sitory openings and, in mixture with bentonite, for sealing boreholes, drifts and shafts. The investigation programme focused on characterizing the thermo-hydro-mechanical properties of the excavated Callovo-Oxfordian claystone and the compacted claystone–bentonite mixtures, including (1) mechanical compaction, (2) gas and water permeability as a function of porosity, (3) water retention and saturation, (4) swelling capacity and (5) thermal properties of the materials. The major results are presented in this paper. The disposal concepts developed by many countries for repositories in clay formations are based on the principle of a multi-barrier system, which comprises the natural geological barriers provided by the host rock and its surroundings, and an engineered barrier system (EBS).

The present transmutation systemis a hybrid one of an intense proton accelerator, a tungsten target cooled with sodium and a subcritical core loaded with the TRU alloy fuel. In this system the transmutation rate of about 200 kgTRU a year (generated from about 8 units of 1 GWe PWR) are attainable and the marginal electricity more than one needed to drive the accelerator can be produced. With the aim to make assessment of the system design and to upgrade the computer codes for simulating nuclear spallation processes in the transmutation system, the integral spallation experiment has been planned. The lead target has been set UP along the 500 Plev beam line of a proton synchrotrons booster at KEK. The first irradiation experiment has started Autumnin 1990. 48...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Faults profoundly affect {{patterns}} {{and rates of}} fluid flow and solute transport in the geological environment. They may act as conduits, barriers or combined conduit-barrier systems. In order to elucidate the relationship between fluid flow properties and deformation mechanisms of fault-related rocks, we applied X-ray CT during laboratory permeameter measurements for direct imaging of fluid flow during permeability esting. A KI solution, which has high X-ray attenuation values, {{was used as a}} contrast medium for the advection imaging. Three-dimensional fluid flow distributions were measured for the studied fault-related rocks. Fault zones characterized by independent particulate flow as deformation mechanism act as conduits for fluid flow, whereas cataclastic fault zones act as barriers. Fluid flow in fractured rocks is currently being studied with regard to storage of high-level <b>radio-active</b> <b>waste.</b> The concept of waste disposal in Japan is based on a multibarrier system which combines an isolating geological environment with an engineered barrier system.

40|$|Abstract. The {{leaching}} rate of 60 Co and 137 Cs from the spent cation exchange resins in cement–b nto ite matrix has been studied. The solidification matrix was a standard Portland cement mixed with 290 – 350 (kg/m 3) spent cation exchange resins, {{with or without}} 2 – 5 % of bentonite clay. The {{leaching rate}}s from the cement– bentonite matrix for 60 Co: (4, 2 – 7, 0) ´ 10 – 5 (cm/d) and 137 Cs: (3, 2 – 6, 6) ´ 10 – 4 (cm/d), after 125 days were measured. From the leaching data the apparent diffusivity of cobalt and cesium in cement–bentonite clay matrix with a waste load of 290 – 35 (kg/m 3) spent cation exchange resins, was measured for 60 Co: (1, 1 – 4, 0) ´ 10 – 6 (cm 2 /d) and 137 Cs: (0, 5 – 2, 6) ´ 10 – 4 (cm 2 /d), after 125 days.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{necessity}} for quickly detecting and assessing alpha and beta emitters in the environment, in nuclear fuel processes, and in storage waste has caused {{an increase in}} analyses of gross α (sum of all α emitters in the sample) and gross β (sum of all β emitters in the sample) activity. In fact, these analyses {{have been the most}} popular method for measuring radio-activity. Scintillation counting allows for the detection and quantification of α- and β-emitting radionuclides in an accurate and reproducible way without self-absorption problems. Optimization of α/β separation is achieved by using pulse-shape dis-crimination (PSD), calibrated by quantifying event misclassification at any given setting for pure α and β emitters. We studied α/β separation for different scintillant/vial combinations. We observed that both the optimum PSD level and total interference value were dependent upon the sample quenching. Thus, we propose a procedure for analyzing gross α and β activity in <b>radio-active</b> <b>waste</b> streams, such as ion exchange resins and evaporator concentrates, from Spanish nuclear power plants. The sam-ples were prepared using standard solutions of radionuclides that are normally present in these types of samples. The results are compared with those obtained by other techniques, such as proportional counting...|$|E
40|$|Environmental hazards can {{be caused}} by <b>radio-active</b> <b>waste</b> after disposal. It is, therefore, {{important}} that safety assessment methodologies be developed and established to study and estimate the possible hazards, and institute safety methodologies that will prevent the evolution of these hazards. Spent sealed sources are a specific type of radioactive waste. According to the IAEA definition,[1] spent sealed sources are unused sources because of activity decay, damage, misuse, loss, or theft. Accidental exposure to humans from spent sealed sources can occur at the moment they become spent and before their disposal. Because of this reason, safety assessment methodologies have been tailored to suit the management of spent sealed sources. To provide an understanding of and confidence in this study, validation analysis was undertaken by considering the scenario of an accident that occurred in Egypt, June 2000 (the Meet-Halfa accident from an iridium- 192 source). The study includes consideration related to safety assessments for spent sealed sources, the processes which caused an active source to be spent, accident scenarios, mathematical models for dose calcula-tions, radiological consequences and regulatory criteria. This article also outlines a validation study which evaluated a theoretical scenario (compared to the real scenario of the Meet-Halfa accident,) based on the clinical assessment of the affected individuals...|$|E
40|$|Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) were {{conceived}} {{at the early}} stages of nuclear energy in view of the favourable features fostered by a liquid fuel. They were developed as graphite-moderated thorium-fuelled breeder reactors till the seventies, when studies on this reactor concept were mostly abandoned in favour of the liquid–metal fast breeder concepts. A decade ago, the MSRs were included among the six GEN-IV systems and a core optimization process allowing for the GEN-IV main objectives led toward a fast-spectrum MSR concept (MSFR – Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Albeit advantageous in terms of U- 233 breeding and/or <b>radio-active</b> <b>waste</b> burning, the new concept lacks the notable know-how available for the thermal-spectrum MSR technology. The present paper preliminarily investigates the MSR dynamics, based on the conceptual MSFR design currently available. A primary objective is to benchmark two different models of the MSFR primary circuit, both of them including a detailed and fully-coupled (node-wise) representation of turbulent fuel-salt flow, neutron diffusion, and delayed-neutron precursor diffusion and convection. A good agreement is generally observed between the adopted models, though some discrepancies exist in the temperature-field, with ensuing mild impacts on the reactor dynamics. The performed analyses are also used for a preliminary characterization of the MSFR steady-state and accidental transient response. Some points of enhancement needed in the MSFR conceptual design are identified, mainly related to in-core velocity and temperature fields. The reactor response following major accidental transient initiators suggests a generally benign behaviour of this reactor concept...|$|E
40|$|ZIRCONOLITE and its {{polymorph}} zirkelite {{are rare}} in natural rocks, {{and have been}} found as accessory minerals mostly in carbonatites and ultrabasic intrusive rocks (see Williams and Gier 6, 1996, for a recent review). The chemical formula of zirconolite is essentially CaZrTi 207, but {{a wide range of}} substitutions exists, which makes it suitable for use in SYNROC, a potential storage material of <b>radio-active</b> <b>waste</b> (Ringwood et aL, 1979). Zirconolites from Sri Lanka, found associated with 'gem gravels ' in alluvial deposits were collected {{at the beginning of the}} century and are now incorporated in various museum collections around the world. However, to the best of our knowledge, their source rock is still unknown. Among these zirconolite samples, a variety from Walaweduwa, first described as zirkelite by Blake and Smith (1913), is of specific interest because of its unusually high concentrations of Th and U. This characteristic provides information on the resistance of the mineral to radiation damage (Sinclair and Ringwood, 1981), and on the chemical substitutions that stabilize the crystal structure. The reported analyses (Blake and Smith, 1913; Sinclair and Ringwood, 1981, and Lumpkin et al., 1986) do not include all minor and trace elements. Here we report the results of detailed electron microprobe analyses of a zirconolite crystal from Walaweduwa. In the course of this study inclusions of the extremely rare mineral thorntite, ThTi 206, were found, the composition of which is also reported. Experimental Electron microprobe analyses were made using a Jeol X- 8600 Superprobe, fitted with wavelength (WDS) and energy (EDS) dispersive spectrometers, and operated at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV, a specimen current of 25 hA, and a beam diameter o...|$|E
40|$|AZARDOUS WASTE {{disposal}} {{problems are}} not new. Only recently, however, has significant H media attention {{been given to the}} magnitude of the problems associated with chemical and <b>radio-active</b> <b>waste</b> disposal. The disposal of these wastes is of concern not only to industry, but to all gener-ators of hazardous waste and the public as well. Chemical solvent waste disposal from laborato-ries of academic, health care, and research institu-tions is a problem that has grown both in regulatory complexity and associated costs. The author was asked to develop a comprehensive environmental and occupational health program for the biomed-ical research and health care facilities of the Univer-sity of Connecticut. The most immediate need was for a n effective chemical waste management pro-gram. The implementation of the Resource Conser-vation and Recovery Act (RCRA) by the Environ-mental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as a con-cern for the public health, necessitated the imple-mentation of such a program. Initially these chemi-cals were disposed of by a hazardous waste disposal firm that had been contracted at considerable cost. Program planning The production and disposal of chemical waste at the University of Connecticut Health Center was re-viewed to determine where and how significant cost savings might be realized. The largest volume of chemicals for disposal were found to be waste xy-lenes and alcohol from histology processing opera-tions in both the clinical and research laboratories. It was decided that substantial savings could be realized by eliminating or greatly reducing the amounts of waste xylenes and alcohol for disposal. The only stipulations placed on a means to bring about a volume reduction were: the methods used must be ecologically sound, they must be accom-plished with a minimum of risk, and they must be cost effective. One of the methods investigated was the reclamation of the solvents through distillatio...|$|E

The world's next major fusion experiment, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), will be a pre-prototype power plant. Since announcement of the ITER site in June 2005, the ITER project, has gained momentum and political support. Despite Australia's foundation role in the field of fusion science, through the pioneering work of Sir Mark Oliphant, and significant contributions to the international fusion program over the succeeding years, Australia is not involved in the ITER project. In this talk, the activities of a recently formed consortium of scientists and engineers, the Australian ITER Forum will be outlined. The Forum is drawn from six Universities, ANSTO (the Australian Nuclear Science & Technology Organisation) and AINSE (the Australian Institute for Nuclear Science & Engineering), and seeks to promote fusion energy in the Australian community and negotiate a role for Australia in the ITER project. As part of this activity, the Australian government recently funded a workshop that discussed the ways and means of engaging Australia in ITER.
