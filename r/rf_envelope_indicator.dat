Because radio sections in sensor nodes contribute to a large extent to the overall power consumption, the focus of this study is on the RF transceiver. The aim is to reduce the average power consumption which depends significantly on the circuit architecture design, operating data rate, and duty cycle. In a symmetric communicating system, due to the tradeoff between transmitting power and receiver sensitivity on one hand, as well as between phase noise tolerance and power dissipation in local oscillators on the other hand, the design and operating parameters of the transceiver need to be determined from the perspective of the average power consumption. Therefore, in our study, as an initial step in system design, the optimum for instantaneous data rate, noise figure, and oscillator power budget are analytically determined. The analysis is carried out, taking into consideration an existing in-channel wideband interference, on two transceiver architectures: <b>RF</b> <b>envelope</b> detection and conventional heterodyne. The transceiver in both architectures employs on-off-keying modulation and duty cycling.

40|$|Hybrid Digital/RF Envelope Predistortion Linearization for High Power Amplifiers in Wireless Communication Systems Wangmyong Woo 151 Pages Directed by Dr. J. Stevenson Kenney The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to implement a hybrid digital/RF envelope predistortion linearization system for high-power amplifiers used in wireless communication systems. It is well known that RF PAs have AM/AM (amplitude modulation) and AM/PM (phase modulation) nonlinear characteristics. Moreover, the distortion components generated by a PA are not constant, but vary as a function of many input conditions such as amplitude, signal bandwidth, self-heating, aging, etc. Memory effects in response to past inputs cause a hysteresis in the nonlinear transfer characteristics of a PA. This hysteresis, in turn, creates uncertainty in predictive linearization techniques. To cope with these nonlinear characteristics, distortion variability, and uncertainty in linearization, an adaptive digital predistortion technique, a hybrid digital/RF envelope predistortion technique, an analog-based <b>RF</b> <b>envelope</b> predistortion technique, and a combinational digital/analog predistortion technique have been developed. A digital adaptation technique based on the error vector minimization of received PA output waveforms was developed. Also, an adaptive baseband-to-baseband test system for the characterization of RF PAs and for the validation of linearization algorithms was implemented in conjunction with the adaptation technique. To overcome disadvantages such as limited correction bandwidth and the need for a baseband input signal in digital predistortion, an adaptive, wideband <b>RF</b> <b>envelope</b> predistortion system was developed that incorporates a memoryless predistortion algorithm. This system is digitally controlled by a look-up table (LUT). Compared with conventional baseband digital approaches, this predistortion architecture has a correction bandwidth that is from 20 percent to 33 percent wider at the same clock speeds for third to fifth order IMDs and does not need a digital baseband input signal. For more accurate predistortion linearization for PAs with memory effects, an <b>RF</b> <b>envelope</b> predistortion system has been developed that uses a combination of analog-based envelope predistortion (APD) working in conjunction with digital LUT-based adaptive envelope predistortion (DPD). The resulting combination considerably decreases the computational complexity of the digital system and significantly improves linearity and efficiency at high power levels. Ph. D.

By generating a common tracking envelope, only one envelope modulator is employed for controlling supply voltage of the RF PAs in all branches in the system, which dramatically reduces the system implementation cost. Due to the structurechange, additional distortion is introduced, {{and it is difficult}} to directly compensate by using the conventional DPD because the tracking envelope is no longer the same as the <b>RF</b> <b>envelope</b> and thus the MIMO ET PA becomes a two-input and one-output system. To resolve this problem, in this paper we propose a novel DPD technique in which the PA input and output data are reconstructed into multiple data subsets according to variations of the tracking envelope.

Experimental results demonstrated that the distortion, including static nonlinearities, memory effects and additional distortion caused by the structure change, can be effectively compensated by using the proposed DPD technique.

40|$|The {{combination}} of minimum time control and multiphase converter is a favorable option for dc-dc converters in applications where output voltage variation is required, such as RF amplifiers and dynamic voltage scaling in microprocessors, {{due to their}} advantage of fast dynamic response. In this paper, an improved minimum time control approach for multiphase buck converter {{that is based on}} charge balance technique, aiming at fast output voltage transition is presented. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed control takes into account the phase delay and current ripple in each phase. Therefore, by investigating the behavior of multiphase converter during voltage transition, it resolves the problem of current unbalance after the transient, which can lead to long settling time of the output voltage. The restriction of this control is that the output voltage that the converter can provide is related to the number of the phases, because only the duty cycles at which the multiphase converter has total ripple cancellation are used in this approach. The model of the proposed control is introduced, and the design constraints of the buck converters filter for this control are discussed. In order to prove the concept, a four-phase buck converter is implemented and the experimental results that validate the proposed control method are presented.

In four awake behaving monkeys, we quantitatively characterized the spatial three-dimensional structure of 55 V 1 RFs using random dot stereograms in which disparity varied as a sinusoidal function of vertical position ("corrugations"). At low spatial frequencies, this produced a modulation in neuronal firing at the temporal frequency of the stimulus. As the spatial frequency increased, the modulation reduced. The mean response rate changed little and was close to that produced by a uniform stimulus at the mean disparity of the corrugation. In 48 of 55 (91 %) neurons, the modulation strength was a lowpass function of spatial frequency. These results are compatible with a response determined only by the weighted mean of the disparities of the dots (the weights being set by the <b>RF</b> <b>envelope)</b> and {{suggest that there is}} no disparity-based surround inhibition or selectivity for disparity gradients. This simple weighting scheme predicts a relationship between RF size and the high-frequency cutoff. Comparison with independent measurements of RF size was compatible with this. All of this behavior closely matches the binocular energy model. The mean cutoff frequency, 0. 5 cycles per degree, is similar to equivalent measures of decline in human psychophysical sensitivity for such depth corrugations as a function of frequency (Tyler, 1974; Prince and Rogers, 1998; Banks et al., 2004). This suggests that human cyclopean acuity for disparity modulations is limited by the selectivity of V 1 neurons.

40|$|Power {{amplifiers}} {{are essential}} components in wireless communication systems and are inherently nonlinear. This nonlinearity generates spectral regrowth beyond the signal bandwidth, {{which in turn}} interferes with adjacent channels. Wideband {{code division multiple access}} (WCDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems are particularly vulnerable to nonlinear distortions; this is due to their high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs), which require a stringent linearity. One way to achieve the required linearity is to back-off the input signal. However, in the case of high PAPR signals, the efficiency of the power amplifier will be very low. In this dissertation, we are concerned with achieving high linearity and high efficiency. We first propose a predistorter based on piecewise pre-equalizers, for use in multi-channel wideband applications. This predistortion linearizer consists of piecewise pre-equalizers, along with a lookup table (LUT) based digital predistorter; together they compensate for nonlinearities, as well as memory effects of power amplifiers. Taking advantage of the multiple finite impulse response (FIR) filters, the complexity is significantly reduced when compared to memory polynomial methods. Furthermore, experimental results obtained when two WCDMA carriers were applied verified that our proposed method provides improvements comparable to those seen using the memory polynomial approach. Secondly, a unique baseband derived radio frequency (RF) predistortion system is presented, which uses LUT coefficients extracted at baseband to directly <b>RF</b> <b>envelope</b> modulate a quadrature vector modulator. The primary advantage of this architecture is that it combines the narrowband benefit of envelope predistortion with the accuracy of baseband predistortion. Finally, a novel efficient crest factor reduction technique for wideband applications is described. The technique uses peak cancellation to reduce the PAPR of the input signal. Conventional iterative peak cancellation requires several iterations to converge to the targeted PAPR, since filtering causes peak re-growth. The proposed algorithm eliminates several iterations and subsequently saves hardware resources.

40|$|Abstract — Efficiency and {{linearity}} of {{the microwave}} power amplifier are critical elements for mobile communication systems. This paper discusses improvements in system efficiency that are obtainable when a dc–dc converter {{is used to}} convert available battery voltage to an optimal supply voltage for the output RF amplifier. A boost dc–dc converter with an operating frequency of 10 MHz is demonstrated using GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors. Advantages of 10 -MHz switching frequency and as-sociated loss mechanisms are described. For modulation formats with time-varying envelope, such as CDMA, the probability of power usage is described. Gains in power efficiency and battery lifetime are calculated. An envelope detector circuit with a fast feedback loop regulator is discussed. Effects of varying supply voltage with respect to distortion are examined along with methods to increase system linearity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and discusses two possible real-time digital predistortion (DPD) architectures suitable for envelope tracking (ET) power amplifiers (PAs) oriented at a final computationally efficient implementation {{in a field}} programmable gate array (FPGA) device. In ET systems, by using a shaping function is possible to modulate the supply voltage according to different criteria. One possibility is to use slower versions of the original <b>RF</b> signal’s <b>envelope</b> in order to relax the slew-rate (SR) and bandwidth (BW) requirements of the envelope amplifier (EA) or drain modulator. The nonlinear distortion that arises when performing ET with a supply voltage signal that follows both the original and the slow envelope will be presented, as well as the DPD function capable of compensating for these unwanted effects. Finally, two different approaches for efficiently implementing the DPD functions, a polynomial-based and a look-up table-based, will be discussed. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|In this {{doctoral}} dissertation, {{the author}} presents the theoretical foundation, {{the analysis and}} design of analog and RF circuits, the chip level implementation, and the experimental validation pertaining to a new radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) power amplifier (PA) architecture that is intended for wireless portable transceivers. A method called Gated Envelope Feedback is proposed to allow the automatic hardware reconfiguration of a stand-alone RFIC PA in multiple states for power efficiency improvement purposes. The method uses self-operating and fully integrated circuitry comprising RF power detection, switching and sequential logic, and <b>RF</b> <b>envelope</b> feedback {{in conjunction with a}} hardware gating function for triggering and activating current reduction mechanisms {{as a function of the}} transmitted RF power level. Because of the critical role that RFIC PA components occupy in modern wireless transceivers, and given the major impact that these components have on the overall RF performances and energy consumption in wireless transceivers, very significant benefits stem from the underlying innovations. The method has been validated through the successful design of a 1. 88 GHz COMA RFIC PA with automatic hardware reconfiguration capability, using an industry renowned state-of-the-art GaAs HBT semiconductor process developed and owned by Skyworks Solutions, Inc., USA. The circuit techniques that have enabled the successful and full on-chip embodiment of the technique are analyzed in details. The IC implementation is discussed, and experimental results showing significant current reduction upon automatic hardware reconfiguration, gain regulation performances, and compliance with the stringent linearity requirements for COMA transmission demonstrate that the gated envelope feedback method is a viable and promising approach to automatic hardware reconfiguration of RFIC PA's for current reduction purposes. Moreover, in regard to on-chip integration of advanced PA control functions, it is demonstrated that the method is better positioning GaAs HBT technologies, which are known to offer very competitive RF performances but inherently have limited integration capabilities. Finally, an analytical approach for the evaluation of inter-modulation distortion (IMD) in envelope feedback architectures is introduced, and the proposed design equations and methodology for IMD analysis may prove very helpful for theoretical analyses, for simulation tasks, and for experimental work...|$|R
