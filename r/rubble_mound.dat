40|$|Abstract- Alacrane is a {{hydraulic}} mobile manipulator for {{search and rescue}} in disaster areas and natural environments, where surmounting elevations such as <b>rubble</b> <b>mounds</b> and terraces is usually required. The paper describes the autonomous terrace climbing maneuver of this mobile robot {{with the help of}} its powerful arm. During this operation, the arm is used both for levering, by pushing it against the ground, and for modifying the center of gravity of the entire robot. A 3 D laser scanner, an IMU, and joint absolute encoders provide all the sensorial information required for this maneuver. Furthermore, fast 3 D scan processing is proposed to estimate the pose, slope, and height of the terrace. Experimental results in an outdoor environment demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach...|$|R

50|$|V.O.C Port is an {{artificial}} deep sea harbour formed with <b>rubble</b> <b>mound</b> type parallel breakwaters projecting into sea up to 4 km. The Length of North Breakwater is 4098.66 m, length of South Breakwater is 3873.37 m {{and the distance}} between breakwaters is 1275 m. The port was designed and executed entirely through indigenous efforts. The harbour basin extends to about 400 hectares of protected water area and is served by an approach channel of 2400 metres length and 183 metres width.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} breakwaters {{must be based}} on the full {{understanding}} of the interaction of a complex natural system (the sea and shores) with artificial structures (breakwaters). Typically, design work entails extensive physical modeling, which can be quite expensive and time-consuming. Until recently, the complex aspects of breakwater behavior were considered too challenging for detailed numerical simulations. This is especially the case for breakwaters consisting of <b>rubble</b> <b>mounds</b> composed of blocks of concrete or rocks in which water flows through complex paths with unsteady motion. Within this context, the problems induced by the rock mound have so far been treated by the sometimes simplistic “porous media” approach which assumes a filtration flow (Darcy or Forchheimer for a linear or quadratic loss, respectively) between the blocks...|$|R
40|$|Seagrass {{colonise}} {{new areas}} via the dispersion of seeds or vegetative fragments. Independent of {{the manner of}} colonization, habitat requirements need to be met for the successful establishment of seagrasses. Here {{we report on the}} colonization process of Posidonia oceanica in a highly disturbed area: a gas pipeline trench at Capo Feto (SW Sicily, Italy). A trench dredged through a P. oceanica bed was back-filled with rubble added from dump barges leading to the formation of a series of <b>rubble</b> <b>mounds</b> on the seabed. Over time, these mounds became colonised with P. oceanica. I>. In order to understand the pattern of P. oceanica colonization, shoot density was quantified over 3 years (2001 – 2003) on different mound locations (crests, sides, valleys). Seagrass coalescence was observed only in valleys between mounds where shoot density averaged 133 ± 50 shoots m? 2, while values for sides and crests were significantly lower (30. 5 ± 14 and 5. 8 ± 2. 6 shoots m? 2, respectively). Although sediment accumulated on both crests and valleys, a significantly thicker sediment layer was recorded in the valleys (9. 8 ± 0. 4 cm) than on crests (1. 1 ± 0. 2). Plaster dissolution rate (an indicator of the hydrodynamic regime) tended to decrease from crests to valleys but even in the valleys, the currents were still higher than in the adjacent vegetated control location. This pattern was constant over time and depths. This is the first study to report on P. oceanica vegetative recruitment on artificial rubble after a disturbance event. It appears that the valleys between the <b>rubble</b> <b>mounds</b> are suitable for seagrass recruitment as sediment deposited between the rubble provides the necessary resources for plant settlement and growth. Once the seagrass patches are established, they may start a positive feedback of attenuation of currents, sediment accumulation and seagrass patch expansion...|$|R
40|$|Quay structures, one of {{the major}} {{components}} of port facilities, are embedded in undersea <b>rubble</b> <b>mounds</b> and reach above the sea level, thus exposing them directly to powerful wave forces such as tidal waves, typhoons and earthquakes. The design of quay structures requires careful selection of the type of structures concerning the external stability followed by a detailed structural design to determine geometry and associated dimensions of the structure. In this paper, a multi-stage decision-making methodology based on LCC (Life Cycle Cost) -based value analysis, structural reliability, and optimization techniques is proposed for the optimal design of a quay structure. The concept of this decision-making methodology is based on the gradual evolution of design details. Probabilistic approaches are taken to deal with the different characteristics of design stages rationally. The feasibility of the proposed decision-making methodology is also reviewed by applying it to a real-world case of port facility design...|$|R

50|$|KOLOS are {{randomly}} {{placed on}} <b>rubble</b> <b>mound</b> breakwaters in two layers.

The random placement of the units facilitates increased rate of placement and less dependence on complex placement techniques. A damage level of 0.5% is allowable in the design of KOLOS armour layer without inflicting damage to the underlayers of the breakwater.|$|E
50|$|The {{layout of}} the new port, {{including}} the layout of approach channel, turning circle and harbour basins has been derived from optimisations based on port operations, construction costs and possible future extensions.

The secondary breakwater {{was replaced by a}} barrier. The barrier consists of a core from sand, internally fortified by a protective geo-bag layer, a revetment on the harbour side and an artificial beach on the seaward side.|$|E

40|$|Social {{pressure}} {{exerted by}} urban development, {{the increase in}} erosion on many coastal stretches, and the rise in sea level due to climate change {{over the last few}} decades have led governments to increase investment in coastal protection. In turn, a reduction in costs and increases in ease of construction and rate of implementation have led to sand-filled geotextile elements, such as bags, tubes, and containers, becoming an alternative or supplement to traditional coastal defence materials, such as <b>rubble</b> <b>mounds,</b> concrete, and so on. Not all coastal zones are appropriate for sand-filled geotextile structures as coastal defences. This article analyses suitable zones for locating geotextile bag revetments to protect coasts from storm erosion and concludes that the least suitable zones are the surf zone (on an open coast and on a slightly protected coast) and deep water (on an open coast), except if a suitable reinforcement is carried out when the demand makes it necessary this build this kind of defence...|$|R

The judicial zone of the Gallscheid Court, named after an execution place within Emmelshausen’s limits - Galgenscheid or Galgenhöhe, the first six letters of each being German for “gallows” - encompassed a great area, within which was, among other places, Lingerhahn.

50|$|As design wave heights get larger, <b>rubble</b> <b>mound</b> breakwaters require larger armour {{units to}} resist the wave forces. These armour units can be formed of {{concrete}} or natural rock. The largest standard grading for rock armour units given in CIRIA 683 'The Rock Manual' is 10-15 tonnes. Larger gradings may be available, but the ultimate size is limited in practice by the natural fracture properties of locally available rock. Shaped concrete armour units (such as Dolos, Xbloc, Tetrapod, etc.) can be provided in up to approximately 40 tonnes (e.g. Jorf Lasfar, Morocco), before they become vulnerable to damage under self weight, wave impact and thermal cracking of the complex shapes during casting/curing.

50|$|In 1974, he {{published}} The Riddle of the Pyramids, {{in which he}} sought to explain the whys and wherefores of the earliest Egyptian pyramids. Though Mendelssohn himself was not an Egyptologist, the book builds on advice from experts like Sir Robert Mond and Walter Emery, {{as well as his}} own visits to Egypt and Mexico. His principal thesis was that the pyramid at Meidum had collapsed during construction, a conclusion he arrived at using his knowledge of physics and which was sparked in 1966 by images of the Aberfan disaster, where Mendelssohn saw similarities to the <b>rubble</b> <b>mound</b> surrounding the Meidum pyramid, a primary destination for his travel to Egypt the year before. Working from that conclusion, he further elaborated a theory that pyramid construction in Egypt took {{on a life of its}} own during the Third and Fourth Dynasties, more or less independently of the reigns of pharaohs. His theory has not been taken up by the Egyptological community, but the book remains a stimulating and detailed study of the Egyptian pyramids.|$|E
40|$|A {{container}} terminal {{is under construction}} at the Port of Barcelona. The quay, 1. 6 km long, is made of concrete caissons founded on granular <b>rubble</b> <b>mounds.</b> The natural soil is a sequence of normally consolidated fine-grained deltaic deposits that reach a thickness of over 60 m. The quay was backfilled with hydraulic fill dredged from the seabed soils {{in front of the}} caissons quay, deposited by a rainbowing technique. A failure of a section of the quay was attributed to the static liquefaction of the hydraulic fill. This failure prompted a field campaign to identify fill properties and its liquefaction potential. Standard and seismic CPTU´s and Marchetti dilatometer tests were performed as well as a programme of laboratory tests. Available indices to estimate liquefaction potential were calculated and compared. One of the relevant issues raised after the quay failure was the ability of preloading to eliminate the liquefaction potential of the fill. In situ tests were performed on the fill before and after a large scale preload test. Liquefaction indices at those two stages are compared showing, in some cases, a reduction of liquefaction potential after preloading. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} pre- and post-settlement processes {{to the early}} life history of coral trout were examined, {{with the aim of}} understanding how events occurring {{during the first year of}} life influence adult demographic parameters. Juvenile coral trout showed distinctive patterns of distribution and abundance at sites around Green Reef, which were consistent in both space (among sites) and time (between years). These patterns were influenced by substratum characteristics, with habitat associations changing as juveniles grew. Newly settled fish initially showed strong associations with low-relief, rubble-covered sand bottoms, but switched to high-relief features such as coral heads and consolidated <b>rubble</b> <b>mounds</b> after approximately two months of benthic life. Post-settlement processes (mortality and movement) for new recruits appeared to be influenced by the amount of sand-rubble habitat available; individuals occupying areas containing relatively high amounts of this substratum suffered less mortality and were more inclined to be site-attached than those from alternate habitats. Temporal patterns of recruitment were variable, but a strong settlement event coincided with the November new moon in all years of the study. Following settlement, juveniles were site-attached, and occupied home ranges that increased in area as they grew. Home ranges of the smallest recruits (25 - 60 mm SL) showed little overlap, and this pattern appeared to be facilitated by intra-specific aggression. Agonistic behaviour was rarely observed in larger recruits (61 - 102 mm), and home ranges broadly overlapped. Recruits displayed an ability to return to former locations when displaced short distances (20 m), and the distance from which juveniles could home increased with age. Recruits displayed higher site-fidelity than 1 + fish; 88 % of marked 0 + individuals were resighted within 20 metres of their capture point, while only 20 % of one year old fish were resighted within these areas. A change in diet occurred during early growth: diets of newly settled fish consisted mostly of epibenthic crustaceans, whereas larger juveniles (60 - 100 mm) were mainly piscivorous. Coral trout of all sizes consumed fish, and most piscine prey were recent recruits to the reef. Foraging modes and diurnal feeding patterns differed between size classes: larger juveniles typically fed by ambushing prey (usually small fish), whereas small recruits concentrated feeding activities around morning hours, and typically foraged by striking at invertebrates associated with rubble substrata. 	Diets varied spatially for large juveniles, but not for small individuals: large juveniles inhabiting structurally complex habitats (coral heads, <b>rubble</b> <b>mounds)</b> shifted to a primarily piscivorous diet sooner than those from less complex habitats. Estimates of growth rates of juvenile coral trout were influenced by larval growth histories, size-selective mortality, and variations in water temperature. Significant inter- and intra-annual differences were detected in planktonic growth rate, which were positively correlated with subsequent benthic growth. These initial patterns were accentuated by higher mortality of slow-growing juveniles, which resulted in relatively faster mean growth rates for juveniles collected later in the year. Temperature also had a strong influence on growth, and accounted for 55 % of the variability in somatic growth following settlement...|$|R
