50|$|HP 9830s were {{commonly}} {{employed at}} aerospace {{companies such as}} Boeing. They were also used by some schools such as Renton, Washington, which used pencil mark-sense cards with card readers to accommodate classroom use. An HP 9830 system with an integrated hard drive was also provided by HP in the early 1970s to National Real Estate Exchange, Inc., a small company in Florida, for its use in developing early real estate software. The U.S. Coast Guard devised a teletype message-forwarding system based on 9825As which were deployed as a working prototype for a subsequent purpose-built system, and also used them in the coordination of LORAN <b>radionavigation</b> <b>transmitter</b> chains. HP9825s were {{used in conjunction with}} Oscor software to score one-design yachting regattas in remote locations, such as the 1976 World Fireball championships in Nova Scotia, the World Windsurfing championships in 1976/1977 in Canc√∫n and Bahamas, and also Laser championships. The HP9825 was selected because it was portable - the only alternatives were phone access to time sharing computers which was not reliable from these locations.|$|E
