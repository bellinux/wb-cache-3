30|$|There {{are three}} aspects of {{differentiating}} <b>reactive</b> power from active power in power system operation, {{and they should}} be considered in reliability evaluation. First, it is not efficient to transfer <b>reactive</b> power over a long distance because <b>reactive</b> power losses in transmission lines are significant and the bus voltage is very sensitive to <b>reactive</b> power. Therefore, the <b>reactive</b> power shortage is usually compensated locally in weakly connected grids. Second, the major role of <b>reactive</b> power is to maintain voltage stability/security of power systems. Therefore, the impact of <b>reactive</b> power on system reliability in terms of energy not supplied is indirect and is calculated based on the <b>reactive</b> power shortage and voltage violations. Finally, the <b>reactive</b> power losses change with system configuration and operation conditions [23, 24]. <b>Reactive</b> power requirements for voltage restoration after a contingency are heavily dependent on <b>reactive</b> power reserve distributions in a power system. In order to reasonably determine the real and <b>reactive</b> power dispatch and post contingency load shedding, the characteristics of real and <b>reactive</b> power corresponding to bus voltage and their correlation have to be considered.|$|R
