5|$|Aerojet's {{first two}} {{contracts}} {{were from the}} U.S. Navy; the Bureau of Aeronautics <b>requested</b> a solid-fuel JATO and the Wilbur Wright Field <b>requested</b> a liquid-fuel unit. The Air Corps had <b>requested</b> two thousand JATOs from Aerojet by late 1943, committing $256,000 toward Parsons' solid-fuel type. Despite this drastically increased turnover, the company continued to operate informally and remained intertwined with the GALCIT project. Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky was brought in {{as head of the}} company's research department. Haley replaced von Kármán as Aerojet chairman and imposed payroll cuts instead of reducing JATO output; the alternative was to cut staff numbers while maintaining more generous salaries, but Haley's priority was Aerojet's contribution to the war effort. Company heads including Parsons were exempted from this austerity, drawing the ire of many personnel.|$|E

We evaluated a fading procedure for maintaining high levels of compliance obtained with high-probability <b>requests.</b> Fading involved a systematic {{reduction in the number of}} high-probability <b>requests</b> and an increase in the latency between the high- and low-probability <b>requests.</b> High levels of compliance for both “do” and “don't” <b>requests</b> were maintained for 16 weeks in a 5 -year-old boy with developmental disabilities after the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence was faded. Similar maintenance was obtained for “do” <b>requests</b> in a 15 -year-old girl with developmental disabilities. For this subject, however, the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence was ineffective with “don't” <b>requests.</b> When “don't” <b>requests</b> were phrased as “do” <b>requests,</b> the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence produced high levels of compliance to the low-probability <b>request.</b> High levels of compliance to these “do” <b>requests</b> were maintained for 16 weeks after the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence was faded...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} DQRUMA/MC-CDMA protocol {{may suffer}} severe code collisions {{due to a}} limited number of <b>request</b> codes. An enhanced DQRUMA/MC-CDMA protocol using minislots for <b>request</b> accesses is proposed to reduce <b>request</b> collisions. In the proposed protocol, <b>request</b> attempts are transmitted concurrently with data packets of other calls. A random scheme (Scheme I) and a preallocated scheme (Scheme II) are distinguished depending on the methods selecting a <b>request</b> code and a <b>request</b> minislot based on a lattice pool for <b>request</b> accesses (LPRA). Both schemes yield low <b>request</b> access delay due to few or no collisions during <b>request</b> accesses. In Scheme I one of <b>request</b> minislots is selected with a randomly chosen code, while in Scheme II the minislot and the code uniquely used in <b>request</b> attempts can resolve a code collision problem during <b>request</b> accesses. The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated by simulation and its result shows that the proposed protocol outperforms the original DQRUMA/MC-CDMA protocol in terms of average total delay...|$|R
