60|$|For the estate, {{which was}} all set at a <b>rack</b> <b>rent,</b> was {{strictly}} entailed; and as Jonas had always lived beyond his income, {{there would be little}} to leave to a younger son. When their mother died the two young men, together with a sister, had been left to the father's care. She also had learnt to ride, and ride hard--to go to the stable and see that her own horse was made up--and to rate her groom in no gentle terms, if things in that department were not as they should be. She also could be eloquent on thrush, sand-cracks, and overreaches--could detect a splint or a spavin at a glance--knew all the parts and portions and joints of a horse much more accurately than she did of a sheep, and was a thorough judge of condition. Rumour also not unfrequently hinted, among the tabbies of Carrick-on-Shannon, that Miss Julia could not only ride with her brothers in the morning, but that she was also occasionally not ill inclined to drink with them of an evening.|$|E
60|$|It is odd, {{that among}} a free trading people, {{as we take}} {{ourselves}} to be, there should so many be found to close in with those counsels, who have been ever averse from all overtures towards a peace. But {{yet there is no}} great mystery in the matter. Let any man observe the equipages in this town; he shall find the greater number of those who make a figure, to be a species of men quite different from any that were ever known before the Revolution, consisting either of generals and colonels, or of such whose whole fortunes lie in funds and stocks: so that power, which according to the old maxim, was used to follow land, is now gone over to money; and the country gentleman is in the condition of a young heir, out of whose estate a scrivener receives half the rents for interest, and hath a mortgage on the whole, and is therefore always ready to feed his vices and extravagancies while there is any thing left. So that if the war continues some years longer, a landed man will be little better than a farmer at a <b>rack</b> <b>rent,</b> to the army, and to the public funds.|$|E
6000|$|And then, {{in broken}} words, {{she told him}} how she had gone up to the fever patient at Ashy, on the fatal night on which Lancelot had last seen her. Shuddering, she hinted at the horrible filth and misery she had seen, at the foul scents which had sickened her. A madness of remorse, she said, had seized her. She had gone, {{in spite of her}} disgust, to several houses which she found open. There were worse cottages there than even her father's; some tradesmen in a {{neighbouring}} town had been allowed to run up a set of <b>rack</b> <b>rent</b> hovels.--Another shudder seized her when she spoke of them; and from that point in her story all was fitful, broken, like the images of a hideous dream. 'Every instant those foul memories were defiling her nostrils. A horrible loathing had taken possession of her, recurring from time to time, till it ended in delirium and fever. A scent-fiend was haunting her night and day,' she said. 'And now the curse of the Lavingtons had truly come upon her. To perish by the people whom they made. Their neglect, cupidity, oppression, are avenged on me! Why not? Have I not wantoned in down and perfumes, while they, by whose labour my luxuries were bought, were pining among scents and sounds,--one day of which would have driven me mad! [...] And then they wonder why men turn Chartists! There are those horrible scents again! Save me from them! Lancelot--darling! Take me to the fresh air! I choke! I am festering away! The Nun-pool! [...] Take all the water, every drop, and wash Ashy clean again! Make a great fountain in it--beautiful marble--to bubble and gurgle, and trickle and foam, for ever and ever, and wash away the sins of the Lavingtons, that the little rosy children may play round it, and the poor toil-bent woman may wash--and wash--and drink--Water! water! I am dying of thirst!' ...|$|E

50|$|The {{town has}} only existed since about 1800 but grew rapidly: by 1821 {{it had a}} {{population}} of 600. During the Great Famine (1844 - 1848) many farmers were evicted by the unpopular landlord Moroney. In the years after the famine the (Protestant) Moroney family went on with <b>rack</b> <b>renting</b> and evictions. At one time the population had enough and started a boycott. The government did not like that and imprisoned all pub-owners and shopkeepers who refused to serve the family or their servant. So {{at the end of}} 1888 most pub-owners and shopkeepers were in jail.|$|R
60|$|I have {{valued the}} bishops' lands two years' {{purchase}} above the usual computed rate, because those lands {{will have a}} sanction from the King and Council in England, and be confirmed by an Act of Parliament here; besides, it is well known, that higher prices are given every day, for worse lands, at the remotest distances, and at <b>rack</b> <b>rents,</b> which I take to be occasioned by want of trade, when there are few borrowers, and the little money in private hands lying dead, {{there is no other}} way to dispose of it but in buying of land, which consequently makes the owners hold it so high.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on the mobility of eighteenth and early nineteenth century English <b>rack</b> <b>rent</b> tenant farmers and farming families, and provides new quantitative estimates of the speed of turnover in the market for farm tenure. The evidence presented should increase the degree of belief in the stylised fact of relatively low tenurial mobility, although the extent of inertia should not be exaggerated. ...|$|E

I {{translate}} [...] For {{the great}} benefit {{of those who}} know [...] What indigestion is--that inward fate [...] Which makes all Styx through one small liver flow.

5|$|Calling {{themselves}} T2 Productions, James and co-producers Stephanie Austin and B.J. <b>Rack</b> <b>rented</b> {{an office}} in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, before starting to assemble the crew for Terminator 2. Adam Greenberg, who worked on The Terminator and Ghost (1990), became director of photography, while Joseph Nemec III, {{who had worked with}} Cameron on The Abyss, was tasked with production design. The team conducted a national search for a steel mill suitable for the film's climax, eventually selecting a dormant mill in Fontana, California, after weeks of negotiations. Locating a potential Cyberdyne building was more difficult, as the site was to host numerous stunts, shootouts, and explosions. An industrial park in Fremont, California, was eventually rented {{for the duration of the}} film's production. Cameron and William Wisher completed the 140-page screenplay draft on May 10, 1990, and by July 15, the first shooting draft had been distributed to the cast and crew; particulars of the technically detailed scripts were shrouded in secrecy. Both the six-week turnaround for the script and the film's accelerated production schedule were to enable a 1991 Fourth of July release.|$|R
5000|$|The feudal dues paid in the Middle Ages to Blyth, {{in money}} and kind, were high, {{and the village}} appears not to have grown. Then came a not untypical {{succession}} of sales leading to increased rents and fines. Having belonged from Domesday to the Dissolution to the Priory of Blyth, [...] "it then came into the possession of someone {{by the name of}} York, who sold it to Sir John Lion, Citizen and Alderman of London, who left it to his nephew, who sold it to a man named More, whose stepson in Nottinghamshire historian Thoroton's time 'obtained the utmost profit the Lordship was any way able to yield him by the means of the extremest <b>rack</b> <b>rents</b> now paid'." [...] The farmland of Elton and of most surrounding villages was still cultivated by the open field system in 1790. Some of the fields today are ridged, {{but it is hard to}} say for sure whether the ridges follow the lines of medieval strips, or whether they formed part of a later system for draining the land. Even before the enclosures, the village and church were described as small, and an account of the tithes paid records that apart from the rectory and the [...] "Manor, or Hall-Farm" [...] there were only eight farms and twelve cottages, [...] "so that it seems there is not much above Half so many Farmers as in old Time." ...|$|R
50|$|The club’s {{original}} {{boat house}} was in King Stable Street in Eton, Berkshire, close to Windsor Bridge. The site was leased from Eton College for 150 years {{but in the}} mid-1990s, the College decided {{to build on the}} site and the club had to find a new home. For five years the club <b>rented</b> <b>rack</b> space from Eton College at Andrew’s Boat House (also used by the Army) just upstream from Boveney Lock. The club eventually found the present site which was split with Wraysbury Skiff and Punting Club who were also looking for a new site at the time. Wraysbury were able to stay at their existing site and withdrew. Construction was completed in 2001 and Eton Excelsior moved in in September that year.|$|R
