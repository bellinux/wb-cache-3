40|$|Elastic tendons {{can act as}} {{muscle power}} {{amplifiers}} or energy-conserving springs during locomotion. We used an in situ muscle-tendon preparation to examine the mechanical function of tendons during lengthening contractions, when muscles absorb energy. Force, length, and power were measured in the lateral gastrocnemius muscle of wild turkeys. Sonomicrometry {{was used to measure}} muscle fascicle length independently from muscle-tendon unit (MTU) length, as measured by a muscle lever system (servomotor). A series of ramp stretches of varying velocities was applied to the MTU in fully activated muscles. Fascicle length changes were decoupled from length changes imposed on the MTU by the servomotor. Under most conditions, muscle fascicles shortened on average, while the MTU lengthened. Energy input to the MTU during the fastest lengthenings was − 54. 4 J/kg, while estimated work input to the muscle fascicles during this period was only − 11. 24 J/kg. This discrepancy indicates that energy was first absorbed by elastic elements, then released to do work on muscle fascicles after the lengthening phase of the contraction. The temporary storage of energy by elastic elements also resulted in a significant attenuation of <b>power</b> <b>input</b> to the muscle fascicles. At the fastest lengthening <b>rates,</b> peak instantaneous <b>power</b> <b>input</b> to the MTU reached − 2, 143. 9 W/kg, while peak <b>power</b> <b>input</b> to the fascicles was only − 557. 6 W/kg.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{the results of}} our {{modeling}} studies on two-phase forced convection in microchannels using water as the fluid medium. The study incorporates the effects of fluid flow <b>rate,</b> <b>power</b> <b>input</b> and channel geometry on the flow resistance and heat transfer from these microchannels. Two separate numerical models have been developed assuming homogeneous and annular flow boiling. Traditional assumptions like negligible single-phase pressure drop or fixed inlet pressure have been relaxed in the models making analysis more complex. The governing equations have been solved from the grass-root level to predict the boiling front, pressure drop and thermal resistance as functions of exit pressure and heat input. The results of both the models are compared to each other and with available experimental data. It is seen that the annular flow model typically predicts higher pressure drop compared to the homogeneous model. Finally, the model has also been extended to study the effects of non-uniform heat input along the flow direction. The results show that the nonuniform power map can have a very strong effect on the overall fluid dynamics and heat transfer...|$|R
