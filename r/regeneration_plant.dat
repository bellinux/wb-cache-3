50|$|While {{the most}} common method of {{building}} Natural Swimming Pools is by using a regeneration zone, advances in NSP technology have all but made this method obsolete. Using a regeneration zone strictly limits where building an NSP is plausible. In the new Pools by Nature US Bio filtration method water flows from the pool, usually by gravity, {{through a series of}} filter systems without the need for any <b>regeneration</b> <b>plant</b> area. Skimmers are not required and after the initial stage, an automatic screen filter cleans the remaining debris particles, down to a particle size of 70 microns. At that time, water move through a Biofermenta filter system, where it is biologically purified and oxygen is added to the water. Pure water can then returned to the pool through low-wattage water pumps, dispersed from bottom outlets that drive the water up to the surface, and provide more of the needed water oxidation. This method works very well in warmer climate and achieves excellent performances in water clarity and health.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} an {{innovative}} carbon dioxide removal method that, {{differently from the}} currently employed commercial techniques, allows also to capture and store the separated CO 2 is investigated. This process, Alkali absorption with Regeneration (AwR), consists in {{a first step in}} which CO 2 is separated from the biogas by chemical absorption with an alkali aqueous solution followed by a second step in which the spent absorption solution is regenerated for reuse in the first step and the captured CO 2 is stored in a solid and thermodynamically stable form. The latter process is carried out contacting the spent absorption solution, rich in carbonate and bicarbonate ions, with a waste material characterized by a high content of calcium hydroxide and leads to the precipitation of calcium carbonate and to the regeneration of the alkali hydroxide content of the solution. The proposed processes were first investigated by preliminary laboratory and simulation analysis. On the basis of the results of these tests, air pollution control (APC) residues from Waste-to-Energy plants were selected as the material to use for the regeneration step and a pilot-scale <b>regeneration</b> <b>plant</b> was designed, built and installed in a landfill site downstream of the already existing absorption column.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the response of 18 rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes to callus induction and <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration</b> from immature embryo culture, using three media (MS, LS and N 6). To evaluate callus induction rate, the following criteria were used: callus diameter, callus fresh weight and callus dry weight. Percentage of callus water content was also measured. After transferring the produced calli from the induction media to a regeneration medium (MSR), percentage of <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration</b> was evaluated. A highly significant difference was observed among genotypes for both callus induction and <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration</b> (P&lt; 0. 01). In callus induction phase, “Nemat” and “Cheram- 2 ” cultivars were superior for callus diameter, having 4. 83 and 4. 6 mm callus diameter, respectively. “Nemat”, “Cheram- 2 ”, “Sepidrood” and “Taroum” cultivars as well as “ 33 IRCTN 91 ” and “IRFAON- 30 ” lines were significantly superior to other cultivars for callus fresh weight. Among the genotypes “Nemat”, “Zayandehrood”, “ 33 IRCTN 91 ” had the highest percentage of callus water contents. Based on <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration,</b> “ 33 IRCTN 91 ” line and “Anbarbo”, “Nemat”, “Cheram- 2 ” and “Taroum” cultivars showed highest rate of <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration</b> from callus.

Then GIS- based algorithms are used to calculate water flows and the depth-to-water index classes dry, fresh, moist and wet. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the possibility to use depth- to-water maps for site adapted planting. The results showed that use of depth-to-water maps for site adapted planting, roughly halved the proportion of improperly planted surfaces from an average of 9 % to 4 %. The variation in the values of proper surface decreased and the result became more even [...] In addition, more pine than spruce was incorrectly planted.
