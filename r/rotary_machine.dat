Once prepared, the stencil is {{wrapped around the}} ink-filled drum of the <b>rotary</b> <b>machine.</b> When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper.

500|$|Mechanization was {{gradually}} introduced to make most {{aspects of the}} industry more efficient, particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north, and therefore easier to work by machine. The slate mill evolved between 1840 and 1860, powered by a single line shaft running along the building and bringing together operations such as sawing, planing and dressing. In 1859, John Whitehead Greaves invented the Greaves sawing table to produce blocks for the splitter, then in 1856 introduced a <b>rotary</b> <b>machine</b> to dress the split slate. The splitting of the blocks to produce roofing slates proved resistant to mechanization, and continued {{to be done with}} a mallet and chisel. An extra source of income from the 1860s was the production of [...] "slab", thicker pieces of slate which were planed and used for many purposes, for example flooring, tombstones and billiard tables.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Planing and moulding operations carried out within the woodworking industry make an extensive use of <b>rotary</b> <b>machining.</b> Cuttermarks are produced on the timber surface, which are generally accepted as unavoidable. More noticeable surface defects may be produced by such factors as cutterhead imbalance, and until recently most research has concentrated on removing these defects. When a high quality finish is required, a further machining operation, such as sanding, is often required to remove cuttermarks. What is required is a modified machining process, which combines a surface closer to the ideal fixed knife finish, while retaining the flexibility, practicality and cost effectiveness of <b>rotary</b> <b>machining.</b> It has been theorized that the surface finish of planed and moulded timber products may be improved by introducing vertical cutterhead pulses. This thesis concerns the progress made towards the modification of the <b>rotary</b> <b>machining</b> process to improve surface form for planed timber components. Thus simulation of the <b>rotary</b> <b>machining</b> process is described, allowing {{an evaluation of the}} surface form quality produced by the modified machining process, and allowing a comparison to be made between the effectiveness of new machining process and conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>machining.</b> In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed machining method, a small-scale planer with an actuation system using piezoelectric actuators to control the spindle movement was designed. An electrical model of the piezoelectric actuators was combined with a finite element model of the spindle to create an overall model used for simulation. The modelling technique used represents significant progress in the field of mechatronic system modelling, and a useful tool for designing active spindle systems...|$|R
2500|$|Traditional {{horizontal}} {{injection molding}} machines {{have been used}} since the mid-1980s, however loading and unloading [...] cores are difficult so two robots are required. Moreover, the cycle time is quite long, approximately 28 seconds. These problem are overcome by using rotary or shuttle action injection molding machines. These types of machines only require one robot to load and unload cores and have a 30% shorter cycle time. However, these types of machines cost approximately 35% more than horizontal machines, require more space, and require two bottom molds (because one is in the machine during the cycle {{and the other is}} being unloaded and loaded with a new core), which adds approximately 40% to the tooling cost. For small parts, horizontal injection molding machines are still used, because the core does not weigh enough to justify the use of a <b>rotary</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
