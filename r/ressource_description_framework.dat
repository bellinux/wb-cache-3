We {{start from the}} Dagstuhl Middle Metamodel (DMM), an existing and well-defined metamodel for reverse engineering. As examples, we define some software quality metrics based on this meta-model, as well as language mappings for Java and UML/XMI. Meta-models, language mappings, and metrics have been implemented using the definitions with our <b>description</b> <b>framework</b> as the specification basis. We suggest that our <b>description</b> <b>framework</b> eliminates existing ambiguities in software metric definitions, simplifying the implementation of metrics in their original sense, an allowing for the definition of standardized metrics...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} several efforts to use {{relational}} model and database to store and manipulate Resource <b>Description</b> <b>Framework</b> (RDF).

In this paper, we introduce Semantic Data Model as a proposed data model language to store and manipulate Resource <b>Description</b> <b>Framework.</b> This study also tries to prescribe the procedure on transforming a semantic data model into a RDF data model.

The Extended Resource <b>Description</b> <b>Framework</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} to equip RDF graphs with weak and strong negation, as well as derivation rules, increasing the expressiveness of ordinary RDF graphs.

40|$|In this {{introductory}} chapter we put {{in context}} and give a brief outline {{of the work that}} we thoroughly present {{in the rest of the}} dissertation. We consider this work divided in two main parts. The first part is the Firenze Framework, a knowledge level <b>description</b> <b>framework</b> rich enough to express the semantics required for describing both semantic Web services and semantic Grid services. We start by defining what the Semantic Grid is and its relation with the Semantic Web; and the possibility of their convergence since both initiatives have become mainly service-oriented. We also introduce the main motivators of the creation of this framework, one is to provide a valid <b>description</b> <b>framework</b> that works at knowledge level; the other to provide a <b>description</b> <b>framework</b> that takes into account the characteristics of Grid services in order to be able to describe them properly. The other part of the dissertation is devoted to Vega, an event-driven architecture that, by means of proposed knowledge level <b>description</b> <b>framework,</b> is able to achieve high scale provisioning of knowledge-intensive services. In this introductory chapter we portrait the anatomy of a generic event-driven architecture, and we briefly enumerate their main characteristics, which are the reason that make them our choice...|$|R
