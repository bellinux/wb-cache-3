40|$|Estimates of the <b>real</b> <b>term</b> {{structure}} for the euro area implied by French index-linked bonds are obtained {{by means of a}} smoothing spline methodology. The <b>real</b> <b>term</b> structure allows computation of the constant-maturity inflation compensation, which is compared with the surveyed inflation expectations in order to obtain a rough measure of the inflation risk premium. The comparison between the inflation compensation and the inflation swap shows that the two variables are closely interlinked but differently affected by illiquidity during periods of stress. The methodology used in this paper is quite effective at capturing the general shape of the <b>real</b> <b>term</b> structure while smoothing through idiosyncratic variations in the yields of index-linked bonds. Real interest rates tend to be quite stable at longer horizons and the average 10 -year real rate from 2002 to 2009 is close to 2 per cent. Furthermore, evidence is found that inflation compensation was held down in the period 2008 - 09 by an increase in the liquidity premium of index-linked bonds. index-linked bond, <b>real</b> <b>term</b> structure, inflation compensation, inflation risk premium, smoothing spline...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{asks the}} {{question}} of whether the newly available TIPS yields data can help us achieve a better understanding of the <b>real</b> <b>term</b> structure and the inflation expectations. The yield differential between TIPS and comparable nominal coupon securities is not a direct measure of inflation expectations, because it contains inflation risk premium, and because the TIPS yield may depart from the true "real yield," due to low investor demand especially in the early years. Without using data from the (indexed) real bond market, we cannot fully identify the real interest rate from the inflation risk premium, unless we assume that all information affecting the <b>real</b> <b>term</b> structure is reflected in the nominal bond prices. Even with this assumption, empirical identification of the <b>real</b> <b>term</b> structure is hard to achieve because of the poor measurement and the frequent revisions of the price series. We develop a flexible multifactor term-structure model to allow for suitable specifications of liquidity premium on TIPS, as well as complications caused by lagged indexation.

The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed.

Previously, Mishkin (1990) assumed a constant expected <b>real</b> <b>term</b> spread in a similar inflation forecasting model. We further extend the model by allowing the coefficient of the nominal yield spread also to vary with time. Results show that the model based on the time-varying expected real rate, estimated with the Kalman filter, is more suitable than the model based on the constant real rate. Also, the term spread lagged one period has more information on future inflation than the contemporaneous term. Finally, the forecasting power of a model with a randomly time-varying yield spread is inferior to the other versions examined. ...|$|R

This will be time varying and can be estimated by combining {{the information in the}} nominal term structure with that in the <b>real</b> <b>term</b> structure. We estimate these risk premia using a generalized CIR affine-yield model, with one factor driving the <b>real</b> <b>term</b> structure of monthly observations on two-year, five-year and ten-year UK index-linked debt and two factors driving the term structure of the corresponding nominal yields. Our estimates show that the inflation risk premium contributes on average about 100 basis points to nominal yields. Since the exit from the ERM this has fallen to 70 basis points, showing greater policy credibility. The inflation risk premium provides a correction to the break-even method of forecasting inflation and produces an unbiased forecast.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the nominal}} and <b>real</b> interest rate <b>term</b> {{structures in the}} United Kingdom over the fifteen-year period that the UK monetary authorities have pursued an explicit inflation target, using a four-factor essentially affine term structure model. The model imposes no-arbitrage restrictions across nominal and real yields, enabling us to decompose nominal forward rates into expected real short rates, expected inflation, <b>real</b> <b>term</b> premia and inflation risk premia. We find that inflation risk premia and longer-term inflation expectations fell significantly when the Bank of England was made operationally independent in 1997. The 'conundrum' of unusually low long-term real rates that began in 2004 is mainly attributed by the model to a fall in <b>real</b> <b>term</b> premia, though {{a significant part of}} the fall is left unexplained. The relative inability of the model to fit long real forwards during much of this recent period may reflect strong pension fund demand for index-linked bonds. Moreover, the model decompositions suggest that these special factors affecting the index-linked market may also partly account for the contemporaneous rise in longer-horizon inflation breakeven rates.
