50|$|Appleton {{thought the}} best place to look for {{evidence}} of the ionosphere was in the variations he believed it was causing around sunset in radio signal receptions. It was sensible to suggest these variations were due to the interference of two waves but an extra step to show that the second wave causing the interference (the first being the ground wave) was coming down from the ionosphere. The experiment he designed had two methods to show ionospheric influence and both allowed the height of the lower boundary of reflection (thus the lower boundary of the reflecting layer) to be determined. The first method was called frequency modulation and the second was to calculate the angle of arrival of the reflected signal at the <b>receiving</b> <b>aerial.</b>|$|E

There was a large glass window between the control room and studio so presenters waiting to do their spot could keep an eye on proceedings. Although paid-for advertising was not allowed the service did run a card advertising service whereby an automatic card sorter would show a continuous programme of postcard adverts. Unfortunately the machine used for this service was very unreliable and the card sorter would often get jammed.|$|E

40|$|Honeybee populations {{around the}} world are {{experiencing}} a decrease in colony numbers probably due to a combination of different causes, such as diseases, poor nutrition and frequent applications of insecticides to control pests. Previous studies about the effect of pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) on Apis mellifera L. report different results. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the effect of field aerial applications of Btk on bee colony performance, specifically on the brood cell percentage evolution, which can be used as an indicator of queen health and brood development breeding rates. To achieve it, the brood cell surface was photographed in every sampling, and data were analyzed using a method based on image treatment software. A total of 480 pictures were examined from two groups of four nucleus hives in two areas, one <b>receiving</b> <b>aerial</b> spraying with Btk and the other without treatment. A mixed factorial design was realized to analyse the data showing no differences in colony performance between the two groups of colonies either before the treatment, during and at the end of the assay. Furthermore, the brood surface ratio of Btk- treated/untreated increased along the experiment. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that Btk aerial applications did not affect the brood development of honeybees under natural conditions. Nevertheless further field studies are required to ascertain a safe use of Btk in forest pest management. </p...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the amplifiers (TMA) design and performance serve to lower the of an EPHEMT low noise system noise figure (NF) amplifier MMIC and its in cellular base-stations. evaluation circuit For performance reasons, the TMA is located as near to the <b>receiving</b> <b>aerial</b> as practical {{and has to be}} connected {{to the rest of the}} radio at the tower’s base by a long run of coaxial cable. The parameters critical to TMA performance are low NF for reasons of optimizing coverage area, high gain to overcome the cable loss, and high linearity as the TMA must operate reliably in a crowded RF spectrum. Additionally, the TMA is required to present a nonreflective input and output terminations, that is, a return loss (RL) of – 20 dB, and yet exhibits sub- 1 dB NF. LNA designs for TMA service typically rely on the hybrid-coupled balanced amplifier arrangement to satisfy this challenging combination of noise and RL requirements [1]. Unfortunately, the balanced amplifier approach increases the cost, size and power consumption of the LNA. The MMIC device described henceforth (Avago Technologies MGA- 632 P 8) represents an important milestone for cellular TMA designs as it simultaneously achieves both target RL and NF without relying on costly and spacehogging hybrid couplers (also known as quadrature hybrids). A means for varying the gain is provided to fulfill customers ’ requirement for gain leveling between adjacent bands, e. g., at PCS and WCDMA. Device and Packaging Design The semiconductor technology that forms the basis of this MMIC is EPHEMT structures on a GaAs wafer; a combination that enables the lowest noise figure of all RF technologies at a reasonable cost [2]. A half micron gate length was chosen as a compromise between high frequency performance and manufacturability and yield [3]. This process has a nominal gain product bandwidth (...|$|E
