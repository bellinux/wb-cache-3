40|$|Abstract: Bluetooth is an {{emerging}} wireless technology that supports ad hoc networking. With increasing interest in energy constrained multi-hop wireless networks, a fundamental {{problem is to}} determine energy efficient communication strategies over these multi-hop networks. In this paper, an asynchronous and distributed energy-efficient Bluetooth scatternet construction algorithm is proposed. First, all random distributed nodes are self-organized into piconets with bounded number of slaves within k; then select bridge nodes to interconnect piconets into a scatternet. The election of the master or bridge is driven by a node which has the plenteous energy and strong receiving signals. Any two adjacent piconets is connected by one route, and every bridge is assigned an exact role by the role transition diagram. The resulting scatternet is a connected mesh-like network, master and bridge nodes constitute a connected dominating set of the scatternet. Route discovery for the scatternet can be realized by using the similar dynamic source routing protocol through masters and bridges which have <b>relative</b> good <b>duty</b> <b>time.</b> The simulation results confirm good functionality of scatternet including a considerable gain in network lifetime...|$|R

40|$|Most muscles {{can be used}} {{to perform}} {{different}} types of motor behavior that range between short powerful contractions for the generation of rapid movements and prolonged low level contractions for the maintenance of posture. These different types of motor behavior are reflected in the muscle’s electromyogram (EMG) and can be quantified in terms of the level and duration of EMG bursts. The total duration of muscle activity during the day, which is defined by the <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> (Hensbergen and Kernell, 1997; Langenbach et al., 2004), is associated with both the number of bursts and their lengths generated during the different motor tasks. Differences in <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> between muscles have been related to their fiber type composition (Monster, 1978; Kernell and Hensbergen, 1998). Muscles largely involved in postural activities generally show high <b>duty</b> <b>times</b> and contain a large percentage of slow type fibers. In contrast, more phasically active muscles show relatively low <b>duty</b> <b>times</b> and generally contain a small percentage of slow type fibers.

40|$|AIMS: To {{examine the}} effect of {{mechanical}} loading on the induction of temporomandibular joint osteoarthrosis (TMJ OA). METHODS: Mechanical stress was applied to the rat TMJ by forced jaw opening of 3 hours a day for 5 days. The electromyographic (EMG) activity of the masseter and digastric muscles was continuously monitored by radio-telemetry. It was characterized by the total time each muscle was active (<b>duty</b> <b>time),</b> the number of bursts, and the average burst length. For histologic analysis, rats were sacrificed before, immediately after, and 3 weeks after the period of forced jaw opening. RESULTS: The condylar cartilage revealed OA-like lesions with a {{decrease in the number of}} chondrocytes immediately after forced jaw opening. Three weeks later, the OA-like lesions were repaired to some extent. After the forced jaw opening, the <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> of the masseter increased, whereas the <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> of the digastric decreased significantly (P <. 01) at the 5 % activity level. Three weeks later, the masseter <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> had decreased and the digastric <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> had slightly increased, returning to the levels observed before forced jaw opening. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that mechanical overloading of the TMJ induced OA-like lesions with a simultaneous influence on jaw muscle activity, especially at the low activity level. This might imply that muscle activity adapted to reduce the effects of (forced) joint overloading...|$|R

40|$|For the intensively studied {{vehicle routing problem}} (VRP), two real-life {{restrictions}} {{have received}} only minor attention in the VRP-literature: traffic congestion and driving hours regulations. Traffic congestion causes late arrivals at customers and long travel times resulting in large transport costs. To account for traffic congestion, time-dependent travel times should be considered when constructing vehicle routes. Next, driving hours regulations, which restrict the available driving and working times for truck drivers, must be respected. Since violations are severely fined, also driving hours regulations should be considered when constructing vehicle routes, even more in combination with congestion problems. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a solution method for the VRP with time windows (VRPTW), time-dependent travel times, and driving hours regulations. The major difficulty of this VRPTW extension is to optimize each vehicle’s departure times to minimize the <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> of each driver. Having compact <b>duty</b> <b>times</b> leads to cost savings. However, obtaining compact <b>duty</b> <b>times</b> is much harder when time-dependent travel times and driving hours regulations are considered. We propose a restricted dynamic programming (DP) heuristic for constructing the vehicle routes, and an efficient heuristic for optimizing the vehicle’s departure times for each (partial) vehicle route, such that the complete solution algorithm runs in polynomial time. Computational experiments demonstrate the trade-off between travel distance minimization and <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> minimization, and illustrate the cost savings of extending the depot opening hours such that traveling before the morning peak and after the evening peak becomes possible...|$|R
40|$|For an {{understanding}} of how various degrees of altered use (training, disuse) affect the properties of skeletal muscles, {{it is important to know}} how much they are used normally. The main aim of the present project was to produce such background knowledge for hindlimb muscles of the cat. In four adult female cats, each one being studied in several experimental sessions, ankle muscles were chronically implanted with electrodes for electromyographic (EMG) recording. The muscles recorded from were: extensor digitorum longus (EDL), peroneus longus (PL), tibialis anterior (TA), lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and soleus (SOL). For FL, TA and LG, there were anterior as well as posterior recording sites. During 24 -h experimental sessions, the studied animal stayed, together with another cat, in a box large enough for playing and walking around. Using telemetric techniques, samples of EMG signals were recorded on tape for 4 min every 30 min. In an off-line analysis, measurements were made of the total accumulated duration of activity from each one of the studied muscle regions. These ''duty times'' were expressed as a percentage of total sampling duration. When averaged over the whole 24 -h experimental period, the mean <b>duty</b> <b>times</b> per muscle region varied from 1. 9 % for EDL up to about 13. 9 % for SOL. Also, among predominantly fast muscles of mixed-fibre composition (i. e. all studied muscles except SOL), marked and statistically significant differences in <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> were found, mean values varying fivefold from 1. 9 % (EDL) to 9. 5 % (PL, posterior site). For all three muscles with simultaneous recordings from different sites, consistent and statistically significant differences in daily <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> were found between anterior and posterior regions (anterior less than posterior for TA and FL; anterior more than posterior for LG). We also measured the extent to which each 4 -min sampling period was filled with activity (if any). As compared to muscles with a low mean 24 -h <b>duty</b> <b>time,</b> those with high <b>duty</b> <b>times</b> were not active during more sampling periods per day, but, whenever being used, their activity lasted relatively longer. Such results were consistent with the view that differences in mean 24 -h <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> might largely reflect differences in the extent to which the various muscles and muscle regions were used for long-lasting stabilizing contractions...|$|R

40|$|Most {{solution}} {{methods for}} the {{vehicle routing problem}} with time windows (VRPTW) develop routes from the earliest feasible departure time. However, in practice, temporal traffic congestions make that such solutions are not optimal with respect to minimizing the total <b>duty</b> <b>time.</b> Furthermore, VRPTW solutions do not account for complex driving hours regulations, which severely restrict the daily travel time available for a truck driver. To deal with these problems, we consider the vehicle departure time optimization (VDO) problem as a post-processing step of solving a VRPTW. We propose an ILP-formulation that minimizes the total <b>duty</b> <b>time.</b> The obtained solutions are feasible with respect to driving hours regulations and they account for temporal traffic congestions by modeling time-dependent travel times. For the latter, we assume a piecewise constant speed function. Computational experiments show that problem instances of realistic sizes can be solved to optimality within practical computation <b>times.</b> Furthermore, <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> reductions of 8 percent can be achieved.

The masseter consisted of mostly fast-type MyHC. The increment of OVD increased not only the <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> at activity levels exceeding 5, 20, 50 and 80 % of the day’ peak activity in both muscles but also the proportion of MyHC IIa in the masseter muscle and MyHC I in the digastric muscle at the expense of that of MyHC IIb.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, fatigue has been widely studied and has proven scientifically {{to be a threat}} to flight {{operations}} and aircrews, as evidenced in disastrous aviation accidents. Internationally, it is recognised that the prevention or minimization of fatigue requires a collaborative approach, hence not just individuals. However, because of individual differences in coping with fatigue, the complex factors associated with fatigue, and the dynamics in aviation operations, it has proven unrealistic to expect to have a "one size fits all" policy to manage fatigue. Nevertheless, with increased competition in the aviation domain, aircrews are increasingly made to work according to organisational requirements through rosters or schedules that function in " 24 / 7 " settings. Such arrangements have been, and are still being mandated by flight and <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> limitations in civil aviation rules elsewhere. With increased knowledge on the effects of fatigue in the cause of accidents and incidents, it has for some time been known that the historical prescriptive approach does not address potential fatigue-related factors. Australia and New Zealand Civil Aviation Authorities have led the way in developing an alternative approach in the management of fatigue, in a move to operate beyond mandated flight and <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> limitations. Such an approach does not intend to breach current prescriptive rules, but rather incorporate industry views by establishing an alternative strategy in managing aircrew fatigue considered best for the operation, organisation and the pilot. Given the minimal information available on fatigue management in the New Zealand Aviation Industry, this study was initiated to gather perceptions from management, rostering staff and pilots on how their organisations are currently managing fatigue, via a questionnaire. Results of the study showed that 33 % of participants reported maintaining AC 119 - 2 in meeting their flight and <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> limits, 9 % indicated using AC 119 - 2 with dispensations, 11 % stated that they have an accredited fatigue management scheme, 10 % indicated "don't know" and 38 % reported using "other" methods as an alternative to mandated flight and <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> rules. The high percentage of participants opting for "other" methods is an indication that participants are not confident in positively identifying constructive strategies existing within their organisation. This reveals that knowledge on current rules and guidelines pertaining to flight and <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> limitations is lacking. The main implication of the study is that knowledge on prescribed flight and <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> limitations (AC 119 - 2) and fatigue management (AC 119 - 03) in the aviation industry requires substantial enhancement to ensure an effective and sustainable non­ prescriptive approach in the management of fatigue. The study further suggests that more informed education on AC 119 - 2 could be advocated in the industry as a starting point, which may form a strong and mature basis for the development of successful and effective fatigue management schemes. These suggestions warrant a participatory and combined effort involving the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority and the New Zealand Aviation Industry...|$|R

High velocity jet is activated electro-thermally by high frequency pulsed DC discharge in small cavity. A cavity of 2. 38 mm diameter cylinder bounded by circular electrode {{is made in}} a ceramic plate and a small orifice of 1. 78 mm diameter is drilled {{in the middle of}} cavity. High frequency pulsed DC discharge instantaneously heats air in the cavity and produces high velocity jet at the exit of the orifice. Schlieren imaging at high framing rate of 100 kHz reveals the presence of supersonic precursor shock followed by the jet emerging from the orifice. The jet velocity reaches as high as about 300 m/s. Jet with smaller cavity volume produces lesser effect and jet velocity reaches maximum at certain cavity volume with given discharge current and orifice size. As <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> of pulse increases from 5 to 20 μs at fixed frequency of 5 kHz, the jet velocity also increases and becomes nearly constant with further increase in <b>duty</b> <b>time.</b> At fixed <b>duty</b> <b>time</b> of 20 μs, higher frequency pulsing of 10 kHz produces degradation of the jet as the discharge pulse continues.
