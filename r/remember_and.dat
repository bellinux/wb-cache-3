5|$|Begin Again premiered on September 7, 2013 at the Toronto International Film Festival, where The Weinstein Company {{acquired}} the U.S. distribution {{rights to the}} film for $7 million. It was later screened on April 26, 2014 on the closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival. The film's title was changed from Can a Song Save Your Life? to Begin Again between its festival premiere and its theatrical release because viewers {{found it difficult to}} <b>remember</b> <b>and</b> it was often misquoted.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{released}} on December 24, 2010. It was directed by Don Tyler, who previously worked on videos for the bands A Day to <b>Remember</b> <b>and</b> Flyleaf. It was digitally released on June 14, 2011 via iTunes Store and the same day was also uploaded on the band's Vevo channel on YouTube. Shot in an animated technique, the video starts with an animated version of lead singer Levine singing on a microphone while hands are behind his back touching his body. As the video progresses, a nude animated woman is shown dancing around him and flirting with {{the other members of}} the band. Several animation effects such as angel wings and devil elements are shown behind Levine as he is singing, while the woman is also dancing for the other members. The video finishes with a close shot of Levine's face.|$|E
5|$|Rhythm game, or rhythm action, is a subgenre {{of action}} game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player {{is required to}} press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games that measure rhythm and pitch, {{in order to test}} a player's singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says, in that the player must watch, <b>remember,</b> <b>and</b> repeat complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action can take a minigame format with some games blending rhythm with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.|$|E

25|$|Playing {{with toys}} is {{considered}} to be important when it comes to growing up and learning about the world around us.

25|$|The {{idea for}} a new church in the newly {{developed}} Quartiere della Vittoria (literally District of Victory, named for the victory in World War I) came from Ottavio Gasparri, member of the Sacred Heart of Jesus religious institute. At first the church was to be named Tempio della Pace, to <b>remember</b> <b>and</b> honour the fallen of World War I. Construction began in May 1920. The original design proposed by Marcello Piacentini {{was inspired by the}} churches built in Rome in the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, {{the range of}} {{available}} numbers was once again starting to run out, exacerbated by a move to biannual changes in registration letters (March and September) in 1999 to smooth out the bulge in registrations every August, so a new scheme needed to be adopted. It was decided to research a system that would be easier for crash or vehicle related crime witnesses to <b>remember</b> <b>and</b> clearer to read, yet still fit within a normal standard plate size.|$|E
25|$|Cued recall is when {{a person}} is given a list of items to <b>{{remember}}</b> <b>and</b> is then tested with cues to remember material. Researchers have used this procedure to test memory. Participants are given pairs, usually of words, A1-B1, A2-B2...An-Bn (n is the number of pairs in a list) to study. Then the experimenter gives the participant a word to cue the participant to recall the word with which it was originally paired. The word presentation can either be visual or auditory.|$|E

25|$|Human {{knowledge}} {{is based on}} stories and the human brain consists of cognitive machinery necessary to understand, <b>remember</b> <b>and</b> tell stories. Humans are storytelling organisms that both individually and socially, lead storied lives. Stories mirror human thought as humans think in narrative structures and most often remember facts in story form. Facts {{can be understood as}} smaller versions of a larger story, thus storytelling can supplement analytical thinking. Because storytelling requires auditory and visual senses from listeners, one can learn to organize their mental representation of a story, recognize structure of language and express his or her thoughts.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, {{with the}} country still in the Depression, Morgan {{was unable to find}} a {{position}} in commercial art and occupied spare time as an occasional book reviewer for a city newspaper, the Salt Lake Tribune. In August 1938, again helped by a tip and recommendation from a friend, Morgan capitalized on his career as a reviewer to join the Utah Historical Records Survey as a part-time editor and publicist. Within a short time his ability to <b>remember</b> <b>and</b> associate facts brought him into a front-row position writing for the HRS. By 1940 he was transferred to the Utah Writers' Project to complete the state guidebook. Later he became director of the state branch of the Federal Writers Project.|$|E
25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and <b>remember</b> <b>and</b> write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{more than}} 90% of its history, Homo sapiens lived in small bands as nomadic hunter-gatherers. As {{language}} became more complex, {{the ability to}} <b>remember</b> <b>and</b> communicate information resulted, according to a theory proposed by Richard Dawkins, in a new replicator: the meme. Ideas could be exchanged quickly and passed down the generations. Cultural evolution quickly outpaced biological evolution, and history proper began. Between 8500 and 7000 BC, humans in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals: agriculture. This spread to neighboring regions, and developed independently elsewhere, until most Homo sapiens lived sedentary lives in permanent settlements as farmers. Not all societies abandoned nomadism, especially those in isolated areas of the globe poor in domesticable plant species, such as Australia. However, among those civilizations that did adopt agriculture, the relative stability and increased productivity provided by farming allowed the population to expand.|$|E
25|$|Christie allows some culprits {{to escape}} earthly justice {{for a variety}} of reasons, such as the passage of time (retrospective cases), in which the most {{important}} characters have already died, or by active prescription. Such cases include The Witness for the Prosecution, Murder on the Orient Express, The Man in the Brown Suit, Elephants Can <b>Remember,</b> <b>and</b> The Unexpected Guest. There are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die {{as a direct result of}} his plot, sometimes by his own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective (usually Hercule Poirot). This occurs in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Death on the Nile, Dumb Witness, Crooked House, The Hollow, The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, Cat Among the Pigeons, Peril at End House, Nemesis, Appointment with Death, The Secret Adversary, and Curtain. In the last of these (Curtain), no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010 {{the show}} was revived for a six-month {{national}} tour produced by Bruce James Productions Limited and written by Paul Carpenter and Ian Gower, adapting scenes and storylines from episodes of the television series including A Night Not To <b>Remember</b> <b>and</b> Maplin Intercontinental. The audience were treated as campers during scenes involving camp entertainment which included musical numbers and audience participation. The production starred {{two members of the}} original cast, Barry Howard, reprising his role of Barry Stuart-Hargreaves, and Nikki Kelly, originally Sylvia, taking the role of Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves. The tour also starred Peter Amory as Jeffrey Fairbrother, Abigail Finley as Peggy Ollerenshaw, Rebecca Bainbridge as Gladys Pugh, Damian Williams as Ted Bovis, Ben Roddy as Spike Dixon, Richard Colson as William Partridge, Andrew Fettes as Fred Quilley, Kate Burrell as Sylvia Garnsey, Lauren Harrison as Betty Whistler and Carrie Laurence as Tracey Bentwood.
