25|$|A few {{isolated}} outcropping seamounts that pierce {{through more}} than 200 m of impermeable sediments, are conduits that allow hydrologic exchange between the open ocean and the upper oceanic crust—the largest aquifer of the planet. The Cascadia Basin site {{is placed in the}} vicinity of several circulation obviation <b>retrofit</b> <b>kit</b> (CORK) borehole observatories, which are designed to study the hydrology, geochemistry and microbiology of the upper oceanic crust. CORKs are also being used to investigate changes in regional plate strain that are caused by earthquakes on the plate boundaries. The seafloor pressure measurements of the CORK borehole observatories constitute the center of a “tsunami-meter”, a network of several high precision, rapid sampling bottom pressure recorders (BPRs), that allows precise determination of deep water tsunami amplitude, direction of propagation, and speed.|$|E

40|$|LED <b>retrofit</b> <b>kits</b> and linear {{replacement}} lamps are {{now available}} to convert recessed fluorescent light fixtures (or ‘troffers’) in commercial buildings such as offices and retail. These retrofits re-use the top portion of the existing troffer, so the space above the dropped ceiling is not disturbed. Compared to complete troffer replacement, LED retrofits can usually be installed more quickly, with less dust and disturbance of the occupants. Two types of retrofits are available. LED linear replacement lamps are shaped like fluorescent lamps. They reuse the existing lens, and often the existing lamp holders. Integrated-style LED <b>retrofit</b> <b>kits</b> are not shaped like fluorescent lamps. Some reuse the existing lens, while others provide a new customized lens, to enhance appearance and light distribution. Note that besides LED kits, energy efficient kits with new customized lenses are also available with new fluorescent HPT 8 ’s. A recently published report [1] found that, among 21 LED troffer products purchased in summer 2012, most dedicated LED troffers performed better than most LED retrofits. However, as new LED <b>retrofit</b> <b>kits</b> continue to enter the market, early adopters may find products suitable for various applications...|$|R

5000|$|Corded window blinds {{present a}} {{strangulation}} hazard to children, causing 184 {{deaths in the}} United States between 1996 and 2012. Recalls of window covering products have not significantly {{reduced the number of}} deaths since 1980. <b>Retrofit</b> <b>kits</b> have been used since 1995 to [...] "reduce" [...] the strangulation hazard; however, children have strangled on <b>retrofit</b> <b>kits</b> since 1995. The US CPSC recommends using cordless or cord-free window coverings where children live or visit. For window coverings that use continuous-loop cord systems, like vertical blinds, a wall cord cleat can be used to anchor the cord tightly to the wall and prevent children from having access to the dangling cord loop. Window blinds slats are held together with cords that allow for tilting slats, raising or lowering, and these are potentially dangerous if loose. As an added precaution, cord stops should be installed correctly and adjusted to restrict the movement of inner lift cords.|$|R

40|$|The member {{agencies}} of the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) implement a range of water conservation programs to reduce water waste. These programs are described below. Rebates and Incentives Indoor Test Kit: The SNWA offers free indoor water audit kits that include a water-flow measuring bag for showerheads and faucets and a toilet leak detection tablet (SNWA 2007 a). For customers with high consumption levels, SNWA can offer additional assistance, including field visits, information, and incentives. Indoor Fixture Retrofit Kits: The SNWA offers free fixture <b>retrofit</b> <b>kits</b> to customers with homes built prior to the 1989 ordinance requiring low-flow fixtures (SNWA 2007 a). The <b>retrofit</b> <b>kits</b> include faucet aerators, leak detection tablets, a toilet flapper, and a low-water use showerhead. Although heavily promoted in 1997 and 1998, this program has served over 15, 000 homes 1 —a {{relatively small number of}} households. The SNWA contends that participation in this program is low due to market saturation (Sovocool 2007). Water Conservation Education: The SNWA offers several programs to educate citizens and contractors about water conservation efforts they can implement. In 2003, the Water Smart Contractor program was initiated to train contractors to use methods that improve landscape water efficiency on new landscape installations and retrofits. The SNWA has implemented a school water education program that trains teachers, creates a youth advisory council, and provides classroom materials to educate students on water conservation.
