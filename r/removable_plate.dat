30|$|Until now, little {{information}} has been available about the posttreatment stability of orthodontic treatment using implant anchorage[10]. Sugawara et al.[15] found minimal short-term relapse, and no significant correlation {{was found between the}} amount of relapse and tipping ratio and the amount of tooth movement. Lima and Lima[11] showed 4 years of stable retention after distalization of the mandibular dentition in the treatment of class III open bite adult patients. Many factors may affect posttreatment stability, including prolonged or permanent retention, maintaining pretreatment arch form and intercanine width, obtaining proper occlusal relationship and function, and taking into account muscle balance and harmony[26, 27]. In our case, we managed retention with a lower bonded splint and an upper <b>removable</b> <b>plate.</b> Miniscrew removal was deferred to permit an immediate correction of any eventual relapse.

40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} {{results on}} the advance of a mixing or non-mixing front occurring at a density interface due to gravitational acceleration are analyzed considering the fractal structure of the front. The experimental configuration consists on a unstable two layer system held by a <b>removable</b> <b>plate</b> in a box. The initial density difference {{is characterized by the}} Atwood number. The evolution of the instability is non dimensionalized by τ = (Ag/H). As the plate is removed the gravitational acceleration, generates a combination of spikes and bubbles, which reach maximum complexity and local mixing efficiency before the front reaches the end walls. The instability produced is known as Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability, and in its simplest forms occurs when a layer of dense fluid is placed on top of a less dense layer in a gravitational field. The instability forms a turbulent front between the two layers developing a cascade of secondary instabilities in a non-homogeneous fashion. A Large Eddy Simulation numerical model using FLUENT is used to predict some of the global features of the experiments, different models on the interaction of the bubble generated buoyancy flux and on the boundary conditions are compared with the experiments.

The muscle activity at rest was unchanged during the period of observation. The activity during maximal biting, chewing, and swallowing decreased during the phase of proclination, which was interpreted as a result of occlusal instability. The positions of the mandible at rest, at intercuspation, and during chewing were stable during the treatment.

40|$|OBJETIVO: avaliar as possíveis alterações e a estabilidade dentária e esquelética no sentido transversal, bem como as possíveis alterações verticais da face (AFAI), produzidas pela Expansão Rápida da Maxila Assistida Cirurgicamente (ERMAC). MÉTODOS: a amostra selecionada para este estudo retrospectivo foi composta por 60 telerradiografias em norma frontal, de 15 pacientes, sendo 6 do gênero masculino e 9 do gênero feminino, com média de idades de 23 anos e 3 meses. O disjuntor Hyrax foi instalado e o procedimento cirúrgico adotado envolveu a separação da sutura palatina mediana e não-abordagem da sutura pterigomaxilar. A ativação foi realizada do terceiro dias após a cirurgia até o término da expansão, determinada por critérios clínicos. Todos os pacientes foram radiografados nas fases pré-expansão (T 1); pós-expansão imediata (T 2); 3 meses pós-expansão, com o próprio disjuntor como contenção (T 3); e 6 meses pós-expansão, com a placa removível de acrílico como contenção (T 4). Medidas lineares foram obtidas a partir dos traçados cefalométricos gerados por um programa computadorizado (Radiocef Studio 2) e analisadas estatisticamente pelos testes de variância (ANOVA) e Tukey ao nível de 5 % de significância. RESULTADOS E CONCLUSÕES: concluiu-se que a ERMAC produziu aumentos estatisticamente significativos da cavidade nasal, da largura maxilar e da distância intermolares superiores, de T 1 para T 2, os quais se mantiveram em T 3 e T 4. A largura facial e as distâncias intermolares inferiores não apresentaram alterações após a ERMAC. Avaliando o comportamento {{vertical}} da face, notou-se um aumento da AFAI nas fases T 1 para T 2, que diminuiu após a contenção de 3 meses (T 3) e permaneceu estável em T 4, embora aumentada se comparada com T 1. AIM: This study {{evaluated the}} stability of the dental and skeletal changes produced by the Surgically Assisted Rapid Maxillary Expansion (SARME) in transversal and vertical dimensions. METHODS: The sample selected for this retrospective study was comprised by 60 posteroanterior cephalograms, of 15 patients (6 males and 9 females), with mean age of 23. 3 years. An Hyrax appliance was used and the surgical procedure was characterized by the midsagittal osteotomy and non approach of pterygopalatine suture. The beginning of activation occurred in the third postoperative day, being that the limits for the expansion were determined by eminently clinical criteria. All the patients were radiographed in the following phases: pre-expansion (T 1), immediate post-expansion (T 2), three months post-expansion (with the Hyrax appliance as retention) (T 3), and six months post-expansion (with the acrylic <b>removable</b> <b>plate</b> as retention) (T 4). Linear measurements were obtained from the cephalograms tracings generated by a computerized program (Radiocef Studio 2) and statistically analyzed by the variance test (ANOVA) and Tukey at the 5 % level of significance. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: It was concluded that SARME produced a statistically significant increase of nasal cavity, maxillary width, upper intermolars distance, from T 1 to T 2, which were maintained in T 3 and T 4. The facial width and the lower intermolars distance did not presented changes after the SARME. Evaluating the vertical behavior of the face, it was observed an increase of anterior inferior facial height in phases T 1 to T 2 that decreased after three months of retention (T 3) and maintained stable in T 4, although increased if compared with T 1...|$|E

40|$|Die vorliegende Studie hatte zum Ziel, die Effizienz / die Erfolgsrate der Behandlung des Distalbisses (Angle Klasse II: 1) mittels Aktivator (Andresen-Aktivator und van-Beek-Aktivator) zu beurteilen. Es sollte geklärt werden, ob Zusammenhänge zwischen Behandlungserfolg einerseits und (1) Art des zur Behandlung verwendeten Aktivators, (2) Geschlecht, (3) Alter vor der Behandlung, (4) Behandlungsdauer, (5) Anzahl der Behandlungstermine, (6) Kooperation des Patienten, sowie (7) Okklusionsverhältnisse, (8) Dentalstadium und (9) skelettofazialer Morphologie vor der Behandlung andererseits existieren. Das Patientengut umfasste 118 Probanden (70 männliche und 48 weibliche) mit einer Angle Klasse II: 1 Dysgnathie. Die Probanden wurden bezüglich ihrer Gebissentwicklung in 3 Gruppen aufgeteilt: frühes Wechselgebiss (DS 1 und DS 2; n= 61), spätes Wechselgebiss (DS 3; n= 52) und bleibendes Gebiss (DS 4; n= 5). Vor der Aktivatortherapie wurde lediglich bei einigen Probanden eine Oberkieferdehnplatten- oder eine Quadhelix-Behandlung durchgeführt. Kieferorthopädische Modelle von vor und nach der Behandlung sowie Fernröntgenseitenbilder von vor der Behandlung wurden ausgewertet und die Patienten als erfolgreich und nicht erfolgreich therapiert eingestuft. Die Untersuchung lieferte folgende Ergebnisse: 	Von den 118 Probanden wurden 76 (= 64 %) erfolgreich und 42 (= 36 %) nicht erfolgreich therapiert. 	Es gab keine Zusammenhänge zwischen Behandlungserfolg einerseits und (1) Art des zur Behandlung verwendeten Aktivators, (2) Geschlecht, sowie (3) Alter vor der Behandlung andererseits. 	Die durchschnittliche Behandlungsdauer der Erfolgsgruppe (3, 2 Jahre) war um ca. 1 Jahr länger (p< 0, 001) als die der Nicht-Erfolgsgruppe (2, 2 Jahre). 	Die Erfolgsgruppe hatte durchschnittlich ca. 6 Behandlungstermine mehr (p< 0, 01) als die Nicht-Erfolgsgruppe. 	Behandlungsdauer und Anzahl der Behandlungstermine nahmen mit fortschreitendem Dentalstadium (DS 1 und 2 zu DS 3) ab (p< 0, 001). 	Die Erfolgsgruppe zeigte eine statistisch signifikant bessere (p< 0, 001) Kooperation als die Nicht-Erfolgsgruppe. In der Erfolgsgruppe wiesen 84, 2 % (64 / 76) der Probanden eine gute und 15, 8 % (12 / 76) eine schlechte Kooperation auf, während in der Nicht-Erfolgsgruppe 40, 5 % (17 / 42) der Probanden eine gute und 59, 5 % (25 / 42) eine schlechte Kooperation zeigten. 	Die Nicht-Erfolgsgruppe hatte vor der Behandlung tendenziell die schlechteren Okklusionsverhältnisse. In der Erfolgsgruppe bzw. der Nicht-Erfolgsgruppe verbesserte sich die sagittale Molarenrelation um durchschnittlich 0, 9 Prämolarenbreiten (Pb) bzw. um 0, 4 Pb, die sagittale Eckzahnrelation verbesserte sich um durchschnittlich 0, 5 Pb bzw. um 0, 2 Pb. Der Overjet verkleinerte sich um durchschnittlich 4 mm bzw. um 2 mm, und der Overbite verkleinerte sich um durchschnittlich 0, 5 mm bzw. er veränderte sich nicht. 	Es lag kein Zusammenhang zwischen Behandlungserfolg und Dentalstadium (DS 1 / DS 2 und DS 3) zu Behandlungsbeginn vor. 	Bezüglich der skelettofazialen Morphologie vor der Behandlung zeigte sich, dass der ANB-Winkel der Erfolgsgruppe (5, 5 °) durchschnittlich 0, 8 ° kleiner (p< 0, 05) als der der Nicht-Erfolgsgruppe (6, 3 °) war. Der Wits-Wert der Erfolgsgruppe (+ 2, 6 mm) war durchschnittlich 1, 2 mm kleiner (p< 0, 01) als der der Nicht-Erfolgsgruppe (+ 3, 8 mm). Schlussfolgernd konnte folgendes festgestellt werden: Da nur ca. 2 / 3 der Patienten erfolgreich mit einem Aktivator behandelt wurden, während ca. 1 / 3 der Behandlungen als nicht erfolgreich angesehen werden mussten, war die Effizienz der Distalbissbehandlung (Angle Klasse II: 1) mit Aktivator als mäßig zu bezeichnen. The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the degree of {{effectiveness}} and the success rate of Class II: 1 treatment using the activator (Andresen-activator and van-Beek-activator). The following questions were of interest: Is there any relationship between successful treatment on one hand and (1) the type of activator used for treatment, (2) the sex of the patient, (3) the age before treatment, (4) the treatment duration, (5) the number of treatment appointments, (6) patient cooperation, (7) pre-treatment occlusal relationships, (8) pre-treatment dental development, and (9) skeletofacial morphology before treatment on the other hand? The material consisted of 118 subjects (70 male and 48 female) with a Class II: 1 malocclusion. According to dental development the subjects were divided into three groups: early mixed dentition (DS 1 and DS 2; n= 61), late mixed dentition (DS 3; n= 52) and permanent dentition (DS 4; n= 5). In a few cases a <b>removable</b> <b>plate</b> or a quadhelix in the upper jaw was used before activator treatment. Pre- and post-treatment dental casts as well as pre-treatment lateral headfilms of each patient were evaluated and the treatment results were classified as successful or unsuccessful. The following results were obtained: 	 76 (= 64 %) out of 118 subjects were treated successfully, while 42 (= 36 %) were treated unsuccessfully. 	There was no relationship between successful treatment on one hand and (1) the type of activator used, (2) gender, and (3) pre-treatment age on the other hand. 	The mean treatment duration of the successfully treated group (3. 2 years) was about approximately 1 year longer (p< 0, 001) than that of the unsuccessfully treated group (2. 2 years). 	The successfully treated subjects needed 6 more appointments (p< 0, 01) than the unsuccessfully treated subjects. 	The treatment duration and the number of treatment appointments decreased (p< 0, 001) with progressing dental development (DS 1 and 2 to DS 3). 	The cooperation was statistically significantly better (p< 0, 001) in the successfully treated group than in the unsuccessfully treated group. In the successfully treated group 84. 2 % (64 / 76) of the subjects showed a good and 15. 8 % (12 / 76) a poor cooperation, whereas in the unsuccessfully treated group 40. 5 % (17 / 42) of the subjects showed a good and 59. 5 % (25 / 42) a poor cooperation. 	The unsuccessfully treated group had worse pre-treatment occlusal relationships than the successfully treated group. In the successfully treated group the sagittal molar relationships improved by an average of 0. 9 premolar widths (pw) and in the unsuccessfully treated group by 0. 4 pw. The sagittal canine relationships improved by an average of 0. 5 pw in the successfully treated group and by 0. 2 pw in the unsuccessfully treated group. The overjet decreased by an average of 4 mm in the successfully treated group and by 2 mm in the unsuccessfully treated group. The overbite decreased by an average of 0. 5 mm in the successfully treated group while it remained unchanged in the unsuccessfully treated group. 	There was no relationship between successful treatment and pre-treatment dental development (DS 1 / DS 2 and DS 3). 	Concerning skeletofacial morphology before treatment the ANB angle of the successfully treated group (5. 5 °) was, on average, 0. 8 ° smaller (p< 0, 05) than that of the unsuccessfully treated group (6. 3 °). The Wits-Appraisal of the successfully treated group (+ 2. 6 mm) was, on average, 1. 2 mm smaller (p< 0, 01) than that of the unsuccessfully treated group (+ 3. 8 mm). The following could be concluded: As only approximately 2 / 3 of the patients were treated successfully with an activator, whereas approximately 1 / 3 of the patients were treated unsuccessfully, the effectiveness of Class II: 1 treatment using an activator could be considered as moderate...|$|E
