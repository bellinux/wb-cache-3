40|$|The {{machinability}} {{of stainless}} steel has attracted considerable interest because of its high strength and corrosion <b>resistance.</b> <b>Cutting</b> fluids-based oil are the most unsustainable elements of machining processes, it is negatively affect {{the environmental impact of}} a process. Therefore, dry machining is the optimum solution, when applicable. Reducing energy consumption and using low-cost cutting tools under dry condition should considered for sustainable machining. Therefore, this study aims to optimize machining parameters, including power consumption and the traditional machining responses of surface roughness and tool wear. Stainless steel was turned with an uncoated carbide tool under dry conditions. A multi-objective optimization method of Response surface methodology was employed to optimize machining parameters. The significant contribution of parameters was determined on the basis of compound desirability value, and optimal levels of the parameters were identified. A confirmation test was conducted to validate results. This combination of parameters resulted in the minimum power consumption of 14. 94 % and decreased surface roughness and tool wear by 4. 71 % and 13. 98 %, respectively. Therefore, this method also effectively reduces the effects and costs of the machining process...|$|E
40|$|This licentiate thesis has {{the main}} focus on {{evaluation}} of the wear of coated and uncoated polycrystalline cubic boron nitride cutting tool used in cutting operations against hardened steel. And to exam the surface finish and integrity of the work material used. Harder work material, higher cutting speed and cost reductions result {{in the development of}} harder and more wear <b>resistance</b> <b>cutting</b> tools. Although PCBN cutting tools have been used in over 30 years, little work have been done on PVD coated PCBN cutting tools. Therefore hard turning and hard milling experiments with PVD coated and uncoated cutting tools have been performed and evaluated. The coatings {{used in the present study}} are TiSiN and TiAlN. The wear scar and surface integrity have been examined with help of several different characterization techniques, for example scanning electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy.   The results showed that the PCBN cutting tools used displayed crater wear, flank wear and edge micro chipping. While the influence of the coating on the crater and flank wear was very small and the coating showed a high tendency to spalling. Scratch testing of coated PCBN showed that, the TiAlN coating resulted in major adhesive fractures. This displays the importance of understanding the effect of different types of lapping/grinding processes in the pre-treatment of hard and super hard substrate materials and the amount and type of damage that they can create. For the cutting tools used in turning, patches of a adhered layer, mainly consisting of FexOy were shown at both the crater and flank. And for the cutting tools used in milling a tribofilm consisting of SixOy covered the crater. A combination of tribochemical reactions, adhesive wear and mild abrasive wear is believed to control the flank and crater wear of the PCBN cutting tools. On a microscopic scale the difference phases of the PCBN cutting tool used in turning showed different wear characteristics. The machined surface of the work material showed a smooth surface with a Ra-value in the range of 100 - 200 nm for the turned surface and 100 - 150 nm for the milled surface. With increasing crater and flank wear in combination with edge chipping the machined surface becomes rougher and showed a higher Ra-value. For the cutting tools used in milling the tendency to micro edge chipping was significant higher when milling the tools steels showing a higher hard phase content and a lower heat conductivity resulting in higher mechanical and thermal stresses at the cutting edge...|$|E

40|$|In {{this second}} report, the {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) trea tment which reduced friction between wood and steel in previous report was adopted as an application to wood machining and the machinability in cutting or sanding PEG treated wood was examined. The main resu 1 ts obtained are as fol 1 ows. (1) A 1 though the bending strength 0 f most PEG trea ted wood is reduced {{as compared with}} untreated wood, that of wood treated with PEG of higher molecular weight such as PEG 4000 increases. (2) The horizontal and vertical <b>cutting</b> <b>resistances</b> in <b>cutting</b> parallel to the grain are considerably reduced by PEG treatment. In this case, although the rate of reduction in <b>cutting</b> <b>resistances</b> becomes larger at the higher retention of PEG, it is independent of molecular weight of PEG. (3) The PEG treatment furthermore leads {{to an increase in}} radius of chip curvature and a decrease in roughness of cutting surface. (4) It is conjectured that the above reduction in <b>cutting</b> <b>resistances</b> is principally due to the decrease in strength in the case of wood treated with PEG of lower molecular weight and due to the decrease in coefficient of friction in the case of higher molecular weight. (5) The <b>cutting</b> <b>resistance</b> in cross sectional cutting is also reduced by PEG treatment and the cutting surface is improved. (6) In sanding, although PEG treatment reduces sanding resistance and improves sanding surface, it lessens the rate of stock removal. PEG処理木材の切削ならびに研削における被削性について検討し次の結果を得た.

A comparison between energy consumption in the cutting process for oscillatory and non-oscillatory cases was presented. Two sources of energy provide the required energy to the oscillatory soil cutting process: the oscillator driver and the tractor drawbar power. An optimum frequency was suggested for a given condition to realize a more effective soil cutting process. A tillage tool operating on agricultural soil was considered as a cantilever beam subjected to the fluctuating soil <b>cutting</b> <b>resistance.</b> A finite element model was developed to simulate {{the response of the}} deflection, velocity and acceleration of the shank and tillage tool when the soil resistance was applied {{at the end of the}} shank.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of a number of physical and chemical attributes upon muskmelon texture as described by sensory evaluation. Measurements of turgor pressure, percent moisture, total sugars, alcohol-insoluble-solids, three pectic fractions, total pectic materials, starch and cellulose were performed on 50 melons. The melons were purchased at random from a retail market in Corvallis, Oregon, over a five-week period during July and August, 1966. Subjective evaluation of textural quality was provided by a five-membered panel employing a pre-tested ballot. On five-point scales, judges rated <b>resistance</b> to <b>cutting,</b> <b>resistance</b> to biting, resistance to crushing, crispness, fibrousness and sweetness. Simple and multiple correlation analyses were performed to elucidate relationships between the objective and subjective observations. Considerable variation was found among melons for most of the attributes. Variation was largest in the case of water-soluble pectic substances and cellulose and least for alcohol-insoluble-solids. According to the results of this study, melon texture is determined to a great extent by the type and amount of cell wall constituents. Significant multiple correlations were found between cell wall constituents, cellulose and protopectin, and sensory panel scores for <b>resistance</b> to <b>cutting,</b> <b>resistance</b> to biting, resistance to crushing and crispness. Fruit maturity, as inferred from starch and protopectin content, also exerted an effect upon texture. Significant multiple correlations were found between starch and protopectin and panel scores for <b>resistance</b> to <b>cutting,</b> <b>resistance</b> to crushing and crispness. Although not specifically related to texture, a significant and positive simple correlation was found between total sugars and sweetness. Similarly, significant negative correlations were found between starch and total sugars and starch and sweetness. Turgor pressure, percent moisture, alcohol-insoluble-solids, total sugar, water-soluble pectic substances, pectates-pectinates and total pectic materials were found not to be reliable indicators of muskmelon texture. Although turgor pressure did not exhibit a significant relationship to any textural aspects, a trend was observed in the data. As a result of this observation and difficulty encountered in measuring turgor pressure, further work with this variable is recommended. Proximate composition of the melons analyzed compared favorably with published data. This observation lends confidence to the methods and analyses employed. Large standard deviations calculated for some of the attributes measured emphasize the extent of variation among melons, the difficulty in assessing texture in an objective manner and the problem encountered in marketing and purchasing the fresh fruit...|$|R
