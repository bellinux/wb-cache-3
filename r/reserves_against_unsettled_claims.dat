"I {{take you}} at your word, Goodman Maule," [...] said {{the owner of}} the Seven Gables, with a smile, [...] "and will proceed to suggest a mode in which your {{hereditary}} resentments--justifiable or otherwise--may have had a bearing on my affairs. You have heard, I suppose, that the Pyncheon family, ever since my grandfather's days, have been prosecuting a still <b>unsettled</b> <b>claim</b> to a very large extent of territory at the Eastward?" ...|$|R
40|$|The claims {{generating}} {{process for}} a non-life insurance portfolio is modelled as a marked Poisson process, where the mark {{associated with an}} incurred claim describes the development of that claim until final settlement. An <b>unsettled</b> <b>claim</b> is {{at any point in}} time assigned to a state in some state-space, and the transitions between different states are assumed to be governed by a Markovian law. All claims payments are assumed to occur at the time of transition between states. We develop separate xpressions for the IBNR and RBNS reserves, and the corresponding prediction errors...|$|R
5000|$|Mellie Uyldert (31 May 1908 in Blaricum - 10 May 2009 in Bilthoven) was {{a female}} Dutch New Age writer, {{alternative}} healer, occultist, and astrologer who published about 30 esoteric books, selling over a million copies, making her a recognized person in the Netherlands. Of a conservative, peculiar, poetic, eccentric character, she was also controversial because of several <b>unsettling</b> <b>claims</b> that caused antagonism. [...] In the 1970s she became a celebrity on Dutch television. Her publications cover fairy tales, herbal medicine, stones, metals, health, and gnomes. She also wrote poems.|$|R

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} have to estimate reserves and provisions to cover the payment of either unreported <b>claims</b> or <b>unsettled</b> <b>claims.</b> In this paper, we apply the Chain-Ladder method to obtain a point estimate of reserves, and then we use the bootstrap technique to estimate {{the margin of error}} and the confidence interval of the reserves. Since estimating reserves is a real problem which insurance {{companies have}} to face, its solving has a special interest for students of Actuarial Sciences. To ease the understanding and monitoring the process, the Chain-Ladder method and bootstrap is run step by step by using an Excel application designed for that purpose...|$|R

It annulled most of claims by US and Mexican nationals against the other party's government, except for claims by US oil companies for property nationalized by the Mexican government, which remained {{to be determined by}} future agreements. The convention came into effect on April 2, 1942. It was registered in United Nations Treaty Series on March 26, 1952.|$|R

50|$|Theron and Aspasio, or {{a series}} of Letters upon the most {{important}} and interesting Subjects, which appeared in 1755, and was equally well received, called forth some adverse criticism even from Calvinists, on account of tendencies which were considered to lead to antinomianism, and was strongly objected to by Wesley in his Preservative <b>against</b> <b>unsettled</b> Notions in Religion. Besides carrying into England the theological disputes to which the Marrow of Modern Divinity had given rise in Scotland (the Marrow Controversy), it also led to {{what is known as the}} Sandemanian controversy as to the nature of saving faith.|$|R
6000|$|When Mr. Bertram {{had paid}} the bill due {{by his brother}} to Mr. Wilkinson, there was {{outstanding}} some family <b>unsettled</b> <b>claim</b> from which the two brothers might, or might not, obtain some small sums of money. Sir Lionel, when much pressed by the city Croesus, had begged him to look to this claim, and pay himself from the funds which would be therefrom accruing. The city Croesus had done so: a trifle {{of two or three}} hundred pounds had fallen to Sir Lionel's lot, and had of course been duly credited to his account. But it went a very little way towards squaring matters, and the old man of business went on sending his half-yearly statements, which became anything but [...] "small by degrees." ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractProblems {{linked to}} the high volume of <b>unsettled</b> <b>claims</b> after the {{maturity}} date have been persisting in the Slovak economy during long time. This fact shatters credibility of the entrepreneurship sphere. Integration of the Slovak Republic into the European Union has created conditions for an intense competition in entrepreneurship. Period of financial and economic crisis brings, apart from negative impacts on economies of particular countries, new challenges for economic science as well. Economics should respond to deepening problem of payment indiscipline resulting in payment insolvency of particular enterprises. The aim of the paper is to analyse and evaluate payment discipline in Slovakia and evolution of the European payment index among the V 4 countries. The contribution analyses the international index of encashment which evaluates possibilities of successful debt settlements...|$|R

The author does not {{mention the fact that}} the two governments in 1934 undertook to settle the outstanding claims bu submitting them, evidenced and fully briefed, to the consideration and hoped for agreement of two commissioners with provision for the later submission to an umpire or a lump sum compromise of the <b>unsettled</b> <b>claims.</b> The valuable unpublished report of the American commissioner, Mr. Oscar Underwood, Jr., on the work of the two commissioners, who found themselves unable to agree on many of these claims, warrants publication...|$|R
