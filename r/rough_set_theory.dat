40|$|Abstract: Research {{techniques}} are often divided into quantitative approaches, concerned with measurement, and qualitative approaches, concerned with meaning. Methodologists have often {{found it difficult}} to reconcile this division. However, computational intelligence is directly concerned with capturing meaning in a rigorous form. One commonly used technique is <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> <b>theory,</b> which analyses an information system consisting of a set of objects. The concept of an object is broad enough to include both qualitative and quantitative data structures. This paper provides an overview of <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> <b>theory,</b> and shows how the theory can be used in both classification and clustering tasks.

The information systems are represented as a table where every column represents an attribute (a variable, a property). This attribute can be measured or may also be supplied by a human expert. To obtain the necessary data questionnaires were use. To the migration model selected socioeconomic data, indicators, are applied. Economic and demographic indicators that affect size of migration for districts in the Czech Republic are defined. In data pre-processing we focused on different processing of data inputs.

40|$|Both {{international}} and US auditing standards require auditors {{to evaluate the}} risk of bankruptcy when planning an audit and to modify their audit report if the bankruptcy risk remains high {{at the conclusion of}} the audit. Bankruptcy prediction is a problematic issue for auditors as the development of a cause-effect relationship between attributes that may cause or be related to bankruptcy and the actual occurrence of bankruptcy is difficult. Recent research indicates that auditors only signal bankruptcy in about 50 % of the cases where companies subsequently declare bankruptcy. <b>Rough</b> <b>sets</b> <b>theory</b> is a new approach for dealing with the problem of apparent indiscernibility between objects in a set that has had a reported bankruptcy prediction accuracy ranging from 76 % to 88 % in two recent studies. These accuracy levels appear to be superior to auditor signalling rates, however, the two prior <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> studies made no direct comparisons to auditor signalling rates and either employed small sample sizes or non-current data. This study advances research in this area by comparing <b>rough</b> <b>set</b> prediction capability with actual auditor signalling rates for a large sample of United States companies from the 1991 to 1997 time period. Prior bankruptcy prediction research was carefully reviewed to identify 11 possible predictive factors which had both significant theoretical support and were present in multiple studies. These factors were expressed as variables and data for 11 variables was then obtained for 146 bankrupt United States public companies during the years 1991 - 1997. This sample was then matched in terms of size and industry to 145 non-bankrupt companies from the same time period. The overall sample of 291 companies was divided into development and validation subsamples. <b>Rough</b> <b>sets</b> <b>theory</b> was then used to develop two different bankruptcy prediction models, each containing four variables from the 11 possible predictive variables. The <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> <b>theory</b> based models achieved 61 % and 68 % classification accuracy on the validation sample using a progressive classification procedure involving three classification strategies. By comparison, auditors directly signalled going concern problems via opinion modifications for only 54 % of the bankrupt companies. However, the auditor signalling rate for bankrupt companies increased to 66 % when other opinion modifications related to going concern issues were included. In contrast with prior <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> <b>theory</b> research which suggested that <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> <b>theory</b> offered significant bankruptcy predictive improvements for auditors, the <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> models developed in this research did not provide any significant comparative advantage with regard to prediction accuracy over the actual auditors' methodologies. The current research results should be fairly robust since this <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> <b>theory</b> based research employed (1) a comparison of the <b>rough</b> <b>sets</b> model results to actual auditor decisions for the same companies, (2) recent data, (3) a relatively large sample size, (4) real world bankruptcy|non-bankruptcy frequencies to develop the variable classifications, and (5) a wide range of industries and company sizes.
