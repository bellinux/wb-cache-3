40|$|In {{this paper}} Experimental and Finite Element Analysis of Baseframe for Rigidity is presented. The {{assurance}} of rigidity as per API 610 is mandatory for pumps baseframe supplied in petrochemical industry. A proven <b>rigidity</b> <b>test</b> procedure {{is used for}} testing the structural stiffness of baseframe in line with API 610 clause 6. 3. 5. For typical baseframe, the stiffness is measured by means of <b>rigidity</b> <b>test</b> (actual measurement) for different load cases. The test is carried out to check the conformance of the existing design to API 610 stiffness requirement. Since the existing design fails to meet this requirement, few potential design modifications are suggested. Thesemodified cases are simulated using FEA techniques for stiffness qualification. ANSYS is used for simulation of these cases including that of existing design, for bench marking and comparison purpose. The results of FE analysis are presented in terms of deflection at coupling side shaft end (guideline form API 610), which is supported between bearings in pump bearing housing at static condition. Based on these results, best feasible design solution is proposed and validated experimentally...|$|E

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{associated}} with motor and non-motor rigidity symptoms (e. g., cognitive and personality). The question is raised as to whether rigidity in PD also extends to perception, and if so, whether perceptual, cognitive, and personality rigidities are correlated. Bistable stimuli were presented to 28 non-demented individuals with PD and 26 normal control adults (NC). Necker cube perception and binocular rivalry were examined during passive viewing, and the Necker cube was additionally used for two volitional-control conditions: Hold one percept in front, and Switch between the two percepts. Relative to passive viewing, PD were significantly less able than NC to reduce dominance durations in the Switch condition, indicating perceptual <b>rigidity.</b> <b>Tests</b> of cognitive flexibility and a personality questionnaire were administered to explore the association with perceptual rigidity. Cognitive flexibility was not correlated with perceptual rigidity for either group. Personality (novelty seeking) correlated with dominance durations on Necker passive viewing for PD but not NC. The results indicate the presence in mild-moderate PD of perceptual rigidity and suggest shared neural substrates with novelty seeking, but functional divergence from those supporting cognitive flexibility. The possibility is raised that perceptual rigidity may be a harbinger of cognitive inflexibility later in the disease course...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{further evidence}} on the fit of the new Keynesian Phillips curve for Japan over the years 1972 - 2003. It is motivated by the sense that Japan’s degree of price rigidity found in Sanchez (2005) is implausibly severe and may be unduly affected by assumption that real marginal cost is constant. This paper shows that relaxing this as-sumption implies real marginal cost explains 20 to 30 percent {{of the variation in}} Japan’s inflation under a more generalized production function for the firm. In addition, the de-gree of rigidity is much less under this assumption and implies Japan firms adjust prices every 2 to 3 quarters refuting claims that the new Keynesian Phillips curve overestimates price <b>rigidity.</b> <b>Tests</b> for parameter and thus, model stability give evidence of structural breaks in the estimated coefficients. The break point dates under different specifications coincide with either Japan’s land and asset price bubble or deflationary period. A simple decomposition of labor market rigidities implies a substantial degree of wage rigidity in-fluences the dynamic behavior of real marginal cost and when incorporated into the new Keynesian framework may further improve the model’s empirical performance. Robust-ness tests that nest forward and backward looking behavior imply that forward looking behavior dominates, a key aspect of the new Keynesian framework...|$|R
40|$|Three-point bending {{tests in}} the elastic domain were carried out on {{unidirectional}} laminates made of T 800 H/ 3900 - 2 laminae, holding the fibre direction coincident with the longitudinal axis of the beam. The slenderness ratio was varied in the range 10 – 65, in order to highlight {{the contribution of the}} shear deformation to the structural response. Local <b>rigidity</b> <b>tests</b> were also performed, to ascertain the influence of the indentation at the loading points on the rigidities measured. From the results obtained, the effect of the local deformation on the apparent flexural rigidity was the higher, as the slenderness ratio was reduced, with errors as large as 18 % for the shorter spans adopted. Using Timoshenko’s beam theory and finite element analyses, a prediction of the rigidity in flexure was attempted. The theoretical results and the experimental data showed an excellent correlation, provided an unexpectedly low value of the through-thickness shear modulus was assumed in the calculations. Pos- sible reasons for this occurrence were pointed out, involving the role played by the epoxy/polyamide interleaves in the behaviour of the material, as well as the actual shear correction factor to be used {{to take into account the}} shear effect...|$|R

The respondent of both sexes were included in the sample, aged 18 to 43 with different education. Battery of questions comprising psychological variables was mainly developed at University of Novi Sad (Department of Psychology). The following variables were taken as psychological predictors: motivations (of general achievement, tested with MOP 2002 scale; and locus of control, tested with LOK 2003 scale), value orientations (conservatism-radicalism, tested with KORA 2002 scale; and individualism-collectivism, tested with KOIN 2002 scale), and personal characteristic of <b>rigidity</b> <b>tested</b> with RG-s scale. The effects of other socio-demographic characteristics (age and education) also were tested.

Both materials are well known to be promising candidates for tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. One of the main characteristics that we look for in scaffolds and drug delivery systems is {{the formation of an}} adequate porosity. The role of this porosity is to ensure cell colonisation, flow transport of nutrients and metabolic waste in scaffolds for tissue engineering and to enhance the loading capacity and delivery rate in delivery systems. Two types of scaffolds were produced: one of organic matrix reinforced by an inorganic phase (α-TCP) and the other of inorganic matrix (α-TCP) with gelatin as a binder. Organic phase {{plays an important role in}} the toughness of bone whereas inorganic phase enhances its mechanical properties. The aim was to produce scaffolds with organic matrix and enhance the existing process, and also create new scaffolds with inorganic matrix. Different strategies were tested in order to optimize the fabrication process of the scaffolds. Characterization of the scaffolds included: microstructural evaluation by scanning electron microscopy, evaluation of the percentage of isolated porosity by helium pycnometry, <b>rigidity</b> <b>test</b> by mechanical testing and the study of the proportion of phases in the scaffold by X-ray diffraction analysis. The structure network has been improved in the case of scaffolds with organic matrix, by decreasing the content of closed pores and also by ensuring total incorporation of the α-TCP powder in the scaffold. Regarding the creation of scaffolds of inorganic matrix, the results, in terms of porosity and mechanical properties, were very promising and opened a new area of investigation...|$|E

None of the six packages that contained GMM and arrived by air mail, complied {{to the rules of}} the IATA, whereas a further three, which arrived by national mail did not comply to Dutch law. Except two, all packages were a clear result of ingenuity of the sender. We subjected the ten packages to simple <b>rigidity</b> <b>tests,</b> namely 1) dropping it, 2) stepping on the parcel and 3) dropping a weight of 6. 3 kg on top of it from a height of 1 m. Only one, a parcel harboring commercial obtainable "Culturettes" (Manufactured by Baxter Health Care Products), survived these tests completely undamaged. We compared our experiences with two departments which receive genetically modified bacteria and human pathogens, respectively on a regular basis, namely the PHABAGEN culture collection (University of Utrecht, the Netherlands) and the Laboratory of Bacterial Determinations (National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, the Netherlands). Apart from confirming our experiences to a large extend, their experiences indicate that the vials in about 0. 5 % of the packages will be damaged. If our assumptions are correct, an estimated 3000 packages containing cultures of genetically modified microorganisms are mailed in the Netherlands each year. An estimated 15 of these will be damaged during handling, which, at the present standards of mailing, will result in the unintended, small scale, introduction into the environment of the genetically modified microorganisms involved. Our overall conclusion is therefore that the present standards of mailing of genetically modified microorganisms are insufficient to protect environment and (post) man against possible risks...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{exploring}} {{whether or not}} the two early handlings (petting or mistreat similar to Eells' handling) are effective on body growth, activity, emotionality and vitality in adult rats. So, I conducted two experiments : one in Autumn in 1963 (Exp. Ⅰ), and the other in Spring in 1964 (Exp. Ⅱ). It was the first time when I had ever treated animal subjects, therefore, the experiments were in part both unsuccessful because many rats died during the experiments and the statistical analysis of the data was impossible. This was why I added “An Interim Report”. 　Subjects were male Wistar-King rats. They were devided into 3 groups (Pet-gr., mistreat-gr., and control-gr.) of approximately equal number. I had handled them for 35 days in Exp. I and for 10 to 20 days in Exp. Ⅱafter weaning. Then, I observed their behavior, and measured the weight of adrenals, and lever enzymic activity per wet weight, on and after the 70 th day from the birth. Before the measurement of physiological variables, half of Ss were given such stressors as the forced swimmimg in Exp. I and the 3 day's fasting in Exp. Ⅱ. And I measured body weight at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the experimental period. In addition, the measurement of body weight and tail length were carried out every five days, in pet group and mistreat group of Exp. Ⅱ. 　The main results are as follows :　 1. The interaction between weight growth and early handling was significant in Exp. Ⅰand suggestive in Exp. Ⅱ. Weight growth in pet group was more remarkable than that in mistreat group and control group. So, it could safely be said that early warmhearted stimuli (social stimuli) would accelerate the secretion of the growth-hormone. 　 2. Behavior observation (e. g. open-field test and <b>rigidity</b> <b>test)</b> failed to show any objective results. 　 3. Mean adrenal weight in maturity was heaviest in pet group, next, in mistreat group, and the least in control group, under neutral situation. However, when powerful stress was given in Exp. I, increment of adrenal weight was remarkable in control group, while very little in pet group. This result seems to suggest that stress threshold value was high and emotional sensitivity was low in pet group. 　 4. Under both stress and nonstress conditions, lever enzymic activity per wet weight was highest in pet group. Thus, it is suggested that early warm-hearted stimuli were effective on accelerating the animal's vitality. 　Although this paper was merely an interim report, it could be said generally that early warm-hearted stimuli was effective on body-growth, emotionality and vitality in maturity. On the other hand, effect of early harmful stimuli was not notable against my expectation...|$|E

The current study proposes an integrative model of cognitive distortions (hopelessness and negative evaluations of self and future) and deficits (problem solving deficits, problem solving avoidance, and cognitive <b>rigidity).</b> To <b>test</b> the integrity of this model, a sample of 397 undergraduate students completed measures of deficits, distortions, and current suicide ideation. A structural equation model demonstrated excellent fit, and findings indicated that only distortions have a direct effect on suicidal thinking, whereas cognitive deficits may exert their effects on suicide ideation via their reciprocal relation with distortions. Findings underscore the importance of both cognitive distortions and deficits for understanding suicidality, which may have implications for preventative efforts and treatment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{macroeconomic}} consequences of discretionary {{changes in the}} fiscal policy instruments for Canada. A semi-structural vector autoregression framework is adopted. Restrictions are based on institutional interactions between some policy and non-policy instruments that mimic a government’s decision process. We characterize the actual economy’s response to fiscal shocks. Then, we propose a theoretical model for a small open economy with nominal and real <b>rigidities</b> to <b>test</b> for the endogenous transmission mechanisms following government spending shocks. We pursue a limited information econometric strategy by comparing the theoretical impulse-response functions to the empirical ones capturing {{the effects of a}} government spending disturbance. Generally, the outcomes of the model are very close to the observed reactions especially for consumption, investment, exports, imports, and inflation, however, the model fails in predicting the real exchange rate reaction.
