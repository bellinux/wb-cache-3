500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, <b>red-throated</b> <b>pipit,</b> subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-throated</b> <b>pipit</b> is {{native to}} the boreal regions of {{northern}} Europe and Asia. The breeding habitat is open country including mountains, marshland and tundra. The nest is built on the ground, often beside a tussock of grass, on rough grassland or on a hummock in a marsh. It is made of dry grasses and sedges with a soft lining of reindeer hair or down. Four to six eggs are laid and incubated by the female for nearly two weeks. The young are fledged and ready to leave the nest about twelve days later. The <b>red-throated</b> <b>pipit</b> is insectivorous, like its relatives, but also eats seeds.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-throated</b> <b>pipit</b> has a {{very large}} range and the global {{population}} has been estimated to be about two million individuals. It is rated as being of [...] "least concern" [...] by the IUCN as its population {{is believed to be}} stable and it faces no particular threats.|$|E
50|$|The loch and {{the forest}} around it are popular with birdwatchers, walkers, {{mountain}} bikers and day-trippers. Among the birds found on or around Loch an Eilein are the crested tit, redstart, spotted flycatcher, tree <b>pipit,</b> <b>red-throated</b> diver, common sandpiper, whinchat, and the occasional merlin.|$|R
5|$|The family Motacillidae {{consists}} of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest of these groups is the pipits in the genus Anthus, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were considered subspecies of the Eurasian rock pipit until they were separated by the British Ornithologists' Union in 1998. The Eurasian rock pipit {{is closely related to}} the meadow, <b>red-throated</b> and rosy <b>pipits</b> as well as its former subspecies.|$|R
5|$|The family Motacillidae {{consists}} of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest {{of the three groups}} is the pipits in the genus Anthus, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were both formerly considered subspecies of the Eurasian rock pipit. Of these, the rock pipit is the more closely related to the water pipit, based on external and molecular characteristics. Other near relatives are the meadow, <b>red-throated</b> and rosy <b>pipits.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-throated</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus cervinus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird which breeds in the {{far north}} of Europe and Asia, with a foothold in northern Alaska. It is a long-distance migrant moving in winter to Africa, south and east Asia and west coast United States. It is a vagrant to western Europe.|$|E
50|$|A. gustavi {{is a small}} pipit, which {{somewhat}} {{resembles the}} non-breeding <b>red-throated</b> <b>pipit.</b> The species is heavily streaked brown above, with whitish mantle stripes, and with black markings on a white belly and buff breast below. It can be distinguished from red-throated by its heavier bill, whiter mantle stripes, and contrast between its buff breast and white belly.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} to the <b>red-throated</b> <b>pipit</b> Anthus cervinus, which is more heavily {{streaked}} and (in summer only) has an orange-red throat, and to the tree pipit Anthus trivialis, which is slightly larger, less heavily streaked, and has stronger facial markings and a shorter hind claw. The song of the meadow pipit accelerates towards the end while that of the tree pipit slows down.|$|E
50|$|At higher altitudes, Vardojaure Lake is {{rich with}} birds, mostly ducks {{and also the}} European golden plover, {{characteristic}} of the alpine zone and sometimes found in the humid zones. Låotakjaure Lake, {{on the border of}} Padjelanta, is interesting from an ornithological point of view. Other rare species are also present, such as the lesser white-fronted goose, the great snipe, the <b>red-throated</b> <b>pipit,</b> the long-tailed duck and the bar-tailed godwit. The Luottolako Plateau is also considered to be interesting, with the most significant concentration of purple sandpipers in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a small}} pipit, {{with adults}} easily {{identified}} in the breeding season by their brick red face and throat. In other plumages this is an undistinguished looking species, heavily streaked brown above, with whitish mantle stripes, and with black markings on a white background below. It is very similar in appearance to the meadow pipit and in the autumn it much resembles the tree pipit but has an altogether more striped appearance because of the larger numbers of streaks on the cap, back, flank, rump and chest. The flight of the <b>red-throated</b> <b>pipit</b> is strong and direct, and it gives a characteristic psii call as it flies.|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{studies of}} bird {{communities}} in Arctic regions are rare {{in comparison to}} studies performed in temperate regions, particularly studies that takes detectability into consideration. Finding a suitable and robust method for long-term monitoring of bird populations in the low Arctic which includes a correction of imperfect detection, can contribute to increased ecological understanding and easier identification of changes over time. During two field seasons (June-July) in 2015 and 2016, the bird population on Erkuta tundra monitoring site, Yamal, Russia, was surveyed using the three different methods: distance sampling on line transects, repeated point counts and double observer point counts. The comparison between the methods was done by estimating abundances and densities of the three most common species in the area, i. e. Lapland bunting (Calcarius lapponicus), <b>Red-throated</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus cervinus) and Wood sandpiper (Tringa glareola). I found that the most plausible density estimates of the common target species were provided by the line transect distance sampling. Although all assumptions were difficult to completely fulfil in the field, the method could be improved by more exact distance measurements in the field, since the degree of overestimation {{is limited to the}} extent of which the assumptions are violated. In addition, the line transect distance sampling method have the least impact of “floaters” (non-breeders), which also makes this method more robust. Repeated point counts heavily overestimated the densities, and the models fitted poorly for <b>Red-throated</b> <b>pipit.</b> The overestimation was likely due to violation of the assumption of closed population, and could be reduced by using a model allowing for temporary emigration. Also, too short distance between points, and thus a risk of double counting, could have contributed to the overestimation. However, the double observer point counts offer an alternative approach for long-term monitoring, where the slight overestimation also can be decreased with increased distance between points. In addition, the double observer method requires less effort than the other two methods...|$|E
40|$|This bird {{report for}} the Camargue, Crau and Alpilles (Rhône delta, S. France), covers the years 1980 and 1981. It has been {{compiled}} partly from observations communicated by visiting n aturalists but particularly from resident ornithologists, attached to the « Fondation Tour du Valat », the « Centre d'Écologie de Camargue » (C. N. R. S.), the « Réserve Nationale de Camargue » (S. N. P. N.) and the « Centre de Recherches Ornithologiques de Provence » (C. R. O. P.). As with the previous reports only the results of censuses and unusual observations are given. As a baseline, readers are advised to consult the recently published guide to the birds of the Camargue by Blondel and Isenmann (1981) in which are mentioned all 337 species recorded {{in the area to}} date. The climatological report shows a cold spell in December 1980, with subzero temperatures recorded on 18 days. Total rainfall in autumn and winter was below, but in spring and summer higher, than normal. 1981 was even more unusual, with 25 nights of frost in January, low rainfall, long hours of sunlight and much northerly wind. In contrast, the winter ended (March) mild and wet. April was mild and dry, May cold and wet. The variable summer and autumn weather was characterised by a dry spell (excepting September) with no rain in October/November. December was mild and wet. A first complete census of wintering cormorants revealed 4000 in 1980 and 6000 in 1981 against a formerly estimated maximum of about 2000. This increase has meant that the delta {{has become one of the}} most important wintering are as for the species in western Europe. The Grey Heron population continues to increase with 438 nests in 1980 and 515 in 1981 (table I). In contrast, Purple Herons have decreased in number in the delta over the last decade, probably as a result of a reduction in the available breeding habitat. Large colonies still exist just outside the delta, and the region continues to be the most important breeding area for Purple Herons in France. The population of Cattle Egrets, after being stable from 1977 to 1979 (table II), increased by 48 % in 1980 before decreasing in 1981. This drop was undoubtedly attributable to the cold winter. A nest of Little Bittern was found in 1981 and there is a summer record of a Reef Heron in 1980. A pair of White Storks again bred, raising 3 young in both years. The adult pair are sedentary whilst the young migrate in autumn. Flamingos again bred in large numbers, with 7500 prs. in 1980 and 9500 prs. in 1981, although this latter figure was reduced to 8170 prs. by heavy rains. These raised 3730 and 4000 chicks respectively. The colour-ringing programme continued and a further 1358 chicks were marked during the two years, bringing the total of individu ally recognisable birds to 3316. Of these, 1724 (52 %) have since been identified throughout the West Mediterranean, whilst the total number of sightings exceeds 11000. Both Greylag Goose and Gannet have been attracted to the Flamingo colony, the latter bird staying for three months, displaying and occupying a nest cone and accompanying the flamingos up to 14 kms inland. Bewick's Swans continue to be winter visitors with 52 in 1979 - 1980 and 82 in 1980 - 1981, with a record high of 23 juveniles. The breeding population of Shelduck, a species extending its range in the south of France, was censused in 1980, with 350 chicks (42 families) in the Salins-de-Giraud and 700 (86 families) in the Salins-d'Aigues-Mortes. A further 111 were colour-ringed as part of a study on the movements of the West Mediterranean population which has now been shown to moult in the same area as the North West European population, in North West Germany, a distance of 1200 kms north of the Camargue. Winter counts have revealed peaks of 1354 birds in 1980 and 1035 in 1981, in each case representing over 80 % of the total number recorded in the south of France. For other species of ducks the peak 1980 - 1981 winter count was of 143000 in November. Instead of increasing in December, as is usually the case, the cold spell of early December resulted in a decrease of 25 % mostly caused by a high hunting mortality within the delta. Amongst the major changes in numbers compared to former winters has been a decrease of Pintail and Tufted Ducks and an increase of Shoveler and Gadwall. Diving ducks (Tufted and Pochard) are gradually decreasing in the Camargue because there are more attractive areas further north, whilst some of the surface-feeders tend to increase, Mallard and Teal together regularly forming 50 - 60 % of the total Anatidae. Amongst the seaducks, a concentration of 1000 Scoters, mostly or solely Velvets, was quite exceptional. The area is one of the most remarkable in Europe for raptors at all seasons. Booted Eagles were again regularly recorded in 1980 and a Sea Eagle appeared in both years. Wintering Marsh Harriers are at a remarkably high density with 280 counted at 3 roosts, probably only about half of the total in the area. There were two observations of Eleonora's Falcon in 1981. The average number of wintering coots bas recently decreased from about 25000 (1964 - 1968) to 20000 in 1980 - 1981. Sample censuses of the breeding population indicate a relatively law density of 3. 7 nests per 10 ha. ln the Crau, the wintering Little Bustards have been estimated at 1000 - 1100, which corresponds with the breeding population of about 500 prs. The third record of a Pectoral Sandpiper was a bird shot in September 1979. There is a second winter record of a Great Skua in 1981 and a remarkable observation of 22 Long-tailed Skuas together in the Gulf of Beauduc in May 1980. A pair of Mediterranean Gulls successfully bred in both 1980 and 1981 whilst the Slender-billed Gull was not found breeding either year. The former of these two species occurs in large numbers outside the breeding season with maximum counts of 250 in March 1980 and 700 in September 1981. Two pairs of Black Terns nested in 1980, the first breeding record since 1931. Whiskered Terns bred in 1981 (120 prs.). This species was formerly abundant in the area but bad not been recorded breeding since 1974. The Long-eared Owl, which forms winter roosts of up to 20 birds, was found breeding in 1980 for only the fifth time. There are several spring records of Red-rumped Swallows whilst those of the common Swallow in December may indicate a possible attempt at wintering. Richard's Pipit was recorded for the first time in October 1981 with a second record one month later, whilst the May 1980 record of a <b>Red-throated</b> <b>Pipit</b> was only the sixth in the past 30 years. The Stonechat seems now to be well re-established as a breeding species and there is a possible return of the Penduline Tit with one nest found in each of the two years...|$|E
