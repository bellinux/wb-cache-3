5|$|As {{with the}} Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings found {{it very difficult to}} <b>rein</b> <b>back</b> their troops, who lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
25|$|The British Horse Society Dressage Rules require {{competitors}} to perform four {{variations of the}} walk, six forms of the trot, five leaping gaits (all forms of the canter), halt, and <b>rein</b> <b>back,</b> but not the gallop. The British Horse Society Equitation examinations also require proficiency in the gallop as distinct from the canter.|$|E
25|$|In a Western equitation class a rider may {{be asked}} to perform a test or pattern, used to judge the rider's {{position}} and control of the horse. Tests may be as simple as jogging in a circle or backing up, or as complex as a full reining pattern, and may include elements such as transitions from halt to lope or lope to halt, sliding stops, a figure-8 at the lope with simple or flying change of lead, serpentines at the lope with flying changes, the <b>rein</b> <b>back,</b> a 360 degree or greater spin or pivot, and the rollback.|$|E

6000|$|He {{returned}} to his party with a gleam of stronger excitement in his eyes than Lawrence had observed since they became acquainted. Riding alongside of Manuela, who was in advance, he entered into earnest and animated conversation with her. Then, <b>reining</b> <b>back</b> until he was abreast of Lawrence, he said-- ...|$|R
50|$|Seema {{has a way}} {{of making}} Maya feel fat and useless and as time passes, she begins to realise that the wedding she was hoping for is {{becoming}} a distant dream. Maya resolves to sort herself out and take the <b>reins</b> <b>back</b> from Seema {{and find a way to}} give Janghir a wedding to be proud of.|$|R
2500|$|Islamist {{terrorist}} activity increased dramatically in 2003, with the Riyadh compound bombings and other attacks, which prompted {{the government to}} take much more stringent action against terrorism. [...] The king (Abdullah) has also taken steps to <b>rein</b> <b>back</b> {{the powers of the}} ulema, for instance transferring their control over girls' education to the Ministry of Education.|$|E

60|$|They continued, therefore, to <b>rein</b> <b>back,</b> as the Flemings were doubled up, {{powerless}} {{to give any}} aid, or to press forward towards the front line.|$|E
6000|$|... 'By my faith!' said Sir Gervas, <b>reining</b> <b>back</b> his steed {{until he}} was abreast of me, 'our square-toed friends need not be in such post-haste to get to heaven when they have so many angels among them on earth. Gad's wounds, are they not beautiful? Never a patch or a diamond amongst them, and yet what would not our faded belles of the Mall or the Piazza give for their innocence and freshness?' ...|$|R
50|$|On February 8, 2016, {{following}} the formal {{approval of the}} transfer in ownership by the U.S. Department of Transportation, {{it was announced that}} Dave Pflieger, who joined as CEO in October 2014 and presided over its successful restructuring, turnaround, and sale, would be leaving Island Air to work directly for Ellison in an unspecified role and turning the <b>reins</b> <b>back</b> over to Les Murashige, a former Island Air executive, who would become President and CEO under the airline’s new owners, PacifiCap LLC.|$|R
5000|$|In 1836 he was {{appointed}} as a diplomatic agent with the Xhosa [...] "Gaika", Imidange and Amabele tribes.Stretch was a fervent supporter of the policies of Andries Stockenström, in bringing a degree of peace to the frontier and <b>reining</b> <b>back</b> white settlers from moving into Xhosa lands. Like Stockenström, he was an idealist who detested the injustices against the Xhosa, but was also an adept fighter who agreed {{to take up arms}} for the Cape when war did break out.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, Harry, I {{will not}} say you nay," [...] he said at length. [...] "Scenes of broils and civil war are not for lads of your age. But, as you say, {{it would be a}} thing to talk of to old age how you rode after the king when he entered London in state. But mind, if there be fighting, you must <b>rein</b> <b>back</b> and keep out of it." ...|$|E
50|$|Baucher also {{incorporated}} flexions of the haunches, including rotations of the croup {{around the}} shoulders. This intended {{to teach the}} horse to keep his haunches straight and to help move them backward in the <b>rein</b> <b>back.</b> The <b>rein</b> <b>back</b> was used to teach the horse to move his whole body mass away from the bit (to increase {{the power of the}} hand), and also to help close the angles of the hind legs, which would help increase impulsion.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, Tony DiCicco {{handed the}} {{coaching}} <b>reins</b> <b>back</b> to Jill Ellis, who had coached the 2007 Pan American Games squad. 2009 {{also saw the}} influx of players {{who took part in}} the inaugural FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup into the U-20s, including Kristen Mewis, US Soccer's 2008 Young Female Player of the Year, and Vicki DiMartino, younger sister of U-20 alumni Christina (2006) and Gina (2007-2008). Two members of the 2008 squad, Sydney Leroux and Christine Nairn, returned to captain the team through the next World Cup cycle.|$|R
50|$|The same {{approach}} has been taken by activists and commentators that support the race based conceptions of a divided society. Kundnani, for example, claims that {{the changing nature of}} debates on ‘race’ has helped to shift the imperative to integration and by building shared norms, common identity and stable communities, diverse groups would be expected to ‘buy into’ British institutions, organisations and processes. Lentin and Titley (2011) also believe that the development of community cohesion was a means of <b>reining</b> <b>back</b> race relations policies on the part of Government.|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} useful {{to transfer the}} weight of the seat onto the thighs when asking for the <b>rein</b> <b>back,</b> so that the horse may easily round up through its back and engage its hind end.|$|E
50|$|Both legs in {{a neutral}} {{position}} (neither forward nor back), applying equal pressure against the horse's sides, generally asks {{for an increase in}} speed or an upward transition (such as walk to trot). Depending on the level of restraining aids (seat and hands), the leg can also ask for an increase in impulsion, for collection, or even for the <b>rein</b> <b>back.</b> To ask a horse to back up, a rider simultaneously uses soft rein aids to keep the horse from stepping forward, but uses the legs to ask for movement, so the horse moves backwards. It is incorrect to ask for a <b>rein</b> <b>back</b> by pulling or jerking on the reins.|$|E
5000|$|The {{judge will}} then ride {{the horses and}} then may require {{individual}} performances, called [...] "shows," [...] from the competitors. Individual shows should not exceed 1 minutes, and should include walk, trot, canter, gallop, <b>rein</b> <b>back,</b> stand still and demonstrate obedience to the leg.|$|E
5000|$|Then-lead {{developer}} Ben Brinkman's 1UP.com log {{claimed that}} MLB 2K9 represented the final {{act of a}} planned three year development cycle for 2K's baseball series for next gen systems. He restated the [...] "three year plan" [...] in a January 18, 2008 podcast with Official Xbox Magazine. In both interviews, Brinkman stated that 2K9, the third game, would represent the final, most polished version of the next gen series. However, Brinkman {{walked away from the}} series after the release of MLB 2K8, handing the <b>reins</b> <b>back</b> to Visual Concepts.|$|R
60|$|There {{were indeed}} quite {{a large number}} of men and women {{assembled}} in front of the house--all the tenants, with their wives and families, having gathered to greet their young landlord--and loud bursts of cheering arose as he rode up, Sydney and Mr. Popham <b>reining</b> <b>back</b> their horses a little to allow him to precede them. Cyril took off his hat, and bowed repeatedly in reply to the acclamations that greeted him. The tenants crowded round, many of the older men pressing forward to shake him by the hand.|$|R
6000|$|In {{many ways}} the war has brought us up all {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} an abyss. When it is over shall we go galloping over the edge, or, <b>reining</b> <b>back,</b> sit awhile in our saddles looking for a better track? We were all on the highway to a hell of material expansion and vulgarity, of cheap immediate profit, and momentary sensation; north and south in our different ways, all [...] "rattling into barbarity." [...] Shall we find our way again into a finer air, where self-respect, not profit, rules, and rare things and durable are made once more? ...|$|R
50|$|Reins {{are used}} to give subtle {{commands}} or cues, also known as rein aids. Various commands may signal a turn, ask for a slower speed, request a halt or <b>rein</b> <b>back.</b> Rein aids are used along with leg aids, shifting of body weight, and sometimes voice commands.|$|E
50|$|The British Horse Society Dressage Rules require {{competitors}} to perform four {{variations of the}} walk, six forms of the trot, five leaping gaits (all forms of the canter), halt, and <b>rein</b> <b>back,</b> but not the gallop.

5000|$|Hacks in the UK {{must have}} {{straight}} movement and move with [...] "pointed" [...] toes. Individual shows {{do not need}} to show a gallop, but should show <b>rein</b> <b>back</b> alongside the usual requirements of halt, walk, trot and canter. Workouts in Australia are similar to the UK however, a horse is often asked to show lengthening in the trot and canter and simple or flying changes of lead at the canter.|$|E
60|$|The {{difficulty}} and narrowness {{of the road}} had by this time become such as to interrupt the conversation of the travellers, and Lord Menteith, <b>reining</b> <b>back</b> his horse, held a moment's private conversation with his domestics. The Captain, who now led the van of the party, after {{about a quarter of}} a mile's slow and toilsome advance up a broken and rugged ascent, emerged into an upland valley, to which a mountain stream acted as a drain, and afforded sufficient room upon its greensward banks for the travellers to pursue their journey in a more social manner.|$|R

50|$|In popular culture, {{to rein in}} {{means to}} hold back, slow down, control or limit. Sometimes the eggcorn, reign in, is used. Usage of the {{opposing}} free <b>rein</b> dates <b>back</b> to Geoffrey Chaucer (1343-1400) and means to give or allow complete freedom, in action and decision, over something.|$|R

[...] The king (Abdullah) has also taken steps to <b>rein</b> <b>back</b> {{the powers of the}} ulema, for instance transferring their control over girls' education to the Ministry of Education.Some have complained that the king's dominance over the ulema has weakened the traditional Islamic legitimacy of Saudi throne.|$|E
5000|$|Each horse {{performs}} individually. There {{are usually}} four patterns {{from which a}} judge may choose, all containing a walk, a jog, a jog over a log, a lope, a lope over a log, a jog to lope transition, a large serpentine with four [...] "crossing lead" [...] changes, a shallow serpentine with 3-4 line lead changes, a halt and a <b>rein</b> <b>back.</b> All lead changes are required to be completed within the designated lead change area.|$|E
50|$|In North American classes, {{the show}} hack {{is to show}} at extended, regular and {{collected}} versions of the walk, trot and canter, as well as performing a hand gallop, halt and the <b>rein</b> <b>back.</b> Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} gait transitions and obedience. While fluid, smooth gaits are always desired, a more dressage-like frame is favored. Some show hack classes for specific breeds, particularly those for the Arabian and Morgan, encourage some animated knee action, though in Canada, use of weighted shoes is prohibited.|$|E
50|$|Moore {{was hired}} to coach Sheboygan for the 1946-47 season. The Red Skins {{finished}} with a 26-18 record and qualified for the National Basketball League (NBL) playoffs, where they were ousted in the first round. In 1947-48, Moore began the season as Sheboygan's head coach, but gave up the duties when the Red Skins obtained player-coach Bobby McDermott, a Hall of Fame guard, from the Chicago American Gears. The Gears players had been distributed among the NBL's teams when Chicago's league, the fledgling Professional Basketball League of America, folded in November 1947 after only three weeks in operation. McDermott coached Sheboygan to a 4-5 record in one month of duty before leaving for the Tri-Cities Blackhawks and handing the <b>reins</b> <b>back</b> to Moore. The Red Skins finished a disappointing 23-37 and missed the playoffs. Moore served as the commissioner of the NBL in its final season.|$|R
5000|$|In 1967 {{he carried}} {{out his own}} {{cultural}} revolution, purging the party of “revisionists”, and as in China things went out of control before he could finally pull the <b>reins</b> <b>back.</b> Great damage nonetheless had already been done to the CPB's image, particularly the killing of young student leaders who had joined the CPB after the failed peace parley. The country had experienced this kind of treatment of their young only recently {{in the hands of}} Ne Win's army in the July 7, 1962 massacre of Rangoon University students during a peaceful protest on campus shortly after the coup d'etat of March 2, 1962. The next year, on September 24, 1968, whilst on the run from government troops, Than Tun was assassinated by a subordinate who later surrendered to General Ne Win's government. The assassin had joined the Communists just two years before as an [...] "army deserter".|$|R
5000|$|Ragg's second {{collection}} Holding Unfailing (2017) {{was described}} by Sarah Howe as offering the reader 'intriguing, supple poems that range across the world and across the landscapes of the mind.' The attention to place and landscape, especially in relation to contemporary China, was noted by Penelope Shuttle in her account of the book: 'This collection has for its central focus scenes from contemporary China, observing with detachment and direct emotional intent those personal landscapes which fan out from Ragg’s experiences of a country undergoing profound change. Such landscapes and the burdening memories accompanying them create poems of concentrated philosophical energy. They search and question. Ragg explores paths and places across a world shot through with colour. Yet he <b>reins</b> <b>back</b> from the expected celebratory note, in order to sift truth from falsehood, to travel from height to abyss. This is a wide-ranging and thought-provoking collection.' ...|$|R
