40|$|To {{describe}} the history, objectives, statistics, and initiatives used to address challenges {{associated with the}} Mayo Clinic Visiting Medical Student (VMS) Clerkship Program. Mayo Clinic administrative records were reviewed for calendar years 1995 through 2008 {{to determine the effect}} of interventions to increase the numbers of appropriately qualified international VMSs and underrepresented minority VMSs. For numerical data, descriptive statistics were used; for comparisons, chi(2) tests were performed. During the specified period, 4908 VMSs participated in the Mayo VMS Program (yearly mean [SD], 351 [24]). Most students were from US medical schools (3247 [66 %]) and were male (3084 [63 %]). Overall, 3101 VMSs (63 %) applied for and 935 (30 %) were appointed to Mayo Clinic <b>residency</b> program <b>positions.</b> Interventions to address the challenge of large numbers of international students who participated in our VMS program but did not apply for Mayo <b>residency</b> <b>positions</b> resulted in significantly fewer international students participating in our VMS program (P<. 001), applying for Mayo <b>residency</b> program <b>positions</b> (P<. 001), and being appointed to <b>residency</b> <b>positions</b> (P=. 001). Interventions to address the challenge of low numbers of underrepresented minority students resulted in significantly more of these students participating in our VMS program (P=. 005), applying for Mayo <b>residency</b> <b>positions</b> (P=. 008), and being appointed to <b>residency</b> <b>positions</b> (P=. 04). Our findings suggest that specific interventions can affect the characteristics of students who participate in VMS programs and who apply for and are appointed to <b>residency</b> program <b>positions...</b>|$|R

50|$|After earning {{their medical}} degrees, Drs.

The couple was eventually offered <b>residency</b> <b>positions</b> in both Minnesota and New York. After weighing the pros and cons, but more importantly, a coin toss, they decided to move to New York. Dr. Seymour Schwartz and Dr. Ruth Schwartz accepted <b>residency</b> <b>positions</b> at local hospitals in Rochester, New York and went on to complete their training at Strong Memorial Hospital and Genesee Hospital, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Jaffe, {{her husband}} and first child moved to the Washington, D.C. area, where the Jaffe's second son was born. Dr. Jaffe took a <b>residency</b> <b>position</b> at Georgetown University and worked {{primarily}} in anatomic pathology. After a year at Georgetown, Jaffe entered an NCI residency program. Dr. Jaffe's early research at NCI helped replace purely descriptive classifications with those based on immunology which helped in the development process leading to today's disease-specific therapies. Jaffe and her fellow NCI researchers showed that red blood cells coated with antibody and erythrocyte-antibody-complement (EAC) adhered to B-cell areas, proving they were lymphocytes derived from the lymphoid follicles.|$|E
50|$|Increasing the {{bargaining}} power of residents has been proposed, on {{the argument that}} they would then choose the best training programs. The 2002 Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges anti-trust case sought more freedom for medical residents to negotiate working conditions. In order to obtain accreditation as doctors, American medical residents are required {{to enter into a}} contract to accept whatever <b>residency</b> <b>position</b> they are assigned; they are then matched to a job by the AAMC and told what the working conditions and pay are. The plaintiffs allege that this is an anti-competitive practice, and that the defendants artificially limit the number of resident positions available.|$|E

He would serve aboard the USS Marquette AKA 95 at its port of call in the Mediterranean for 18 months. Four months prior to the completion of his assignment, he was informed that his <b>residency</b> <b>position</b> had been given to someone else.

50|$|Barney Brooks {{was born}} in Texas in 1884, {{received}} his B.S. from the University of Texas in 1905, and graduated from Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1911.

He did his internship in surgery under William Halsted but was not offered an appointment as surgical resident, so he completed his residency at The Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, after which he joined the surgical staff at Washington University School of Medicine. In 1925 Brooks was appointed Vanderbilt University Hospital's first Professor and Chief of Surgery, in part due to a strong recommendation from Halsted, despite the fact that Halsted had denied him a <b>residency</b> <b>position</b> years earlier. At both at Washington University and Vanderbilt Brooks established productive laboratories in surgical pathology.|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} 20 years, I have {{assisted}} unmatched medical {{students as they}} sought <b>residency</b> <b>positions</b> on Scramble Day.

And, with perhaps one or two unmatched US graduates per medical school, there were up to 200 US medical school graduates in the scramble. I am not sure that anyone knows the exact number of “scrambling ” graduates, but this year’s Scramble Day was certainly a favorable market for students. At our school, there were three unmatched students, mostly for the usual reasons—applying to the most popular programs and not going on enough interviews. Our Portland program filled.
