2500|$|The Sandy <b>Row</b> <b>unit</b> was not {{the only}} women's unit within the UDA. There was a {{particularly}} active women's group on the Shankill Road which had been established by Wendy [...] "Bucket" [...] Millar as the first UDA women's unit. A number of the members were highly visible due to the beehive hairstyles they typically wore. Although [...] each unit was independent of the others, Jean Moore and later Hester Dunn served as the overall leaders of the UDA's women's department at the UDA headquarters in Gawn Street, east Belfast. Tanya Higgins and Nancy Brown Diggs observed in their book Women Living in Conflict that the loyalist paramilitary women were [...] "angrier and more militant" [...] than their male counterparts. Another analysis was provided by Sandra McEvoy in her report Women Loyalist Paramilitaries in Northern Ireland: Duty, Agency and Empowerment - a Report from the Field in which she suggested that by joining paramilitary groups like the UDA, loyalist women were provided with a sense of freedom and personal and political power that had previously been denied them in the domestic sphere; furthermore by taking up [...] "the gun", the women proved they were willing to go to prison for their beliefs and the loyalist cause.|$|E

40|$|PARAFAC is a {{generalization}} of {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) to the situation where a set of data matrices is to be analysed. If each data matrix has the same <b>row</b> and column <b>units,</b> the resulting data are three-way data and can be modelled by the PARAFAC 1 model. If each data matrix has the same column units but different (numbers of) <b>row</b> <b>units,</b> the PARAFAC 2 model can be used. Like the PARAFACI model, the PARAFAC 2 model gives unique solutions under certain mild assumptions, whereas it is less severely constrained than PARAFAC 1. It may therefore {{also be used for}} regular three-way data in situations where the PARAFAC 1 model is too restricted. Usually the PARAFAC 2 model is fitted to a set of matrices with cross-products between the column units. However, this model-fitting procedure is computationally complex and inefficient. In the present paper a procedure for fitting the PARAFAC 2 model directly to the set of data matrices is proposed. It is shown that this algorithm is more efficient than the indirect fitting algorithm. Moreover, it is more easily adjusted so as to allow for constraints on the parameter matrices, to handle missing data, as well as to handle generalizations to sets of three- and higher-way data. Furthermore, with the direct fitting approach we also gain information on the <b>row</b> <b>units,</b> in the form of 'factor scores'. As will be shown, this elaboration of the model in no way limits the feasibility of the method. Even though full information on the <b>row</b> <b>units</b> becomes available, the algorithm is based on the usually much smaller cross-product matrices only.

Two months later a unit from Sandy Row shot and killed a bouncer from the same bar, which was Catholic-owned but entertained a mixed clientele. Similar attacks continued into 1975, with a Sandy Row gunman killing a young Catholic builder on nearby Great Victoria Street, before another attack by the Sandy <b>Row</b> <b>unit</b> on 9 February when they entered St Bride's Catholic Church on the Malone Road, a popular target for vandalism attacks by local loyalist youths, and killed two students in attendance.

40|$|Interlocking, {{single layer}} {{concrete}} armour units {{are placed in}} a specific grid {{depending on the type}} of armour unit. Within this grid, armour units are placed in horizontal rows. The number of horizontal rows of single layer armour units on a breakwater is limited to 20. This limit is proposed in order to prevent major settlements, which might affect the interlocking of the armour units. The limit on the number of rows is based on experience from prototypes and is not yet confirmed in a systematic study. Then number of rows also might have an effect on the load on the first (bottom) <b>row</b> of armour <b>units,</b> which affects the structural integrity of the armour units. The load on the first <b>row</b> of armour <b>units</b> is however unknown. The research presented in this thesis is a study on the load on the first (bottom) row of concrete armour units placed on a breakwater. Both the static load and the dynamic load were examined. The static load is defined as the load on the bottom <b>row</b> of armour <b>units</b> resulting from the higher positioned <b>rows</b> of armour <b>units</b> during conditions without waves. The dynamic load is defined as the load on the bottom <b>row</b> of armour <b>units</b> during conditions with wave attack minus the static load. These loads were studied by physical model tests. The static load was studied in an experiment in which the down slope force on the bottom <b>rows</b> of armour <b>units</b> (Xbloc units of 366 grams) was continuously measured during the placement of 20 <b>rows</b> of armour <b>units</b> on a slope of 37 degrees (slope of 3 : 4) in a series of 15 tests. The dynamic load was studied in a physical model test in a wave flume. The first <b>row</b> of armour <b>units</b> was placed on a movable frame which was connected to a load cell. The dynamic load was measured during tests with regular waves of 20 % to 100 % of the maximum wave height corresponding to the used armour unit (Xbloc units of 61. 7 gram which were positioned on a typical breakwater slope of 3 : 4) and a wave period corresponding to an Iribarren number of 3, 4 and 5 for all of the described wave heights. This static load experiment resulted in a relationship of the measured static load on the first <b>row</b> of armour <b>units</b> with the number of rows applied on the slope of the model. From this relationship appeared that the static load approaches a maximum value after 10 rows. An analytical model was developed and validated against the measured results. This model gives an interpretation of the cause of the maximum value. The measurements of the dynamic load showed two clear phenomena. The dynamic load appeared to be a harmonic load with the same period as the waves imposed on the model. The dynamic load is the result of the flow of water along the armour layer. The maximum dynamic load on the first <b>row</b> of armour <b>units</b> occurred simultaneous with the maximum downwash which is in line with expectations. A relation between the downwash velocity and the amplitude of the dynamic load was found. The second observed phenomenon is the increase of the wave averaged load on the first <b>row</b> of armour <b>units</b> during the test. During the tests the harmonic load oscillated around an equilibrium line which showed a positive trend. The measured load after testing was significant higher than the measured load at the beginning of the tests. A relation was found between the wave characteristics and the increase of the load on the first <b>row</b> of armour <b>units.</b> Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
