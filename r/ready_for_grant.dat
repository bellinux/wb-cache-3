5000|$|Unless the {{application}} is directly <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>grant,</b> communications under [...] are {{issued by the}} Examining Division and notified to the applicant or the appointed representative. In such communications, the Examining Division invites the applicant to reply within a given period, by correcting the [...] "deficiencies noted and amending the description, claims and drawings", where appropriate. If amendments are filed, the amendments must not extend the content of {{the application}} as filed, or, in other words, there must not be any added subject-matter. In that context, the applicant is master of its own application in that the decision to amend or not, and how to amend the application, is a decision of the applicant alone (although the Examining Division may apply pressure to have amendments made).|$|E
5|$|As {{the great}} numbers of troops from both armies gathered, {{it was widely}} assumed in the North {{that this would be}} the battle to end the war. Grant, {{reinstated}} by Halleck at Lincoln's and Stanton's urging, left Fort Henry and traveled by boat up the Tennessee River to rejoin his army with orders to advance with the Army of the Tennessee into Tennessee. Grant's main Union army was located at Pittsburg Landing, while 40,000 Confederate troops converged at Corinth. Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman assured Grant that his green troops were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> an attack. <b>Grant</b> agreed and wired Halleck with their assessment. Grant, whose forces numbered 45,000, wanted to attack the Confederates at Corinth, but Halleck ordered him not to attack until Major General Don Carlos Buell arrived with his division of 25,000. Meanwhile, <b>Grant</b> prepared <b>for</b> an attack on the Confederate army of roughly equal strength. Instead of preparing defensive fortifications between the Tennessee River and Owl Creek, and clearing fields of fire, they spent most of their time drilling the largely inexperienced troops while Sherman dismissed reports of nearby Confederates.|$|R
50|$|As {{the great}} numbers of {{troops from the}} North and South gathered, it was widely assumed in the North {{that this would be}} the battle to end the war. Grant, {{reinstated}} by Halleck, left Fort Henry and traveled by boat up the Tennessee River to rejoin his army with orders to advance with the Army of the Tennessee into Tennessee. Upon Grant's arrival, Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman assured him that his green troops were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> an attack. <b>Grant</b> agreed and that evening wired Halleck with their assessment. Encamped on the western bank at Pittsburg Landing, Grant's army now numbered about 45,000 troops. Halleck, however, had also given Grant orders not to attack until Major General Don Carlos Buell arrived with his division of 25,000 troops. In the meantime Grant began to make preparations for an attack on the Confederate army of roughly equal strength at Corinth, Mississippi. However, instead of preparing defensive fortifications facing Corinth between the Tennessee River and Owl Creek, and clearing fields of fire, they spent most of their time drilling the largely inexperienced troops while Sherman several times dismissed reports of nearby Confederates.|$|R
