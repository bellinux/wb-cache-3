Moreover, unattended speech was found to have no effect upon performance in immediate free recall.

40|$|Background The genetic {{architecture}} of a quantitative trait influences the phenotypic response to natural or artificial selection. One {{of the main}} objectives of genetic mapping studies is to identify the genetic factors underlying complex traits and understand how they contribute to phenotypic expression. Presently, we are good at identifying and locating individual loci with large effects, {{but there is a}} void in describing more complex genetic architectures. Although large networks of connected genes have been reported, there is an almost complete lack of information on how polymorphisms in these networks contribute to phenotypic variation and change. To date, most of our understanding comes from theoretical, model-based studies, and it remains difficult to assess how realistic their conclusions are as they lack empirical support. Results A previous study provided evidence that nearly half of the difference in eight-week body weight between two divergently selected lines of chickens was a result of four loci organized in a 'radial' network (one central locus interacting with three 'radial' loci that, in turn, only interacted with the central locus). Here, we study the relationship between phenotypic change and genetic polymorphism in this empirically detected network. We use a model-free approach to study, through individual-based simulations, the dynamic properties of this polymorphic and epistatic genetic architecture. The study provides new insights to how epistasis can modify the selection <b>response,</b> <b>buffer</b> and reveal effects of major loci leading to a progressive release of genetic variation. We also illustrate the difficulty of predicting genetic architecture from observed selection response, and discuss mechanisms that might lead to misleading conclusions on underlying genetic architectures from quantitative trait locus (QTL) experiments in selected populations. Conclusion Considering both molecular (QTL) and phenotypic (selection response) data, as suggested in this work, provides additional insights into the genetic mechanisms involved in the response to selection. Such dissection of genetic architectures and in-depth studies of their ability to contribute to short- or long-term selection response represents an important step towards {{a better understanding of the}} genetic bases of complex traits and, consequently, of the evolutionary properties of populations...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{about the nature of}} a man's {{immediate}} memory for a short sequence of verbal items. Two components of immediate memory may be distinguished: an 'active' memory component, which is progressively destroyed within a few seconds if, subsequent to presentation of the sequence, the man is required to perform a distracting task which prevents rehearsal of the items, and a residual 'inactive' component which is more permanent. My concern is with behavioural evidence relating {{to the question of how}} the attributes of a verbal sequence are represented in active memory subsequent to identification of the constituent items. It is possible selectively to probe the retrieval of different attributes of the sequence by the use of appropriate tasks. Evidence on the performance of normal adult subjects in various short-term memory tasks, from the literature and from my own experiments, is extensively reviewed. There emerges a fundamental contrast between two groups of tasks: on the one hand, tasks which require the subject to indicate whether a test item was present in the memorised sequence (item recognition) or to judge the relative recency with which items have occurred; on the other,tasks which require the subject to base his response on the order or precise position of items in the sequence. To account for the nature of the contrast I put forward a general hypothesis which is an amended and elaborated version of parts of a general model of memory described by Morton (1970). It is argued that subsequent to identification of an item, representations of it may temporarily be held in active memory by two distinct storage mechanisms. Thefirst is as a decaying trace at the neural unit, called (following Morton) a 'logogen', responsible for the identification of that item. This trace may be treated as possessing a unidimensional 'strength' whose magnitude is dependent on how recently the item has occurred. Item recognition and judgements of recency are held to be mediated by assessment of the test item's trace strength with respect to a decision criterion located on the strength continuum. Secondly, the item may also be represented as one of several maintained in a serially- organised limited-capacity storage mechanism called (following Morton) the 'response buffer'. This holds a small number of the verbal responses recently made available by the logogens, coded as a string of articulatory descriptions or commands. It has two crucial properties. Firstly, items represented in it as potential responses may be fed back in sequence to the logogens for re-identification (the process of sub-vocal rehearsal). Secondly, since the serial order in which items enter the <b>response</b> <b>buffer</b> is retained as an intrinsic property of its structure, retrieval from it provides a ready mode of access to the order or position of items in the memorised sequence, which item-traces at logogens do not. The thesis falls into two parts. The first three chapters contain a theoretical review of the literature. In Ch. 1, the active/ inactive distinction is introduced with some reference to the historical background (1. 1). Some points of technique are raised (1. 2), the aims, of the present work are outlined (1. 3) and the twostore hypothesis is described (1. 4) In Ch. 2, evidence is reviewed from short-term memory experiments in which accuracy is the main dependent variable, beginning with experiments in which either serial recall of the whole sequence or probed recall of a single item is required. The hypothesis that the order of items is retained in active memory as an intrinsic property of the memory structure is contrasted with theories (e. g. Wickelgren, 1972) emphasising the formation of temporary associations between the representations of items adjacent in the list and/or between item and position representations. It is concluded that inter-item associations play no major role in active memory, and that item-position associations cannot account both for the partial independence of order and item errors and for the relationship between order errors and phonemic similarity. Conrad's (1965) model is introduced as a precursor of my own. It is concluded that items are recalled primarily from the (ordered) <b>response</b> <b>buffer,</b> but that traces at logogens influence the availability of responses as guesses when items are wholly or partly lost from the <b>response</b> <b>buffer</b> (2. 11). Some evidence is then described which suggests that variables may be identified which differentially influence retention of information about the order of items and about their occurrence (2. 12). Experiments comparing the effectiveness of position, context or both,as cues for recall are argued to imply that order and position are coded by the same mechanism, but that access to items retained by it may be more direct given a position rather than a contextual cue (2. 13). We then turn to experiments on short-term recognition and judgements of recency, which are discussed in relation to the trace strength theory of Wickelgren and Norman (1966) (2. 21). It is concluded that an item's recent identification is represented as an exponentially-decaying trace located at a unique permanent representation of that item, to which access is direct (2. 22). But order-recognition experiments provide little evidence that associations between items are represented in active memory in the same way (2. 23). The two-store hypothesis is then applied to some general problems of the functions of active memory: in speech comprehension (2. 31) as an 'address register' for inactive memory (cf. Broadbent, 1971) (2. 32) and as a working memory. Finally, the logogen system is discussed in relation to Sperling's (1967) 'recognition buffer' (2. 34) and evidence for articulatory as opposed to acoustic coding in immediate memory is reviewed (2. 35). In Ch. 3, I introduce the experimental paradigms pioneered by Sternberg (1966), which involve presentation on each trial of a different sub-span list for memorisation, followed by a probe to which reaction-time (RT) is measured. Several models are outlined of the nature, dynamics and format of the representations mediating performance in Sternberg's item-recognition paradigm (IRn), in which the subject must indicate whether the probe was or was not a member of the list. Predictions are derived from Sternberg's two scanning models and two versions of a trace strength hypothesis and compared to data available in the literature. The evidence favours the hypothesis that subjects perform the IRn task by judging the strength of the trace at the amodal representation (logogen) to which the probe provides direct access (3. 1). Evidence from a version of the IRn paradigm in which the memory set remains constant from trial to trial is then reviewed; it is argued that the results obtained are necessarily equivocal with respect to active memory; nevertheless, the concept of trace strength may be of use in this context also (3. 2). Next, we see that Sternberg's own experiments on contextual recall (CR), in which the subject must respond with the item following the probed item in the list, yield a pattern of results very different from that obtained in IRn. His own explanation is in terms of different strategies of search within a single store. In view of the failure of the exhaustive scanning model of IRn, the differences may be better accounted for by the two-store model. Since these RT paradigms provide a relatively pure and sensitive way of probing the retrieval of different attributes from active memory, a strategy is suggested of looking for factors which differentially influence performance in IRn, CR and related tasks. Evidence already available suggests that these factors may include serial position, phonemic similarity and the availability of a position cue. The second part of the thesis describes my own experiments. These employ Sternberg's varied-set IEn and CR paradigms and a task in which the subject must indicate the location of the probe in the list presented on that trial (Ln). In Ch. 4, I raise some methodological issues inherent in the use of reaction time as a measure and give details of the apparatus and general procedure common to the experiments. In Ch. 5 are described three experiments on the effects of phonemic similarity between items of the memory set on performance in the three tasks. Five-consonant lists were presented visually at a fast rate; the probe followed immediately and subjects were instructed not to rehearse; vocabulary and other factors were held constant across tasks. In Exp. I (CR) and Exp. III (Ln) phonemic similarity increased both RT and error frequency. The relationship between serial position and the effects of similarity in both tasks suggested a slow forward serial search through a temporally-ordered phonemically-coded store, save perhaps for terminal items of the sequence. The effects of similarity were in both tasks diminished when the probed item was phonemically distinct from the list items and, in CR, when the response item was similarly isolated. In Exp. II, no comparable effects upon IRn performance were found. Moreover, whereas marked increases with serial position probed were obtained in both CR and Ln, in the IRn task RT showed an accelerating decrease with serial position probed. The contrast between the two patterns of results is argued to be incompatible both with Sternberg's account in terms of two retrieval strategies and with Wickelgren's associative theory. The first experiment described in Ch. 6 (Exp. IV) demonstrated that IRn was not facilitated by a cue presented along with the probe which informed the subject which half (in terms of ordinal position) of the four digit memory set was relevant to his decision. This result is compatible with the proposal that access to the active memory representations involved in IRn is direct, and does not require a search through an ordered store. Exp. V compared the effects upon IRn and CR of giving with the probe a cue telling the subject in which of four spatio-temporal positions the probed item had been presented (if, in IRn, it was a positive probe). Experimental parameters and subjects were the same for both tasks. Information provided by the position cue had a marked facilitatory effect on CR, none on IRn (as in Exp. IV). The difference is held to reflect the fact that location in the list of the probed item and retrieval of its successor, in CR, requires a serial search of the <b>response</b> <b>buffer,</b> a search which may however be abbreviated if the subject knows at what position to begin the search. In Ch. 7 I give an account of a single experiment (Exp. Vl) intended to test predictions critically distinguishing the models of IRn outlined in Section 3. 1. Memory sets of 1 - 4 consonants were visually presented at a fast rate; subjects were told not to rehearse, Two variables were manipulated: 1) the recency of occurrence, prior to the present trial, of items presented as negative probes; 2) the recency of items in the memory set. The latter was varied by presenting the probe either immediately or following a short delay during which rehearsal was prevented by a vowel-naming task. It was found that the more recently a negative probe had occurred, the slower and less accurately it was rejected; the effect increased with set size. The introduction of a filled delay between list and probe reduced the slopes of the serial position and set-size functions. The former showed monotonic recency effects. These and other aspects of tho data are incompatible with any scanning model and favour the trace strength inspection hypothesis. In Ch. 8, two early exploratory experiments are described in which the task was again IRn. Mixed memory sets of digits and letters were presented; the probe was randomly either a letter or a digit. The question was whether the subject could use the semantic class of the probe to restrict a search to the appropriate subset of the list; such a strategy would not be possible according to a pure trace strength hypothesis. While Exp. VII provided no evidence for such a 'directed search' strategy, the data from Exp. VIII, in which the conditions were changed so as to maximise the possibility of such a strategy, showed an increase in RT with the size of the subset of the same class as the probe. However, it transpires that given the conditions of the experiment, this result does not rule out an explanation in terms of the trace strength inspection model. Changes are suggested which would make the experiment more decisive. The last chapter is devoted to concluding comments,speculations and plans. The necessity for exploring the adequacy of the two-store model in relation to other areas of research is acknowledged; these include speech production perception and comprehension, attention, non-verbal memory and the study of patients with memory disorders due to brain damage. Further experiments are suggested to compare the effects in the various short-term memory tasks of semantic similarity, rate of presentation, and interpolated material. In conclusion it is suggested that a greater emphasis on the representation of motor as well as perceptual events does much tc clarify the nature of active memory. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Most power {{reduction}} {{mechanisms for}} NoC channel buffers rely on on-demand wakeup to {{transition from a}} low-power state to the active state. Two drawbacks of on-demand wakeup limit its effectiveness: 1) performance impact caused by wakeup delays, and 2) energy and area cost of sleep circuitry itself. What makes the problem harder to solve is that solutions to either problem tend to exacerbate the other. For example, faster wakeup from a power-gated state requires greater charge/discharge current for the sleep transistors while using nimbler sleep transistors implies long wakeup delays. As a result, powerdowns have to be conservatively prescribed, missing many power-saving opportunities. We propose Boomerang, a novel power-saving method that overcomes the above drawbacks. Specifically, based on the observation that a response is always preceded by a request, we let the request trigger wakeup of the buffer {{that is to be}} used by its response in the (near) future, instead of using on-demand wakeups. Hiding the wakeup delay completely, Boomerang allows us to employ aggressive sleep policies and use low-cost power gating circuits on <b>response</b> <b>buffers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{hemodynamics}} of {{the liver}} with its dual blood supply is unique. The liver depends entirely on the hepatic artery to regulate total hepatic flow since the portal vein is unable to control inflow to the liver. The existence of stable hepatic blood flow {{is essential for the}} maintenance of hepatic functions. The reservoir (capacitance) function, the clearance of many compounds (such as hormones) and the stability of intrahepatic sinusoidal pressure depends on hepatic blood flow. It has been long observed that the hepatic arterial flow responds in a reciprocal fashion to changes in portal flow in order to maintain total hepatic flow steady, an observation referred to as the hepatic arterial <b>buffer</b> <b>response.</b> On the other hand, the occurrence of changes in hepatic arterial resistance in response to changes in arterial perfusion pressure (i. e. autoregulation) remains controversial. The mechanisms underlying both responses have not been fully elucidated, although a myogenic mechanism has been suggested. This research study was designed first, to quantitate the hepatic arterial <b>buffer</b> <b>response</b> and the hepatic arterial autoregulation and second, to examine the likely mechanisms governing these responses. An anesthetized cat model with intact liver and intact blood supply was used. The hepatic arterial autoregulation <b>response</b> and the <b>buffer</b> <b>response</b> were induced by the use of a micrometer screw-clamp placed around the hepatic artery and the superior mesenteric artery. Blood flow in both arteries was measured by electromagnetic flow probes. The results indicated that the buffer capacity is variable. The buffering efficiency increases with the decrease in portal flow to reach a maximum value of 24 % at 60 % decrease in portal flow. Although further decreases in portal flow were accompanied by progressive increases in hepatic arterial conductance, the buffering efficiency declined. Our results showed the existence of weak hepatic arterial autoregulation. Both the <b>buffer</b> <b>response</b> and autoregulation were found to be mediated through adenosine. A unified hypothesis has been suggested according to which adenosine is secreted by specialized cells in the space of Mall close to the resistance arterioles of the hepatic artery. This intrinsic dilator can act on the resistance arterioles or be washed away by portal or hepatic arterial flow. Reduction in either flow would result in accumulation of adenosine resulting in vasodilation of the hepatic artery. An increase in either flow would result in vasoconstriction.

Haemodynamic change following a meal challenge has been utilised as a model to study the effects of novel treatment for portal hypertension [28, 47, 48].

Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 30 %, 70 % and 90 % hepatectomy. Baseline measurements before hepatectomy served as controls.

Hepatic tissue pO 2 was analysed by polarographic techniques. Hepatic function and integrity were studied by bromosulfophthalein bile excretion and liver histology. Portal blood flow was 2 - to 4 -fold increased after 70 % and 90 % hepatectomy. This, however, did not provoke a hepatic arterial <b>buffer</b> <b>response.</b> Nonetheless, portal hyperperfusion and constant hepatic arterial blood flow were associated with a reduced mitochondrial redox state and a decreased hepatic tissue pO 2 after 70 % and 90 % hepatectomy.

Portal hyperperfusion after extended hepatectomy does not induce a hepatic arterial <b>buffer</b> <b>response</b> but reduces mitochondrial redox state and hepatocellular oxygenation. This is not due to a deterioration of microvascular perfusion, but rather due to a relative hypermetabolism of the remnant liver after major resection...|$|R

Changing driver behaviour {{has been proposed}} where bans on vehicle use are politically unpalatable, but the efficacy of vehicle setbacks and reduced speeds remains largely untested. We characterised bird-vehicle encounters in terms of driver behaviour and the disturbance caused to birds, and tested whether spatial buffers or lower speeds reduced bird escape responses on open beaches. Focal observations showed that: i) most drivers did not create sizeable buffers between their vehicles and birds; ii) bird disturbance was frequent; and iii) predictors of probability of flushing (escape) were setback distance and vehicle type (buses flushed birds at higher rates than cars). Experiments demonstrated that substantial reductions in bird escape <b>responses</b> required <b>buffers</b> to be wide (> 25 m) and vehicle speeds to be slow (< 30 km h- 1). Setback distances can reduce impacts on wildlife, provided that they are carefully designed and derived from empirical evidence. No speed or distance combination we tested, however, eliminated bird <b>responses.</b> Thus, while <b>buffers</b> reduce <b>response</b> rates, {{they are likely to}} be much less effective than vehicle-free zones (i. e. beach closures), and rely on changes to current driver behaviour.

Heart failure, increased intra-abdominal pressure, haemodialysis {{and the presence of}} obstructive sleep apnoea are among the multiple clinical conditions that are associated with impaired splanchnic perfusion in critically ill patients. Total liver blood flow is believed to be relatively protected when gut blood flow decreases, because hepatic arterial flow increases when portal venous flow decreases (the hepatic arterial <b>buffer</b> <b>response</b> [HABR]). However, there is evidence that the HABR is diminished or even abolished during endotoxaemia and when gut blood flow becomes very low. Unfortunately, no drugs are yet available that increase total hepato-splanchnic blood flow selectively and to a clinically relevant extent. The present review discusses old and new concepts of splanchnic vasoregulation from both experimental and clinical viewpoints. Recently published trials in this field are discussed.

Self-esteem cannot function well as an anxiety buffering system in those who have post traumatic stress disorder as the buffer is weakened in these individuals. High self-esteem can displace defensive <b>responses</b> and <b>buffer</b> against the terror of mortality salience {{because it is a}} signal that the individual is living at the standard they should, based on their world view. Self-worth as the terror management theory suggests is an essential component of the existential anxiety- buffering system.

40|$|International audienceThe {{functions}} of caveolae, the characteristic plasma membrane invaginations, remain debated. Their abundance in cells experiencing mechanical stress {{led us to}} investigate their role in membrane-mediated mechanical response. Acute mechanical stress induced by osmotic swelling or by uniaxial stretching results in a rapid disappearance of caveolae, in a reduced caveolin/Cavin 1 interaction, and in an increase of free caveolins at the plasma membrane. Tether-pulling force measurements in cells and in plasma membrane spheres demonstrate that caveola flattening and disassembly is the primary actin-and ATP-independent cell <b>response</b> that <b>buffers</b> membrane tension surges during mechanical stress. Conversely, stress release leads to complete caveola reassembly in an actin-and ATP-dependent process. The absence of a functional caveola reservoir in myotubes from muscular dystrophic patients enhanced membrane fragility under mechanical stress. Our findings support a new role for caveolae as a physiological membrane reservoir that quickly accommodates sudden and acute mechanical stresses...|$|R
