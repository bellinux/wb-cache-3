5|$|The New Horizons probe, {{en route}} to Pluto, flew by Jupiter for a gravity assist {{and was the first}} probe {{launched}} directly towards Jupiter since the Ulysses in 1990. Its Long <b>Range</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Imager (LORRI) took its first photographs of Jupiter on September 4, 2006. The spacecraft began further study of the Jovian system in December 2006, and made its closest approach on February 28, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Based in Nui Dat, the SASR was {{responsible}} for providing intelligence to both the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) and US forces, operating throughout Phuoc Tuy Province as well as Bien Hoa, Long Khanh and Binh Tuy provinces. From 1966 SASR squadrons rotated through Vietnam on year-long deployments, {{with each of the}} three Sabre Squadrons completing two tours before the last squadron was withdrawn in 1971. Missions included medium <b>range</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> patrols, observation of enemy troop movements, and long range offensive operations and ambushing in enemy dominated territory. Operating in small groups of four to six men they moved more slowly than conventional infantry through jungle or bushland and were heavily armed, employing a high rate of fire to simulate a larger force on contact and to support their withdrawal. The primary method of deployment was by helicopter, with the SASR working closely with No. 9 Squadron RAAF which regularly provided rapid and precise insertion and extraction of patrols into jungle landing zones at tree top height. On occasion, SASR patrols were also deployed by M-113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) with a method devised to deceive the Viet Cong as to their insertion and the location of their drop-off point despite the noise they made moving through the jungle. An operational parachute jump was also undertaken.|$|E
50|$|The Renard R.31 was {{designed}} by Alfred Renard of Constructions Aéronautiques G. Renard to meet a requirement of the Belgian Air Force for a short <b>ranged</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> and army co-operation aircraft. It first flew from Evere Airfield, near Brussels, on 16 October 1932.|$|R

25|$|The Van Berkel W-B was {{a single}} engine Dutch long <b>range</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> {{seaplane}} built in the early 1920s for work in the Dutch East Indies. Six were operated by the Dutch Naval Aviation Service (MLD) with disappointing results, though the last two were not decommissioned until 1933.|$|E
25|$|During its {{construction}} the Ro III {{was known as}} the Ro II series III, indicating its close similarity to its predecessor. The most obvious difference was a sharp bow to improve seaworthiness. It was advertised in two forms, either as a ten passenger airliner or a long <b>range</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A {{small number}} of B-24s were {{purchased}} for the RAF but assessment showed {{that they were not}} suitable for use over Europe. They were however suitable for long <b>range</b> maritime <b>reconnaissance</b> and were put into use with RAF Coastal Command.|$|R

5000|$|Fox-AT2 - Long <b>range</b> {{battlefield}} <b>reconnaissance</b> variant. The Fox-AT2 {{looks much}} like the Fox-AT1, but has the wider 4-meter wingspan. It can carry a heavier sensor payload of 30 kg, but only two wings stores, and uses a long-range radio communications link.|$|R
25|$|Because the Spectres' {{advanced}} sensors were {{useful in}} <b>range</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> and range clearing tasks, the 711th also provided missile range {{support to the}} Air Force's Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral AFS from 1979 to 1989 and space shuttle support to National Aeronautics and Space Administration at Kennedy Space Center from 1981 to 1988.|$|E

25|$|The National Defense University of Finland hasn't {{published}} any thesis {{or paper}} on the 21st century where sissi units and tactics are mentioned. This might be mainly because the FDF has moved to a more flexible defense by reforming its land warfare doctrine leaving no room for tactics and strategies for regiment/company level sissi troops. After organizational changes, the FDF will provide reconnaissance (formerly sissi) training in Kainuun Prikaati, {{as well as in}} other major training formations, where they emphasise scout recon. training. That includes reconnaissance, forward observation and fire control but this training no longer leans towards special tactics, weapons, sabotage and woodland area fighting skills. However, the FDF still trains long <b>range</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> patrol units in Utti jaegare Regiment (Paratroopers, one of the elite units of the FDF) and they are trained in woodland area fighting, survival skills, unconventional methods and asymmetric tactics though the major role is geared more towards long <b>range</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> and special operations.|$|E
50|$|The Reconnaissance Patrol Competition is a {{national}} military patrolling exercise that makes its participating units cover more than 100 kilometers in three days while performing numerous types of military tasks.

25|$|Although {{supplemented}} by other types, the R.E.8 remained the standard RFC artillery observation, air photography and general short <b>range</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> aircraft {{for the remainder}} of the war, equipping 18 RFC squadrons in 1917 and 19 squadrons in 1918. Belgium was the only country other than Britain and the Dominions to operate the R.E.8 during the First World War, receiving 22 in July 1917. At least some of the Belgian examples were fitted with Hispano-Suiza engines, in a SPAD type cowling, rather than the S.E.5a type cowling of the R.E.8a.|$|E
25|$|Other companies/squadrons {{served in}} other parts of New Guinea and the Dutch East Indies, also serving with {{considerable}} distinction, mainly performing roles such as long <b>range</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> intelligence gathering and flank protection, but also occasionally being called upon to perform more traditional infantry roles. Indeed, the 2/6th Independent Company arguably fought {{one of the most remarkable}} small-unit actions of the war when it captured and held the village of Kaiapit and after the Battle of Buna–Gona where it served alongside the Americans, it was singled out for rare praise from General Douglas MacArthur.|$|E
25|$|The Long <b>Range</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Unit (LRRU) {{is a small}} {{infantry}} unit {{responsible for}} providing small reconnaissance teams for patrols in tropical rainforests, wetlands and in the highlands and is developing a counter terrorist capability for the APEC Summit in 2018.
