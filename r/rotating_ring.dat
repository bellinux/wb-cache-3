5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This <b>rotating</b> <b>ring</b> in turn drives the rotation of the central axle (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a stator. This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E
25|$|Notice that {{to send a}} {{laser pulse}} toward the {{stationary}} observer S at R = 0, the Langevin observer L has to aim slightly behind to correct for its own motion. Turning things around, just as a duck hunter would expect, to send a laser pulse toward the Langevin observer riding a counterclockwise <b>rotating</b> <b>ring,</b> the central observer has to aim, not at this observer's current position, but at the position at which he will arrive {{just in time to}} intercept the signal.

2500|$|Each {{integral}} {{curve of}} the timelike unit vector field [...] appears in the cylindrical chart as a helix with constant radius (such as the red curve in Fig.nbsp&1). [...] Suppose we choose one Langevin observer and consider the other observers who ride on a ring of radius R which is rigidly rotating with angular velocity ω. [...] Then if we take an integral curve (blue helical curve in Fig.nbsp&1) of the spacelike basis vector , we obtain a curve which we might hope {{can be interpreted as}} a [...] "line of simultaneity" [...] for the ring-riding observers.

In addition, large scale non-axisymmetric modes are obtained when the applied field is sufficiently strong.

In {{the case of}} the <b>rotating</b> black <b>ring</b> we use Weyl aligned null directions to algebraically classify the Weyl tensor, and utilize an adapted Cartan algorithm in order to produce Cartan invariants. For the supersymmetric black ring we employ the discriminant approach and repeat the adapted Cartan algorithm. For both of these metrics we are able to construct Cartan invariants that detect the horizon alone, and which are easier to compute and analyse that scalar polynomial curvature invariants.
