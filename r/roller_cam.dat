25|$|There {{are several}} brake types {{based on the}} {{cantilever}} brake design: cantilever brakes and direct-pull brakes - both second class lever designs - and <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> brakes and U-brakes - both first class lever designs.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> {{design was}} first {{developed}} by Charlie Cunningham of WTB around 1982 and licensed to Suntour. [...] <b>Roller</b> <b>cam</b> brakes were used on early mountain bikes in the 1980s {{and into the}} 1990s, mounted to the head tube and seat stays in the standard locations, and below the chain stays for improved stiffness as they do not protrude {{to interfere with the}} crank. It is not unusual for a bicycle to have a single <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> brake (or U-brake) combined with another type. [...] They are still used on some BMX and recumbent bicycles.|$|E
2500|$|... "U-brakes" [...] (also {{known by}} the trademarked term [...] "990-style") are {{essentially}} the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake. [...] The {{difference is that the}} two arm pivots attach directly to the frame or fork while those of the centre-pull caliper brake attach to an integral bridge frame that mounts to the frame or fork by a single bolt. [...] Like <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> brakes, this is a caliper design with pivots located above the rim. [...] Thus U-brakes are often interchangeable with, and have the same maintenance issues as, <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> brakes.|$|E

50|$|Beginning {{with all}} of the Saturn S-Series {{vehicles}} that were made in late 1999 (sometimes referred to as 1999.5 models) had received improvements to both the SOHC and the DOHC engines in the S-Series. These changes included revised pistons, new connecting rods, and new crankshaft counterweights in the engine as well. The Twin Cam cylinder head had now featured a new roller-rocker setup with hydraulic tappets and <b>roller</b> <b>cams</b> replacing the conventional bucket lifter setup of the previous engine in the S-Series.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The working {{profile of}} the <b>roller</b> gear {{indexing}} <b>cam</b> is sophisticated space curved surface. It is difficult to get the 3 D model with conventional cartography. In this paper, a parameter molding method of the <b>roller</b> gear indexing <b>cam</b> based on VB and UG is provided. A system is compiled. The Simulation and Kinematics Analysis of the <b>roller</b> gear indexing <b>cam</b> mechanism can be done after the parameters are completely set. It hopes that the flaw and other problem in design can be found though this simulation and kinematics analysis, which is facilitate the designer to improve the design in time...|$|R
2500|$|There is much {{in favor}} of the <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> brake design. [...] Since the cam {{controls}} the rate of closure, the clamping force can be made non-linear with the pull. And since the design can provide positive mechanical advantage, maximum clamping force can be higher than that of other types of brakes. They are known for being strong and controllable. [...] On the downside, they require some skill to set up and can complicate wheel changes. [...] And they require maintenance: like U-brakes, as the pad wears it strikes the rim higher; unless re-adjusted it can eventually contact the tyre's sidewall.|$|E
2500|$|The GT had a Tickford Vehicle Engineering Ford SVO GT40 5.0litre V8, {{producing}} 200kilowatts (268hp) {{of power}} {{due to the}} special SVO GT40 cylinder heads, a high compression ratio of 9.0:1, large valves, heavy-duty valve springs, <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> followers, fuel injection with a large throttle body and exhaust extractors. The manual version had a heavy-duty clutch, strengthened gears and a short-throw gearshift as standard.

2500|$|The Super Coupe {{came with}} an engine {{having the same}} {{displacement}} (3.8L) as the naturally aspirated V6, though most all internal components were upgraded to handle the increased torque and temperature generated due to {{the addition of a}} supercharger. Among the modifications, the engine block and heads were modified to enhance coolant flow, the crankshaft was upgraded to a fully counter weighted forged unit, the billet <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> had a unique profile, and the pistons were made of a stronger hypereutectic alloy.

40|$|An {{electromagnetic}} brake/clutch device {{includes a}} drive shaft supported {{by at least}} one bearing for transmitting torque, a housing, affixed to prevent its rotation, surrounding the drive shaft, and an electromagnetically activated device within the housing to selectively prevent and allow rotation of the drive shaft. The electromagnetically activated device includes a plurality of <b>cammed</b> <b>rollers</b> to prevent counter-clockwise rotation of the drive shaft. The drive shaft includes a circumferential disk and the housing includes a reaction ring for engagement with the plurality of <b>cammed</b> <b>rollers.</b> The plurality of <b>cammed</b> <b>rollers</b> are released from engagement with the circumferential disk and the reaction ring by a plurality of tripping mechanisms within the housing. The tripping action uses the locking force to act as a release force merely by changing the boundary conditions of the roller interface angles. The tripping mechanisms include trippers for disengaging the plurality of <b>cammed</b> <b>rollers</b> and an anvil shaped portion for providing lateral movement of the trippers. The plurality of <b>cammed</b> <b>rollers</b> is preloaded to engagement with the circumferential disk and reaction ring by a spring, and is located with respect to an adjacent tripping mechanism with another spring...|$|R

50|$|A slipper type {{torque wrench}} {{consists}} of a <b>roller</b> and <b>cam</b> (or similar) mechanism. The cam {{is attached to the}} driving head, the roller pushes against the cam locking it in place with a specific force which is provided by a spring (which is in many cases adjustable). If a torque is demanded which is able to defeat the holding force of the roller and spring, the wrench will slip and no torque will be applied to the bolt. A slipper torque wrench will not over tighten the fastener by continuing to apply torque beyond a predetermined limit.|$|R
2500|$|There are two rare {{variants}} {{that use}} the <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> principle. [...] For locations where centre-pull is inappropriate, the side-pull [...] "toggle cam brake" [...] was developed. [...] Also a first-class cantilever, it uses a single-sided sliding cam (the toggle) against one arm that is attached by {{a link to the}} other arm. [...] As the cam presses against the follower, the force is also transmitted to the other arm via the link. [...] And specifically for suspension forks where the housing must terminate at the brake frame, the side-pull [...] "sabre cam brake" [...] was developed. In the sabre cam design, the cable end is fixed and the housing moves the single-sided cam.|$|E
2500|$|... 1987 saw {{changes to}} the front and rear fascias on the [...] "base coupe" [...] with the SE and GT models keeping the same [...] "Aero" [...] nose. The new non-aero noses lost the black bumper pads of the earlier models and had a {{smoother}} look. The four-cylinder engine's power rating increased to [...] with some major modifications which included a <b>roller</b> <b>cam,</b> redesigned intake manifold, distributorless ignition system (DIS), open combustion chamber cylinder head and upgraded throttle-body fuel injection system. This was the last year for the spin-on oil filter on the four-cylinder. Bright Blue (M21) and Medium Red Metallic (M77) were added and replacing the ribbed black molding was the round style found on the GT models. As a side note, the SE models retained the ribbed molding, and added the aero nose found on the GT. Redesigned headlight motors appeared in 1987. Additionally, starting with the 1987 model Pontiac dealerships offered an upgrade {{in the form of an}} [...] "option" [...] that changed the original body to a Pininfarina Ferrari 308-type body, called the Fiero Mera. Corporate Concepts completed the [...] "Mera" [...] transformation and none were sold as kit form. The Mera body change was offered only on new Fieros, sold through Pontiac dealers and is considered a class of car in its own right. Only 247 Mera's were produced by Corporate Concepts before production was halted when sued by Ferrari. With its limited number produced, the Pontiac Mera is one of the rarest American made automobiles.|$|E

40|$|Proposed motor {{based on}} {{magnetostrictive}} effect provides stepped angular motion with angular increments of order of 100 microradians. Driven to repeat stepping cycle rapidly enough to achieve maximum speed of about 20 rpm, provides torque {{an order of}} magnitude greater than electric motors, and brakes itself when power turned off. Magnetostrictive rods in electromagnet coils push against drive plate, causing it to rotate slightly. This slight rotation jams conical <b>rollers</b> between <b>cam</b> surfaces on outer drive ring and split drum, so rollers transmit rotation to drum. Suitable for precise, high-torque, fail-safe-braking, direct drive of robot joint, without bulk and weight of additional brake mechanism and gear train...|$|R

Even though Mitch reassures him that nothing is going on between him and Teddy anymore, Cam seems to not calm down. He only calms down when Jay tells him that although Teddy {{is a really good}} person and everyone likes him, he did not bring the best out of Mitch, something that Cam does.|$|R

50|$|The {{camshaft}} is billet steel, {{made from}} 8620 carbon or S7 through-hardened tool steel or similar. It runs in five oil pressure lubricated bearing shells and {{is driven by}} gears {{in the front of}} the engine. Mechanical <b>roller</b> lifters (<b>cam</b> followers) ride atop the cam lobes and drive the steel push rods up into the steel rocker arms that actuate the valves. The rockers are of roller tip type on the intake and exhaust sides. Like the <b>cam</b> follower <b>rollers,</b> the steel tip roller rotates on a steel roller bearing and the steel rocker arms rotate on a pair of through-hardened tool steel shafts within bronze bushings. Intake and exhaust rockers are billet. The dual valve springs are of coaxial type and made out of titanium. Valve retainers are also made of titanium, as are the rocker covers.|$|R
50|$|The gun is an air-cooled, recoil-operated design, firing {{standard}} 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition, fed from {{a slightly}} curved 30-round magazine {{inserted in the}} left side of the weapon. It uses a locking ring, which is located at the end of the barrel extension, to lock the bolt. Inside the locking ring, there are six sets of locking lugs, arranged as an interrupted thread, which mate with lugs cut at the rear of the bolt. Rotation of the ring, which locks and unlocks the bolt, is controlled by rollers mounted on the outside of the ring. Upon recoil, these <b>rollers</b> follow <b>cam</b> tracks cut into the receiver. The gun is of relatively simple design, with most parts having a round cross-section. The tubular receiver is an extension of the barrel jacket. The butt hosts a tube which contains the return spring and its guide.|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{improving}} the engine’s power density, we put forward {{a new type of}} power transmission mechanism which is used for opposed-cylinder engine. The gas pressure acts on the cam through the piston and push rod, and the spindle rotation of external is driven by the cam. The design of spatial cam work surface is completed by using the enveloping theory of a family of space curves, the force between <b>roller</b> and <b>cam</b> is analyzed using dynamic analysis software. Under the condition of equal number, size and stroke of piston, the new one with larger power density is more compact in structure than the traditional power transmission mechanism, and the reaction force {{on either side of the}} main shaft and the acting force between pistons and cylinders are smaller than those in traditional one, which prolongs the service life of the pistons...|$|R

50|$|The {{screw and nut}} {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start threads. Recirculating rollers are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning engagement with the threads of the nut and screw, shifting up or down by one lead of thread after completing an orbit around the screw. The nut assembly typically includes a slotted cage and cam rings. The cage captivates the rollers in elongated slots, equally spacing the rollers while permitting rotation and axial motion of the <b>rollers.</b> The <b>cam</b> rings have opposing cams aligned with an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from nut and screw, and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the nut assembly (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the screw). Returned to its starting position, and reengaged to nut and screw, the roller may then orbit the screw once again.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{non-traditional}} cam and roller-follower mechanism is described here. In this mechanism, the roller-crank rather than the cam is used as the continuous input member, while both complete a full rotation in each revolution and remain in contact throughout. It is noted {{that in order to}} have the cam fully rotate for every full rotation of the roller-crank, the cam cannot be a closed profile, rather the roller tra-verses the open cam profile twice in each cycle. Using kinematic analysis, the angular velocity of the <b>cam</b> when the <b>roller</b> traverses the <b>cam</b> profile in one direction, is related to the angular velocity of the <b>cam</b> when the <b>roller</b> retraces its path on the cam in the other direction. Thus, one can specify any arbitrary function relating the motion of the cam to the motion of the roller-crank for only 180 ° of rotation in the angular velocity space. The motion of the cam in the remaining portion is then automatically determined. In specifying the arbitrary motion, many desirable characteristics such as multiple dwells, low acceleration and jerk, etc., can be obtained. Useful design equations are derived for this purpose. Using the kinematic in-version technique, the cam profile is readily obtained once the motion is specified in the angular velocity space. The only limitation to the arbitrary motion specification is making sure that the transmission angle never gets too low, so that the force will be transmitted eciently from <b>roller</b> to <b>cam.</b> This is addressed by incorporating a transmission index into the motion specification in the synthesis process. Consequently, in this method we can specify any arbitrary motion within a permissible zone, such that the transmission index is higher than the specified minimum value. Single-dwell, double-dwell and a long hesitation motion are used as examples to demonstrate the eectiveness of the design method. Force closure using an optimall...|$|R

50|$|The G41's {{engineering}} origins {{lay in the}} 7.92×33mm Kurz StG 45(M) Assault rifle, {{and later}} the 7.62×51mm NATO G3 battle rifle. It is a selective fire automatic weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback system of operation. The two-piece bolt mechanism consists of a bolt head that contains two cylindrical rollers and a wedge-shaped locking piece, attached to a heavy bolt carrier. When fired, the build-up of gas pressure generated by the ignited powder charge exerts rearward pressure on the bolt, which is then transferred onto the rollers. The <b>rollers</b> are <b>cammed</b> inward against appropriately shaped walls in the barrel extension, displacing the locking piece. The geometry of the camming ramps on the wedge-like locking piece ensure a rearward velocity that is {{greater than that of}} the bolt. This ensures that the bullet has left the barrel, allowing bore pressures to drop to a safe level before the rollers are fully retracted, clearing the barrel extension notches and releasing the bolt, which is then engaged by the bolt carrier and withdraws together with the entire moving assembly.|$|R
50|$|The SIG MG 710-3 is an automatic, {{air-cooled}} belt-fed weapon {{operated by}} roller-delayed blowback and fires {{from an open}} bolt. The machine gun's bolt differs from other contemporary designs employing the short recoil method of operation (such as CETME and Heckler & Koch designed weapons), being a 3-piece design that consists of a bolt head with two locking rollers, a striker sleeve and the bolt carrier which is connected telescopically with the bolt head. When a round is chambered pressure from the return spring drives the bolt and carrier assembly forward; simultaneously both <b>rollers</b> engage <b>camming</b> surfaces which drive the rollers outward from their compressed travel position into recesses in the barrel extension. Upon firing, the bolt carrier and striker assembly recoil to the rear and the geometry of the fixed camming surfaces drives the rollers inward unlocking the bolt breech and increasing {{the speed at which}} the striker sleeve withdraws relative to the bolt. As the slower bolt continues rearward it impacts the returning striker sleeve (this impact decelerates the bolt).|$|R
