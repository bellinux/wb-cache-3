50|$|Rheology {{generally}} {{accounts for}} the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids, by characterizing the minimum number of functions that are needed to relate stresses with rate of change of strain or strain rates. For example, ketchup can have its viscosity reduced by shaking (or other forms of mechanical agitation, where the relative movement of different layers in the material actually causes the reduction in viscosity) but water cannot. Ketchup is a shear thinning material, like yogurt and emulsion paint (US terminology latex paint or acrylic paint), exhibiting thixotropy, where an increase in relative flow velocity will cause a reduction in viscosity, for example, by stirring. Some other non-Newtonian materials show the opposite behavior, rheopecty: viscosity going up with <b>relative</b> <b>deformation,</b> and are called shear thickening or dilatant materials. Since Sir Isaac Newton originated the concept of viscosity, the study of liquids with strain rate dependent viscosity is also often called Non-Newtonian fluid mechanics.|$|E
50|$|The {{elasticity}} of materials {{is described by}} a stress-strain curve, which shows the relation between stress (the average restorative internal force per unit area) and strain (the <b>relative</b> <b>deformation).</b> The curve is generally nonlinear, but it can (by use of a Taylor series) be approximated as linear for sufficiently small deformations (in which higher-order terms are negligible). If the material is isotropic, the linearized stress-strain relationship is called Hooke's law, which is often presumed to apply up to the elastic limit for most metals or crystalline materials whereas nonlinear elasticity is generally required to model large deformations of rubbery materials even in the elastic range. For even higher stresses, materials exhibit plastic behavior, that is, they deform irreversibly and do not return to their original shape after stress is no longer applied. For rubber-like materials such as elastomers, {{the slope of the}} stress-strain curve increases with stress, meaning that rubbers progressively become more difficult to stretch, while for most metals, the gradient decreases at very high stresses, meaning that they progressively become easier to stretch. Elasticity is not exhibited only by solids; non-Newtonian fluids, such as viscoelastic fluids, will also exhibit elasticity in certain conditions quantified by the Deborah number. In response to a small, rapidly applied and removed strain, these fluids may deform and then return to their original shape. Under larger strains, or strains applied for longer periods of time, these fluids may start to flow like a viscous liquid.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{covers the}} {{integrity}} of decorative sandwich materials; relations between <b>relative</b> <b>deformations</b> of the sandwich system {{and the length of}} contact between layers; thicknesses of the surface layer and <b>relative</b> <b>deformations</b> of the concrete base. Principles of the proposed technology are also provided in the article. The field study of the behaviour of decorative sandwich concrete products exposed to severe conditions of operation have proven that products collapse due to cracking and peeling of the polymer concrete layer in particular cases. Deformations of sandwich materials caused by temperature and humidity fluctuations were analyzed by strain-gauge resistance sensors placed onto the surface polymer concrete layer of a product fragment and on the concrete base {{in the course of their}} freezing. Deformations were measured at the temperature intervals of 4 to 5 degrees Celsius. Freezing represents the most severe condition. Mathematical method of experimental planning was employed to identify the dependence between <b>relative</b> <b>deformations</b> of sandwich system Исс and length of layer-to-layer contact L, thickness of surface layer h and <b>relative</b> <b>deformations</b> of the concrete base ɛ 105. As a result of the probabilistic and statistical processing of the experimental data a three-factor quadratic model of <b>relative</b> <b>deformations</b> of a sandwich system was generated. This equation is used to identify the most favourable conditions to assure {{the integrity of}} a sandwich product under the combined impact of the aforementioned factors. The analysis has proven that the surface layer made of polymer concrete does not crack irrespective of the contact length if deformations of the concrete base do not exceed the limit tensibility of the surface layer. In the event of substantial deformations of the concrete base, integrity of the sandwich system is to be assured by means of the right choice of thickness and length of the surface layer. Based on the dependence of <b>relative</b> <b>deformations</b> of the sandwich composite, made of a concrete matrix and a polymer concrete decorative and protective layer, analysis of their integrity was performed with the account for the thickness of the surface layer, contact length and <b>relative</b> <b>deformations</b> of the water saturated concrete base in the course of freezing. Pre-set theoretical provisions were applied to develop recommendations aimed at the optimization of the composition and characteristics of the technology of production of double-layer decorative and protective products based on polymer and mineral binders.

40|$|Nonlinear {{deformations}} in fingerprint images, {{arising from}} the elasticity of the skin {{as well as the}} pressure and movement of the finger during image acquisition, lead to difficulties in establishing a match between multiple impressions acquired from the same finger. One solution to this problem is to estimate and remove the <b>relative</b> <b>deformations</b> prior to the matching stage. In this paper, these <b>relative</b> <b>deformations</b> are represented as an average deformation model based on minutiae locations and orientations using 2 -D Thin Plate Splines (TPS). The estimated average deformation is used to pre-distort a template prior to matching it with a query image in a verification task. Experimental results show that the use of minutiae locations and orientations to estimate the deformation leads to a more representative deformation model than using minutiae locations only. An index of deformation based on the bending energy is also proposed to select templates with the least variability in the deformations. The EER goes down by ≈ 1. 1 % when we incorporate minutiae orientation information and use the template selection strategy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Gradient-dependent {{plasticity}} where {{a characteristic}} length is involved into yield function is adopted {{to calculate the}} thickness of shear band (SB) {{and the distribution of}} plastic shear strain in SB. The characteristic length reflecting the heterogeneous extent of texture only controls SB’s thickness. The local plastic shear strain in SB is highly non-uniform. The total fracture energy is the sum of pre-peak and post-peak fracture energies. The pre-peak part is described by the nonlinear Scott model and depends on the height of specimen. The post-peak part is calculated through the derived post-peak <b>relative</b> stress-plastic <b>deformation</b> curve. If the inclination angle of SB is not influenced by the height, then the slope of post-peak <b>relative</b> stress-plastic <b>deformation</b> curve and the post-peak fracture energy are independent of the height. The total fracture energy is linearly size-dependent as the pre-peak fracture energy is linearly related to the height.

40|$|AbstractA {{patented}} self-tensioning {{system for}} long-span wooden structural floors is described {{that increases the}} performance of the deflected sections in terms of both resistance and deformation. The system is based on a force multiplier mechanism composed by two connecting rods which are secured to a post-stressing tendon. The mechanical device is activated by the transmission of the load from the structural element to the supports, causing an elongation and stressing the tendon. This transmission comes with a slight vertical displacement of the supports. Throughout this system, the intensity of the tensioning force varies with the applied load; thus, a more favorable bending moment distribution from the load is obtained, and the <b>relative</b> <b>deformations</b> of the different sections of the piece are reduced.

Due to plastic deformation, after cabling the filament size distributions in a strand usually change. The average filament size typically increases, as does the width of the distribution. This is consistent with the low field transport current of strands in cables being typically lower and less reproducible than for round strands [1].
