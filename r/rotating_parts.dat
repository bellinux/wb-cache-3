These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating reference frame of the bike and rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, inertial reference frame and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on <b>rotating</b> <b>parts</b> such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those <b>rotating</b> <b>parts.</b> They are discussed further in the section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, however, {{vibration}} is undesirable, wasting {{energy and}} creating unwanted sound. For example, the vibrational motions of engines, electric motors, or any mechanical device in operation are typically unwanted. Such vibrations could {{be caused by}} imbalances in the <b>rotating</b> <b>parts,</b> uneven friction, or the meshing of gear teeth. Careful designs usually minimize unwanted vibrations.|$|E
25|$|An {{egg beater}} is a hand-cranked mixing device for whipping, beating, and folding food ingredients. It {{typically}} {{consists of a}} handle mounted over a piston, which drives one or two beaters. The beaters are immersed in the food to be mixed. In 1856, American tinner Ralph Collier of Baltimore, Maryland, invented and patented the first rotary egg beater with <b>rotating</b> <b>parts.</b> Collier was issued U.S. patent #16,267 on December 23, 1856.|$|E
25|$|In 1494, Christopher Columbus {{experienced}} a tropical cyclone, {{which led to}} the first written European account of a hurricane. In 1686, Edmund Halley presented a systematic study of the trade winds and monsoons and identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions. In 1735, an ideal explanation of global circulation through study of the trade winds was written by George Hadley. In 1743, when Benjamin Franklin was prevented from seeing a lunar eclipse by a hurricane, he decided that cyclones move in a contrary manner to the winds at their periphery. Understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the Earth affects airflow was partial at first. Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis published a paper in 1835 on the energy yield of machines with <b>rotating</b> <b>parts,</b> such as waterwheels. In 1856, William Ferrel proposed the existence of a circulation cell in the mid-latitudes, and the air within deflected by the Coriolis force resulting in the prevailing westerly winds. Late in the 19th century, the motion of air masses along isobars was understood {{to be the result of}} the large-scale interaction of the pressure gradient force and the deflecting force. By 1912, this deflecting force was named the Coriolis effect. Just after World War I, a group of meteorologists in Norway led by Vilhelm Bjerknes developed the Norwegian cyclone model that explains the generation, intensification and ultimate decay (the life cycle) of mid-latitude cyclones, and introduced the idea of fronts, that is, sharply defined boundaries between air masses. The group included Carl-Gustaf Rossby (who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of fluid dynamics), Tor Bergeron (who first determined how rain forms) and Jacob Bjerknes.|$|E
40|$|Loosening of a <b>rotating</b> <b>part</b> {{from its}} fixed {{position}} on the shaft or {{a part of the}} stator which comes loose and begins to turn with the rotor very frequently represents machinery malfunction. The loose part becomes involved in rotative motion mostly due to dry or fluid friction, and thus its motion is very erratic. The loose part can also move axially along the shaft. Detachment of the <b>rotating</b> <b>part</b> causes changes in the rotor balance state. Most often this results in higher unbalance. During steady-state operation the effect of a loose <b>rotating</b> <b>part</b> can manifest itself through heat vibration. It can be diagnosed by observing periodic changes of amplitude and phase of the synchronous response. During start-up (or shutdown) a loose <b>rotating</b> <b>part</b> carrying some amount of unbalance may manifest its dynamic action in the form of subsynchronous vibrations, very similar to those of other instabilities. The objective of this demonstration is to observe the effect of a loose <b>rotating</b> <b>part</b> (fixed, however, in the axial direction) under both steady-state (rotor constant speed) and transient (rotor start-up or shutdown) operation. The dynamic response depends very much on the amount of damping in the system: lubrication of the loose part/shaft surfaces and addition/elimination of aerodynamic drag blades, mounted on the loose disk, significantly change the rotor response...|$|R

By 08:00, Scharnhorst had reached the Jade Bight but ice prevented the ship from entering Wilhelmshaven. While waiting outside the port, Admiral Ciliax returned to the ship. The ice had been cleared by noon, permitting Scharnhorsts entrance to Wilhelmshaven. Two days later, Scharnhorst went to Kiel for permanent repairs. Work was conducted in a floating dry dock and lasted until July 1942. Afterward, another round of trials were conducted in the Baltic, which revealed the necessity of replacing several of the boiler tubes.|$|E
2500|$|Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis {{published}} {{a paper in}} 1835 on the energy yield of machines with <b>rotating</b> <b>parts,</b> such as waterwheels. That paper considered the supplementary forces that are detected in a rotating frame of reference. Coriolis divided these supplementary forces into two categories. The second category contained a force that arises from the cross product of the angular velocity of a coordinate system and the projection of a particle's velocity into a plane perpendicular to the system's axis of rotation. Coriolis referred to this force as the [...] "compound centrifugal force" [...] due to its analogies with the centrifugal force already considered in category one. The effect was known in the early 20th century as the [...] "acceleration of Coriolis", and by 1920 as [...] "Coriolis force".|$|E
2500|$|The modern steam turbine, {{invented by}} Charles A. Parsons in 1884, overcomes these {{problems}} by having only <b>rotating</b> <b>parts,</b> and no reciprocating parts. In 1894 he formed a syndicate {{to build a}} small experimental [...] steam launch, Turbinia. In a famous publicity stunt, Parson's steam launch sped uninvited past warships in the Solent at the 1897 Review of the Fleet held on the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria's accession to the throne. Turbinia raced past them at the unheard-of speed of 34 knots (63km/h), far outstripping the ships of the Royal Navy sent to intercept. In January 1898 the Admiralty ordered a turbine-powered destroyer, Viper, and later that year a typical lightly built destroyer being built as a private venture was fitted with turbines. The Admiralty purchased this ship after requiring strengthening of the hull, and named the vessel HMS Cobra. Both destroyers were launched in 1899, and both were soon lost for reasons unrelated to their machinery, and before the Admiralty could obtain substantial experience with turbine propulsion.|$|E
30|$|The {{difference}} between the two rotation designs lies in the approach that we used to generate the variable sets in the <b>rotated</b> <b>parts.</b> While the common set was fixed to be the same in both designs, the method of constructing the <b>rotated</b> <b>part</b> differed. In Design 1, we constructed the variable sets so that each had a similar correlation with science performance (Variable Set 1.1 and Variable Set 1.2). In Design 2, we constructed the variable sets so that one had a lower correlation with science performance (Variable Set 2.1) and the other had a higher correlation with performance (Variable Set 2.2). This second design enabled us to ascertain if the correlations between the questions and performance would be likely if questions were assigned, in actuality, to the <b>rotated</b> <b>parts</b> of a questionnaire. In other words, the two designs allowed us to explore what impact the constructs in the <b>rotated</b> <b>parts</b> of the questionnaire had on various aspects of the proficiency estimates (i.e., means, standard deviations, percentiles, correlations), with that impact dependent on whether the constructs had a similar or a different relationship with performance.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{concerns the}} computational analyses of local {{strength of the}} umbilical mast (UM), which is designed for the prelaunch preparation and launch security of the space rocket (SR) "SOYUZ- 2 " of 1 B stage. Based on the finite elements method, modeling and calculation of local strength for the most loaded UM elements are conducted using Russian program complex «APM WINMACHINE». The paper gives a justification for choosing the program complex «APM WINMACHINE, as a program calculation device. In calculating the principles of a local analysis are used. Physical models of the UM particular constructive units are formed to observe them under certain boundary conditions: forces and movements. Parameters of boundary conditions are determined in terms of stress-strain condition of UM simplified model as a whole. As the research results, the paper presents the finite element models of two UM constructive units, namely a joint of the mast farm branches with strengthening of the mast <b>rotating</b> <b>part</b> and an element in the UM bottom <b>rotating</b> <b>part</b> (“the spine”). Besides, there are also the calculated results of the local strength of abovementioned UM <b>rotating</b> <b>part</b> units: a general pattern of the stress distribution with stress values exceeding the allowable ones. The research results allow us to draw conclusions that the units under consideration have performance capability and require their constructive strengthening. The UM developers have taken in consideration recommendations, based on the UM <b>rotating</b> <b>part</b> local strength calculation, making appropriate correction in the project documentation. The experience gained in using the «APM WINMACHINE» allowed us to support {{the conclusion that it}} is efficient to solve the tasks of defining stress-strain condition of complicated spatial constructions. </p...|$|R
