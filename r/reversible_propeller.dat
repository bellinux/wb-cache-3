50|$|In 2013 Antonov {{announced}} that it had successfully flown {{for the first time}} a new version of the An-2 dubbed the An-2-100 fitted with a 3-blade <b>reversible</b> <b>propeller</b> and a 1500 shp Motor Sich MS-14 turboprop running on kerosene rather than Avgas which is no longer produced in CIS countries.|$|E
50|$|Power {{was to be}} {{supplied}} by four Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65R turboprop engines driving five-bladed Hartzell <b>Propeller</b> constant speed <b>reversible</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{airplane}} {{powered by}} two Ivchenko AI-24 turboprops was the An-24. They drove four-bladed AV-72T constant-speed <b>reversible</b> <b>propellers.</b> Early production aircraft had AI-24 engines providing 1,790 kW (2,400 shp) takeoff power each, while later production airplanes were {{equipped with the}} newer AI-24A engines.|$|R

50|$|Stopping and {{reversing}} direction {{are dependent}} upon good operator/pilot/driver skills since airboats {{do not have}} brakes. They are incapable of traveling in reverse, unless equipped with a <b>reversible</b> <b>propeller.</b> Some designs use a clam shell reversing device intended for braking or backing up very short distances but these systems are not commonly used.|$|E
5000|$|The eminent {{inventor}} Frederick William Lanchester {{recognized the}} potential of the motorboat and over the following 15 years, in collaboration with his brother George, perfected the modern motorboat, or powerboat. Working in the garden of their home in Olton, Warwickshire, they designed and built a river flat-bottomed launch with an advanced high-revving engine that drove via a stern paddle wheel in 1893. In 1897, he produced a second engine similar in design to his previous one but running on benzene at 800 r.p.m. The engine drove a <b>reversible</b> <b>propeller.</b> An important part of his new engine was the revolutionary carburettor, for mixing the fuel and air correctly. His invention was known as a [...] "wick carburetor", because fuel was drawn into a series of wicks, from where it was vaporized. He patented this invention in 1905.|$|E
50|$|Investigation of {{propellers}} {{found new}} research had been halted when RLM {{decided to focus}} on jets, only to be resumed. The Mission's interviews were limited to Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (United German Metalworks, VDM), and, at Göttingen, they interviewed Dr. Stüper, who tested VDM's <b>reversible</b> <b>propeller.</b> This three-bladed unit had links to two electric motors, which could change the pitch at two degrees per second for constant speed or 60-100° per second for braking (in reverse mode); it was scheduled for production early in 1945, {{to be used by}} the Dornier Do 335, Dornier Do 317, and Focke-Wulf Fw 190. Mission members visited VDM's forging works at Heddernheim, on the outskirts of Frankfurt. Dr Eckert, of VDM spin-off company Continental Metall Gesellschaft (Continental Metal Company, CMG) confirmed Stüper's claims, adding CMG contemplated switching to hydraulic cylinders. CMG also had a four-bladed project propeller that could eliminate engine overspeeding, by reducing pitch on two blades and increasing it on the other two. In addition, CMG had done some work on hollow propeller blades, one made from a simple rectangular tube with welded-on edges.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Frank W. Caldwell of Hamilton Standard led {{a team that}} {{developed}} a variable-pitch propeller, using hydraulic pressure and centrifugal force to change the angle of attack of the blades. Caldwell received the 1933 Collier Trophy for this advance in flight propulsion. Later advances included full-feathering and <b>reversible</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A controllable-pitch {{propeller}} (CPP) or variable-pitch propeller {{is a type}} of propeller with blades {{that can}} be rotated around their long axis to change the blade pitch. <b>Reversible</b> <b>propellers</b> - those where the pitch can be set to negative values - can also create reverse thrust for braking or going backwards without the need to change the direction of shaft revolution.|$|R
50|$|Created {{a patent}} for a {{mechanically}} controlled <b>reversible</b> pitch <b>propeller</b> later copied {{and used by}} the German Luftwaffe.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1951, two XB-47Ds were {{modified}} from B-47Bs as purely experimental platforms, {{with a big}} Wright YT49-W-1 turboprop engine spinning a huge four-paddle prop, replacing each of the inboard two-jet pods. Difficulties with engine development delayed {{first flight}} of the XB-47D until 26 August 1955. The aircraft's performance was {{comparable to that of}} a conventional B-47, and its <b>reversible</b> <b>propellers</b> shortened the landing roll, but the USAF did not follow up the idea.|$|R

50|$|Public {{disclosure}} of the SkiGull design was made at the EAA's Airventure convention in 2015. Details included ability to operate in ocean waves with skis or land on smooth water or grass with skis retracted, 140 knot cruise speed (optionally 177 knots turbocharged), quiet flight, water takeoff in 460 feet, high wing with 47-foot span (foldable), ground transportation without a trailer, a single 44-percent-span Fowler flap behind the main propeller, and two electric motors with forward-folding <b>reversible</b> <b>propellers</b> to simplify docking and give optional takeoff power.|$|R
50|$|The Amphicar's {{engine was}} mounted {{at the rear}} of the craft, driving the rear wheels through a 4-speed manual transmission. For use in the water, the same engine drove a pair of <b>reversible</b> <b>propellers</b> at the rear, with a second gear lever {{engaging}} forward or reverse drive. Once in the water, the main gear lever would normally be left in neutral. By engaging first gear as well as drive to the propellers when approaching a boat ramp, the Amphicar could drive itself out of the water.|$|R
50|$|February 1953: VP-21 {{replaced}} its P4M-1s with P2V-6 Neptunes, {{carrying the}} latest equipment for minelaying and Anti-submarine warfare (ASW), a steerable nose wheel and <b>reversible</b> pitch <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two {{experimental}} SESs (the SES-100A and 100B), both {{of around}} 100 tons, with 80 ft (24 m) length and 40 ft (12 m) beams, were {{developed for the}} US Military in the 1960s and 70s. They both attained speeds {{in excess of the}} program goal of 80 knots (150 km/h). The SES 100B, was built by Bell Aerospace (Textron Corporation) at the NASA Michoud Assembly Facility. Driven by 2 semi-submerged, supercavitating controllable, <b>reversible</b> <b>propellers,</b> achieved speeds in excess of 96 knots (approximately 110 mph) in the Gulf outside St. Andrews Bay in Panama City, Florida.|$|R

5000|$|Four (LM2500) {{gas turbine}} engines propel Port Royal with [...] at speeds greater than 30 kn. Two five-bladed {{controllable}} <b>reversible</b> pitch <b>propellers</b> (17 ft diameter) and two rudders assist in acceleration and deceleration.|$|R
50|$|The Constellation {{had several}} {{technological}} advancements such as electric de-icing, hydraulic assisted controls, <b>reversible</b> pitch <b>propellers</b> and pressurization, which allowed the Constellation to fly above the clouds. Lockheed had done pressurization in an aircraft before, with the Lockheed XC-35.|$|R
50|$|The G.222 is a twin turboprop-engine {{tactical}} military transport aircraft, and {{is designed}} to be capable of transporting equipment or troops in combat zones and operating with minimal ground support. Early production aircraft were exclusively fitted with the General Electric T64-GE-P4D turboprop engine, the licence-built Rolls-Royce Tyne was made available as an alternative powerplant for the type from 1980 onwards, while the Allison T56 was another proposed powerplant for the type. Due to features such as double-slotted flaps, stacked brakes, and <b>reversible</b> <b>propellers,</b> the G.222 has excellent short landing capabilities and is able to land in as little as 1,800 feet. It was designed to be integrated with the larger, commonplace Lockheed C-130 Hercules.|$|R
40|$|As {{an aid to}} {{airplane}} designers {{interested in}} providing pursuit airplanes with decelerating devices intended to increase the firing time when overtaking another airplane, formulas are given relating the pertinent distances and speeds in horizontal flight to the drag increase required. Charts are given for a representative parasite-drag coefficient from which the drag increase, the time gained, and the closing distance may be found. The charts are made up for three values of {{the ratio of the}} final speed of the pursuing airplane to the speed of the pursued airplane and for several values of the ratio of the speed of the pursued airplane to the initial speed of the pursuing airplane. Charts are also given indicating the drag increases obtainable with double split flaps and with conventional propellers. The use of the charts is illustrated by an example in which it is indicated that either double split flaps or, under certain ideal conditions, <b>reversible</b> <b>propellers</b> should provide the speed reductions required...|$|R
50|$|The thrust {{to propel}} the {{aircraft}} forward comes from its propellers or jet engines. Reverse thrust for backing up {{can be generated}} by thrust reversers such as on the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, or <b>reversible</b> pitch <b>propellers</b> such as on the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Most aircraft, however, are not designed to back up {{on their own and}} must be pushed back either by hand or by using an aircraft tug.|$|R
50|$|Asheville class gunboats {{employed}} a combined diesel or gas turbine (CODOG) propulsion system; twin Cummins diesel engines for endurance, and a GE LM1500 gas turbine for high-speed dash. Engine controls were operated by pneumatics. The controllable <b>reversible</b> pitch <b>propeller</b> {{allowed them to}} stop {{in less than two}} ship lengths from full speed. They were the first gas turbine ships in the US Navy, as well as the first with aluminum hulls and fiberglass superstructures.|$|R
50|$|Designed {{and built}} by Ingalls Shipyards of Litton Industries in Pascagoula, Mississippi, USA, Fletcher {{was a member}} of the first major class of surface ships in the United States Navy to be powered by gas turbine engines. Four General Electric LM2500 gas turbine engines, marine {{versions}} of those used in DC-10 aircraft, drove the ship at speeds in excess of 30 knots (56 km/h). Twin controllable <b>reversible</b> pitch <b>propellers</b> provided Fletcher with a degree of maneuverability unique among warships of her size.|$|R

2500|$|The Husky {{features}} a braced high wing, tandem seating and dual controls. The structure is steel tube frames and Dacron covering {{over all but}} {{the rear of the}} fuselage, plus metal leading edges on the wings. The high wing was selected for good all-around visibility, making the Husky ideal for observation and patrol roles. [...] Power is supplied by a relatively powerful (for the Husky's weight) [...] Textron Lycoming O-360 flat-four piston engine turning a constant speed propeller. In 2015 a <b>reversible</b> MT <b>Propeller</b> was approved under a Supplementary Type Certificate for better control during floatplane water operations. [...] The Husky's high power-to-weight ratio and low wing loading result in good short-field performance.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1950s, the Maritime Administration instituted the Liberty Ship Conversion and Engine Improvement Program, {{which had}} a goal to {{increase}} the speed of Liberty ships to , making them competitive with more modern designs, as well as gaining experience with alternate propulsion systems. Four ships were converted in the $11 million program. [...] The SS Benjamin Chew had its existing condensers modified and a new superheater and geared turbine installed to give the ship 6,000 shp, up from 2,500. The SS Thomas Nelson had its bow lengthened, diesel engines installed in place of the original steam engine, and movable cranes outfitted in place of the original cargo handling gear. The GTS (Gas Turbine Ship) John Sergeant had its bow extended, and its steam engine replaced with a General Electric gas turbine of 6,600 shp, connected to a <b>reversible</b> pitch <b>propeller</b> via reduction gearing. John Sergeant was considered overall to be a success, but problems with the <b>reversible</b> pitch <b>propeller</b> ended its trial after 3 years. The GTS William Patterson had its bow extended and its steam engine replaced with 6 General Electric GE-14 free-piston gas generators, connected to two reversible turbines and capable of 6,000 shp total. William Patterson was considered to be a failure as reliability was poor and the scalability of the design was poor. [...] All four vessels were fueled with Bunker C fuel oil, though John Sergeant required a quality of fuel available at limited ports and also required further treatment to reduce contaminants. [...] Three were scrapped in 1971 or 1972 and the diesel-equipped Thomas Nelson was scrapped in 1981.|$|R
