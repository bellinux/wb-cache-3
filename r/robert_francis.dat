500|$|<b>Robert</b> <b>Francis</b> Engs's Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited: Samuel Chapman Armstrong and Hampton Institute, 1839–1893 is {{the first}} {{biography}} of General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, {{the founder of the}} Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute. The book was published by the University of Tennessee Press in 1999. It challenges several long-standing ideas about this period: that the [...] "Hampton-Tuskegee system" [...] and its adherents stunted the progress of African Americans, that the Hampton Institute ideology was opposed to that of historically black and historically white colleges, and that the positions of W. E. B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington were diametrically opposed. Engs writes Armstrong as a symbol of postbellum America's conflicts over race, class, religion, and gender. Engs's Armstrong, in [...] "paternal ... arrogance" [...] believed that he and others of higher status could best determine how to improve the lots of those suppressed by [...] "lack of opportunity and discrimination", such as African Americans and American Indians. This intuition, of knowing [...] "what was best for the freedmen", was influenced by his experience in missionary work, where his parents treated the indigenous Hawaiians as misbehaving children with behavior to be corrected. The biography distills Armstrong's philosophy, demeanor, and understanding of African Americans from his experiences as a missionary, student of Williams College, and leader in the American Civil War. Engs dismisses polarized interpretations of Armstrong's legacy as either a savior or a handicap for uneducated blacks. Instead, Armstrong is portrayed as a complex man who believes both in [...] "black inferiority" [...] and that freedmen could improve their lives through his lessons.|$|E
