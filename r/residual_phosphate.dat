5000|$|A phosphorus-free {{growth medium}} (which {{actually}} contained 3.1 ± 0.3 μM of <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate,</b> from impurities in reagents) {{was used to}} culture the bacteria in a regime of increasing exposure to arsenate; the initial level of 0.1 mM was eventually ramped up to 40 mM. Alternative media used for comparative experiments contained either high levels of phosphate (1.5 mM) with no arsenate, or had neither added phosphate nor added arsenate. It was observed that GFAJ-1 could grow through many doublings in cell numbers when cultured in either phosphate or arsenate media, but could not grow when placed in a medium of a similar composition to which neither phosphate nor arsenate was added. The phosphorus content of the arsenic-fed, phosphorus-starved bacteria (as measured by ICP-MS) was only 0.019 (± 0.001) % by dry weight, one thirtieth of that when grown in phosphate-rich medium. This phosphorus content was also only about one tenth of the cells' average arsenic content (0.19 ± 0.25% by dry weight). The arsenic content of cells as measured by ICP-MS varies widely and can be lower than the phosphorus contents in some experiments, and up to fourteen times higher in others. Other data from the same study obtained with nano-SIMS suggest a ~75-fold excess of phosphate (P) over arsenic (As) when expressed as P:C and As:C ratios, even in cells grown with arsenate and no added phosphate. When cultured in the arsenate solution, GFAJ-1 only grew 60% {{as fast as it}} did in phosphate solution. The phosphate-starved bacteria had an intracellular volume 1.5 times normal; the greater volume appeared {{to be associated with the}} appearance of large [...] "vacuole-like regions".When the researchers added isotope-labeled arsenate to the solution to track its distribution, they found that arsenic was present in the cellular fractions containing the bacteria's proteins, lipids and metabolites such as ATP, as well as its DNA and RNA. Nucleic acids from stationary phase cells starved of phosphorus were concentrated via five extractions (one with phenol, three with phenol-chloroform and one with chloroform extraction solvent), followed by ethanol precipitation. Although direct evidence of the incorporation of arsenic into biomolecules is still lacking, radioactivity measurements suggested that approximately one-tenth (11.0 ± 0.1%) of the arsenic absorbed by these bacteria ended up in the fraction that contained the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and all other co-precipitated compounds not extracted by the previous treatments. A comparable control experiment with isotope-labeled phosphate was not performed.With the distribution of the strain in mid-2011, other labs began to independently test the validity of the discovery. Prof. Rosie Redfield from the University of British Columbia, following issues with the growth conditions, investigated the growth requirements of GFAJ-1, and found that the strain grows better on solid agar medium than in liquid culture. Redfield attributed this to low potassium levels and hypothesized that the potassium levels in basal ML60 medium may be too low to support growth. Redfield after finding and addressing further issues (ionic strength, pH and the use of glass tubes instead of polypropylene) found that arsenate marginally stimulated growth, but didn't affect the final densities of the cultures, unlike what was claimed. Subsequent studies using mass spectrometry by the same group found no evidence of arsenate being incorporated into the DNA of GFAJ-1.|$|E
40|$|The Olsen {{method is}} an {{indicator}} of plant-available phosphorus (P). The effect of time and temperature on <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate</b> in soils was measured using the Olsen method in a pot experiment. Four soils were investigated: two from Pakistan and one each from England (calcareous) and Colombia (acidic). Two levels of <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate</b> were developed in each soil after addition of phosphate by incubation at either 10 degreesC or 45 degreesC. The amount of phosphate added {{was based on the}} P maximum of each soil, calculated using the Langmuir equation. Rvegrass was used as the test crop. The pooled data for the four soils incubated at 10 degreesC showed good correlation between Olsen P and dry matter yield or P uptake (r(2) = 0. 85 and 0. 77, respectively), whereas at 45 degreesC, each soil had its own relationship and pooled data did not show correlation of Olsen P with dry matter yield or P uptake. When the data at both temperatures were pooled, Olsen P was a good indicator of yield and uptake for the English soil. For the Pakistani soils, Olsen P after 45 degreesC treatment was an underestimate relative to the 10 degreesC data and for the Colombian soil it was an overestimate. The reasons for these differences need to be explored further before high temperature incubation can be used to simulate long-term changes in the field...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) {{has been}} used for a {{detailed}} structural analysis of different amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and hydroxyapatite (HAp) samples. For ACP the NMR data reveal the presence of hydrogenphosphate units in much larger quantities as known previously also showing differences between the samples. Furthermore, phosphate units close to water and a third group (yet unknown) are found in the spectra. A novel proposal has been established to explain the Ca-deficiency in nanocrystalline HAp. It consists of a crystalline core of stoichiometric composition which contains only 50 % of the total phosphate amount. The <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate</b> is contained in a disordered surface layer with about 1 nm thickness. Most importantly, this surface layer contains hydrogenphosphate groups to a large extend and carbonate units. A Ca/P ratio of 1. 52 is obtained from the NMR data which is very close to the value of 1. 51 of the chemical analysis. Thus, NMR allows the investigation of the disordered mineral-protein interface and first examples concerning bone and nacre are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the presence of heavy metals presence on the elimination of phosphates in dairy wastewater. It focuses on the phosphates precipitation in a stoichiometric dose of ferric chloride and is made of two main parts: Without contribution of heavy metals. With contribution of heavy metals (lead and cadmium). In both parts, the removal was carried out at first in a physical-chemical way by the precipitation of phosphates with ferric chloride; the <b>residual</b> <b>phosphates</b> concentrations were then biologically eliminated by activated sludge taken from an urban wastewater treatment plant. For the tests conducted with heavy metals presence, lead and cadmium concentrations between (10 and 100 mg/L) were added to the wastewater kept for our study. The main results show: -Good phosphate precipitation with the use of ferric chloride. - The combination of biological and physical-chemical processes is possible since a removal of 69 % in presence of Lead (Pb) and 93 % in presence of Cadmium (Cd) were obtained. -Maximum removals of 100 % lead (for 100 mg/L of Pb) and 94 % cadmium (for 50 mg/L of Cd) were obtained after phosphates precipitation by the ferric chloride. Moreover, in an attempt to assess the performance of the biological treatment by activated sludge combined to the physical-chemical process on the removal of heavy metals in the water to be treated. The evolution of the Cadmium's concentration according to time was followed in both supernatant and sludge. This was made possible by a kinetic study in batch. In this case, the results show: -Cadmium removal from about 81 % in the supernatant. -Good retention of cadmium in the sludge. The synthesis of all the results obtained during this study shows that the combination of physical-chemical and biological processes improves the removal of phosphates in the absence and presence of heavy metals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Phosphorus {{is a vital}} {{element in}} human’s lifecycle. It is {{required}} for humans and for other organisms to live. Life activities {{of some of these}} organisms cause big problems for humans. Eutrophication process is caused by excessive income of phosphorus and nitrogen to natural water resources. The main aim of this project was to test flotation unit together with coagulants and flocculants for removing of phosphorus from wastewater in a water basin of water reservoir Švihov. Research consisted of laboratory analyzes with subsequent verification of the results in the field. Coagulants and flocculants were tested, using conventional jar tests. For these tests were used wastewater from target wastewater treatment plant with artificial addition of phosphate in the form of KH 2 PO 4. It was done for better visibility of the coagulation results. Flotation experiments were done on a pilot scale flotation unit, provided by the KUNST company, on wastewater treatment plant of the Pacov city. Using jar tests the best available combination of coagulant and flocculant was found (FeCl 3 and 827 BS with dosage of 1. 25 mg/l for both of them). Different dosages of coagulants and flocculants were assessed, basing on subsequent analyses. Was measured pH value, as it is critical value for the environment and it cannot be less than 6. Also assessment was based on <b>residual</b> <b>phosphates</b> concentration, traces of aluminum and iron from coagulants and COD value. During subsequent flotation tests was found that at certain ratio of Fe/P, there is additional consumption of coagulant in the sampling water. We supposed, that it happened because of breakthrough point for inorganic phosphorus, which is situated between Fe/P ratios of 2. 6 and 4. 6. It is important to conduct additional experiments on less equipped treatment plants in the area, where effectiveness of application of flotation unit, together with chemicals can be determined better for these territories and conditions.

40|$|Brain tissue {{infected}} with the virus of poliomyelitis {{has been shown to}} have a decreased ability to metabolize glucose under anaerobic conditions while oxidation of glucose is unimpaired (1). Preliminary studies also suggested that oxidation of lactate, succinate, and pyruvate by poliomyelitic brain tissue did not differ from normal. Dehydrogenase activity of poliomyelitis-infected brain was unaffected with glucose, lactate, or succinate as substrates but was greater than normal in the absence of added substrate. Sodium fluoride had a greater inhibitory effect on anaerobic glycolysis of normal than of poliomyelitic mouse brain suspensions.

40|$|Surface {{waters in}} {{upwelling}} regions {{are thought to}} be nutrient rich and hence inhibit nitrogen fixation (diazotrophy) because diazotrophs can preferentially assimilate nitrate and ammonia instead of expending energy to fix dinitrogen. We found average nitrogen fixation rates to be two to seven times higher in the surface waters of the upwelling region of the eastern equatorial Atlantic than typically measured here during non-upwelling periods. We posit that in this region, low nitrate-phosphate ratio waters are upwelled, and an initial bloom of non-diazotrophic phytoplankton removes recently upwelled nitrate. Thereby, diazotrophy is fuelled by <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate</b> and by a combination of aeolian and upwelled sources of iron. Annually, we estimate that approximately 47 Gmol of new nitrogen is introduced by diazotrophy in upwelled waters alone and 195 Gmol N is fixed in the equatorial Atlantic region. Our findings challenge the paradigm that the highest nitrogen fixation rates occur in oligotrophic gyres and instead provide evidence of its importance in upwelling regimes where phosphate- and iron-rich waters rich are upwelled...|$|E

Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD) and response surface method (RSM) were used to study the effects of a large number of nutrients on cell growth and lipid accumulation. The optimized medium supported a lipid concentration of 641. 4 mg/l and a cell density of 2. 54 g/l, which were 4. 5 -fold and 2. 2 -fold of that obtained with the basic medium, modified Bristol medium (MBM), respectively. The capacity of the strain for phosphorus removal and nitrogen removal was investigated using artificial wastewater and municipal wastewater effluents. It was demonstrated that the strain could achieve near-zero <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate</b> and nitrogen at the end of cultivation when artificial wastewater contained up to 140 mg N-NO 3 -/l and 47 mg P-PO 43 -/l.

40|$|When Spirodela {{plants are}} {{transferred}} to a phosphate-deficient medium, growth slows down immediately, and ceases after 14 days. During this time, inorganic phosphate content falls from 30 to 0. 7 μmoles/g fresh weight of tissue, phosphate ester content from 3. 5 to 0. 6 μmoles/g, phospholipid content from 3. 5 to 1. 2 μmoles/g, and <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate</b> (mainly RNA) content from 7. 5 to 2. 0 μmoles/g. Relative proportions of the various phosphate esters, and relative proportions of the various phospholipids, are not markedly affected by phosphate deficiency. Turnover rates of phosphate esters are somewhat higher in phosphate-deficient tissue. In control tissue, inorganic phosphate is present in 2 pools; a metabolic (12 %) and a non-metabolic pool (88 %). In phosphate-deficient tissues, most of the inorganic phosphate (> 90 %) is in the metabolic pool. Non-metabolic phosphate is presumably stored in the vacuole, and is not readily accessible to the tissue, so that growth normally occurs {{at the expense of}} external phosphate. During deficiency, growth is limited by the rate at which phosphate can be transported through the tonoplast and tissue to the growing point. Growth ceases when the supply of non-metabolic phosphate is exhausted. Metabolic phosphate is presumably located in the cytoplasm: it can not be used for growth. Nor can the plant respond to deficiency by making some phosphorus compounds at the expense of others. In this respect, phosphorus deficiency and nitrogen deficiency are dissimilar...|$|E

40|$|DOI: 10. 1080 / 00103624. 2010. 508296 The soil {{phosphorus}} (P) test in Portugal {{is based}} on extraction with ammonium lactate (AL) at acidic pH. Because this test is rarely used in other countries, it is desirable {{to see whether the}} AL-P values correlate with the more commonly used P tests. In this work, we compared AL-P with bicarbonate-extractable P (Olsen’s method) for a group of 48 samples from Portuguese acidic soils differing widely in P status. Despite their contrasting composition, both reagents extracted phosphate from the same sources, albeit in different proportions. Both Olsen P and AL-P were strongly correlated with resin-extractable and dilute electrolyte-desorbable P, which are respectively related to the soil contents in phytoavailable P and P that can be released to runoff or drainage water. Olsen P and AL-P were strongly correlated (R 2 = 0. 870), the correlation became stronger when three overfertilized soils were excluded (Olsen P = 2. 35 + 0. 45 AL-P; R 2 = 0. 908; P ≤ 0. 001, n = 45). No correlation was observed for a group of soils recently fertilized with Gafsa phosphate probably because the acidic AL reagent dissolved <b>residual</b> calcium <b>phosphate,</b> thus overestimating the soil content in desorbable P. On the basis of the present results and the AL-P-based fertility classes used for fertilizer recommendation purposes, Olsen P–based fertility classes were tentatively proposed for Portuguese acidic soils...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT One of the {{alternatives}} for achieving sustainable agriculture {{and a reduction in}} production costs, especially with phosphate fertilisers, is to inoculate seeds with bacteria of the genus Azospirillum. The aim of this study therefore, was to evaluate <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate</b> fertilisation and Azospirillum brasilense, together with the contribution of straw from maize intercropped with Marandu grass, on leaf nutritional content, yield components and winter bean yield. The experiment was carried out on the Teaching and Research Farm, of the School of Engineering at UNESP, located in Selvíria in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, in a typic clayey dystrophic Red Latosol. The experimental design was of randomised blocks with four replications in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme. The treatments consisted of beans sown on straw from maize intercropped with Marandu grass on areas that had received five levels of P 2 O 5 in the form of MAP, applied during an initial cultivation of black oats (0, 30, 60, 120 and 240 kg ha- 1), both with and without inoculation of the oat and maize which preceded the beans with Azospirillum brasilense. Leaf nutrient content, leaf chlorophyll index (ICF), yield components and bean productivity were all evaluated. Inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense of the black oat and maize seeds improved the nutritional status of the plants, but had a negative effect on grain yield.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{solubilization}} behavior of the tailings produced by the floatation of a complex low grade phosphate ore. The composition of the tailings was essentially dolomite (52. 04 %) with minor amounts of phosphate, iron and aluminium oxides (10. 4 and 0. 5 % respectively). The presence of these products created uncontrolled land pollution and severely affected groundwater. An initiative has been taken up for utilization of this waste to generate an eco-friendly product. First step towards this panorama is incorporation of suitable microorganisms for the biodegradation of this effluent. Sulphur oxidizing bacteria Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans produces sulphuric acid which neutralizes the dolomitic tailings and convert it into plant available forms. The solubilization activity was tested in sulphur medium with 5, 10, 15 and 20 % concentration of tailings. The solubilization is graded {{on the basis of}} pH, Electrical conductivity (EC), soluble calcium and magnesium and soluble phosphate. The results from ex-situ experiments showed that the treatment with 15 % tailings ended with highest solubilization. The values of pH, EC, soluble calcium and magnesium and soluble phosphate for this treatment were 4. 92, 31. 6 dS/m, 10. 8 mL EDTA and 17. 24 µg/mL respectively. Also, the results proved that sulphur oxidizing bacteria Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans is capable of solubilizing dolomitic tailings from the Jhamarkotra mines. Finally, an important factor taken into account was solubilization of <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate</b> along with dolomite in the tailings. This combined action affects the solubilization behaviour of the residue, which was also showed successfully with the assayed laboratory studies...|$|E
40|$|Two {{subjects}} in chemical phosphate removal were investigated in this study: rapid mixing and modeling. Evaluation of rapid-mixing parameters showed that chemical phosphate removal {{is affected by}} the mixing intensity, the mixing time, and aluminum solution strength. Phosphate removal efficiency improved as the mixing intensity increased from a mean velocity gradient (G) value of 150 to 600 sec[superscript]- 1. Further increase in a G value was not accompanied by improvement of phosphate removal efficiency. This indicates that an optimum mixing intensity for chemical phosphate removal is a G value of 600 sec[superscript]- 1. The effect of the mixing time was found insignificant when it was in the range of 10 - 60 seconds. After that, phosphate removal efficiency deteriorated over time when the mixing time was increased up to 180 seconds. The time trend was found to be linear and constant at G values of 500 - 1000 sec[superscript]- 1. The higher the aluminum solution strength, the better was the phosphate removal efficiency;The modeling study found that phosphates were removed by forming aluminum hydroxyphosphate, Al[subscript] 1. 2 H[subscript] 2 PO[subscript] 4 (OH) [subscript] 2. 6, rather than aluminum phosphate in chemical phosphate removal. It was also shown that calcium-phosphate precipitation could occur at an initial stage of chemical phosphate removal when calcium was present in the wastewater. The precipitates could be tricalcium phosphate. Aluminum chloride and alum were compared in their effects on chemical phosphate removal. There was no difference between use of these two chemicals. Evaluation of the Ferguson model for phosphate removal revealed that the Ferguson model predicted the <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate</b> values well. However, the model was found to be more like data fitting because it did not incorporate complexes and cannot account for use of different chemical effects.

40|$|International audienceThe annual {{population}} {{growth rate of}} African cities is on average 5 %. This situation leads to increasing quantities of wastewater generated in most cities. For example, in the Ivorian capital Abidjan, the daily volume of collected wastewater is actually ~ 190 000 m 3. The Abidjan wastewaters only undergo a passive treatment prior to discharge into the Ebrié lagoon. Moreover, excess of orthophosphate is at the origin of eutrophication that leads to strong perturbation of the lagoon biodiversity. Therefore, {{there is a growing}} interest to identify easily available minerals for performing tertiary treatment of dephosphatisation [1]. In this study, samples of shale were collected from Toumodi region (i. e. Lomo North site) in the Center of Ivory Coast. The solid samples were characterized by several techniques including XRD, Mössbauer spectroscopy, SEM-EDX, XPS and ICP-MS. The major minerals of the shale are silicates and phyllosilicates, i. e. quartz, albite, muscovite and clinochlore. Structural Fe III and Fe II species are present in substitution of other cations of the clays minerals and a minor part of the Fe III species is present in goethite -FeOOH. The reactivity of the shale with phosphate (PO 4) was studied in both homogeneous suspension (" batch reactor ") and in hydrodynamic conditions (" column reactors "). A particular attention was devoted to determine both <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate</b> and metal species (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Al 3 + and total iron) released in solution after phosphate sorption. Kinetics experiments in " batch reactors " showed that the saturation of the shale surface by PO 4 occurred after  24 hours of contact time. Adsorption isotherms led to a maximal PO 4 adsorption capacity of  0. 4 mg g- 1 at neutral pH. The PO 4 removal capacity decreased with increasing pH and reached a minimum around pH= 10. In strong alkaline conditions an increase of the PO 4 removal capacity was observed that was linked to an increase of the aluminum solubility. During the column experiments, the phosphate solution circulated continuously during a five days period and then was stop during 2. 7 days to study the effect of residence time on phosphate removal. This sequence was repeated several times in order to reach a quasi-saturation of the column by PO 4. The PO 4 breakthrough of the column was strongly dependent on the contact time. Interestingly, a correlation between the increase of PO 4 removal rate observed at longer contact time with an increase of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + solubility was established. Therefore, these species could play a more important role than iron in the PO 4 removal mechanism of shale. In conclusion the shale of Ivory Cost is an interesting material for PO 4 removal from wastewater. Nevertheless, it should be compared in terms of removal efficiency and cost to other readily available natural compounds, e. g. laterite and sandstone, or recently developed synthetic Fe III nanocomposites [2].

Sur un bassin de 48 m 2, alimenté eu eaux usées domestiques préalablement traitées pendant une semaine dans un bassin {{primaire}} ont été suivies selon un rythme hebdomadaire les formes carbonées, azotées et phosphorées dis-soutes et particulaires, les variables caractéristiques de l'activité photosynthétiques (chlorophylle a, pH et 02) et les données climatiques (rayonnement solaire et température). Une analyse en composantes principales réalisée sur l'ensemble des résultats a montré, d'une part l'opposition des variables climatiques et photosynthétiques aux formes minérales de l'azote et du phosphore (N-NH 4 et P-PO 4) et d'autre part l'influence de la charge organique sur le fonctionnement du système. L'évolution des formes azotées et phosphorées présente un effet saisonnier marqué. En hiver ou lors de surcharge organique importante, une augmentation du temps de séjour peut améliorer les rendements épuratoires. L'évolution de la matière organique dissoute est indépendante du cycle saisonnier. Au cours des deux années du suivi on observe une adaptation progressive de l'écosystème à la dégradation de la matière organique. Dans le lagunage à haut rendement l'élimination de l'azote et du phosphore est liée principalement à l'activité algale, qui entraîne une assimilation biologique et une élévation du pH, responsables des phénomènes chimiques de volatilisation de l'azote ammoniacal et de précipitation de phosphate de calcium. High rait algal ponds (HRAP) for {{wastewater treatment}} {{have been the}} locus {{of a lot of}} attention since their creation by Professor W. J. OSWALD in the early 1960 ' s. These aquatic ecosystems are hypereutrophic because of massive nutrient introduction with the wastewater influent. This kind of pond is very different from oxidation ponds because al short residence times (2 to 12 days), shallow depths (0. 30 to 0. 60 m) and constant mechanical mixing which improves algal growth. This study has been carried out {{in a small town in}} the department of Herault (France). The objective is to establish the efficiencies and mechanisms for nitrogen and phosphorus remval from secondary domestic wastewater by treatment by HRAP. A high rate algal pond of 48 m 2 surface area and 35 cm depth, constantly mixed with paddle wheels was studied (fig. 1). Residence limes changed from 2 te 12 days with solar radiations and influent loading. The samples were collected once a week from the in- and outflow at 3 p. m. - Dissolved and particulate COD, varions nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, suspended solide, chlorophyll-a, pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature and irradiation were determined. The results of principal component analysis show a negative correlation between (1) the climatic and photosynthetic parameters and (2) inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, as well as the influence of organic loading on the HRAP efficiency. The chronological clustering analysis was performed on the data taking into account the discontinuities of effluent autrient contents (fig. 4). During the first year, from February to September 1988, good climatic conditions were shown to favour photosynthetic activity and consequently a good ammonia and orthophosphate removal. Front September 1988 to February 1989, the effluent was characterized by high ammonia and orthophosphate levels because of unfavourable climatic conditions and low photosynthetic activity. During the second year, the objective was to improve removal efficiencies; the residence time was changed with solar radiations and influent loading. The results of the chronological clustering analysis of ammonia and orthophosphate levels showed only one sequence (February 1989 -January 1990) because the seasonal variations of nutrient removal were attenuated. The optimal residence time was found to be 4 days in summer and 12 days in winter. The evolution of dissolved chemical oxygen demand is independent of seasonal conditions but decreases with the maturity of the system (< 50 mg. l- 1). The mass balance of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds has been established (fig. 5). In high rate algal pond influent, the main nitrogen form is ammonia. In the effluent the main nitrogen form is suspended organic nitrogen. The oxidized forms (NO 2 - et NO 3) present very low levels; nitrification is a minor process in the system. Ammonia is reduced by both assimilation and stripping; suspended organic nitrogen in the effluent is an indicator of assimilation by algal biomass and loss of nitrogen is an indicator of ammonia stripping. With regard to directive 91 / 271 EEC concerning domestic wastewater treatment, partial algal separation is necessary in order to achieve 15 mg • l- 1 total nitrogen, which is the limit for zones sensitive to eutrophication. The <b>residual</b> <b>phosphate</b> levels are controlled by pH, which is responsible for instantaneous calcium phosphate precipitation. As the dissolved calcium concentrations are high in the calcareous region near the site (Ca = 125 mg • l- 1), the pH of the water will be the main contraint on phosphate elimination in the HRAP. Theoretical calculations indicate that the precipitate is probably an amorphous tricalcium phosphate in pseudoequilibrium (fig. 6). Phosphate concentrations are much higher titan the values expected for calcium hydroxyapatite in equilibrium (MOUTIN et al., 1992). The limit of 2 mg • l- 1 for phosphores can only be attained when pH reaches or exceeds 9. Nitrogen and phosphorus removal is correlated mainly with phytoplanktonic activity, which controls biological nutrients assimilation and pH levels. High pH values are responsable for ammonia stripping and calcium phosphate precipitation...|$|E
40|$|Calcification of bioprosthetic {{heart valves}} {{fabricated}} from glutaraldehyde pretreated bovine pericardium or porcine aortic valves (PAV) {{is a frequent}} cause {{of the failure of}} these devices. Of all strategies considered thus far, only detergent preincubations using compounds such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) ingibited PAV bioprosthetic mineralization in circulatory sheep bioprosthetic valve replacements. The present study sought to characterize the mechanism of action of SDS preincubation. Results of transport and material characterization studies showed that SDS had a relatively high affinity for PAV, with a maximum uptake of 167. 1 ± 6. 8 Μg SDS/mg tissue over 24 h at 37 °C with a partition coefficient of 19. 3. The PAV diffusion of SDS was 1. 95 ± 0. 35 10 − 6 cm 2 /sec. The principal effect of SDS on PAV was phospholipid extraction. The residual organic phospholipid extraction. The <b>residual</b> organic <b>phosphate</b> in the SDS pretreated tissue was 2. 22 ± 0. 72 nmol/mg tissue compared to the control untreated group with 18. 52 ± 2. 1 nmol/mg tissue. Incubations of PAV specimens in a 1 % SDS solution for 24 h significantly inhibited calcification after 21 days in subdermal implants in 3 -week-old male rats (PAV Ca 2 + = 18. 0 ± 11. 8 Μg/mg) compared to control (177. 8 ± 6. 0 Μg/mg). In contrast, coimplants of 30 % SDS silicone rubber polymers, for regional sustained SDS administration, did not impede PAV calcification in 21 day implants Ca 2 + = 166. 0 ± 14. 0 Μg/mg compared to the nondrug silicone matrix controls, (Ca 2 + = 173. 0 ± 6. 6 Μg/mg). Thus, we conclude that the mechanisms of SDS inhibition of PAV calcification is due to material effects which occur during preincubation, and is not facilitated by sustained SDS administration. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
40|$|In {{tropical}} regions, the <b>residual</b> {{effect of}} <b>phosphate</b> fertilizer source is of crucial importance. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} effects of application of P sources in chemical properties of soil, nutrition and productivity of sugarcane plant and during {{the first and second}} ratoon. The sources of P applied in furrows at planting were, triple superphosphate, Arad phosphate, bone meal (100 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5 total) and a control without P, the varieties of sugarcane studied were IAC 86 - 2480 and SP 79 - 1011. A randomized block design in a 4 × 2 factorial was used, with four replications. The study was conducted in the municipality of Alta Floresta-MT, Brazil, in Typic Hapludox. After each cutting, in soil P content, pH and Ca were evaluated. In the plant, the production of green and dry matter of shoots, the concentration of P in the biomass harvested, the export of P and agronomic efficiency of the sources of P were determined. The bone meal had a higher agronomic efficiency resulted in greater accumulation and export of P by crop, higher content of available Ca and P and increase soil pH. The Arad reactive phosphate increased its agronomic efficiency between crop cycles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMost of Indonesian {{agricultural}} soils are acidic {{and low in}} both total and available phosphorus particularly. The major nutrient constraint in these soils is P and responses to both N and K are poor unless P deficiency has first been corrected. Correction of P deficiency therefore constitutes {{a major part of}} improving fertility of acid soils. Phosphate rock is recommended for application to acid soils where phosphorus is an important limiting nutrient on plant growth. This problem faces most acid soils in Sumatra and Kalimantan. We conducted a study of the effect of reactive phosphate rock for Maize on an Ultisol in Pleihari, South Kalimantan Province. The experiment was carried out in farmer fields for six cropping season. The objectives are to evaluate direct application of reactive phosphate rock (RPR) for Maize, its combination with manure and agronomic effectiveness. Reactive phosphate rock improved soil fertility and maize crop productivity. Moroccan RPR contained the highest citric acid extractable P 2 O 5 among other phosphate rock tested and also the most effective in improving maize yield. In addition, the <b>residual</b> effect of <b>phosphate</b> rock in supplying plant with P for up to six cultivation years was demonstrated. However, although phosphate rock is cheaper than SP- 36, farmers did not adopt this technology yet. Through collaboration research between The OCP and ISRI (Indonesian Soil Research Institute), a more comprehensive study on the potential effect of direct application of Reactive Phosphate Rock from OCP MOROCCO, on Maize is being conducted. The overall objectives are to evaluate direct application of Reactive Phosphate Rock for Maize and find out the best application rate and method of Rock Phosphate for Maize...|$|R
