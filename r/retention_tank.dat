40|$|In the past, New Brunswick Laboratory (NBL) {{has used}} a fluorometric method for the {{determination}} of sub-microgram quantities of uranium. In its continuing effort to upgrade and improve measurement technology, NBL has evaluated the commercially-available KPA- 11 kinetic phosphorescence analyzer (Chemchek, Richland, WA). The Chemchek KPA- 11 is a bench-top instrument which performs single-measurement, quench-corrected analyses for trace uranium. It incorporates patented kinetic phosphorimetry techniques to measure and analyze sample phosphorescence {{as a function of}} time. With laser excitation and time-corrected photon counting, the KPA- 11 has a lower detection limit than conventional fluorometric methods. Operated with a personal computer, the state-of-the-art KPA- 11 offers extensive time resolution and phosphorescence lifetime capabilities for additional specificity. Interferences are thereby avoided while obtaining precise measurements. Routine analyses can be easily and effectively accomplished, with the accuracy and precision equivalent to the pulsed-laser fluorometric method presently performed at NBL, without the need for internal standards. Applications of kinetic phosphorimetry at NBL include the measurement of trace level uranium in <b>retention</b> <b>tank,</b> waste samples, and low-level samples. It has also been used to support other experimental activities at NBL by the measuring of nanogram amounts of uranium contamination (in blanks) in isotopic sample preparations, and the determining of elution curves of different ion exchange resins used for uranium purification. In many cases, no pretreatment of samples was necessary except to fume them with nitric acid, and then to redissolve and dilute them to an appropriate concentration with 1 M HNO{sub 3 } before measurement. Concentrations were determined on a mass basis ({micro}g U/g of solution), but no density corrections were needed since all the samples (including the samples used for calibration) were in the same density matrix (1 M HNO{sub 3 }).

One of the most commonly implemented solutions to control flooding in urban areas is stormwater <b>retention</b> <b>tanks</b> where pluvial water is temporarily stored. Such devices usually serve twofold purpose, that is, ensure pluvial flood protection by storing water during the pick flow and decontaminate stormwater before releasing it into the natural environment during more common events. These two functions imply opposite management strategies; indeed in the decontamination mode, water needs to be stored {{at the beginning of the}} event whereas in the flood protection, the storage volume is kept empty for the peak flow. In order to optimise the use of these devices (i. e., increasing the amount of treated water while avoiding flooding), there is a need to improve fine-scale rainfall estimation, which is the most significant input, and to implement urban hydrological models...|$|R

Indeed, contrary to the nomadic and seminomadic camps already described that practice long-distance movement, occupying rented or acquired mountain pastures, here, the Mamadîs' camp does not seem to move each year. The location seems to be the same, year after year, like the camps of the Erdusî and Peniyaniçî tribes and those using short-distance horizontal mountain summer pastures. The absence of springs on this mountain pasture has 'anchored' the camp around specific water tank constructions.|$|R

The method is based on (1) The statistical analysis of the relationship between rainfall and FC concentrations in urban rivers; (2) The simulation of hydrology and hydraulics; and (3) Scenario analysis. The proposed method was applied to the Beauport River watershed, in Canada, covering an area of 28. 7 km 2. FC loads and concentrations in the river, during and following rainfall events, were computed using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) hydrological/hydraulic simulation model combined with event mean concentrations.

Under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) 20 / 60 /EC and the US Federal Water Pollution Control Act 2002 management of water quality within river drainage basins {{has shifted from}} traditional point-source control to a holistic approach whereby the overall contribution of point and diffuse sources of pollutants has to be considered. Consequently, there is a requirement to undertake source-apportionment studies of pollutant fluxes within catchments. The inclusion of the Bathing Water Directive (BWD), under the list of ?protected areas? in the WFD places a requirement to control sources of faecal indicator organisms within catchments {{in order to achieve}} the objectives of both the BWD (and its revision - 2006 / 7 /EC) and the WFD. This study was therefore initiated to quantify catchment-derived fluxes of faecal indicator compliance parameters originating from both point and diffuse sources. The Ribble drainage basin is the single UK sentinel WFD research catchment and discharges to the south of the Fylde coast, which includes a number of high profile, historically non-compliant, bathing waters. Faecal indicator concentrations (faecal coliform concentrations are reported herein) were measured at 41 riverine locations, the 15 largest wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and 15 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) across the Ribble basin over a 44 -day period during the 2002 bathing season. The sampling programme included targeting rainfall-induced high flow events and sample results were categorised as either base flow or high flow. At the riverine sites, geometric mean faecal coliform concentrations showed statistically significant elevation at high flow compared to base flow. The resultant faecal coliform flux estimates revealed that over 90 % of the total organism load to the Ribble Estuary was discharged by sewage related sources during high flow events. These sewage sources were largely related to the urban areas to the south and east of the Ribble basin, with over half the load associated with the relatively small subcatchment of the River Douglas. The majority of this load was attributed to two WwTWs that discharge through a common outfall close to the tidal limit of this catchment. Budgets adjusted to accommodate the impact of proposed UV disinfection of these effluents showed that the load from these sources would be reduced significantly during base flow conditions. However, during high flow events loads would still remain high due to the operation of storm sewage overflows from stormwater <b>retention</b> <b>tanks.</b> The study identified untreated storm sewage spills from urban infrastructure and WwTW stormwater <b>retention</b> <b>tanks</b> as the dominant component of the high flow flux of faecal indicators to receiving waters of the Fylde coast and the associated bathing waters.

40|$|This Air Pollution Control System (APCS) Conceptual Design and Evaluation {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate a high-performance (APC) system for minimizing air emissions from mixed waste thermal treatment systems. Seven variations of high-performance APCS designs were conceptualized using several design objectives. One of the system designs was selected for detailed process simulation using ASPEN PLUS to determine material and energy balances and evaluate performance. Installed system capital costs were also estimated. Sensitivity studies were conducted to evaluate the incremental cost and benefit of added carbon adsorber beds for mercury control, specific catalytic reduction for NO{sub x} control, and offgas <b>retention</b> <b>tanks</b> for holding the offgas until sample analysis is conducted to verify that the offgas meets emission limits. Results show that the high-performance dry-wet APCS can easily meet all expected emission limits except for possibly mercury. The capability to achieve high levels of mercury control (potentially necessary for thermally treating some DOE mixed streams) could not be validated using current performance data for mercury control technologies. The engineering approach and ASPEN PLUS modeling tool developed and used in this study identified APC equipment and system performance, size, cost, and other issues that are not yet resolved. These issues need to be addressed in feasibility studies and conceptual designs for new facilities or for determining how to modify existing facilities to meet expected emission limits. The ASPEN PLUS process simulation with current and refined input assumptions and calculations can be used to provide system performance information for decision-making, identifying best options, estimating costs, reducing the potential for emission violations, providing information needed for waste flow analysis, incorporating new APCS technologies in existing designs, or performing facility design and permitting activities...|$|R

The air systems operate at various levels of intensity to conserve energy when the building isn’t fully occupied. The lighting system includes both occupancy sensors and a daylight harvesting system that automatically dims or brightens the lights in a room based {{on the amount of}} daylight. The building also has two heat-recovery wheels that draw heat out of the air to help cool the space in the summer and warm it in the winter.•More than 95 percent of construction and demolition waste was recycled. All salvageable furniture removed from vacant spaces either was reused at Brandeis or donated for reuse elsewhere. Recycling containers are provided in every kitchen, lab, office, and common space to support the Brandeis recycling program.•Large amounts of glass on the exterior of the building provide ample daylight. All interior spaces have direct or borrowed daylight (except where research requires darkness). Operable windows in nonlab spaces offer occupants natural ventilation. •Native plantings require no irrigation or maintenance, significantly reducing water consumption. Concrete sidewalks contain a white additive to help reflect sunlight and reduce solar heat gain. Permeable eco-pavers allow water to soak into the ground, and underground <b>retention</b> <b>tanks</b> store rainwater for slow release.•The flooring tile, carpet, and exterior panels are all made with recycled and recyclable material. Furniture is GREENGUARD-certified. Wood used throughout the project is free of formaldehyde. •Research labs are designed for maximum flexibility. Open labs along the north and south faces of the building can expand and contract, while a flexible casework system can be easily adjusted as lab requirements change.|$|R
40|$|The study {{concerns}} the sewage system of Kranj, Šenčur and Naklo communities which gravitates {{to the central}} sewage treatment plant of Kranj, and is managed by the Slovene public company “Komunala Kranj d. o. o. ”. Adapted technical solutions were set forth {{for the improvement of}} stormwater management (drainage, discharge and/or storage) from public roads and public surfaces (ex. parkings) taking into account {{the current state of the}} sewage networks and available facilities. In a first phase, the design and operating conditions of the current sewage networks were assessed based on recorded cadastral data, our own scouring of the terrains and sewer smoke testing. We found that the current management of the stormwater from public roads and public surfaces is generally inadequate because often too polluted water is directly evacuated into the environment. In a second phase, updated various data sources on the size of communities, water consumption from all origins, drainage conditions of stormwater, the slope of the terrains, and road load by vehicles traffic, were collected and were the basis for this study. For the Zlato Polje area of Kranj, we have shown that by inserting new sewage section heading to the local Sava river for the evacuation and purification of critical stormwater through a gravity oil separator, we can reduce both overall burdening of the sewage system and the impact on the environment by the stormwater. Also, we have suggested for the large-sized communities the construction of new faecal wastewater sewage sections conveying directly to the waste treatment plant in order to bypass the current mixed system. Following the German standard ATV-A 128 E, dimensioning of stormwater overflows and stormwater <b>retention</b> <b>tanks</b> were carried out including the design of the required various wastewater management elements. Finally, the regulating equipment necessary for the proper wastewater management of the above mentioned localities, especially for the Kranj area, was recommended...|$|R
