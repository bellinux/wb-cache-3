30|$|In this report, we {{aimed at}} {{identifying}} which correlation of the differentially expressed miRNAs {{is more likely}} to play roles in transgenic maize through miRNA-gene interaction networks compared to non-transgenic near-isogenic control. Unless the GM plant is intended to produce new dsRNA molecules, the RNA itself is rarely formally considered in a risk assessment [14]. This is surprising since many GMO risk assessment guidance draw special attention to the characterization of novel RNAs, frequently mentioning the need to provide information on any expressed substances in the <b>recombinant-DNA</b> <b>plant,</b> such as: “any gene product(s) (e.g. a protein or an untranslated RNA)” (paragraph 32 of [34]); “demonstrate whether the inserted/modified sequence results in intended changes at the protein, RNA and/or metabolite levels” (page 10 of [35]); “detailed description of the expression of the gene product inserted in the host organism” (item 10, Annex II [36]). Although the GM varieties studied here were not tested for their dsRNA content during approval process because of assumptions made either explicitly or implicitly in the context of risk assessments, our detailed analysis of MON 89034, NK 603 and stacked MON 89034 xNK 603 suggests that their miRNA profiles are not equivalent to the near-isogenic non-transgenic control samples.|$|E
