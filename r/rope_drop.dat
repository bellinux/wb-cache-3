50|$|With the {{spiralling}} cost of petrol, both AvGas and MoGas, {{the need}} to economise on fuel usage becomes more important. Glider tugs flying from smaller airfields typically fly two circuits for every launch, due {{to the need for}} <b>rope</b> <b>dropping.</b> To remove the need for <b>rope</b> <b>dropping</b> the FVA students designed and built a retractable tow-rope system that could be retrofitted to glider-tugs. A small winch fitted inside the tug carries the tow-rope when retracted. For launch the rope is pulled out by hand and attached to a Tost hook at the extreme tail of the tug with the rope extending behind the tug to the glider, ensuring that the load from the tow is taken by the tugs structure, not the winch. When the tow is finished the tug-pilot retracts the tow rope, automatically releasing the Tost hook, enabling the tug to land directly without carrying out a rope-dropping circuit. The prototype 'FVA-24 WiMi' system was successfully fitted to the FVA club's Grob G 109 motor-glider tug.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s, tin {{ceilings}} {{began to}} lose their popularity and steel materials became scarce because {{of the effort to}} collect scrap metal during WWII. Many sheet metal companies began making other products in order to stay in business. In the 21st century, some renewed interest has been shown in tin ceilings. The increase in interest has stemmed from businesses that were renovating and an interest to return to the nostalgia of the turn of the century. Still to this today there exists a manufacturing company in the United States that produces original tin ceilings and ornaments from the same <b>rope</b> <b>drop</b> hammers as it once did in 1898. Several other companies offer conventional tin ceilings as well as panels made to fit into a drop-ceiling grid.|$|E
5000|$|Vörg was {{attempting}} the Eiger with Anderl Heckmair. They had {{set off in}} pursuit of the preceding team in a race to the top. When they caught up with the Austrian team of Heinrich Harrer and Fritz Kasparek (Vörg and Heckmair's superior 12-point crampons were more useful on the Eiger; Harrer didn't have any crampons at all) they decided to proceed as a four. When they reached the 'Spider' icefield high on the face, they were hit by a ferocious storm, avalanches pounding down upon them. Andreas Heckmair describes what happened when he slipped from the face. [...] I bore straight down on him in a lightning swift slide. Wiggerl let the <b>rope</b> <b>drop</b> and caught me with his hands, and one of the points of my crampons went through his palm. The force with which I came down on Wiggerl knocked him out of his holds, but he, too, had been able to save himself and there we were, standing about 4 feet below our stance on steep ice without any footholds.Our Friends...hadn't even noticed anything had happened. If we hadn't checked our fall we would have hurled them out from the face with us in a wide arc.|$|E
5000|$|Orchid {{hunting is}} no {{pleasure}} jaunt. I {{remember one time}} when {{it looked as if}} I would have to leave behind several plants of a bulky variety because they and the machetecould not be handled at the same time. The under-growth was not so dense for a foot or two (approximately 30-60 cm) above ground. I got down on hands and knees and crawled for half a mile (roughly 800 m) but I brought home the orchids. [...] Up in Chiriquí, in the northwestern corner of Panama, orchids are found in abundance at an altitude of [...] to [...] Likewise abundant are barrancas, steep gullies like those in the Rockies, maybe hundreds of yards (meters) long and deep. One day about 6 years ago [...] - [...] I was 66 then [...] - [...] I saw a fine plant growing on a half-dead limb that grew out almost horizontally over one of those barrancas. 'I never saw you before,' I thought, and 'I won't let you get away, barranca or no barranca.' My man shinned out a few feet (roughly a meter) on that dying branch and then scurried back, scared at the prospect of a 500-foot (150 m) fall. That made me mad. I threw off my hat, coat, and shoes and went after that orchid. Just as I reached out for it the branch cracked. My heart stopped. But I never let loose my grip on that plant and scurried back to earth like a scared chipmunk. And that - {{that was the first time}} I ever saw the Odontoglossum Powellia. [...] A colony of vicious ants always is found in the roots of the bucket orchid. I am beginning to believe the eggs and waste nourish the orchid. As the branch falls the ground the Indian scrambles down treeand dives in the nearest water. You make a noose in a long <b>rope,</b> <b>drop</b> it over the branch and jerk it into the water. In a half hour or so the ants have drowned or floated away. Then you can pick up your rare find, but not before. George Harry Pring (see below) elaborated on collecting bucket orchids: [...] "Removing a clump of these plants may be compared with disturbing a hornet's nest, but, according to Mr. Powell, who had experienced both adventures, the hornets are easier to combat than the thousands of small stinging ants." [...] Pring then told of a fourth collection technique used by Powell and Hunter; one Pring himself used. [...] "In many instances, to dislodge the epiphyte [...] "air plant", growing non-parasitically, without climbing the tree, it is necessary to cut a sapling with a forked-top as long as the distance up to where it clings. Its roots in some cases are three to four feet long, and great dexterity is required to dislodge it as to not cause injury. During this operation, clouds of dust, granulated bark and moss which rain down from above almost blind the collector." [...] "These men got many fine specimens through this method." ...|$|E

40|$|Large tensile forces, {{known as}} snap loads, can occur when a slack rope becomes taut. Such forces may damage the rope or masses {{connected}} to it. Experiments {{are described in}} which {{one end of a}} rope is attached {{to the top of a}} drop tower and the bottom end is attached to a weight. The weight is raised to a certain height and then released. The force at the top of the rope and the acceleration of the weight are recorded during the first snap load that occurs. Repeated drop tests are performed on each rope. The effects of the type of <b>rope,</b> <b>drop</b> height, drop weight, whether the rope has been subjected to static precycling, and the number of previous dynamic tests are examined. A mathematical model is proposed for the rope force as a function of the displacement and velocity of the weight...|$|E

A gang of men climbed across the ledge and began to cut the slimy mass with spades. The surface heaved beneath them like a treacherous bog and the smell was horrible. Now and then a spade made an opening for the gases to escape and the nauseated men were driven back. For all that, they filled the skip and the swinging derrick carried the load across the deck and tilted it overboard.|$|R

As he rolled off into the black abyss he felt the rope tighten about his ankle and an instant later he was stopped with a sudden jerk to swing pendulumlike, head downward. Then the creature lowered away until Bradley's head came in sudden and painful contact with the floor below, after which the Wieroo let loose of the rope entirely and the Englishman's body crashed to the wooden planking. He felt the free end of the <b>rope</b> <b>dropped</b> upon him and heard the grating being slid into place above him.|$|R

5000|$|The {{mountain}} guides {{only had}} one long rope - 60 metres - with them. Hans Schlunegger just put it between his back and his rucksack (not into his rucksack) to save some time. This was not an unusual practice for them. Unfortunately when he made a sudden movement the <b>rope</b> <b>dropped</b> and fell down {{to the foot of}} the wall. As a result the team combined two shorter ropes to reach the required length; however the combined ropes still fell short. Kurz pulled up their rope, fixed it, and began his abseiling descent. He was stopped a mere couple of metres above his rescuers by the knot. To abseil any further he would have had to raise himself enough to release the pressure on the knot and let it pass through his gear. Desperately, Kurz tried to move himself past the knot, but in vain. Facing the futility of his situation, he said only [...] "Ich kann nicht mehr" [...] ("I can't on anymore") and died. His body was later recovered by a German team.|$|R
