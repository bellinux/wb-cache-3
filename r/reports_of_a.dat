5|$|A {{medium-sized}} warbler, the Nauru {{reed warbler}} has dark brown upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak.

It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means {{that it could be}} vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. <b>Reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.|$|E

The next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign in February 1944, played out differently. Based on Fifth Air Force reports that the islands were unoccupied, MacArthur accelerated his timetable and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force of the islands.
