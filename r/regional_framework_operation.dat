In the Ecosind framework, the general aim of the Cicle Pell project is to identify the economic and environmental improvements which can be achieved by companies in the leather industry and the related supply-chain by applying the industrial ecology principles and tools. In this paper the results of the LCA of bovine leather manufactured in Italy and Spain will be described in order to put in evidence the eco-profile of the two systems and {{to find out if the}} difference in the adopted technologies and cooperative management solutions have led to significant environmental differences...|$|E

The goal of the Cicle Pell project was defining the basis to implement a new strategy of industrial sustainable development in Southern European regions, through the identification of economic and environmental improvements achievable by companies in the leather industry and the related supply-chain by applying the industrial ecology principles and tools. The research we report here addresses three critical issues. First, we identify inter-organizational relationships among firms and other institutions inside the sector, giving a description of various forms of cooperative environmental agreements among firms in the slaughtering and leather tanning districts. Second, we investigate - with the support of social network analysis - the peculiar characteristics of the network structure inside the industry. And third, we investigate in a comparative manner the level of association between inter-organizational network structures and environmental performance at the organizational level...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{development}} has been analysed by studying the cropping pattern and cropping diversification and crop specialization in any agro-ecosystem in <b>regional</b> and temporal <b>framework.</b> Tribal regions are experiencing agricultural intensification through diversification of cropping systems and crop specialization {{as a result of}} ecological economic changes as well as impact of public policy of technology transfer and resource use intensification. The market forces also are influencing the crop intensification as a result of exogenous market demand. In this paper, an attempt is made to analyze the pattern of cropping system in inter <b>regional</b> <b>framework</b> and identify how these patterns have changed {{over a period of time}} in Jhabua tribal district of Madhya Pradesh. Such an analysis will help in taking policy decisions for diversification and specialization of crop production in the changing cropping systems in <b>regional</b> <b>framework</b> with the objectives of achieving higher level of regional food production, maximisation of production and income to the farmers through promotion of cash crops etc. The analysis of the pattern diversity in <b>regional</b> <b>framework</b> would indicate to the eco-regional and exogenous impacts of market and public policies following the law of entropy. ...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{hybrid systems}} with {{regional}} dynamics are considered. These are systems where transitions between different dynamical regimes occur as the continuous {{state of the}} system reaches given switching surfaces. In particular, the {{attention is focused on}} the optimal control problem associated with such systems. More precisely, given a specific cost function, the goal is to determine the optimal path of going from a given starting point to a fixed final state during an a priori specified time horizon. The key characteristic of the approach presented in this thesis is a hierarchical decomposition of the hybrid optimal control problem, yielding to a framework which allows a solution on different levels of control. On the highest level of abstraction, the regional structure of the state space is taken into account and a discrete representation of the connections between the different regions provides global accessibility relations between regions. These are used on a lower level of control to formulate the main theorem of this work, namely, the Hybrid Bellman Equation for multimodal systems, which, in fact, provides a characterization of global optimality, given an upper bound on the number of transitions along a hybrid trajectory. Not surprisingly, the optimal solution is hybrid in nature, in that it depends on not only the continuous control signals, but also on discrete decisions as to what domains the system's continuous state should go through in the first place. The main benefit with the proposed approach {{lies in the fact that}} a hierarchical Dynamic Programming algorithm can be used to representing both a theoretical characterization of the hybrid solution's structural composition and, from a more application-driven point of view, a numerically implementable calculation rule yielding to globally optimal solutions in a <b>regional</b> dynamics <b>framework.</b> The <b>operation</b> of the recursive algorithm is highlighted by the consideration of numerous examples, among them, a heterogeneous multi-agent problem.

40|$|Abstract. A three tier <b>regional</b> {{economic}} indicator <b>framework</b> {{has been created}} to address the tran-sition necessary for economic regions moving from a manufacturing-based to a knowledge-based economy. The proposed framework responds to a basic weakness of a knowledge defi-cient region. The framework {{is consistent with a}} set of five regional strategies adopted by the leadership of the regional economic initiative. The goal is that the unique set of outcomes of-fered will become a critical part of the distinctive strategies for economic development, as well as a tool to facilitate communication with the legislature and the general public. Early findings based on current use of the framework are reported. The findings illustrate the simplicity and robustness of the framework. The framework is divided into three complementary frames of measures and indicators: the <b>regional</b> <b>framework,</b> the sub-regional framework, and the clusters framework. The framework of indicators uses the system approach of inputs (assets, enablers), processes, and outcomes. The <b>regional</b> <b>framework</b> includes the following aspects: cultural enab-lers, physical and administrative infrastructure, quality of life, education, renovation, human, process, market, and financial capital. The framework also includes the need to assess the cul-tural readiness of the region to adopt the new economy‟s realities. For the indicators to be si...|$|R

Accordingly, if income disparities are larger within administrative regions rather than across regions, it might make more sense if regional economic development policy were con-ducted within a functional-area framework rather the current administrative-region framework.
