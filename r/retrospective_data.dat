50|$|Drug {{resistance}} {{is the main}} drive in continuing {{research and development of}} Bcr-Abl TKI. Shortly after the introduction of imatinib, investigators began to describe a number of in vitro derived cell lines with resistance to the drug. This was rapidly followed by the clinical description of imatinib resistant cells in patients, which has resulted in efforts to better understand the biology behind these observations. Assessments of therapeutic response of imatinib in patients with CML are based upon meeting hematologic, cytogenic and molecular milestones. Patients that fail to achieve defined responses at predefined chronological time points are described as primarily resistant to therapy, and those losing previously obtained milestones in disease regression are termed secondarily resistant. Before a conclusion is drawn, {{it is important to consider}} that <b>retrospective</b> <b>data</b> has showed a high incidence of imatinib non-compliance in CML patients and this could lead to undesired clinical outcomes.In general, imatinib resistance can be subdivided into Bcr-Abl dependent and independent mechanisms. Bcr-Abl dependent mechanisms include over expression or amplification of the Bcr-Abl gene and point mutations within the Bcr-Abl kinase domain that interfere with imatinib binding. Bcr-Abl independent mechanisms include factors influencing the concentration of imatinib within the cell, for example by alterations in drug influx and efflux and activation of Bcr-Abl independent pathways, such as members of the Src kinase family. Imatinib resistance can also be produced by other mechanisms that will not be mentioned here as the importance of those mechanisms still remain a question due to lack of clinical data.|$|E
