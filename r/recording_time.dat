5|$|The band {{searched for}} a new concert venue because the Arlequines was {{becoming}} too small for their growing audience. They moved to Cemento, {{where most of the}} 1991 concerts took place. They played with the bands Todos tus muertos, Pobres pibes, Nepal, Militia, Devastación, Rapier, and Resistencia Nativa. Their albums Hermética and Intérpreteswhich had been released as LP records and cassettes, were released by Tripoli on a single compact disc. Tony Scotto left the band because of creative differences and was replaced by Claudio Strunz. Strunz, drummer of the band Heinkel and owner of Hermética's rehearsal room, had already played with the band during practice sessions when Scotto was absent. He made his debut at Sunchales. The band appeared in two television programs, La movida del '90 and Siglo XX Cambalache and recorded their second full-length album, Ácido Argentino, with 150 hours of <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> at the Aguilar studios. It was released at Cemento on December 27.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of all 239 people on board, Flight 370 is the second deadliest {{incident}} involving a Boeing 777 and the second deadliest incident in Malaysia Airlines' history, behind Flight 17 in both categories. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem that was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after the disappearance of Flight 370 and the downing of Flight 17; the airline was re-nationalised {{by the end of}} 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing to disclose information promptly during the early weeks of the search. Flight 370's disappearance brought to public attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight recorders, including several issues raised four years earlier—but never mandated—following {{the loss of}} Air France Flight 447. In response to Flight 370's disappearance, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted new standards for aircraft position reporting over open ocean, extended <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> for cockpit voice recorders, and, from 2020, will require new aircraft designs to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water.|$|E

Emmanuel Lubezki, who won the Academy Award for his cinematography in Birdman, believed that the <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> necessary for the unique long take approach taken in Birdman {{could not have been}} made with older technology. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, New Regency Pictures and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|With a {{collection}} of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch, Dylan booked <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> with Daniel Lanois at Miami's Criteria Studios in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension. Before the album's release Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, pericarditis, brought on by histoplasmosis. His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, [...] "I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon." [...] He {{was back on the}} road by mid-year, and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna, Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan's lyric [...] "Blowin' in the Wind".|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{sessions}} commenced, Bono {{pushed for the}} band to work towards a full-length album. The Edge was initially hesitant, but saw the opportunity {{as a challenge to}} quickly record an album before returning to tour and prove the band had not become spoiled by the luxury of ample <b>recording</b> <b>time.</b> Additionally, Bono and band manager Paul McGuinness had discussed the possibility of releasing a [...] "one-two punch" [...] of records {{since the beginning of the}} Achtung Baby sessions. In early March, U2 reached a consensus to work towards a full-length album. Much like they had for the Achtung Baby sessions, the band split work between two studios at once; Adams operated a Soundtracs mixing console at The Factory, while Flood used an SSL console at the newly relocated Windmill Lane Studios.|$|E

500|$|Supergrass {{formed in}} 1993 after the {{break-up}} of The Jennifers {{and consists of}} Gaz Coombes (lead vocals), Danny Goffey (drums), Mick Quinn (bass), and Rob Coombes (keyboards). Gaz Coombes, Goffey, and Quinn had been playing gigs around Oxford when they were spotted by producer Sam Williams, who {{said he wanted to}} work with them. Between the months of May and August, the band recorded a six track demo at Sawmills Studio and, having signed a deal with Backbeat Records, a limited number of copies of [...] "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] and [...] "Mansize Rooster" [...] were released. The demo had also quickly reached EMI, however, and that led to the group being signed by the Parlophone label, which would re-release the two songs. Quinn said [...] "it took about three and a half months total <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> and cost less to make than the video for Alright." ...|$|E
500|$|Hermética {{performed}} {{their only}} concert outside of Argentina {{in the early}} 1990s at the [...] "Club Platense" [...] in Montevideo, Uruguay. They played with Retrosatán and Alvacast,two bands from Uruguay. Hermética had {{to spend the night}} in the street because of the faulty Uruguayan production. Once they returned to Argentina, they performed at several locations in Buenos Aires and in Mar del Plata with Divididos, Los Violadores, Arácnido and Rata Blanca. They were offered a chance to record an EP with only 27 hours of <b>recording</b> <b>time.</b> They accepted the proposal, and recorded improvised cover versions of songs by V8, Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, Enrique Santos Discépolo, Motörhead, and Manal. Iorio, a fan of a band called Budgie, made deliberate similarities to Metallica's cover EP, which included a cover version of a song by that band. Hermética performed at the [...] "Metal en acción" [...] festival at the José Amalfitani stadium, sharing the bill with 2112, Lethal, Horcas, Kamikaze, Alakran, and Riff.|$|E
500|$|In June 2004, Bloc Party convened at Deltalab Studios in Copenhagen to make Silent Alarm with Paul Epworth. The {{band had}} already written demo songs to record, but Okereke {{has noted that}} [...] "it is a {{creative}} process {{and you have to}} let yourself be inspired while you're in the studio as well". The Deltalab set-up posed problems, because it included bare mains cables and dated, malfunctioning equipment from the 1960s and 1970s. Bloc Party took three sessions to get acquainted with Epworth's methodology. The producer has called the <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> a [...] "growing process" [...] because Okereke was not wholly comfortable singing in front of people, especially after tonsil problems. Although the band members had preliminary ideas about a track's rhythm, they did not know how songs were going to start or end. Okereke often asked Tong to play something on the drums, which inspired him to mould a track by adding guitar chords to the beat.|$|E

500|$|The album Christ Illusion was {{originally}} {{scheduled for release}} on June 6, 2006, and {{would be the first}} album with original drummer Lombardo since 1990's Seasons in the Abyss. However, the band decided to delay the release of the record as {{they did not want to}} be among the many, according to King, [...] "half-ass, stupid fucking loser bands" [...] releasing records on June 6, although USA Today reported the idea was thwarted because the band failed to secure sufficient studio <b>recording</b> <b>time.</b> Slayer released Eternal Pyre on June 6 as a limited-edition EP. Eternal Pyre featured the song [...] "Cult," [...] a live performance of [...] "War Ensemble" [...] in Germany and video footage of the band recording [...] "Cult." [...] Five thousand copies were released and sold exclusively through Hot Topic chain stores, and sold out within hours of release. On June 30, Nuclear Blast Records released a 7" [...] vinyl picture disc version limited to a thousand copies.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, {{and the band}} stayed at the Sunset Marquis Hotel during the sessions. [...] Nimrod took four months to record; Armstrong partially attributed the lengthy <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> to spending [...] "a little too much time" [...] playing pool and foosball during the sessions. [...] The recording schedule, which lasted from noon to {{two in the morning}} every day, became frustrating for the group members, who began drinking heavily. [...] Bassist Mike Dirnt recalled, [...] "One night one of us was walking down the halls knocking on people's doors while naked." [...] Another incident involved drummer Tre Cool throwing his hotel room television set out of his window. [...] Armstrong noted, [...] "There was a lot of glass. [...] You have to live that arrogant lifestyle every now and then." [...] To keep the band focused, Cavallo enlisted his father and manager Pat Magnarella to supervise the group.|$|E
500|$|Cole Waterman of PopMatters {{awarded the}} album {{a score of}} eight out of ten, finding the record to be the group's [...] "most {{accessible}} by far". Waterman described the album's composition as [...] "catchy", finding {{it to be an}} appropriate response to the band's previous album Anonymous; he also highlighted the [...] "absurdist" [...] tone of the record's lyrics—pointing out [...] "South Paw" [...] and [...] "Waratorium" [...] as particular examples of this. Pitchfork Media's Paul Thompson scored Oddfellows 6.8 out of ten, considering it [...] "Tomahawk's most straightforward, stripped-down release to date". Thompson considered the group's main dynamic to consist of Denison's compositions and Patton's vocals, finding that bass player Dunn [...] "hangs back here, ably holding down the low end without overasserting himself". Thompson also debated the effect that the album's short germination period had on its overall composition, believing that the brief <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> lent the record [...] "a feeling that, whenever you get these guys in the same room, this music [...] just comes tearing out".|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} of Stankonia began in spring of 1999 and lasted {{for about a}} year. Owning a studio helped the band expand creatively, as the duo {{did not need to}} worry about time constraints that would occur with a rented studio. André 3000 observed, [...] "You can sit there and fuck with just a kick and a snare all day long if you want to... You're not working on the clock. [...] Really, you're just working on your mind." [...] Big Boi spent the majority of the <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> in the studio, while André 3000 worked at home, creating beats and experimenting with an acoustic guitar. [...] One song that came from a jam session on the guitar was [...] "Ms. Jackson", the album's second single. [...] André 3000 also created song lyrics by writing words on the walls of his home: [...] "I had planned to paint my house anyway; writing on the walls was just something I would do." [...] One stray lyric on his wall eventually developed into [...] "Gasoline Dreams".|$|E
500|$|In February 1989, My Bloody Valentine began {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album at Blackwing Studios in Southwark, London. Creation Records {{believed that the}} album could be recorded [...] "in five days". However, it soon [...] "became clear that wasn't going to happen". Following several unproductive months, during which Shields assumed main duties on the musical and technical aspects of the sessions, the band relocated {{to a total of}} nineteen other studios and hired a number of engineers, including Alan Moulder, Anjali Dutt and Guy Fixsen. Due to the extensive <b>recording</b> <b>time,</b> Shields and Alan McGee agreed to release another EP and subsequently the band released Glider in April 1990. Containing the lead single [...] "Soon", which featured the first recorded use of Shields' [...] "glide guitar" [...] technique, the EP peaked at number 2 on the UK Indie Chart and the band toured in summer 1990 to support its release. In February 1991, while still recording their second album, My Bloody Valentine released Tremolo, which was another critical success and topped the UK Indie Chart.|$|E
