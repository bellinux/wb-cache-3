[...] "Just {{imagine him}} with a smooth coat of grayish-brown instead of a white woolly one, and immense curling horns many times larger than those he now has. Give him a large whitish or very light-yellowish patch around a very short tail.

60|$|Lawson rode in near sundown {{with the}} {{carcasses}} of two beasts of some species hanging over his saddle. It {{turned out that}} Jones had planned a surprise for Wallace and me, and it {{could hardly have been}} a more enjoyable one, considering the time and place. We knew he had a flock of Persian sheep on the south slope of Buckskin, but had no idea it was within striking distance of Oak. Lawson had that day hunted up the shepherd and his sheep, to return to us with two sixty-pound Persian lambs. We feasted at suppertime on meat which was sweet, juicy, very tender and of as rare a flavor as that of the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>sheep.</b>|$|E

His proper name is Stone's Mountain Sheep. In the mountains between these two is another cousin with a white head and dark body called Fannin's sheep.

60|$|On {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the third passage he found that his conjecture was right, for the doorway or opening on his left hand conducted into a spacious cave, also hollowed out of the earth, but apparently against a perpendicular cliff, for the inner end of it was of unhewn rock. The roof of the cave was supported by pillars which were merely sections of pine-trees with the bark left on. These pillars and the earthen walls were adorned with antlers, skulls, and horns of the <b>Rocky</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>sheep,</b> necklaces of grizzly-bear's claws, Indian bows and arrows, rifles, short swords, and various other weapons and trophies of the chase, besides sundry articles of clothing. At the inner end of the cave a large fireplace and chimney had been rudely built, and in this was roaring the pine-wood fire which had lighted them in, and which caused the whole interior to glow with a vivid glare that seemed to surpass that of noon-day.|$|E
60|$|Next {{morning at}} six-thirty {{the sun was}} shining clear, and only a few clouds sailed in the blue. Wind was in the west and the weather promised fair. But clouds began to creep up behind the mountains, first hazy, then white, then dark. Nevertheless we decided to ride out, and cross the Flattop rim, and go around what they call the Chinese Wall. It rained as we climbed through the spruces above Little Trappers Lake. And as we got near the top it began to hail. Again the air grew cold. Once out on top I found a wide expanse, green and white, level in places, but with huge upheavals of ridge. There were flowers here at eleven {{thousand}} feet. The view to the rear was impressive--a wide up-and-down plain studded with out-cropping of rocks, and patches of snow. We were then on top of the Chinese Wall, and the view to the west was grand. At the moment hail was falling thick and white, and to stand above the streaked curtain, as it fell into the abyss was a strange new experience. Below, two thousand feet, lay the spruce forest, and it sloped and dropped into the White River Valley, which in turn rose, a long ragged dark-green slope, up to a bare jagged peak. Beyond this stretched range on range, dark under the lowering pall of clouds. On top we found fresh <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>sheep</b> tracks. A little later, going into a draw, we crossed a snow-bank, solid as ice. We worked down into this draw into the timber. It hailed, and rained some more, then cleared. The warm sun felt good. Once down in the parks we began to ride through a flower-garden. Every slope was beautiful in gold, and red, and blue and white. These parks were luxuriant with grass, and everywhere we found elk beds, where the great stags had been lying, to flee at our approach. But we did not see one. The bigness of this slope impressed me. We rode miles and miles, and every park was surrounded by heavy timber. At length we got into a burned district where the tall dead spruces stood sear and ghastly, and the ground was so thickly strewn with fallen trees that we had difficulty in threading a way through them. Patches of aspen grew on the hillside, still fresh and green despite this frosty morning. Here we found a sego lily, {{one of the most beautiful}} of flowers. Here also I saw pink Indian paint brush. At the foot of this long burned slope we came to the White River trail, and followed it up and around to camp.|$|E

5000|$|Filming {{took place}} in late 1955, from August 9 to December 20. The crew worked fast (75 actual days of filming), {{producing}} 680000 ft of film, which was edited down to 25734 ft of finished film. The picture cost just under $6 million to make, employing 112 locations in 13 countries and 140 sets. Todd said he and the crew visited every country portrayed in the picture, including England, France, India, Spain, Thailand and Japan. According to the Time magazine review of the film, the cast including extras totalled 68,894 people; it also featured 7,959 animals, [...] "including four ostriches, six skunks, 15 elephants, 17 fighting bulls, 512 rhesus monkeys, 800 horses, 950 burros, 2,448 American buffalo, 3,800 <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>sheep</b> and a sacred cow that eats flowers on cue." [...] There is also a cat, at the Reform Club. The wardrobe department spent $410,000 to provide 74,685 costumes and 36,092 trinkets.Some 10,000 extras were used in filming the bullfight scene in Spain, with Cantinflas as the matador; Cantinflas had previously done some bullfighting. They used all 6,500 residents of a small Spanish town called Chinchón, 45 km from Madrid, but Todd decided there weren't enough spectators. So he found 3,500 more from nearby towns. He used 650 Indians for a fight on a train in the West. Many were indeed Indians, but some were Hollywood extras. All 650 had their skin color altered with dye. Todd used about [...] of orange-coloured dye for those extras.|$|E
5000|$|This new Burlington station {{opened on}} July 4, 1898, {{in time for}} the Trans-Mississippi International Exposition, a {{glittering}} inter-national showcase that attracted visitors to Omaha from around the world. The main lobby featured a grand circular staircase that led passengers downstairs to track level and the trains. A large canopy, a first for an Omaha train station, covered two tracks and kept passengers from the elements. The spacious lobby included new amenities, such as separate men's and women's waiting rooms, a gentleman's smoking room, and a sit-down lunch counter. The interior featured Sienna marble columns, and mosaic floors with the staircase accented with bronze castings of <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>Sheep</b> heads. The total cost of the station was $408,000.00, a very impressive amount for the day. The building attracted considerable attention for its pristine beauty. The accolades were universal. A German commission judged the Burlington Station to be America's finest railroad station, and in 1908, the Chicago Record wrote, 'The handsomest railway station ever seen is the Burlington Station at Omaha. It is an artistic gem and looks like a Grecian Temple.' Although great attention was lavished on the classic proportions and styling of the station, functional considerations were also important to the design. Since the two-story depot was built next to the 10th Street viaduct, the main entrance to the station was from the viaduct to the second floor. This portico featured twenty-eight massive Colorado granite columns. The walls of the depot were built of light gray brick and buff Indiana limestone; the roof was covered in red glazed tile. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, in discussing the Omaha station in 1889 said, 'Through an inspiration worthy of general imitation, it (The Burlington Railroad) has erected at Omaha a most imposing, most original, and most architectural of passenger stations.' ...|$|E

40|$|Strong {{evidence}} exists indicating domestic sheep (Ovis aries) can infect <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> bighorn <b>sheep</b> (Ovis canadensis canadensis), a United States Forest Service (USFS) Region 4 sensitive species, with pneumonia (Callan 1991; Foreyt 1989, 1992, 1994; Foreyt and Lagerquist 1996; George et al 2008; Wehausen et al. 2011). Since {{the transmission of}} the pneumonic bacteria between the domestic and wild sheep {{is a result of}} bighorn sheep coming into contact with the bacteria carried in the mucous membranes of the domestic sheep, bighorn sheep at risk of initially contracting the bacteria are those individuals that enter areas currently being grazed or that have been recently grazed by domestic sheep (Foreyt 1990; Jessup 1985; Martin et al. 1996; Monello et al. 2001; Rudolph et al. 2003). The issue is further compounded when infected bighorn sheep return to their herd and have the potential to spread the bacteria to other members, which can result in substantial mortality (Shackleton et al. 1999). Throughout the western United States (U. S.), the USFS and various state wildlife agencies are struggling to protect and maintain the viability of <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> bighorn <b>sheep</b> populations that coexist with domestic sheep being grazed on National Forest lands. This study reviews the biological, social, economic, and legal factors regarding <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> bighorn <b>sheep</b> population protection and viability in the presence of domestic sheep, with special attention given to the Evanston/Mt. View Ranger District (EMVRD) on the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest (UWCNF). Additionally, possible solutions to the problem associated with the comingling of bighorn sheep and domestic sheep and the spread of pneumonia to bighorn sheep were investigated on the EMVRD. This included looking at ways to eliminate interactions between the domestic and wild sheep by identifying movement patterns of six satellite collared bighorn sheep of the Hoop Lake herd on the EMVRD...|$|R
50|$|Cimarron {{was first}} applied {{to either the}} river or {{mountains}} in northeastern New Mexico and applied to {{other places in the}} state. The most common belief is that it was named for the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> bighorn <b>sheep,</b> called carnero cimarrnó in New Mexican Spanish. In addition, cimarrónes was the name for cattle and wild horses. Another of several theories is that is named for the plant rosa cimarróna, a wild rose plant that grows along the river.|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} and validated an enzyme immunoassay for immunoreactive pregnanediol- 3 -glucuronide (iPdG) in feces to monitor reproductive status in desert and <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> bighorn <b>sheep</b> (Ovis canadensis). Fecal iPdG concentrations were strongly correlated (r = 0. 71) with serum progesterone concentrations in paired fecal and blood samples collected from 34 free-ranging desert bighorn sheep. In bimonthly fecal samples collected from 12 captive ewes, fecal iPdG profiles were similar between desert and <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> bighorn <b>sheep</b> and we selected a pregnancy detection cutoff value of iPdG > or = 1. 8 ng/mg feces. Fecal iPdG concentrations always exceeded this cutoff value when {{samples were collected}} from about day 60 of pregnancy to {{a few days before}} parturition, but values < 1. 8 ng/mg (false negatives) were common for samples collected during the first 60 days of gestation. Although we tested a small number of known pregnant and non-pregnant ewes, the accuracy of the assay was 100 % when two samples, collected 2 wk apart, were evaluated for any given ewe. Based on these data, this direct enzyme immunoassay for fecal progesterone metabolites has promise as a diagnostic tool to monitor hormone excretion and pregnancy in a free-ranging ungulate species...|$|R
