5|$|In {{the area}} of {{warships}} also, {{some of the most}} recent ironclads such as the Kōtetsu coexisted with older types of steamboats and even traditional sailboats. The Shogunate initially had a <b>rather</b> <b>strong</b> edge in warships, and it had the vision to order the state-of-the-art French-made Kotetsu, although the ship was blocked from delivery by foreign powers on ground of neutrality once the conflict had started, and was ultimately remitted to the Imperial faction shortly after the Battle of Toba–Fushimi.|$|E
25|$|Personal pronouns {{are seldom}} {{borrowed}} between languages. Therefore the many correspondences between Nostratic pronouns are <b>rather</b> <b>strong</b> {{evidence for the}} existence of a Proto-Nostratic language. The difficulty of finding Afroasiatic cognates is, however, taken by some as evidence that Nostratic has two or three branches, Afroasiatic and Eurasiatic (and possibly Dravidian), and that most or all of the pronouns in the following table can only be traced to Proto-Eurasiatic.|$|E

25|$|Europe has <b>rather</b> <b>strong</b> privacy laws, {{and efforts}} are {{underway}} to further strengthen {{the rights of}} the consumers. However, the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Principles currently effectively expose European users to privacy exploitation by U.S. companies. As a consequence of Edward Snowden's global surveillance disclosure, there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement, as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the National Security Agency, and attempts to reach an agreement have failed.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other dialects, Basel German {{features}} a <b>rather</b> <b>strong</b> dichotomy between the traditional form - Baseldytsch, used {{especially for the}} Carnival of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) - and normal spoken language. Some speakers prefer to use the more traditional variety in written form. The traditional variety is normally associated with the upper classes and with Fasnacht. Like other Swiss German dialects, Basel German has (at least in Basel) more prestige than Standard German, {{and it is now}} even used in churches.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Medical Equipments in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) is {{responsible}} for supervising imports in this segment, but the import and distribution of such equipment is mostly handled by the private sector. Iran has undergone the primary stages of development in terms of industrialisation and a <b>rather</b> <b>strong</b> indigenous manufacturing capability exists in the country. Therefore, one can expect to find a handful of local producers for basic medical equipment, making {{it very hard to}} penetrate into the Iranian market for similar imported ones.|$|E

One might reasonably {{suppose that the}} results would parallel the delta case. However, {{it turns out that}} this is not quite the case. Instead, as we shall see momentarily, there is a <b>rather</b> <b>stronger</b> connection between monotonicity and the sign of ∇_a^νf(t).|$|R
25|$|The {{shock of}} firing can exert {{a great deal}} of stress on the crane, as in most designs the {{cylinder}} is only held closed at one point, the rear of the cylinder. Stronger designs, such as the Ruger Super Redhawk, use a lock in the crane as well as the lock {{at the rear of the}} cylinder. This latch provides a more secure bond between cylinder and frame, and allows the use of larger, more powerful cartridges. Swing out cylinders are <b>rather</b> <b>strong,</b> but not as strong as fixed cylinders, and great care must be taken with the cylinder when loading, so as not to damage the crane.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth Carpenter and Matt Smith {{published}} {{a detailed description}} of the osteology and biomechanics of T. rex forelimbs. They concluded that T. rex arms were actually <b>rather</b> <b>strong,</b> but with a much smaller range of motion than other carnivorous dinosaurs like Allosaurus and Deinonychus. They concluded that while the arms of Tyrannosaurus would have been useless for actually killing prey, they may have been used to hold on to prey while the tyrannosaur killed it with bites. They dismissed notions that the forelimbs were useless or that Tyrannosaurus rex was an obligate scavenger. This study was the complete description of Tyrannosaurus forelimbs in the scientific literature.|$|E
25|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Uranus is calm {{compared to those}} of other giant planets. Only a limited number of small bright clouds at middle latitudes in both hemispheres and one Uranus Dark Spot have been observed since 1986. One of those bright cloud features, located at −34° of latitude and called Berg, probably existed continuously since at least 1986. Nevertheless, the Uranian atmosphere has <b>rather</b> <b>strong</b> zonal winds blowing in the retrograde (counter to the rotation) direction near the equator, but switching to the prograde direction poleward of ±20° latitude. The wind speeds are from −50 to −100m/s at the equator increasing up to 240m/s near 50° latitude. The wind profile measured before the equinox of 2007 was slightly asymmetric with winds stronger in the southern hemisphere, although {{it turned out to be}} a seasonal effect as this hemisphere was continuously illuminated by the Sun before 2007. After 2007 winds in the northern hemisphere accelerated while those in the southern one slowed down.|$|E

25|$|Saturn is {{the source}} of <b>rather</b> <b>strong</b> low {{frequency}} radio emissions called Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR). The frequency of SKR lies in the range 10–1300kHz (wavelength of a few kilometers) with the maximum around 400kHz. The power of these emissions is strongly modulated by the rotation of the planet and is correlated with changes in the solar wind pressure. For instance, when Saturn was immersed into the giant magnetotail of Jupiter during Voyager 2 flyby in 1981, the SKR power decreased greatly or even ceased completely. The kilometeric radiation is thought to be generated by the Cyclotron Maser Instability of the electrons moving along magnetic field lines related to the auroral regions of Saturn. Thus the SKR is related to the auroras around the poles of the planet. The radiation itself comprises spectrally diffuse emissions as well as narrowband tones with bandwidths as narrow as 200Hz. In the frequency–time plane arc like features are often observed, much like {{in the case of the}} Jovian kilometric radiation. The total power of the SKR is around 1GW.|$|E
500|$|... "Untitled Griffin Family History" [...] {{finished}} 49th in {{the weekly}} ratings for the week of May 8–14, 2006, with a Nielsen rating of 8.03. The episode received generally negative reviews from critics. In his review of the episode, Bob Sassone of TV Squad commented [...] "All in all, a so-so episode. It started <b>rather</b> <b>strong</b> but got weaker as it went along". In his review of the Family Guy: Volume Four DVD, Michael Drucker of IGN stated [...] "Untitled Griffin Family History" [...] to be [...] "as cliché as the tropes they're mocking". Despite this, John Viener, the writer of the episode was nominated for an Annie Award for Writing in an Animated Television Production.|$|E

Rocky Mountain News writer Dusty Saunders called the series [...] "superb" [...] and described Night of the Dead Living as [...] "fascinating character studies {{of police officers}} in the squad room". In a 2007 article, Star Tribune writer Neal Justin included [...] "Night of the Dead Living" [...] in a list of 10 excellent network television episodes dating back 40 years. Justin said the episode proved it was not acting that made for good television, but <b>rather</b> <b>strong</b> writing and acting. Not all reviews were positive. John J. O'Connor of The New York Times praised the series in general, but said the various overlapping subplots in [...] "Night of the Dead Living" [...] like the Santa Claus suspect, the pre-teen murder suspect and the cleaning woman's missing baby [...] felt like gratuitous [...] "oddball routines". O'Connor added, [...] "Too much cleverness can be grating." ...|$|E

They are flexuous, marking the lines of growth, <b>rather</b> <b>stronger,</b> more regular and more distant than the spirals, which run {{over the top of}} them and form little white nodes at the crossings. The intersections of these two systems cut the whole surface into rhombic reticulations, whose breadth is about 0.28 mm and their height 0.15 mm. The {{longitudinal}} threads themselves are about 0.13 mm and the spirals about 0.077 mmbroad. On the base, the longitudinals are flattened and spread out into undulations.|$|R

But neither Trevor nor Clowes was inclined to draw any augury from this. Seymour's had taken things easily after half-time; Donaldson's had kept going hard all through.|$|R
500|$|The First World War took {{a toll on}} George's health: he {{was seriously}} injured on 28 October 1915 when thrown by his horse at a troop review in France, and his heavy smoking {{exacerbated}} recurring breathing problems. He suffered from {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} and pleurisy. In 1925, on the instruction of his doctors, he was reluctantly sent on a recuperative private cruise in the Mediterranean; it was his third trip abroad since the war, and his last. In November 1928, he fell seriously ill with septicaemia, and {{for the next two years}} his son Edward took over many of his duties. In 1929, the suggestion of a further rest abroad was rejected by the King [...] "in <b>rather</b> <b>strong</b> language". Instead, he retired for three months to Craigweil House, Aldwick, in the seaside resort of Bognor, Sussex. As a result of his stay, the town acquired the suffix [...] "Regis", which is Latin for [...] "of the King". A myth later grew that his last words, upon being told that he would soon be well enough to revisit the town, were [...] "Bugger Bognor!" ...|$|E
