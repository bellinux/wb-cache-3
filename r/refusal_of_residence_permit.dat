Included are official documents and correspondence pertaining to the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> entry and <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> for Max Karl Liebmann; his illegal entry into Switzerland; his internment during the war; his marriage to Hanne Hirsch; their transfer to various refugee homes; birth of their daughter Jeanne Evelyne; the family's status in Switzerland; and their immigration to the United States. Max Karl Liebmann and Hanne (Johanna Eva) Hirsch met in the French internment camp in Gurs. They later escaped independently to Switzerland. They were married on April 14, 1945, in Geneva. Their daughter Jeanne Evelyne Liebmann was born on March 4, 1946, in Switzerland. Two years later, the family immigrated to the United States. Processed for digitizatio...|$|R
40|$|Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are all {{examples}} of European {{countries that have}} implemented civic integration programs. The diffusion of civic integration courses, requirements and tests for newcomers reveals a convergent trend in immigration integration policies. This kind of policy requires that newcomers meet integration requirements in order to enter, reside, reunite with their families, enjoy social benefits and naturalize in the host country (Kostakopoulou 2010). Migrants are expected to attend language and citizenship courses and/or to take integration tests after entering in the host country (since 2006 the Netherlands, pioneers in the field, have implemented tests to be taken before and in the home country of the migrants). The immigrant’s failure or non-completion of the program tends to be sanctioned by <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> a <b>residence</b> <b>permit,</b> financial penalties, a loss of social benefits, etc. The content and structure of these programs vary widely in terms of scope, goals, target groups and institutional actors involved. This diversity mainly derives from the different historical backgrounds, societal models, as well as patterns and traditions of migration flows. However, beyond the factual analysis {{of the content of}} civic integration programs, my purpose is to analyze some crucial questions raised by such policies through the lens of political theory. It is a good opportunity to question the conceptual frame underpinning the contemporary civic integration discourses. This paper is divided into three parts. In the first section, I discuss the very notion of integration and its implications. Next, the second section is devoted to an analysis of the consequences of the binding character of such programs, and the ways to monitor the success of a migrant after completing a civic integration program. Finally, in the third section I question the real target of such policies: are they aimed at inclusion or exclusion? In conclusion, this paper aims at analyzing the implications of the deep changes experienced by European integration policies. Beyond the understanding of these issues, a broader reflection on the concepts of citizenship, immigration, integration and boundaries is proposed...|$|R

In response to this crisis, the European Court of Justice’s decision in H. T. v.

Specifically, the European Court of Justice ruled that legislation governing the distribution <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> to refugees impliedly allowed for the revocation <b>of</b> a <b>residence</b> <b>permit</b> from a refugee accused of terrorist activities. This decision weakens international custom prohibiting the expulsion of refugees to places where they may be in danger.

In 2011, the Italian Government released the North Africa Emergency Provisions (ENA) temporarily relaxing immigration policies for refugees who fled to Italy {{as a consequence of the}} Arab Spring and the Libyan civil war. To take advantage of this experimental opportunity, we run difference-in-differences regressions on an original dataset to estimate the effects of the ENA provisions on the probability <b>of</b> obtaining a <b>residence</b> <b>permit.</b> The dataset includes micro-data self-collected from an important charity in Milan (Casa della Carità) which regularly provides migrants with legal assistance so as to help them to comply with immigration rules.

The 2002 regularization programme has had a strong effect in the growth of their regular presence. At the beginning of 2009 they were almost 240, 000 (more than 144, 000 Ukrainians). They have peculiar characteristics and show particular socio-economic behaviours. A large part of this presence is constituted by women, in many cases middle aged, mostly employed in the sector of family services. In Italy Moldavians, Ukrainians and Russians are the three most numerous communities coming from this area. Our analysis is focused on these citizenships.
