5|$|Brin {{originally}} {{planned for the}} ships to displace 13,850 tons (14,066 tonnes), to have a secondary armament of eighteen 6-inch (152-mm) guns, and to carry 3,000 tons (3,047 tonnes) of coal for increased <b>range</b> <b>over</b> that of the Caio Duilio class. In the end, however, the 6-inch (152-mm) armament was reduced to eight 6-inch (152mm) and the coal capacity to 1,700 tons (1,727 tonnes) on 15,000 tons (15,237 tonnes) displacement. The number of 6-inch (152-mm) guns was reduced because {{it was found that}} the additional guns could not have been manned when the 17-inch (432-mm) guns were in use. Unlike other ships built at the time, the two Italia-class ironclads dispensed with vertical belt armor. Brin believed that contemporary steel alloys could not effectively defeat armor-piercing shells of the day. Additionally, fitting belt armor on a ship the size of Italia would cause a prohibitive increase in displacement, and so he discarded it completely in favor of a thin armored deck.|$|E

As more Jaguars were delivered, more Phantoms were released enabling existing Lightning squadrons to be converted; 19 Squadron and 92 Squadron, the forward deployed air defence units in Germany, converted in 1976 and 1977 respectively, {{at the same time}} moving from RAF Gütersloh, which was the closest RAF base to the East German border, to RAF Wildenrath, taking advantage of the Phantom's superior <b>range</b> <b>over</b> the Lightning. Three further UK based squadrons, 23, 29 and 56, were also converted between 1974 and 1976. 111 Squadron, which had been the first unit to use the FGR.2 as an interceptor, converted to the FG.1 version in 1979 following the transfer of the Royal Navy's remaining airframes to the RAF. The Phantom subsequently served as the RAF's primary interceptor for over a decade until the introduction into service of the Panavia Tornado F.3 in 1987.|$|E
5|$|John Calhoun Johnson of Placerville {{surveyed}} {{and cleared}} a shorter, lower (and thus less snow-covered) trail east from that town in 1852, completing the {{work by the}} summer. Rather than following the ridge to the Sierra's crest as the Mormons had, Johnson headed eastward to the South Fork American River, crossing to its north side near the present Pacific Ranger Station in order to follow Peavine Ridge around a rocky stretch of the river. Returning to the river between Kyburz and Strawberry, he then continued alongside it to the crest at Johnson Pass, where a steep slope descended to Lake Tahoe. Within Nevada, his route generally followed the lake to Glenbrook, where it turned inland and crossed the Carson <b>Range</b> <b>over</b> Spooner Summit into the Carson Valley near Carson City. This trail, known as Johnson's Cut-off, generally followed the present US 50, with notable deviations only just east of Placerville (via Carson Road), over Peavine Ridge (roughly following Peavine Ridge Road, some trails, and Wrights Lake Road), just east of Strawberry (via Slippery Ford Road), over {{the crest of the}} Sierra (via Johnson Pass Road and Meyers Road), south of Lake Tahoe (via Pioneer Trail), east of Lake Tahoe (via Genoa Peak Road), and from Spooner Summit into the Carson Valley (via Kings Canyon Road). By 1854, Bartlett's Bridge had been built at the trail's westernmost crossing of the American River, allowing wagons to follow the cutoff; it was soon washed away by a freshet on March 7, 1855, and replaced by Brockliss Bridge, several miles to the east. Due to an improvement of the road through Carson Canyon on the old Carson Route, most travelers ended up turning southeast from Johnson Pass over Luther Pass (present SR 89) to join the older route northeast of Carson Pass rather than following the cutoff along Lake Tahoe.|$|E

40|$|Summary. This {{paper is}} based on {{previous}} works [1], [2] in which the operation replacement of subtree in a tree has been defined. We extend this notion for arbitrary non empty antichain. MML Identifier:TREES_A. WWW:[URL] The articles [5], [7], [6], [8], [4], [3], [1], and [2] provide the notation and terminology for this paper. For simplicity, we follow the rules: T, T 1 denote trees, P denotes an antichain of prefixes of T, p, q, r denote finite sequences of elements of N, and t denotes an element of T. The following proposition is true (1) For all finite sequences p, q, r, s such that p � q = s � r holds p and s are ⊆-comparable. Let us consider T, T 1 and let us consider P. Let us assume that P � = / 0. The functor T,P,T 1 yielding a tree is defined as follows: (Def. 1) q ∈ T,P,T 1 iff q ∈ T and for every p such that p ∈ P holds p ⊀ q or there exist p, r such that p ∈ P and r ∈ T 1 and q = p � r. We now state several propositions: (2) Suppose P � = / 0. Then T,P,T 1 = t 1;t 1 <b>ranges</b> <b>over</b> elements of T: � p (p ∈ P ⇒ p ⊀ t 1) ∪ p � s; p <b>ranges</b> <b>over</b> elements of T, s <b>ranges</b> <b>over</b> elements of T 1 : p ∈ P.
