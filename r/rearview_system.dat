40|$|Since the {{creation}} of the automobile, there has been an effort to create and implement mechanical and electronic devices that would improve vehicle safety. In recent years, electronic technologies have become more efficient and cost effective, therefore creating a great spike in widespread implementation. These safety related devices have to be tested for their reliability and amount of help they provide the driver with. The end user (the driver) has to be involved for a successful device. This research presents the methodology used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the <b>rearview</b> video <b>system</b> (RVS) used in vehicles, especially in large commercial trucks and effectively the methodology for a more complete investigation of the problem of correctly implementing a safety device. The focus of this research is backing crashes that involve large trucks. The countermeasure tested was a <b>rearview</b> video <b>system</b> which provides a rear view to the driver in real time. A traditional crash data analysis is almost impossible since there is not enough data to perform it, and no data are available for the use of this system since it is fairly new to the market. A driver experiment under controlled conditions was used to create and collect the data necessary for the analysis. The experiment yielded a total of 71 crashes out of 270 maneuvers (26. 3...|$|R

Electrical wire harnesses are manufactured with the highest quality materials. Teflon-coated tinned military specification wire, cannon plugs, gold plated pins and sockets {{were used for the}} connectors, and wire harnesses were wrapped with a high-temperature glass mesh under a woven Kevlar outer skin.|$|R
50|$|Changes to 2012 Chevrolet Camaro {{include the}} {{introduction}} of the 323 horsepower 3.6L direct injection V-6 LFX engine replacing the outgoing V6 engine models, a new FE4 suspension package for SS coupe (retuned front and rear dampers, new solid front (23 mm) and rear (24 mm) stabilizer bars, 20-inch aluminum wheels with P245/45R20 front and P275/40R20 rear tires (from SS)), a revised instrument panel appearance (new instrument graphics and trim), a new steering wheel design with improved ergonomics, a power lift feature for the front passenger seat, a new Rear Vision Package (a <b>rearview</b> camera <b>system</b> and an auto-dimming mirror to the existing Rear Park Assist feature), a new rear spoiler as standard, taillamps from RS appearance package option becomes standard for all vehicles. Crystal Red Tintcoat replaces Red Jewel as an exterior color.|$|R
50|$|The FX {{series was}} updated for the 2006 model year with new options and {{standard}} features. The updates included an exterior facelift with new grille, bumper, wheel design and three new exterior colors, and inside a revised center console with new color screen. Many features previously optional were made standard, including the 300-watt Bose audio <b>system,</b> <b>RearView</b> Monitor, 7-inch color display, Advanced Air Bag System (AABS), leather seating surfaces with heated front seats, ten-way power driver’s seat with power lumbar support and eight-way power passenger’s seat.|$|R
5000|$|The new {{entertainment}} features {{added to}} the 2009 model year included the optional Ford SYNC, and an all-new DVD-based voice-activated, multi-entertainment/navigational system with liquid crystal touch display. The <b>rearview</b> camera <b>system</b> is now integrated to show the video feed through the navigation screen instead for the rearview mirror, however, the rearview mirror is still used to show images on Expeditions not equipped with the navigation system. The new navigation system features up to 10 gigabytes of storage space for more than 2400 songs, a jukebox function, a screened photo display, iPod/Zune capability for downloading and recharging, ripping CDs, and integrated compatibility for cellphones and Bluetooth; the newly compatible Sirius Travel Link, which allow drivers to access traffic, weather, sports, and local movie listings; and a [...] "Route Guidance" [...] mode for road and street information. The steering wheel also has a tilt feature and radio controls, including Ford SYNC buttons, allowing the driver to press the button and use voice commands to activate the system, which became standard on Eddie Bauer, Limited, and King Ranch. The tilt w/radio control feature was optional on the XLT during its Wayne plant built orders, but after production moved to Louisville it became standard. For accessory purposes, a HD radio can be installed upon request at a Ford dealership in the United States. New for 2009 were standard heated second row outboard seats on the Limited and King Ranch models only with either the second row bench seat or the optional bucket seats.|$|R
40|$|As the size, complexity, {{and speed}} of {{tractors}} and other agricultural self-propelled machinery have increased, so have the visibility-related issues, placing significant importance on the visual skills, alertness, and reactive abilities of the operator. Rearward movement of large agricultural equipment has been identified in the literature as causing not only damage to both machine and stationary objects, but also injuries (even fatalities) to bystanders not visible to the operator. Fortunately, monitoring assistance, while not a new concept, has advanced significantly, offering operators today more options for increasing awareness of the area surrounding their machines. In this research, an attempt is made to (1) identify and describe the key contributors to agricultural machinery visibility issues (both operator and machine-related), and (2) enumerate and evaluate the potential solutions and technologies that address these issues via modifications of ISO, SAE, and DOT standardized visibility testing methods. Enhanced operator safety and efficiency should result from {{a better understanding of}} the visibility problems (especially with regard to rearward movement) inherent in large tractors and self-propelled agricultural machinery. ^ Used in this study were nine machines of different types that varied widely in size, horsepower rating, and operator station configuration to provide a broad representation of what is found on many U. S. farms/ranches. The two main rearward monitoring ‘technologies’ evaluated were the machines’ factory-equipped mirrors and cameras that the researchers affixed to these machines. A 58. 06 m 2 (625 ft 2) testing grid was centered on the rear-most location of the tested machinery with height indicators centered in each of twenty-five grid cells. In general, the findings were consistent across all the machines tested—i. e., rather obstructed rearward visibility using mirrors alone versus considerably less obstructed rearward visibility with the addition of cameras. For example, having exterior extended-arm and interior mirrors only, a MFWD tractor with 1, 100 -bushel grain cart in tow measured, from the operator’s perspective, 68 % obstructed view of the grid’s kneeling-worker-height markers and 100 % throughout the midline of rearward travel; but when equipped with a <b>rearview</b> camera <b>system,</b> the obstructed area was decreased to only 4 %. The visibility models created identified (1) a moderate-positive Pearson r correlation, indicating that many of the obstructed locations of the rearward area affected both mirrors and cameras similarly and (2) a strong-positive Pearson r correlation of kneeling worker height visibility, indicating that mirrors and camera systems share commonality of areas with high visibility (along the midline of travel and outward with greater distance from the rear of the machine, without implements in tow). ^ Of the recommendations coming from this research, the key one is for establishment of engineering standards aimed at (1) enhancing operator ability to identify those locations around agricultural machinery that are obstructed from view, (2) reducing the risk of run-overs through improved monitoring capabilities of machine surroundings and components, and (3) alerting operators and co-workers of these hazardous locations. ...|$|R
