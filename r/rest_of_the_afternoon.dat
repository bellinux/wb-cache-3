5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over {{on the side of the}} road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, the Wednesday {{after he}} {{returned}} to the Santa Rosa Beach house, he went up to Vortex Spring again. In the middle of the day, he did one dive. Other divers saw him looking closely at the area around the cave entrance, as if, it was later reported, he was planning something. After resurfacing he filled his tanks at the dive shop, a transaction recorded on security cameras (it is not known what he filled those tanks with). He spent much of the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> by himself alongside the spring, witnesses said, testing equipment and making notes in his dive log.|$|E
25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, {{what difference does it make}} whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E

60|$|Now {{that the}} cars are gone by and all the restless world with them, and the fishes in the pond no longer feel their rumbling, I am more alone than ever. For <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long <b>afternoon,</b> perhaps, my meditations are {{interrupted}} only by <b>the</b> faint rattle <b>of</b> a carriage or team along the distant highway.|$|R
6000|$|Jan. 23.—From 10 to 3.45 at <b>the</b> {{successive}} stages <b>of</b> Victor [...] Cousin’s interment, in {{my character}} <b>of</b> member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Institute. It [...] was of great interest. I saw many most eminent Frenchmen, so many [...] that they remained as a cloud upon my recollection, except [...] Berryer, Thiers, and some whom I had known before. Jan. [...] 26.—Attended <b>the</b> meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Institute 12-2. Spent <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> [...] <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> with M. Jules Simon in seeing certain quarters of [...] Paris.|$|R
25|$|Bragg {{responded to}} a request by Stevenson for {{reinforcements}} by sending Col. J.T. Holtzclaw's brigade {{under the condition that}} it be used only to cover a Confederate withdrawal from Lookout Mountain, ordering Stevenson at 2:30p.m. to withdraw to the east side of Chattanooga Creek. Stevenson was reluctant to break contact until his troops on the summit could escape on the Summertown Road into the Chattanooga Valley. The brigades of Walthall, Pettus, and Moore were ordered to hold on for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> For hours through the afternoon and into the night, the six Alabama regiments under Pettus and Moore fought sporadically with the Union troops through dense fog, neither side able to see more than a few dozen yards ahead nor make any progress in either direction.|$|E
25|$|As day broke, the Tigris Corps {{found itself}} {{advancing}} through a heavy fog. On left bank, Younghusband's brigades began their {{advance in the}} mid-morning. Approximately two hours into the advance, the brigades paused in their movements to break for lunch. At midday, the fog began to clear and turn into an unseasonably hot day. As the British and Indian battalions were cooking their food, the Ottoman forces launched a spoiling attack. Even though it was driven back, the left bank Tigris Corps' attack on the left bank was further delayed. Eventually, Younghusband's troops reached their positions and launched their attack. However, the objectives of their attack {{turned out to be}} the center of the left bank defenses. Through the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Younghusband's brigades failed to make much headway against the Ottoman defenders. With no cover on the ground, the assault battalions came under fire at long range from rifle, machinegun, and artillery. Few units made it closer than 300 yards before having to dig in for some cover.|$|E
500|$|Right {{after the}} attack, and suspecting that the bombers {{were still on}} the island, the Civil Guard and the National Police Corps {{launched}} a lockdown, an operation named Operation Cage (...) , the biggest manhunt {{in the history of the}} island. Similar operations had been done around Spain in other attacks, such as in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Checkpoints were set up across the island, while the Palma de Mallorca Airport and all ports were temporarily closed. The airport was closed at 4:00 pm and was re-opened at 5:55 pm, with several flights being delayed. During the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the ports were re-opened as well.|$|E
5000|$|Mangin {{arrived with}} <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army that <b>afternoon,</b> {{and set up}} his camp at Gueliz, {{northwest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, where he received the Marrakeshi qaids and their oaths <b>of</b> allegiance to <b>the</b> sultan Yusuf. [...] Two days later, on 9 September 1912, the French army finally entered and took possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Marrakesh.|$|R
60|$|Ormsgill {{acknowledged}} his gesture, swinging off his shapeless hat, {{and then}} led his boys away to <b>the</b> hut one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Headman's servants {{pointed out to}} him. It was old, and had apparently been built for a person of importance for, though this was more usual further east among the dusky Moslem, there was a tall mud wall about it, and a smaller building probably intended for <b>the</b> occupation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women inside the latter. It was dusty and empty save for the rats and certain great spiders, and during <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hot <b>afternoon</b> Ormsgill sat with Nares in the little enclosed space under <b>the</b> lengthening shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall. The boys had curled themselves up amidst the dust and quietly gone to sleep.|$|R
60|$|I helped Grace {{into the}} saddle, and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perfect <b>afternoon</b> passed like a happy dream. Even if alone, at that season the mere sounds and scents of reawakening Nature would have elated me; but then I strode on, holding Cæsar's rein, lost in <b>the</b> golden glamour <b>of</b> it all, until snow peak and solemn forest seemed but a fitting {{background}} for the slender figure swaying to the horse's stride, while the pale, calm face brought into the shadowy aisles a charm of its own. Once--and I could not help myself--a few lines written by a master who loved Nature broke from me, {{and for a moment}} Grace seemed startled. It was a passage from <b>the</b> first home-coming <b>of</b> Queen Guinevere.|$|R
500|$|The {{next day}} Reitell {{invited him to}} her apartment, but he declined. They went sight-seeing, but Thomas felt unwell and retired to his bed for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Reitell gave him half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of phenobarbitone to help him sleep and {{spent the night at}} the hotel with him. Two days later, on 23 October, Herb Hannum, a friend from an earlier trip, noticed how sick Thomas looked and {{suggested}} an appointment with Feltenstein before the performances of Under Milk Wood that evening. Feltenstein administered injections and Thomas made it through the two performances, but collapsed immediately afterwards. Reitell later said that Feltenstein was [...] "rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything".|$|E
500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as hard as I could. [...] Imagine my surprise when he looked up and said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> [...] Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1888 Test Match at the Oval, George Lohmann {{took what}} Pardon thought was [...] "the finest {{of all the}} catches at cover slip ever brought off by George Lohmann". Bannerman could hardly believe his luck, {{and he went on}} about it for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E
50|$|The typical agenda {{starts with}} an opening general session on Monday, {{followed}} by breakout sessions through <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning and <b>afternoon</b> where different presentations occur simultaneously in different conference rooms, allowing attendees {{to choose which}} one {{they want to go}} to. Each breakout session is typically an hour long, with pauses in the schedule to allow attendees to mingle and walk to their next choice of breakout session. Tuesday and Wednesday also have six or seven of these breakout sessions throughout the day.|$|R
60|$|Agatha Lord {{may have}} lacked {{something}} of Nan's experience, but this speech proved her a fair diplomat. It dispersed the gathering storm and during <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> that <b>afternoon</b> <b>the</b> three counseled together in perfect harmony, O'Gorman confiding to his associates such information as would {{enable them to}} act with him intelligently. Hathaway and Peter Conant could not arrive till the next day at noon; they might even come by <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> train. Nan's field glasses would warn them <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrival and meanwhile there was ample time to consider how they should act.|$|R
6000|$|Next, {{nobody would}} cook; it was {{considered}} a degradation; so we had no dinner. We lazied <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pleasant <b>afternoon</b> away, some dozing under the trees, some smoking cob-pipes and talking sweethearts and war, some playing games. By late supper-time all hands were famished; and to meet the difficulty all hands turned to, on an equal footing, and gathered wood, built fires, and cooked the meal. Afterward everything was smooth for a while; then trouble broke out between the corporal and the sergeant, each claiming to rank the other. Nobody knew which was the higher office; so Lyman had to settle the matter by making <b>the</b> rank <b>of</b> both officers equal. <b>The</b> commander <b>of</b> an ignorant crew like that has many troubles and vexations which probably do not occur in the regular army at all. However, with the song-singing and yarn-spinning around the camp-fire, everything presently became serene again; and by-and-by we raked the corn down level in one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crib, and all went to bed on it, tying a horse to the door, {{so that he would}} neigh if any one tried to get in.(1) ...|$|R
60|$|During the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Thurston {{saw little}} of Millicent and Leslie was much with her.|$|E
60|$|The Gazeka brooded {{apart for}} the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> chewing the insult. At close of play he sought Burgess.|$|E
60|$|And for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> Farmer Brown's boy {{was very}} busy {{around the edge}} of the Old Briar-patch.|$|E
60|$|The day was as {{fine and}} the scene as fair at Newmarch as the party was {{numerous}} and various; and my memory associates with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long <b>afternoon</b> many renewals of acquaintance and much sitting and strolling, for snatches <b>of</b> talk, in <b>the</b> long shade <b>of</b> great trees and through <b>the</b> straight walks <b>of</b> old gardens. A couple of hours thus passed, and fresh accessions enriched the picture. There were persons I was curious of--of Lady John, for instance, of whom I promised myself an early view; but we were apt to be carried away in currents that reflected new images and sufficiently beguiled impatience. I recover, all the same, a full sequence of impressions, each of which, I afterwards saw, had been appointed to help all the others. If my anecdote, as I have mentioned, had begun, at Paddington, at a particular moment, it gathered substance step by step and without missing a link. The links, in fact, should I count them all, would make too long a chain. They formed, nevertheless, the happiest little chapter of accidents, though a series of which I can scarce give more than the general effect.|$|R
5|$|Kawachi {{rejoined the}} First Squadron after her refit {{commanded}} by Captain Yoshimoto Masaki and entered Tokuyama Bay on <b>the</b> evening <b>of</b> 11 July 1918. The following morning torpedo target practice was cancelled due to rough seas and the battleship remained at anchor for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. That <b>afternoon</b> a loud explosion was heard at 15:51 in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> starboard forward main-gun turret and {{large quantities of}} smoke erupted from the turret and {{between the first and}} second funnels. Two minutes later, she began to list to starboard and capsized at 15:55, only four minutes after the explosion. Over a thousand men were aboard Kawachi at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion and over 600 were killed, with 433 survivors.|$|R
500|$|After {{they landed}} in Cavtat, the HV moved towards {{the high ground}} to the north through Zvekovica and Uskoplje, east <b>of</b> Cavtat. <b>The</b> 1st Battalion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Guards Brigade first reached the VRS {{positions}} at Gradina Hill, which quickly overrun and the battalion proceeded towards Jasenica, about [...] north-east <b>of</b> Cavtat, reaching <b>the</b> village by <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> On 21 October, <b>the</b> 5th Battalion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Guards Brigade took positions in Stravča and Duba villages adjacent to the CroatiaBosnia and Herzegovina border in <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region, while the special police moved to <b>the</b> villages <b>of</b> Dubravka and Karasovići in <b>the</b> east <b>of</b> Konavle near <b>the</b> Yugoslav border. <b>The</b> 3rd Battalion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Guards Brigade advanced towards Čilipi and Gruda along the Adriatic Highway running through <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> Konavle. <b>The</b> 2nd Battalion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Guards Brigade entered the area to secure the DubrovnikPlat road connecting the region with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Croatia. In <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> HV deployed a battalion of reserve infantry drawn from Dubrovnik Home Guard, and on 23 October the 156th Infantry Brigade was deployed to relieve the 1st Guards Brigade troops protecting the national border.|$|R

6000|$|... “‘When the topmen {{clear the}} raffle with their clasp-knives in their teeth,’” she quoted at me; {{and for the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> we made merry over our labour.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> {{remainder}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division around Cheux and Sainte Manvieu, {{was being}} relieved by the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. When the 5th Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 214th Infantry Brigade, moved into <b>the</b> outskirts <b>of</b> Cheux, {{they found that}} the Scottish infantry had moved on and the vacant position had been reoccupied by grenadiers of 12th SS Panzer Division. After battling to recapture the position, at 0930 the battalion was counter-attacked by six Panthers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Panzer Division. The attack penetrated Cheux and several British anti-tank guns were destroyed before it was beaten off. Further attacks by the 2nd Panzer Division were halted but the entire front was [...] "a mass of small engagements". For <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning and <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> Scottish infantry and the 4th and 29th Armoured brigades expanded <b>the</b> salient north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Odon and secured <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. During late evening <b>the</b> men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 159th Infantry Brigade (11th Armoured Division) were transported in trucks through the narrow [...] "Scottish Corridor" [...] to Tourville, where they dismounted and crossed the Odon on foot to reinforce the bridgehead. During the night Kampfgruppe Weidinger, a 2,500-strong battle group from the 2nd SS Panzer Division arrived at the front and was placed under <b>the</b> command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Panzer Lehr Division.|$|R

50|$|LST 3002 {{was still}} afloat {{next morning and}} a {{skeleton}} crew re-boarded her. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew were carried off by Poland Victory. The Algerine-class minesweeper HMS Maenad attended until the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships Prince Salvor and Salvage Duke took the LST in tow slowly back to Port Taufiq (or Tewfik) arriving there <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> 12 December. There, she was dry docked in the small shipyard for temporary repairs, the skeleton crew remaining on board.|$|R
60|$|A belated caller straggled in, and Arranmore {{took his}} leave. Lady Caroom for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{was a little}} absent. She gave her {{visitors}} cold tea, and seriously imperiled her reputation as a charming and sympathetic hostess.|$|E

60|$|Some of {{the boys}} {{remained}} in Cedarville for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> As soon as Jack and Andy had put aside their football outfits, they joined Pepper and the Ford girls, and all went to meet Mr. Rossmore Ford, who had just arrived in his carriage.|$|E

This bucket was a heavy one with iron hoops, and I {{had a great deal}} of trouble sometimes to shield my head from it." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{several days}} <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> <b>the</b> boys felt {{once more in}} proper trim for sport, and went out after a bunch of rabbits and squirrels. They were fairly lucky, and three o'clock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> found them on the return to the camp.|$|R

By <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> you should have selected a location for your design project and photographed/sketched the area so you can bring back information to the studio.
