40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study which involved the measurement of various vehicles responses to being driven over various types of <b>road</b> <b>hump</b> at a range of speeds. The study used measured data such as driver’s seat vertical acceleration for biomechanical modelling of the human response to repeated travel over road humps. As part of this project, computer simulation runs were conducted using SIMON to investigate the use of this program for the ‘virtual testing ’ of future <b>road</b> <b>hump</b> designs. This paper compares the results of physical tests and ‘virtual tests ’ for five different vehicle types travelling over four different designs of <b>road</b> <b>hump,</b> with each vehicle being tested at speeds of up to 40 mph. Vehicle types include a passenger car with independent suspension, a taxi and a minibus, both with solid axle suspensions, and a bus and ambulance with airbag suspensions.

40|$|In {{its most}} simple terms, traffic calming is about {{preserving}} {{the functions of}} local streets. As local streets are intended to provide primarily land-access services, hence, when traffic begins to use local streets for through movements, traffic volume and speed levels become incompatible with this primary function. To respond, {{a study on the}} effectiveness of traffic calming measures in reducing vehicles speed at Taman Setapak residential area was undertaken. Field observations and spot speed survey were conducted to collect primary data. The field observation was carried out to collect data on road geometrics and design characteristics of the road humps. The spot speed survey was administered to collect vehicles speed at different points near the road humps. The major findings include first, the road humps proved effective in reducing the speed of the vehicles and second the design characteristics of the road humps {{is an important factor in}} reducing the speed of the vehicles. The average speed of the vehicles before approaching the road humps was about 30 km/hr and at the road humps below 10 km/hr.

40|$|This conference {{paper was}} {{presented}} at EURONOISE 1998, Munich, Germany [© EURONOISE]: [URL] humps and speed cushions is a simple method of reducing the severity and number of road accidents {{as a result of}} decrease in speeds at which drivers choose to travel However, the experimental investigations carried out by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) have demonstrated that such a gain is achieved partly in expense of the increased traffic noise and ground-borne vibration (Watts 1997). It has been shown during these investigations that speed control cushions and <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> can produce perceptible levels of ground vibration which depend on vehicle type and hump and cushion design. Theoretical investigations of ground vibrations generated by road traffic have been carried out by several authors. A number of works has been done for vehicles travelling on statistically rough surfaces of rather good quality (Taniguchi et al. 1979, Le Houedec et al 1982, Hunt 1991, Hanazato et al. 1991) and for accelerating and braking vehicles (Krylov 1995 a-c, 1996 a,b). However, vibrations caused by vehicles travelling over single obstacles were analysed only very briefly (Krylov 1995 a,c) and no calculations directly relevant to traffic calming <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> and speed cushions were carried out.

40|$|There is a {{well-documented}} {{relationship between}} motorists speed and the number, respectively severity, of accidents in urban streets. Also, {{studies have shown}} that vehicle emissions can increase on streets where speed reducing measures are installed, if the driving pattern of the motorists becomes more jerky. Hence, to decrease vehicle emissions and improve traffic safety in built up areas, it is important to motivate or even enforce motorists to drive with a low and even speed. Since most motorists do not always follow the speed limits, different kinds of forcing measures, such as road humps, chicanes and chokers, are used to force motorists to drive slower. The most common of these measures is the <b>road</b> <b>hump.</b> To this date, not many studies, concerning how road humps affect the driving pattern of motorists, have been done. To be able to study the driving pattern of motorists, a method to measure speed continuously over segments of streets has been developed. With this method, speed profiles showing how mean and 85 th percentile speed vary along streets, before and after the streets were re-designed, have been produced. The analyses of these speed profiles reveal that previous studies in this area of interest, have underestimated how much motorists increase their speed between road humps. The analyses also show that motorists always increase their speed between road humps, even if the distance between the humps is only 20 metres. This leads to the conclusion that it is impossible, only using road humps, to make motorists drive with both low and even speed...|$|E

40|$|A <b>road</b> <b>hump,</b> or speed hump, is {{a traffic}} calming device {{used to reduce}} vehicle speed and volume on {{residential}} streets. Road humps are placed across the road to slow traffic and are often installed {{in a series of}} several humps in order to prevent cars from speeding before and after the hump. Speed humps are used in locations where very low speeds are desired and reasonable. Speed humps are typically placed on residential roads and are not used on major roads, bus routes, or primary emergency response routes. In Italy, the road humps are often built in shape of raised crosswalks, or RCWs, and they are generally placed both close and between intersections. This paper deals with the analysis of observed data on a large sample of RCWs located in Tuscany, central Italy. Such data were referred both to geometry characteristics of the single raised crosswalk and recorded differences in vehicle speeds before and after it. Speed data were gathered using two automatic radar-recorders for each one of the sampled raised crosswalks. All the collected data were analyzed trough statistical tests in order to assess their homogeneity or not between different locations and various types of roads. Finally, we were able of making some conclusions and highlighting design aspects. On one side, RCWs with similar geometries and higher heights (about 15 cm) have similar effects on vehicle speeds lowering, regardless of local conditions (location, road geometry, driver behaviour, etc.). Moreover, raised crosswalks installed in a series have strong efficacy than the isolated ones. On the opposite side, the effects of raised crosswalks with smaller heights (less than 6 cm) show clearly a very low influence on vehicle speed variations...|$|E

40|$|Speed hump or {{also known}} as <b>road</b> <b>hump</b> is {{designed}} to ensure safety for both drivers and pedestrian. The use of speed humps in residential streets is an efficient way of controlling speed ofvehicles. However, in Malaysia some ofthe dimensions designed by the local authorities had been implemented on an 'ad hoc' basis without any proper standards or guidelines (HPU, 2002). Although Highway Planning Unit (HPU) and Standards and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM) have stipulated specific ranges of dimensions for the installation of speed humps, however no perfect and ideal guidelines were introduced and were not properly enforced by the local authorities. Therefore, with many styles and inconsistent designs of the speed humps a well-established empirical study has been implemented to develop optimal designs consistency models. In this study, the geometric design of the speed hump was related to 85 th percentile speed and discomfort level. The speed data were carried out by using a laser gun meter detector to obtain the spot speed data at the selected speed hump location and vibration data collection were carried out using triaxial acceleration transducers connected to Racelogic VBOX II SX. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to develop a statistical relationship between speed hump geometric, 85 th percentile speed and discomfort level. In the validation stage, the site empirical data were compared with the predicted data using the paired T -test and discrepancy measure such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Finally, the models have successfully developed and validated according to the statistical procedures in the study. The findings are hoped to provide a starting point towards {{the development of a}} standard for the speed humps in residential areas which will not only focus on the effectiveness but also considering the safety and discomfort level of the road users while travelling on the speed hump...|$|E
