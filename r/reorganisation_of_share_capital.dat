5000|$|A key goal of {{the capital}} {{structure}} changes was to stop {{large amounts of money}} washing in and out of Fonterra’s balance sheet each year as milk production fluctuates. Under the previous structure, farmers matched their shareholding with their milk production by owning one co-operative share for each kilogram of milksolids (kgMS) produced annually. [...] If their milk production dropped in any season, they could redeem shares back to the co-operative, which was required to buy the shares back off them. Consequently, Fonterra faced the risk of losing large amounts <b>of</b> <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> through redemptions during times of declining milk production. [...] For instance, after milk production fell during the 2007/08 drought, Fonterra had to pay out $742 million <b>of</b> <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> to farmers via redemptions.|$|R

That power does not, however, remove the requirement to account for the <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> in the company's books of account.
