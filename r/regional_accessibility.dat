This particular area has seen a growing amount of interest as plans to make it an urban center were already begun in 2010. Private-sector development within the United States in combination with political groups have begun the planning process behind the redevelopment of Tysons Corner. There are two forces at work in the creation of an edge city as it can be beneficial to both parties. With the redevelopment process taking place there has been an aggressive push to bring in businesses to Tysons Corner. Edge cities such as Tysons Corner have specific <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> that has been enhanced by major projects funded by federal and state governments. One of the bigger enhancements to transportation specifically to Tysons Corner was the construction “…of the Washington Dulles International Airport and an associated access road and the Capital Beltway but also expansions to state roads”.

30|$|Hanson [16] {{argued that}} the {{accessibility}} constitutes of two main parts: proximity and mobility. And the accessibility was estimated as travel time, which depends upon both proximity and mobility. In some studies, the accessibility was modeled by simple measures, such as distances from roads, towns, and other destinations [15, 18]. In other studies, the accessibility was also examined by comparing those variables in different villages with an interview-based approach [23]. Typically, Euclidian distance, measuring the distance to roads, was often used as a simple measurement of the accessibility [15]. While no standards or mature quantitative accessibility models have been found from the literature review, the literature inspired the authors to explore an innovative approach to redevelop a set of <b>regional</b> <b>accessibilities</b> that can be measured and analyzed in a GIS environment.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a {{framework}} to assess impacts of various policy options and transport infrastructure investments on accessibility at European level. In order to test the developed framework, impacts of transport infrastructure projects co-funded by the Cohesion Fund and ERDF between 2000 and 2006 were analyzed in terms of accessibility and territorial cohesion. These projects aimed at improving road and rail transport networks in the peripheral and/or enlargement countries while connecting them to the core network. Their impact on accessibility of regions was evaluated for passenger transport using an appropriate combination of various accessibility indicators. At first, the travel costs with and without the improved infrastructure were estimated using the TRANS-TOOLS model (Tools for Transport Forecasting and Scenario Testing; the Europe-wide transport network model used as one of the main reference tools for impact assessments by the European Commission); then, the output of the model was used to compute <b>regional</b> <b>accessibilities</b> at NUTS 3 level in Europe.

40|$|<b>Regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> can {{be defined}} as the ease with which {{destinations}} can be reached throughout a region. The proximity of a residence to potential destinations, such as jobs, shopping, and leisure-time activities, {{and the nature of the}} transportation links to those destinations together determine accessibility. In general, the closer a residence is to the center of the region, the higher the level of <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility,</b> given the concentration of jobs and other activities in the center. Close proximity to secondary centers of activity – “subcenters ” – also contributes to <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility.</b> For any given residence, accessibility will vary for each type of activity (e. g. jobs, shopping, leisure, etc.) and mode of travel (e. g. driving versus transit). <b>Regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> is the outcome of many different land use and transportationrelated policy decisions over a long period of time.

40|$|The {{question}} of how alternative forms of development affect travel patterns has recently {{been the focus of}} a heated debate, much of which centers on the effects of suburbanization in particular. The concept of accessibility provides an important tool for resolving this question. By measuring both the accessibility to activity within the community, or "local" accessibility, and the accessibility to regional centers of activity from that community, or "regional" accessibility, the structure of a community is more fully characterized. The research summarized uses the concepts of local and <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> to test the implications for shopping travel of alternative forms of development in a case study of the San Francisco Bay Area. The results show that higher levels of both local and <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> are associated with lower average shopping distances but are not associated with differences in shopping frequency. As a result, higher levels of both local and <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> are associated with less total shopping travel. However, the effect of high levels of local accessibility is greatest when <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> is low and vice versa. These findings suggest that policies should be directed toward enhancing both types of accessibility, but that the effects may work against each other to some degree...|$|E

40|$|High speed rail (also {{commonly}} known as HSR) is highly {{regarded as one of}} the most significant innovation for mass passenger transportation to travellers willing to pay for reduced travel impediments (shorter travel time, convenience, safety, security, comfort, reliability, flexibility, uniqueness and attractiveness). The transport policy in Australia has until now focused primarily on private passenger car transport and air transportation to the degree that State and Federal Governments’ commitments and actions of rail-oriented mass transportation system still remains sketchy in spite of occasional political and public attentions into it.

40|$|The role of land-use {{and related}} {{policies}} in reducing automobile dependence {{has been the}} subject of heated policy debate for over two decades. Previous research has shed light on the correlations between land-use and travel. Yet a crucial knowledge gap still exists in establishing causality between the two. Do changes in land-use characteristics cause behavioral changes in individuals?????? decisions on what transportation means to use for travel? How does land-use as a contextual factor shape the decision process and outcome of trip frequency and travel mode choice? These questions remain largely unanswered. Attempting to fill the gap, this study applied the directed acyclic graphs method to identify the causal relationship between land-use and travel in the 9 -county Dallas- Fort Worth (D-FW) metropolitan area. The logit captivity (LC) model, an extension to the conventional multinomial logit, was utilized to capture the contribution of land-use in affecting individuals?????? decisions on travel mode choice. All the data for this study were obtained from the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG). Evidence from the D-FW region confirms to a certain extent the causal effects of land-use on travel. For work trips, increases in <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility,</b> job density and share of commercial land-use reduce the use of automobiles. Higher <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility,</b> however, causes households to generate automobile trips and thus leads to the increase in vehicle miles of travel (VMT). For non-work trips, population density, job density and <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> are direct causes of the choice of automobile, while only <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> is causally connected to reducing automobile trips and VMT. The logit captivity model results indicate that land-use contributes to captive-driving choices for home-based work trips. Lack of land-use mix at trip origins increases the probabilities of trip-makers being captive to the automobile from 0. 06 % to 5. 62 % for driving-alone and from 0. 38 % to 3. 55 % for shared-ride...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} question of how particular forms of metropolitan development affect travel patterns, a question long of concern to planners but recently the subject of a heated debate. Critics identify sprawling, low-density, single-use, automobile-dependent suburban development as the problem, and recommend a return to the higher-density, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented design practices of the past as the solution, particularly as a way of reducing non-work automobile travel. Yet the question remains: can these “neo-traditional” communities reduce automobile travel when implemented within the broader context of freeways and regional shopping malls. The concept of accessibility provides an important tool for resolving this question. Accessibility measures the attractiveness of potential destinations and the cost of reaching them. By measuring both the accessibility to activity within the community, or “local” accessibility, and the accessibility to regional centers of activity from that community, or “regional” accessibility, the structure of a community and its relationship to the metropolitan area are more fully characterized. It is hypothesized that, for shopping trips, high levels of accessibility are directly associated with shorter distances and greater variety in destinations and indirectly associated with greater frequencies and some shift away from automobile use. Some degree of substitutability between local and <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> is also hypothesized, suggesting that high levels of local accessibility may reduce the need for regional travel. This dissertation defines quantitative and qualitative measures of local and <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> and uses them to test the implications for shopping travel of alternative forms of development in a case study of the San Francisco Bay Area. An aggregate-level analysis shows a significant negative relationship between the length of the shopping trip and both local and <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility,</b> but no significant relationship with trip frequency. Accessibility is more thoroughly evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively for four Bay Area communities, leading to several refinements in the definition and measurement of local and <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility.</b> A survey of residents in the case study areas reveals a more complex relationship, in that high levels of accessibility work to both decrease and to increase travel. The survey also shows that substitutability is limited: local accessibility seems to have little effect on regional travel. This dissertation concludes by reviewing policy implications, particularly the importance of finding an appropriate balance between the sometimes conflicting goals of minimizing travel and maximizing the range of alternatives available to residents...|$|E

40|$|Most urban {{planning}} {{literature suggests that}} compact and mixed-use neighborhoods correlate with lower vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT), and accordingly, lower energy consumption and transportation-related emissions. However, many of these studies also find {{that the relationship between}} urban form and travel behavior is marginal at best, and several commit analytical errors, which may compromise the robustness of parameter estimates. This thesis examines daily travel behavior in Santiago de Chile to understand how demographic structure, neighborhood design, and <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> influence travel behavior as measured through emitted grams of five criteria pollutants (C 0 2, VOCs, PM 10, CO and NO,). To answer this question, two different modeling techniques are employed to investigate the variables related to car ownership and travel behavior. The first analysis uses a discrete-continuous choice model to understand the attributes that influence car-ownership and travel emissions. The second study uses structural equation modeling to simultaneously estimate latent urban form factors, car-ownership and emitted pollutants. The advantage of each technique is that they both offer the flexibility to address the four major methodological errors identified in the literature review: inulticollinearity, spatial auto-correlation, the modifiable areal unit problem and self-selection. After controlling for the four methods-related gaps, both models find that, although economic and demographic characteristics dominate in explaining travel decisions, the built environment plays a small, but significant, role. The discrete-continuous choice model uses two classes of measures to capture urban form: local attributes and <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility.</b> It finds that neighborhood-level and regional characteristics have an equally important impact on 2 or 3 -plus vehicle ownership. Furthermore, the model suggests that <b>regional</b> <b>accessibility</b> attributes dominate among the built environment measures in explaining variations in emitted travel pollutants. The structural equation model uses three latent urban form factors to characterize the built environment: a high-intensity, mixed-use factor; a high-income residential factor; and a non-gridded street factor. It finds that the high-density, mixed-use factor decreases the utility of owning a vehicle, and reduces the likelihood of travel emissions. The latter two factors, on the other hand, both increase the probability of owning a car. Lastly, the non-gridded street factor has a consistently positive effect on travel emissions. by Veronica Adelle Hannan. Thesis: M. C.

Multilevel and ordered logit models are developed for the San Francisco Bay Area to estimate the effects of urban form and socioeconomic characteristics on vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and vehicle trip frequency (for work, shopping, and social/recreational purposes). We find that the two urban scale characteristics exert complementary effects on VKT. However, because people in the San Francisco Bay Area display significantly lower VKT in the local than in the regional action space, we conclude that regional-scale interventions would contribute more to the policy objective of VKT reduction, although local-scale design policies might also help reach this policy goal. Intersection density (for the local action space models) and <b>regional</b> jobs <b>accessibility</b> (for the <b>regional</b> action space models) demonstrated the strongest and most significant relationships with VKT. The built environment did not appear to significantly affect vehicle trip frequency, which is likely due to the uniformly high levels of vehicle use in both the local and regional action spaces in the area...|$|R
