40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{comparative}} study on the total revenue generated with pre-emptive and non pre-emptive priority scheduler for a fairly generic problem of pricing the server's surplus capacity in a single server Markovian queue. The specific problem is to optimally price the server's surplus capacity by introducing {{a new class of}} customers (secondary class) without affecting the pre-specified <b>service</b> level <b>of</b> its current customers (primary class) when pre-emption is allowed. Pre-emptive scheduling is used in various applications. First, a finite step algorithm is proposed to obtain global optimal operating and pricing parameters for this problem. These optimal operating and pricing parameters constitute a unique Nash equilibrium in a certain two player non cooperative game. We then describe the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> level where pre-emptive scheduling gives feasible solution and generates some revenue while non pre-emptive scheduling has infeasible solution. Further, some complementary conditions are identified to compare revenue analytically for certain <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> level where strict priority to secondary class is optimal. Our computational examples show that the complementary conditions adjust {{in such a way that}} pre-emptive scheduling always generates more revenue. Theoretical analysis is found to be intractable for the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> level when pure dynamic policy is optimal. Hence, extensive numerical examples are presented to describe different instances. It is noted in numerical examples that pre-emptive scheduling generates at least as much revenue as non pre-emptive scheduling. A certain <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> level is identified where improvement in revenue is quite significant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
