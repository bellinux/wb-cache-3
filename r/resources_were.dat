30|$|The spatial {{differences}} of ECC of water <b>resources</b> <b>are</b> big in Heilongjiang Province. The ECC is largest in Daxing’anling, because the water <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> abundant and the precipitation is more, but {{the population is}} small. The utilization of water <b>resources</b> <b>is</b> low, but the water ECC is bigger. The water ECC decreased significantly in western and eastern, and the water <b>resources</b> <b>are</b> relatively small in the regions where the consumption of water is mainly used on agricultural production. Daqing is an industry city where the development and utilization of water <b>resources</b> <b>are</b> higher, so the ECC level is lower.|$|R

5|$|Analysis of Estonian {{oil shale}} {{resources}} and mining possibilities intensified {{during the early}} 20th century while Estonia {{was part of the}} Russian Empire. Industrial development was under way in Saint Petersburg (known as Petrograd in 1914–24), but regional fuel <b>resources</b> <b>were</b> in short supply. A large shale oil extraction plant for processing Estonian oil shale was proposed in 1910. The outbreak of World War I, coupled with a fuel supply crisis, accelerated the pace of the research.|$|E

5|$|By the 1820s, animal <b>resources</b> <b>were</b> {{in decline}} in the area leading to {{increased}} competition among the tribes for game and for furs to sell. Collusion among the fur trading companies led to a dramatic drop in fur prices during the late 1820s causing impoverishment for many Sioux hunters.

5|$|Considerable Australian {{and other}} Allied {{military}} <b>resources</b> <b>were</b> devoted to protecting shipping and ports from Axis submarines and warships. For instance, the RAN escorted over 1,100coastal convoys the Army established coastal defences to protect important ports {{and a high}} proportion of the RAAF's operational squadrons were used to protect shipping at various times. Nevertheless, the use of these units for defensive tasks and the shipping casualties in Australian waters did not seriously affect the Australian economy or Allied war effort.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the landing at Porton Plantation, the planned Australian advance into the Bonis Peninsula was called off, and the Australians focused their main effort on Bougainville towards the capture of Buin in the south. The effort in the north was reduced to that of a holding action as further <b>resources</b> <b>were</b> {{transferred}} out of the sector. Nevertheless, the 31st/51st Battalion continued to undertake patrols along the Ratsua front, during which they suffered further casualties, until they were withdrawn from combat operations on 28 June. They were subsequently moved back to Torokina.|$|E
5|$|German {{intelligence}} {{suggested that}} the RAF was down to just 300 serviceable fighters on 17 August 1940, taking into consideration German pilots' claims and their estimates of British production capabilities. In fact, there were 855 machines serviceable, with another 289 at storage units and 84 at training units. These <b>resources</b> <b>were</b> included {{in a total of}} 1,438 fighters, twice as many as at the beginning of July 1940. Expecting weakening opposition, the Luftwaffe prepared for a major action against RAF Sector Stations on 18 August.|$|E

During his term, every province was provided with at least one upper-secondary school. He also became involved in frequent school migrations due to both the war and changing policy.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} France, men and <b>resources</b> <b>were</b> being marshalled {{in preparation}} for the large British-French Somme Offensive. The build-up in the Somme did not go unnoticed by the German Supreme Army Command. The German Second Army, which was holding the sector north of the Somme, had observed preparations for an offensive since the end of February 1916. Short of resources due to operations at Verdun, the Germans could only mount local operations in an effort to divert British resources from the Somme.|$|E

When ordered to deport the Roman Jews, Kesselring resisted. He announced that no <b>resources</b> <b>were</b> available to carry out such an order. Hitler then transferred responsibility to the SS. About 2,000 Roman Jews were ultimately deported between October 1943 and June 1944, half of them on 16 October 1943. During the German occupation of Italy, the Germans were believed to have killed some 46,000 Italian civilians, including 7,000 Jews.|$|E

5|$|The Meiningen cantatas of Johann Ludwig Bach {{were scored}} {{for the four}} vocal parts and {{a small group of}} instrumentalists, {{consisting}} of two oboes, violins, violas and continuo: at Meiningen, as with many of the smaller courts in Germany, <b>resources</b> <b>were</b> limited; it appears that continuo instruments like bassoons were available only when these works were performed elsewhere. When Bach performed his cousin's cantatas in Leipzig in 1726, he used the same orchestral forces as Meiningen for all but two, adding trumpets with drums in one and piccolo trumpets in another.|$|E
