25|$|The random {{disorder}} in the potential {{landscape of the}} two-dimensional electron gas {{plays a key role}} in the observation of topological sectors and their instantons (phase transitions). Because of the disorder, the electrons are localized and thus they cannot flow across the sample. But if we consider a loop around a localized 2D electron, we can notice that current is still able to flow in the direction around this loop. This current is able to renormalize to larger scales and eventually becomes the Hall current that <b>rotates</b> <b>along</b> the edge of the sample. A topological sector corresponds to an integer number of rotations and it is now visible macroscopically, in the robustly quantized behavior of the measurable Hall current. If the electrons were not sufficiently localized, this measurement would be blurred out by the usual flow of current through the sample.|$|E

50|$|In {{a binary}} {{system with a}} {{circular}} orbit, it is often useful to describe the system in a coordinate system that <b>rotates</b> <b>along</b> with the objects. In this non-inertial frame, one must consider centrifugal force in addition to gravity. The two together can be described by a potential, so that, for example, the stellar surfaces lie along equipotential surfaces.|$|E

50|$|A space {{elevator}} cable <b>rotates</b> <b>along</b> {{with the}} rotation of the Earth. Therefore, objects attached to the cable would experience upward centrifugal force in the direction opposing the downward gravitational force. The higher up the cable the object is located, the less the gravitational pull of the Earth, and the stronger the upward centrifugal force due to the rotation, so that more centrifugal force opposes less gravity. The centrifugal force and the gravity are balanced at geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO). Above GEO, the centrifugal force is stronger than gravity, causing objects attached to the cable there to pull upward on it.|$|E

50|$|The best {{explanation}} of the phenomenon of optical molasses {{is based on the}} principle of polarization gradient cooling. Counterpropagating beams of circularly polarized light cause a standing wave, where the light polarization is linear but the direction <b>rotates</b> <b>along</b> the direction of the beams at a very fast rate. Atoms moving in the spatially varying linear polarisation have a higher probability density of being in a state that is more susceptible to absorption of light from the beam coming head-on, rather than the beam from behind. This results in a velocity dependent damping force that is able to reduce the velocity of a cloud of atoms to near the recoil limit.|$|E

5000|$|The PPI display {{provides}} a 2-D [...] "all round" [...] {{display of the}} airspace around a radar site. The distance out {{from the center of}} the display indicates range, and the angle around the display is the azimuth to the target. The current position of the radar antenna is typically indicated by a line extending from the center to the outside of the display, which <b>rotates</b> <b>along</b> with the antenna in realtime. It is essentially a B-scope extended to 360 degrees. The PPI display is typically what people think of as a radar display in general, and was widely used in air traffic control until the introduction of raster displays in the 1990s.|$|E

The {{components}} {{structure and}} principle of ring ball gratings sensor is put {{forward for the}} present state that there still has not a better method to detect torque under the extreme environment in domestic. According to the localization property in time and frequency domains and the translation invariant property, the preprocessed signal of sensor is decomposed with multi resolution, and the signal is reconstructed with wavelet under the intervention of neural network. The wavelet neural networks (WNN) model is constructed and the algorithm routine is realized in laboratory virtual instrument engineering workbench (LabVIEW). With the testing device, the demodulation experiments are carried out for the corresponding sensor signals when the shaft is continuous <b>rotated</b> <b>along</b> the same direction, <b>rotated</b> <b>along</b> the alternate direction and knocked.

50|$|The {{operation}} of a synchronous motor {{is due to the}} interaction of the magnetic fields of the stator and the rotor. Its stator winding, which consists of a 3 phase winding, is provided with a 3 phase supply, and the rotor is provided with a DC supply. The 3 phase stator winding carrying 3 phase currents produces 3 phase rotating magnetic flux (and therefore a rotating magnetic field). The rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field and <b>rotates</b> <b>along</b> with it. Once the rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field, the motor is said to be in synchronization. A single-phase (or two-phase derived from single phase) stator winding is possible, but in this case the direction of rotation is not defined and the machine may start in either direction unless prevented from doing so by the starting arrangements.|$|E
50|$|In human anatomy, the {{clavicle}} or collarbone is a {{long bone}} {{that serves as a}} strut between the shoulder blade and the sternum or breastbone. There are two clavicles, one on the left and one on the right. The clavicle is the only long bone in the body that lies horizontally. Together with the shoulder blade it makes up the shoulder girdle. It is a palpable bone and in people who have less fat in this region, the location of the bone is clearly visible, as it creates a bulge in the skin. It receives its name from the clavicula ("little key") because the bone <b>rotates</b> <b>along</b> its axis like a key when the shoulder is abducted. The clavicle is the most commonly broken bone. It can easily be fractured due to impacts to the shoulder from the force of falling on outstretched arms or by a direct hit.|$|E

The radiated power is expressed as a general trace formula solely in terms of the scattering matrix, making an explicit connection to the conjecture of Zel'dovich [JETP Lett. 14, 180 (1971) ] on rotating objects. We further show that a <b>rotating</b> body drags <b>along</b> nearby objects while making them spin parallel to its own rotation axis...|$|R

50|$|There are 5 {{sensory organs}} innervated by the {{vestibular}} nerve; 3 semicircular canals (HSCC, SSCC, PSCC) and 2 otolith organs. Each semicircular canal (SSC) {{is a thin}} tube that thickens briefly (2x thin diameter), at a point called osseous ampullae. At their center-base each contains an ampullary cupula. The cupula is a gelatin bulb connected to stereocilia, affected by the relative movement of the endolymph it is bathed in. Since the cupula {{is part of the}} bony labyrinth it <b>rotates</b> <b>along</b> with actual head movement unable to cause stimulation by itself; that is, if endolymph was not present, movement could not be detected. Endolymph follows the rotation of the canal, however, due to inertia lags behind initially, which bends and activates the cupula. After any extended rotation the endolymph catches up to the canal and the cupula returns to its upright position and resets. When extended rotation ceases, however, endolymph continues, (due to inertia) which bends and activates the cupula.|$|E
