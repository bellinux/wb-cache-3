5000|$|La Farge, {{known as}} [...] "Kipper" [...] {{to friends and}} family, {{enrolled}} in Harvard College in 1915, but his college career was interrupted by World War I. After reserve officer training in Plattsburg, NY, in 1916 and in 1918, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the cavalry. Discharged after four months in France, he <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>college.</b> <b>While</b> at Harvard, he was an editor for the Harvard Advocate literary magazine. He graduated from Harvard with a B.A. in 1920 {{and went on to}} complete a B.S. from the School of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania in 1923.|$|E
50|$|After {{his tour}} of duty he <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> art <b>college.</b> <b>While</b> still in his senior year he {{obtained}} a commission to illustrate the Senior Girl Scout Handbook. He graduated in 1961, and was asked back to teach a drawing class one day a week. After two years increasing freelance work brought an end to teaching. His early varied clients included Smith Kline & French Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia Electric, the Franklin Mint, {{and a number of}} clients through Philadelphia's Bruno/Mease Studio and the N.W. Ayer Agency. He illustrated several books, mainly for the teen-age market.|$|R
50|$|Decker {{was named}} as a NASCAR Drive for Diversity driver in 2014. She competed in Whelen All-American Series events for Rev Racing that {{year at the}} Hickory Motor Speedway, Langley Speedway, and Motor Mile Speedway. She had been {{attending}} the University of Wisconsin-Stout (pursuing a degree in early childhood education) for two years but had to quit to race in the Southern United States for the season. She <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> in 2015 <b>while</b> continuing to race super late models. Decker {{received a call from}} Mike Harmon Racing at New Smyrna Speedway during the World Series of Stock Car Racing within the Daytona Speedweeks to see if she was interested to race in one of their trucks. She attempted her first ever NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race driving the #74 Chevrolet for owner/driver Mike Harmon, but was one of four teams that failed to qualify. She qualified 33rd fastest, about 1/10 second behind the 32nd final spot. The first practice for the race had rained out and she had one 90 minute practice to find speed. She has NASCAR certification to run short tracks in the Truck Series only; her goal is to race in the Xfinity Series. Decker planned another attempt at Iowa Speedway on June 19, 2015; this deal, however, did not come together. Decker qualified in the fall Martinsville race and finished 30th. Decker returned in 2016, with her sister Claire Decker, and her cousin Natalie Decker competing in the Martinsville race. Claire and Paige qualified for the race, while Natalie was sent home.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, after {{eleven years}} as {{president}} at Kentucky Wesleyan, Hamilton accepted {{the presidency of}} Central Methodist College in Fayette, Missouri. Central Methodist, like Kentucky Wesleyan prior to Hamilton's arrival, faced declining enrollment, shaky finances and low morale. The 1970s were difficult times for small colleges across the United States and Central Methodist in particular entered the decade with a difficult financial future. Hamilton introduced new programs to attract new students, including organizing the Allied Health Consortium among various Missouri schools. Hamilton also tirelessly worked to build new ties between the college and Missouri's Methodist churches and to recruit new students. An office (using donated facilities procured by Hamilton) was opened in St. Louis to assist with school business and recruitment. Hamilton improved conditions for the school's faculty by installing telephones in their offices, instituting health insurance {{as part of their}} employment benefits, and raising faculty pay. Hamilton also established the school's first sabbatical program for faculty and made it a regular part of college affairs. He also instituted faculty evaluations, conducted by faculty and students. The curriculum was expanded and college governance was opened up, allowing for greater participation by more people and interests. Hamilton also established a nursing program which continued as {{an important part of the}} college long after his departure. Hamilton added new academic and athletic scholarships. In 1973 the school's rugby team finished third in the national championship tournament, and the first women's athletic teams at the college were established during Hamilton's term as president. Hamilton also arranged to have the tombstones of Daniel Boone and his wife <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the <b>college.</b> Also <b>while</b> at Central Methodist, Hamilton was ordained as a Methodist minister.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{takes the}} risk of college {{participation}} into context when evaluating the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> education. College dropout and a higher permanent income shock for those who graduate from college accounts for 51 % of the excess <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> education. Using a simple risk premium approach, I reconcile the observed high average <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling with relatively low attendance rates. A high dropout risk has two important effects on the estimated average <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> education: via selection bias and via risk premium. ...|$|R

The most striking result is the extremely high <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> education of Hispanic workers relative to White workers. The {{significant differences in the}} patterns of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> education along with higher college premium for Hispanic workers shed a light on which areas public and educational policies should address...|$|R

40|$|Recent studies debate how the unobserved {{dependence}} {{between the}} monetary <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> education and selection into college can be characterised. This paper examines this question using British data. We develop a semiparametric local instrumental variables estimator for identified {{features of a}} flexible correlated random coefficient model. These identified features {{are directly related to}} the marginal and average treatment effect in policy evaluation. Our results indicate that <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> systematically differ between actual college graduates and actual college non-graduates. They are on average higher for college graduates and positively related <b>to</b> selection into <b>college</b> for 96 % of the individuals. The dependence between selection into <b>college</b> and <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> education is strongest for individuals with low math test scores at the age of 7, individuals with less educated mothers, and for working-class individuals...|$|R
