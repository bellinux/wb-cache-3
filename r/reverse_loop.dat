The Melbourne Railway Company purchased the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company in 1862, and the St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company but was amalgamated with the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company to form the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay United Railway Company on 22 October 1864. subsequently all these railway businesses were acquired by the government-owned Victorian Railways in 1878.|$|E
50|$|The station opened {{when the}} Van Aken line was {{extended}} east from Lynnfield Road. The extension opened on July 30, 1930 {{at the same}} time that trains began using Cleveland Union Terminal.The station originally included a car yard with a reverse U for turning the trains around. A passenger station building was constructed within the radius of <b>reverse</b> <b>loop</b> in 1932. However, because of the need to generate income, the building was never used as a passenger station but was leased for use as a Texaco service station. In 1948, the reverse U was replaced by a regular turnaround loop.|$|E

The area {{located near the}} coast will be selected as the pilot project because of having strong occurrence of PD which is mainly caused by salt contamination. The methods applied in this experiment consist of using tie wires made from an insulation sheath of low voltage cable, the sheath of PIC itself; composite tie wire and aluminium tie wire (<b>reverse</b> <b>loop</b> binding). Following the trial results, there are two methods that considered as the most effective ways for PD solving; binding PIC by using the PIC’s insulation sheath and the composite tie wire instead of aluminium tie wire (conventional binding) ...|$|E
40|$|Reverse {{subdivision}} aims at {{constructing a}} coarser representation {{of an object}} given by a fine polygon mesh. In this paper, we first derive a mask for <b>reverse</b> <b>Loop</b> subdivision {{that can be applied}} to both regular and extraordinary vertices. The mask is parameterized, and thus can also be used in reversing variants of Loop subdivision, such as those proposed by Warren and Litke. We apply this mask not only to mesh geometry, but also to texture coordinates. This reverses the texture-mapping process described by DeRose, Kass and Truong, in which a texture originally defined for a coarse mesh was carried to the finer meshes obtained by subdivision. Combined with the forward subdivision, the proposed technique constitutes a multiresolution representation of textured subdivision surfaces. We illustrate its use with a set of examples...|$|E
40|$|Thiosulfate {{respiration}} in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is catalyzed by the membrane-bound enzyme thiosulfate reductase. Experiments with quinone biosynthesis mutants {{show that}} menaquinol {{is the sole}} electron donor to thiosulfate reductase. However, the reduction of thiosulfate by menaquinol is highly endergonic under standard conditions (ΔE°' = - 328 mV). Thiosulfate reductase activity was found {{to depend on the}} proton motive force (PMF) across the cytoplasmic membrane. A structural model for thiosulfate reductase suggests that the PMF drives endergonic electron flow within the enzyme by a <b>reverse</b> <b>loop</b> mechanism. Thiosulfate reductase was able to catalyze the combined oxidation of sulfide and sulfite to thiosulfate in a reverse of the physiological reaction. In contrast to the forward reaction the exergonic thiosulfate-forming reaction was PMF independent. Electron transfer from formate to thiosulfate in whole cells occurs predominantly by intraspecies hydrogen transfer...|$|E

Low molar Cl/Br ratios (85 - 93) and a δ 18 O <b>reverse</b> <b>loop</b> suggests an evaporative seawater origin for hypersaline water from the Upper Permian-Lower Triassic Khuff Formation. In contrast, formation water from the Upper Carboniferous-Lower Permian Unayzah Group shows a heterogeneous trend between low salinity/low δ 18 O freshwater and hypersaline/intermediate δ 18 O brine, the latter being a product of evaporated seawater. Unayzah water salinity increases linearly with depth {{at the rate of}} 77 to 98 mg/L per meter, allowing quantitative prediction of water resistivity (Rw) at specific reservoir depths. The increase in Ca and depletion of Mg and HCO 3 with Unayzah depth suggests the impact of temperature-triggered ion exchange processes that alter the primary host rock and formation water composition...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 6. 2 mu s {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of amyloid-beta (10 - 35) (A beta) were performed in explicit water solvent. The results {{reveal that the}} collapsed-coil (cc) structure determined by experiments is stable at pH 5. 6 for hundreds of nanoseconds, but it can exchange with a strand-loop-strand (SLS) structure on the microsecond time scale. The SLS structure has D 23 -K 28 as a <b>reverse</b> <b>loop</b> and the central hydrophobic core and the C-terminal in hydrophobic contact. This SLS structure topologically resembles the proposed monomer conformation in fibrils. Since {{it has been suggested}} that a special conformation of A beta is needed when the monomer binds to fibril ends to elongate fibrils, we propose that the SLS structure may be an important intermediate binding structure for A beta fibril growth. Simulations at pH 2. 0, which is used to mimic the mutation of E 22 Q and D 23 N, and at high temperature (400 K) indicate that the SLS structure is considerably populated under these conditions while the cc structure is disrupted. These results imply that the SLS structures may also be a binding intermediate in other conditions such as E 22 Q and/or D 23 N mutations and high temperature, which have been proved to promote fibril formation previously...|$|E
40|$|Methylation of lysine- 79 (K 79) {{within the}} {{globular}} domain of histone H 3 by Dot 1 methylase {{is important for}} transcriptional silencing and for association of the Sir silencing proteins in yeast. Here, we show {{that the level of}} H 3 -K 79 methylation is low at all Sir-dependent silenced loci but not at other transcriptionally repressed regions. Hypomethylation of H 3 -K 79 at the telomeric and silent mating-type loci, but not the ribosomal DNA, requires the Sir proteins. Overexpression of Sir 3 concomitantly extends the domain of Sir protein association and H 3 -K 79 hypomethylation at telomeres. In mammalian cells, H 3 -K 79 methylation is found at loci that are active for V(D) J recombination, but not at recombinationally inactive loci that are heterochromatic. These results suggest that H 3 -K 79 methylation is an evolutionarily conserved marker of active chromatin regions, and that silencing proteins block the ability of Dot 1 to methylate histone H 3. Further, they suggest that Sir proteins preferentially bind chromatin with hypomethylated H 3 -K 79 and then block H 3 -K 79 methylation. This positive feedback loop, and the <b>reverse</b> <b>loop</b> in which H 3 -K 79 methylation weakens Sir protein association and leads to further methylation, suggests a model for position-effect variegation...|$|E

40|$|The jughandle is a {{category}} of unconventional intersection that redistributes left turns to improve capacity and safety. The New Jersey Department of Transportation, a pioneer in jughandle design, classifies jughandles as either Type A (forward ramp intersecting the cross street), Type B (forward ramp curving left to intersect the mainline), or Type C (<b>reverse</b> <b>loop</b> ramp). This research has developed {{a new type of}} jughandle design referred to as Type A+B. This design closes the minor approaches at intersections and directs traffic through a jughandle onto the mainline. It also accommodates U-turns and mainline left turns {{in a manner similar to}} traditional Type B jughandles. A unique type of signal phasing, developed to accommodate this design, allows both jughandles to move concurrently. This type of intersection is hypothesized to be most appropriate for the retrofit of suburban arterials requiring installation of a median barrier. The retrofit would install a median barrier with the jughandles, and eliminate signals at intersections with low cross-street volumes, replacing them with right turns followed by U-turns (RTUT). The objective of this research is to determine whether this is an appropriate context for the design, and under what general volume conditions the Type A+B jughandle can reduce delay. Simulation software was used to compare performance measures for the Type A+B jughandle against a conventional intersection and a traditional Type A jughandle, for a wide range of traffic volumes whose turn movement proportions were modeled after a suburban arterial. The research also tested use of this design on an existing suburban arterial in the Pittsburgh region. Measures of performance evaluated include intersection delay, additional footprint, fuel consumption, and number of stops. It was found that the Type A+B jughandle significantly reduced delay under high-volume conditions, and resulted in a much larger intersection footprint...|$|E
