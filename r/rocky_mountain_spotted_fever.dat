The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>fever,</b> and West Nile virus.|$|E

40|$|The {{pathogens}} {{transmitted by}} ticks {{to human beings}} are a motive of public health concern around the world, {{such is the case}} of Lyme disease in the northern hemisphere, Encephalitis virus in Europe, the recurrent <b>fevers</b> and the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountains</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>fever,</b> better known in Colombia as “Tobia Fever”. People of all economic and social conditions are prone to develop a zoonotic agent transmitted by these vectors, which could be infected by several pathogens through co-infection mechanisms. The epidemiology and prevalence of these diseases are affected by ecological, climatic and anthropogenic factors. All these factors, affect in a different manner the enzootic cycle between pathogens, ticks and wild hosts. Current molecular diagnostic tools have allowed to progress in pathogen identification, previously unknown or undetermined. The government intervention capacity of each country, and the multidisciplinary professional cooperation, especially from physicians and veterinarians, is fundamental in order to strategically implement control and prevention plans that can deal with this problematic. The present article aims to make a thorough review of the factors which are favoring the transmission of zoonotic agents by ticks, contextualizing the most important aspects that determine their prevalence, and the most relevant control and prevention measures...|$|R

Species of the genus Rickettsia contain some of the most hazardous of the obligate intracellular bacteria, including Rickettsia rickettsii and R. conorii the causative agents of <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> and Mediterranean <b>spotted</b> <b>fevers,</b> respectively. <b>Spotted</b> <b>fever</b> group Rickettsia species commonly invade and thrive within cells of the host circulatory system whereby the endothelial cells are severely perturbed. The subsequent disruption of circulatory continuity results in much of the severe morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases, including macropapular dermal rash, interstitial pneumonia, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, and other multisystem manifestations. This review describes current knowledge of the essential pathogenic processes of adherence to and invasion of host cells, efforts to disrupt these processes, and potential for disease prevention through vaccination with recently identified bacterial adherence and invasion proteins.

40|$|The {{presence}} of cell-mediated immunity in <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>spotted</b> fever-infected guinea pigs {{was determined by}} two in vitro assays: whole blood lymphocyte transformation (LT) and macrophage migration inhibition. Increased LT was detected as early as 1 week in guinea pigs infected with Rickettsia rickettsii and treated with oxytetracycline and was detected by two weeks in infected but untreated guinea pigs. Elevated LT was still detectable at 10 weeks postinfection. Guinea pigs vaccinated with killed rickettsiae failed to develop lymphocyte responsiveness; however, there was a rapid lymphocyte response after challenge with live organisms, suggesting potentiation by the vaccine. Vaccinated guinea pigs that were challenged and then treated with antibiotic failed to develop LT, suggesting that infection {{is necessary for the}} observed response. Macrophage migration inhibition was detected in both infected and vaccinated guinea pigs by 1 week after infection, but this response was no longer detected 4 to 5 weeks later.

40|$|Abstract. Infected deer ticks (Ixodes scapularis) {{were allowed}} to attach to naive mice for {{variable}} lengths of time to determine the duration of tick attachment required for Powassan (POW) virus transmission to occur. Viral load in engorged larvae detaching from viremic mice and in resulting nymphs was also monitored. Ninety percent of larval ticks acquired POW virus from mice that had been intraperitoneally inoculated with 105 plaque-forming units (PFU). En-gorged larvae contained approximately 10 PFU. Transstadial transmission efficiency was 22 %, resulting in approxi-mately 20 % infection in nymphs that had fed as larvae on viremic mice. Titer increased approximately 100 -fold during molting. Nymphal deer ticks efficiently transmitted POW virus to naive mice after as few as 15 minutes of attachment, suggesting that unlike Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, no grace period exists between tick attachment and POW virus transmission. Pathogens transmitted by ticks frequently require a period of reactivation and/or replication prior to being transmitted from an infected tick to a naive host. This phenomenon is an adaptation by tick-borne agents to the many months that may pass between tick blood meals, 1 and has been well docu-mented for the agents of <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>spotted</b> feve...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundRocky <b>Mountain</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>fever</b> (RMSF) is {{a disease}} that now causes {{significant}} morbidity and mortality on several American Indian reservations in Arizona. Although the disease is treatable, reported RMSF case fatality rates from this region are high (7 %) compared {{to the rest of}} the nation (< 1 %), suggesting a need to identify clinical points for intervention. MethodsThe first 205 cases from this region were reviewed and fatal RMSF cases were compared to nonfatal cases to determine clinical risk factors for fatal outcome. ResultsDoxycycline was initiated significantly later in fatal cases (median, day 7) than nonfatal cases (median, day 3), although both groups of case patients presented for care early (median, day 2). Multiple factors increased the risk of doxycycline delay and fatal outcome, such as early symptoms of nausea and diarrhea, history of alcoholism or chronic lung disease, and abnormal laboratory results such as elevated liver aminotransferases. Rash, history of tick bite, thrombocytopenia, and hyponatremia were often absent at initial presentation. ConclusionsEarlier treatment with doxycycline can decrease morbidity and mortality from RMSF in this region. Recognition of risk factors associated with doxycycline delay and fatal outcome, such as early gastrointestinal symptoms and a history of alcoholism or chronic lung disease, may be useful in guiding early treatment decisions. Healthcare providers should have a low threshold for initiating doxycycline whenever treating febrile or potentially septic patients from tribal lands in Arizona, even if an alternative diagnosis seems more likely and classic findings of RMSF are absent.

40|$|Until {{the year}} 2000, only three Rickettsia species were known in South America: (i) Rickettsia rickettsii, {{transmitted}} by the ticks Amblyomma cajennense, and Amblyomma aureolatum, reported in Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil, {{where it is}} the etiological agent of <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>spotted</b> fever; (ii) Rickettsia prowazekii, transmitted by body lice and causing epidemic typhus in highland areas, mainly in Peru; (iii) Rickettsia typhi, transmitted by fleas and causing endemic typhus in many countries. During this new century, at least seven other rickettsiae were reported in South America: Rickettsia felis infecting fleas and the tick-associated agents Rickettsia parkeri, Rickettsia massiliae, Candidatus ""Rickettsia amblyommii,"" Rickettsia bellii, Rickettsia rhipicephali, and Candidatus ""Rickettsia andeanae. "" Among these other rickettsiae, only R. felis, R. parkeri and R. massiliae are currently recognized as human pathogens. R. rickettsii is a rare agent in nature, infecting : <= 1 % individuals in a few tick populations. Contrastingly, R. parkeri, Candidatus ""R. amblyommii, "" R. rhipicephali, and R. bellii are usually found infecting 10 to 100 % individuals in different tick populations. Despite rickettsiae being transmitted transovarially through tick generations, low infection rates for R. rickettsii are possibly related to pathogenic effect of R. rickettsii for ticks, as shown for A. aureolatum under laboratory conditions. This scenario implies that R. rickettsii needs amplifier vertebrate hosts for its perpetuation in nature, {{in order to create}} new lines of infected ticks (horizontal transmission). In Brazil, capybaras and opossums are the most probable amplifier hosts for R. rickettsii, among A. cajennense ticks, and small rodents for A. aureolatum.

25|$|Strains of Rickettsia rickettsii, {{the disease}} aften of <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>fever</b> {{have been found}} in the rabbit tick.

A Brazilian strain of the Rickettsia rickettsii was also found recently in Rio de Janeiro in ticks found on wild rabbits as well as rabbit ticks in Costa Rica. Since rabbit ticks support the infection of virulent strains of this bacteria, H. leporispalustris contains a role in the maintenance of R. rickettsii in the Americas. H. leporispalustris is currently one of the known vectors that is keeping this bacteria in circulation. Rabbit ticks prefer to not feed on humans so the transmission of this bacteria via rabbit ticks to humans is rare. Also, H. leporispalustris transmits Coxiella burnetii and Francisella tularensis.
