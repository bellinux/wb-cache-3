5|$|A second group, the Foundation for the Pure Spanish Horse or PRE Mundial, {{has begun}} another PRE <b>registry</b> as an {{alternative}} to the ANCCE. This new <b>registry</b> claims that all of their registered horses trace back to the original stud book maintained by the Cria Caballar, which was a branch of the Spanish Ministry of Defense, for 100 years. Thus, the PRE Mundial <b>registry</b> asserts that their <b>registry</b> is the most authentic, purest PRE <b>registry</b> functioning today.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, a breed <b>registry,</b> {{called the}} American Welara Pony <b>Registry,</b> {{was created in}} the US in order to develop and promote the breed. A {{studbook}} also began to be published, and pedigrees of Welaras were collected and preserved. Only Welsh and Arabian blood is allowed for purebreds, and all registered ponies must have at least 1/8 and no more than 7/8 blood from each breed. As of 2005, the <b>registry</b> claimed slightly over 1,500 ponies registered in North America, with around 100 new foals registered annually. Welara Sport Ponies may also be registered – these are ponies at least 50 percent Welara but with blood from other breeds, often the Thoroughbred. The association also registers pureblood Welsh and Arabian foundation stock.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{the park}} sold off {{a large number}} of horses, {{including}} herd stallions, and released several stallions with outside bloodlines into the herds. At this point, brothers Leo and Frank Kuntz began purchasing the horses with the aim of preserving the breed, and founded the Nokota Horse Conservancy in 1999, later beginning a breed <b>registry</b> through the same organization. Later, a second, short-lived, <b>registry</b> was begun by another organization in Minnesota. In 2009, the North Dakota Badlands Horse <b>Registry</b> was created, which registers the slightly different type of horses which have been removed from the park in recent years. Today, the park conducts regular thinning of the herd to keep numbers between 70 and 110, and the excess horses are sold off.|$|E

METHODS: In the framework of the EUROCOURSE project, and to prepare cancer <b>registries</b> for participation in the ERA-net scheme, we launched a survey on the methods used to assess completeness, and also on the timeliness and methods of dissemination of results by <b>registries.</b> We sent the questionnaire to all general <b>registries</b> (GCRs) and specialised <b>registries</b> (SCRs) active in Europe and within the European Network of Cancer <b>Registries</b> (ENCR).

40|$|Background: Large disease <b>registries</b> are the {{preferred}} method to assess long-term treatment safety. If psoriasis <b>registries</b> collaborate in a network, {{their power to}} assess safety is increased. Objective: To identify heterogeneity in psoriasis <b>registries</b> and methodological challenges for synthesising the data they provide. Methods: We surveyed the <b>registries</b> in PSONET and identified and addressed the challenges to collaborative analysis for the network in several round table meetings. Results: Eight out of 10 <b>registries</b> had a prospective comparator cohort with similar disease characteristics but not on biologics. <b>Registries</b> differed in the coding and validation or follow-up of adverse events {{and in the way}} they sampled their population. Fifteen challenges to <b>registries</b> collaborating were identified in the areas of operational governance, structural conduct, bias and analysis. Conclusions: Participation in PSONET, a network of psoriasis <b>registries,</b> helps identify and solve common issues, enhancing the individual <b>registries,</b> and provides larger sets of more powerful safety data in a diverse population. Challenges to interpreting data collectively include heterogeneity in sampling, variable penetration of biologics and compatibility of different datasets. Copyright (c) 2012 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|R

5|$|The Liberian open <b>registry,</b> {{founded in}} 1948, was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State during World War II. Stettinius created a {{corporate}} structure that included The Liberia Corporation, a joint-venture with the government of Liberia. The corporation was structured so that one-fourth of its revenue would go to the Liberian government, another 10% went to fund social programs in Liberia, and the remainder returned to Stettinius' corporation. The Liberian <b>registry</b> was created at a time when Panama's <b>registry</b> was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.|$|E

40|$|Background: Identification of MS <b>registries</b> and {{databases}} {{that are}} currently in use in Europe {{as well as a}} detailed knowledge of their content and structure is important in order to facilitate comprehensive analysis and comparison of data. Methods: National MS <b>registries</b> or databases were identified by literature search, from the results of the MS Barometer 2011 and by asking 33 national MS societies. A standardized questionnaire was developed and sent to the registries' leaders, followed by telephone interviews with them. Results: Twenty <b>registries</b> were identified, with 13 completing the questionnaire and seven being interviewed by telephone. These <b>registries</b> differed widely for objectives, structure, collected data, and for patients and centres included. Despite this heterogeneity, common objectives of the <b>registries</b> were epidemiology (n= 10), long-term therapy outcome (n= 8), healthcare research (n= 9) and support/basis for clinical trials (n= 8). While physician-based outcome measures (EDSS) are used in all <b>registries,</b> data from patients' perspectives were only collected in six <b>registries.</b> Conclusions: The detailed information on a large number of national MS <b>registries</b> in Europe is a prerequisite to facilitating harmonized integration of existing data from MS <b>registries</b> and databases, as well as comprehensive analyses and comparison across European populations...|$|R
