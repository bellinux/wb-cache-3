Leykis discussed the confession on subsequent episodes of his show, urging listeners to phone a toll-free number if they had possibly relevant information, and offering a cash reward for information leading to conviction of the woman for murder. About a month later, former talk show host Geraldo Rivera asked Leykis about the incident on his Geraldo at Large syndicated television program.

The purpose of this analysis was to explore in greater depth themes that emerged in illness narratives of {{a small sample of}} African-American men living with type- 2 diabetes. The primary theme that is the focus of this article is the lived experience of black manhood and masculinity and its intersection with the challenges of diabetes self-management. In-depth interviews with 16 African-American men who had established type- 2 diabetes yielded thematic analyses of four questions: (1) What do you fear most about having diabetes? (2) In what ways have people in your life treated you differently after learning you have diabetes? (3) In what ways has knowing you have diabetes affected the way you see yourself? and (4) What are some <b>reactions</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> tell people you have diabetes? This preliminary study suggests that the requirements of diabetes self-management often run counter to the traditional sex roles and learned behaviors of African-American men, and this can contribute to nonadherence to medications and poor glycemic control. Gender identity is a key cultural factor that influences health-related behaviors, including how men with type- 2 diabetes engage with the healthcare system and manage their diabetes. Understanding African-American men's gender identity is an important component of cultural competency for physicians and can be consequential in patient outcomes...|$|R

This study aimed to take further steps into investigating the mechanism of the resin-gel synthesis based on phase differentiation of titania, in the hope to describe optimal synthetic conditions for desired polymorph production with tailored particle size. Solvent, polymer chain length, heating rate and the use of citric acid has been varied previously. The results obtained suggested that the working theory of the resin-gel synthesis may be incorrect as there was significant phase differentiation based on the solvent used. This work explored the effects of the stoichiometric ratio of PEG to TiCl 4 and the effect of heating rates to clarify the <b>reaction</b> mechanism. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|R

A maximal level of sensitivity to hyperadrenaline injure of thoracic aorta tissues, intermediate level of injure of abdominic aorta and pulmonic arteria, and minimal level of injure of vena cava posterior were discovered. It is discovered that the blocker of calcium channels (nifedipine) cause maximal decrease of the degree of violations of water-electrolytic and calcium metabolism in blood vessel wall in progress of the hyperadrenaline arteriosclerosis, antioxidant (vitamin E) has moderate effect, and the complex former (diphosphonic acid) - has minimal effect in this respect. The obtained results testify that quite direct and tight interrelations between lipid and calcium mechanisms of injure of blood vessel tissues exist in progress of the hyperadrenaline arteriosclerosis; and also that intracellular free radical processes and calcium-dependent reactions cause much greater violations of water-electrolytic and calcium metabolism in vessel wall tissues than extracellular <b>reactions</b> do. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|R
