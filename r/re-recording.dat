5|$|Moodu Pani marked A. R. Rahman's first {{association}} with Ilaiyaraaja; the former (then known by his birth name Dilip) {{worked as a}} keyboardist in the film. During the <b>re-recording</b> of Moodu Pani soundtrack and score, Ilaiyaraaja fired his original keyboardist, due to the person's drinking behaviour. At that time, another one of his troupe members asked Ilaiyaraaja to meet a boy named Dilip, {{who knew how to}} play the keyboard. Ilaiyaraaja agreed and sent for Dilip, whom he instructed regarding the notes and tune he had to play. Dilip, under Ilaiyaraaja's supervision, successfully completed the <b>re-recording</b> process.|$|E

5|$|Boult's {{recordings}} {{fall into}} three main periods. In the first, from 1920 {{to the end}} of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for HMV. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand by the major labels, and although he made a substantial number of discs for Decca, he recorded mostly for smaller labels, chiefly Pye Nixa. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, <b>re-recording</b> much of his key repertoire in stereo. He also added many works to his discography that he had not recorded before.|$|E

5|$|Lambert {{proved to}} be unable to mix the track, and a fresh attempt at {{recording}} was made {{at the start of}} April at Mick Jagger's house, Stargroves, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Glyn Johns was invited to help with production, and he decided to re-use the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the <b>re-recording</b> of the part in New York was felt to be inferior to the original. Keith Moon had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played electric guitar and bass.|$|E
5|$|Sukumar's usual composer, Devi Sri Prasad, {{was chosen}} for the film's soundtrack and score in Prasad's first Mahesh film.

Ravikumar informed Rahman that he had already discussed a release date with the press, and that Rahman would be blamed for any delay. To make the deadline, Rahman did a live <b>re-recording</b> of both the soundtrack and score to finish them on time.|$|E
5|$|According to Rajamouli, {{the film}} unit {{consulted}} a 3D {{video of the}} storyboard before shooting a scene each day. After the filming of each scene was completed, the editing and <b>re-recording</b> procedures were done with simple greyscale animation. An Arri Alexa camera, a prime lens, and Scorpio and Strada cranes {{were used for the}} principal photography, while a probe lens and high-intensity lighting were used for the macro photography. Senthil Kumar had to use a special lens with a minimum f-stop of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used GoPro cameras as they were the smallest possible ones that offered close to professional resolution. Phantom Cam was used to film extreme slow motion sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second.|$|E
5|$|And Their Name Was Treason is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band A Day to Remember, {{released}} on May 10, 2005 through Indianola Records.

The band toured in the United States to help promote the album. The album has since sold over 10,000 copies. A re-recorded version of the album, titled Old Record, was released in October 2008 by Victory. The band members later admitted that {{they were forced to}} do the <b>re-recording</b> at the request of label owner Tony Brummel. The reissue charted at number 16 on the Heatseekers Album Chart in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Despite initial {{difficulties}} {{in finding a}} producer willing {{to take charge of}} the debut album of a newly signed band, Don Gilmore ultimately agreed to head up the project, with Andy Wallace hired as the mixer. Recording sessions, which mostly involved <b>re-recording</b> the songs off the demo tape, began at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California in early 2000 and lasted four weeks. Shinoda's rapping sections in most of the songs were significantly altered from the original, while most choruses remained largely unchanged. Due to the absence of Dave Farrell and Kyle Christener, {{who took part in the}} 1999 extended play, the band hired Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck as stand-in bassists; Delson also played bass throughout most of the album. The Dust Brothers provided additional beats for the track “With You”.|$|E
5|$|Editing began {{later that}} day, {{with the first}} rough cut {{completed}} on March 18. A version was screened on March 30 for Moore, Peter Lauritson, Dan Curry, J. P. Farrell and Dawn Velazquez to better inform the post-production optical effects which were under production at the time. Cast audio <b>re-recording</b> took place from April 9 onwards depending on the individual actor's availability, supervised by Velazquez. Composer Dennis McCarthy first saw a cut of the episode on April 21. He worked with Velazquez and music editor Gerry Sackman to develop some musical cues which could recur throughout the episode as well as working out what type of work {{will need to be}} completed. For example, although he couldn't see the visual effects at the time as they were not yet complete, Velazquez explained what they should look like.|$|E
5|$|Hermética was a thrash metal band, drawing {{influences}} from Motörhead, Megadeth, and Black Sabbath. Their {{music was}} composed primarily by bassist Ricardo Iorio with occasional input from guitarist Antonio Romano, who composed the guitar solos. The band used a counterpoint between the singing styles {{of their two}} vocalists; lead singer Claudio O'Connor's vocals were high pitched, while Iorio had a raucous style of singing. Iorio sang segments of some songs but rarely performed songs in their entirety. Iorio thought that his singing style in Hermética was inferior to his later work with Almafuerte because the songs had not been composed specifically for him. The success of Hermética's second studio album Ácido Argentino allowed the band to increase the budget {{for the production of}} its follow-up, Víctimas del Vaciamiento. Iorio proposed <b>re-recording</b> the band's first album with drummer Claudio Strunz and a higher budget, but the label refused his proposal.|$|E
