5|$|While {{the team}} {{did not see}} the postseason for the {{remainder}} of the decade, Smith continued to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> All-Star appearances and Gold Gloves. Combined with the attention he received from his contract, Smith continued to be a national figure. Known as a savvy dresser, he made the April 1988 cover of GQ magazine. Smith was witness to change within the Cardinal organization when owner Gussie Busch died in 1989 and Herzog quit as manager during the 1990 season.|$|E
5|$|Overall, John II Komnenos {{left the}} empire {{a great deal}} better off than he had found it. Substantial territories had been recovered, and his successes against the invading Petchenegs, Serbs and Seljuk Turks, along with his {{attempts}} to establish Byzantine suzerainty over the Crusader States in Antioch and Edessa, did much to restore the reputation of his empire. His careful, methodical approach to warfare had protected the empire from the risk of sudden defeats, while his determination and skill had allowed him to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> {{a long list of}} successful sieges and assaults against enemy strongholds. By the time of his death, he had earned near universal respect, even from the Crusaders, for his courage, dedication and piety. His early death meant his work went unfinished; historian Zoe Oldenbourg speculates that his last campaign might well have resulted in real gains for Byzantium and the Christian cause.|$|E

25|$|Gagné {{used this}} deadly {{combination}} of pitches to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> strikeouts {{at a very}} high rate. In his Cy Young-winning season of 2003, he had 100 more strikeouts (137) than hits he allowed (37). This produced a strikeout-to-hit ratio of 3.7, a single-season record for relief pitchers with 50 innings. He also has the highest percentage of swinging strikes as a percent of his total pitches (18.5%) among all pitchers since the 2002 season. He also owns the highest percentage of swinging strikes on pitches inside the strike zone.|$|E
25|$|The Nets {{left him}} {{unprotected}} during the 1995 expansion draft, but Dare was not selected {{by either the}} Toronto Raptors or the Vancouver Grizzlies. In his first full season (1995–96), in which he played a personal best 58 out of 82 games, he turned the ball over 72 times while registering no assists, holding the dubious NBA record for most games played in a season, 58, without recording an assist. During his four-year career, he would <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> {{a total of four}} assists accompanied by 96 turnovers, while averaging 2.1 points, 2.6 rebounds, and less than 0.1 assists per game.|$|E

25|$|Trent Bridge {{was lucky}} to escape most of the rain that ravaged the sixth round of the Championship, as over 100 overs was {{possible}} {{on the first day}} in which Kent could <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> 301 runs in their first innings, after being put in to bat by Nottinghamshire's captain Stephen Fleming. Kent's David Fulton and Robert Key paired up to score 81 for the first wicket, but former Yorkshire bowler Ryan Sidebottom came back to remove the three top order batsmen. Sidebottom finished with his five for 61, while the Irish wicket-keeper Niall O'Brien top-scored with 64 on season debut for Kent, taking over from Geraint Jones who had been called up to play Tests for England.|$|E
25|$|After the {{starting}} bell rang at 3:15 pm, the Chicagos managed to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> a 3-0 {{lead in the}} top of the first inning with one hit, two walks, two errors, and a sacrifice fly. The Browns narrowed the margin with a run in the second inning on some astute base running by Bill Gleason, with another run notched in the third inning when Tip O'Neill tripled home a runner. The tide turned decisively in the fifth inning when starting pitcher John Clarkson, pitching a second consecutive game, began to run out of gas, giving up a two-run single to center by Gleason, followed by an RBI single by Browns first baseman Charlie Comiskey.|$|E
25|$|Wilkinson {{played for}} England in matches against Australia, the United States and Canada as the 1999 Rugby World Cup approached. He made his Rugby World Cup debut against Italy, scoring one try, {{converting}} another six and landing five penalty goals to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> 32individualpoints in the 67–7 win. After playing another pool {{game against the}} All Blacks, which England lost 30–16, he was rested against Tonga, a match won by England 101–10. Following the quarter-final playoff win against Fiji, Wilkinson was relegated to the bench for the quarter-final against South Africa. England lost the match by 44–21 and exited the tournament. Clive Woodward refused to expand on his selection choice at the time, and following the match some commentators blamed the head coach's lack of consistency in team selection as harming England's World Cup bid.|$|E

25|$|Bowman {{realizes that}} his life has been irrevocably changed. He makes Blair record a video taped {{confession}} of his illegal actions, then kills Blair and disposes of all forensic evidence of the agents' presence. Afterwards, he hunts down and kills Blair's remaining subordinates. Bowman and his closest friends begin to systematically kill ATF agents around the nation – whom Bowman views as supporting the infringement of citizen's constitutional rights, and abusing government powers – as well as politicians who had supported unconstitutional gun control legislation. Simultaneously Bowman releases the video tape of Blair to CNN, which claims that Blair and his companions have {{had a change of}} heart, realize what they are doing is wrong, and are now dedicated to killing other ATF agents. Amidst the national search for Blair and company, Bowman continues to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> the body count.|$|E
25|$|Muster {{continued}} to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> clay-court victories in 1996. He won seven tournaments, {{six of them}} titles he successfully defended after winning them the year before. These 1996 tournament victories included his third Monte Carlo title, where he defeated clay court specialist Albert Costa in the final, and his third Italian Open title, defeating Richard Krajicek in the final. Muster's win-loss record on clay in 1996 was an impressive 46–3. This made his 1995–96 record on the surface 111–5, which was, at the time, the best two-year clay-court record since the open era began in 1968. Despite Muster's continued dominance on clay-courts in 1996, he was upset in the Round of 16 at the 1996 French Open, losing to eventual finalist Michael Stich. In July 1996, in {{the final of the}} 1996 Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, Muster defeated the French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov in three straight sets.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} home {{series against}} India saw Cook continue his fine Test form despite England not winning a Test. He {{was the third}} highest scoring Englishman {{with an average of}} 37. In the first Test, Cook made scores of 36 and 17 as the match ended in a draw. During {{the first day of the}} second Test at Trent Bridge, Cook became the youngest English player to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> 1,500 Test runs eclipsing the record held by David Gower. In the first innings of the third Test, Cook made his biggest score of the series, 61 and followed this up with 43 in the second innings to help England secure a draw. Cook played in six of the seven ensuing one-day matches, scoring his maiden ODI century in the first match alongside Ian Bell's 126 not out guiding England to a 104 win victory that propped up England's first one-day series victory since 2005. After two ducks, Cook was dropped in the final, decisive match.|$|E

25|$|Despite all the changes, O'Neal {{spearheaded the}} Pacers to a league-best 61–21 {{record in the}} 2003–04 season. He {{remained}} a constant double-double threat, averaging 20.1 points and 10.0 rebounds a game in the regular season. He also continued to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> individual honors, making his third All-Star trip and being named to the All-NBA Second Team. Artest was instrumental to the team's success too as he enjoyed a breakthrough season, netting his first All-Star berth {{as well as the}} NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. In the playoffs, Indiana gained revenge from the preceding season by sweeping Boston in the first round, before defeating the Miami Heat in the next. That sent them back to the Eastern Conference Finals for the sixth time in 11 years, where they were disposed of by eventual NBA champions Detroit Pistons. In the series-deciding Game 6, O'Neal endured a sprained knee and managed to tally 20 points and 10 rebounds, but Richard Hamilton's inspired play ensured a close victory for the Pistons.|$|E
25|$|Ambrose {{announced}} on 17 August 2010 that {{he signed a}} multi-year deal with Richard Petty Motorsports to drive the #9 Stanley/DeWalt Power Tools Ford Fusion. He finished 37th in his first race with the team at the Daytona 500, after being crashed out of contention in a 15 car wreck in turn 3 on lap 29. He did finish the race. He went on to have an impressive race at Phoenix running in the top 10 {{for most of the}} day. In August, Ambrose won the rain delayed Heluva Good! Sour Cream Dips at The Glen on 15 August to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> his first career Sprint Cup Series win by passing Brad Keselowski and Kyle Busch with two laps to go. Ambrose further vindicated his road course abilities, backing up under a week later by taking an emotional victory at Montreal in the Nationwide Series, during the NAPA Auto Parts 200. The 2011 season continued to be his career best as he recorded 5 top 5 and 12 top 10 finishes. Ambrose finished the 2011 season 19th in the final point standings.|$|E
25|$|The early 1980s saw the Sooners {{begin to}} slip under Switzer. They lost four games each in 1981, 1982, and 1983. It {{was the first}} time they lost four games in a season since 1970 under Coach Fairbanks. However, eight of those twelve losses came to the likes of USC, Texas, Nebraska and Ohio State. They began to turn things around in 1984 when they went 9–2–1 and {{finished}} the season at #6. The 1984 team featured Buster Rhymes at wide receiver, Spencer Tillman at running back and Tony Casillas at defensive tackle. Over the next three years, the team continued to grow and went 11–1 each year (with all three losses coming to Miami), including a national championship in 1985 (they finished ranked number three in 1986 and 1987). Many great Sooner athletes came through the program during these years, including two-time Butkus Award winner Brian Bosworth, tight end Keith Jackson and quarterback Jamelle Holieway. While Switzer was not able to match Wilkinson's unimaginable string of 13consecutive conference championships, he was able to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> 12 of his own during his career at Oklahoma.|$|E

25|$|Yorktown fueled and {{provisioned}} at Ulithi until 30 December 1944, {{at which}} time she returned to sea to join TF 38 on strikes at targets in Formosa and the Philippines {{in support of the}} landings at Lingayen. The carriers began with raids on airfields on 3 January on the island of Formosa and continued with various targets for the next week. On 10 January, Yorktown and the rest of TF 38 entered the South China Sea via Bashi Channel to begin a series of raids on Japan's inner defenses. On 12 January, her planes visited the vicinity of Saigon and Tourane (now named Da Nang) Bay, Indochina, in hopes of catching major units of the Japanese fleet. Though foiled in their primary desire, TF 38 aviators still managed to <b>rack</b> <b>up</b> an exceptional score – 44 enemy ships, of which 15 were combatants. On 15 January, raids were launched on Formosa and Canton in China. The following day, her aviators struck at Canton again and also went to Hong Kong. On 20 January, she exited the South China Sea with TF 38 via Balintang Channel. She participated in a raid on Formosa on 21 January and another on Okinawa on 22 January before clearing the area for Ulithi. On the morning of 26 January, she re-entered Ulithi lagoon with TF 38.|$|E
