5|$|Following in Jacobsen's footsteps, Denmark {{had some}} {{outstanding}} successes in 20th-century architecture. Most notably, Jørn Utzon's iconic Sydney Opera House {{earned him the}} distinction of becoming only the second person to have his work recognized as a World Heritage Site while still alive. His Bagsværd Church (1968–76) in Copenhagen has been considered an outstanding example of critical <b>regionalism,</b> for the synthesis created between universal civilisation and regional culture.|$|E
5|$|Several Aleppan dignitaries {{supported}} Emir Faisal and in late October 1918, {{following the}} Sharifian army's entry into Aleppo, {{a branch of}} the Arab Club was founded in the city. The Arab Club's ideology was a mix of Arab nationalism and Aleppine <b>regionalism.</b> It promoted the concept of Syrian national unity, and served as a political support base for Emir Faisal. Among the Arab Club's founders were Ibrahim Hananu, the president of Aleppo Vilayet's presidential council, Rashid al-Tali'a, governor of Aleppo Vilayet, Najib Bani Zadih, a wealthy Aleppine merchant, Abd al-Rahman al-Kayyali, an Aleppine physician and Shaykh Mas'ud al-Kawakibi, one of the city's leading Muslim scholars.|$|E
5|$|The early 1940s was of {{particular}} importance in American art as American scene painting (<b>Regionalism)</b> {{came to be seen}} as an inadequate mode of artistic expression in a tumultuous time. In 1942, Peggy Guggenheim, who had fled Europe with her husband, Surrealist artist Max Ernst, opened her gallery Art of This Century, showing European and promising American avant-garde artists. Jackson Pollock had his first one-man show there in 1943 and, in 1945, Guggenheim showed Mark Rothko.|$|E

5|$|The empire's legacy {{includes}} many monuments spread over South India, {{the best known}} of which is the group at Hampi. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in Hindu temples construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended <b>regionalism</b> by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor.|$|E
5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that <b>regionalism</b> will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another.|$|E
5|$|The {{program had}} some loose ends that {{manifested}} themselves later. Many refugees were not economically integrated and lived from government handouts. Critics {{noted that the}} refugees had become a special interest group that fostered resentment. The COMIGAL officials often decided not to split up refugees belonging to the same village, hoping to maintain social continuity. In some cases, Catholic priests refused to obey government directives to settle in certain areas. Many of the refugees also refused to relocate from the camps {{on the outskirts of}} the capital, wanting to live an urban lifestyle, and objecting to Diem's desire that they help developed inhospitable frontier territory where disease was more common and the economy less developed. On occasions, the reluctance to disperse away from Saigon resulted in protests outside Diem's residence. Many Catholic villages were effectively transplanted into southern territory. This was efficient in the short run but meant that they would never assimilate into southern society. They had little contact with the Buddhist majority and often held them in contempt, sometimes flying the Vatican flag instead of the national flag. Peter Hansen, an Australian Catholic priest and academic scholar of religion, has added that tensions between northern and southern Catholics were also present, due to issues of <b>regionalism</b> and local traditions. Hansen also said that northern Catholics took a more defensive attitude towards other religions than their southern co-religionists, and were more likely to see non-Catholics as a threat. He further noted that northern Catholics had a more theocratic outlook in that they were more willing to listen to the advice of priests on a wide range of issues, not only spiritual and ecclesiastical matters. These differences and the sense of segregation persist to the current day.|$|E

40|$|As we know, speech {{perception}} and production are {{strongly influenced by}} sign-specific "socio-pragmatic indexicality" (cf. Purschke 2014), that is, by the mental conceptions (of meaning, style etc.) people associate with individual linguistic features. I assume that, in German-speaking areas, the "subjective (notion of the) dialectality" of a non-standard feature represents a basic form of socio-pragmatic indexicality and is closely connected to language variation and change, in that the more <b>regionalisms</b> are regarded as non-standard features, the more they vary synchronically and diachronically. Following Purschke (2014), I define the subjective dialectality of <b>regionalisms</b> as being based on their feature-specific "salience" and "pertinence", that is, on both the pure awareness and further evaluation of such features as non-standard variants. A discussion of theoretical issues {{is followed by the}} presentation of empirical data from a speech perception study (in the style of Herrgen/Schmidt 1985). Scale-based judgments by Northern, Central and Southern German listeners provide evidence about the subjective dialectality of 15 Bavarian <b>regionalisms.</b> They further reveal how subjective dialectality is related to listeners' origins and regional language competence. Comparing the subjective data with two Bavarian speakers' language use reveals the relation between subjective dialectality and synchronic variation in the analysed <b>regionalisms...</b>|$|R

25|$|His rise {{to power}} {{occurred}} {{during a period of}} intense <b>regionalism</b> in Dahomey. They were spurred by the historical resentment shared by members of the former kingdoms of Abomey, Porto Novo, and disorganised tribes from the north. Its result was the creation of three de facto tribal zones: the north, southeast, and southwest. This <b>regionalism</b> permeated into the armed forces, compounded by divisions of officers into cliques based on education. Hachème was a member of what Decalo called the Abomey clique, which also included prominent officers Philippe Aho, Benoit Sinzogan, and Benoit Adandejan.|$|E

25|$|Almost every Pakistani {{state has}} a {{regional}} party devoted solely {{to the culture of}} the native people. Unlike the Awami National party and the Balochistan national party, these mostly cannot be called nationalist, as they use <b>regionalism</b> as a strategy to garner votes, building on the frustration of common people with official status and the centralization of government institutions in Pakistan. However, the recent elections as well as history have shown that such ethnic nationalist parties rarely win more than 1% of the popular vote, with the overwhelming majority of votes going to large and established political parties that pursue a national agenda as opposed to <b>regionalism.</b>|$|E
25|$|There was {{political}} stability from the 1940s {{to the early}} 1970s; however, <b>regionalism</b> regained with people thinking of themselves as from their local city or municipality over the state. This <b>regionalism</b> impeded the economy as local authorities restrained outside goods. For this reason, construction of highways and communications were pushed to help with economic development. Most of the work was done around Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Tapachula. This included the Sureste railroad connecting northern municipalities such as Pichucalco, Salto de Agua, Palenque, Catazajá and La Libertad. The Cristobal Colon highway linked Tuxtla to the Guatemalan border. Other highways included El Escopetazo to Pichucalco, a highway between San Cristóbal and Palenque with branches to Cuxtepeques and LaFrailesca. This helped to integrate the state's economy, but it also permitted the political rise of communal land owners called ejidatarios.|$|E

40|$|The article {{raises the}} problem of {{identifying}} regional and dialect words in the Russian language of the XVIII century. In this regard, the principles and methods for establishing geographically limited lexical means of the historical period are studied. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the method of reconstruction of the original state of the secondary dialect, which was deeply developed by V. V. Palagina. Considering the provisions of theTomskscientist {{and a number of other}} researchers the author offers his own interpretation of some methods in identifying regional words in colloquial idioms, functioning in the territory of a late settlement. The article emphasizes the importance of respecting the research principle of historicism, i. e. regularly taking into account vocabulary’s historical dynamics, which determines the change of status of the all-Russian as well as regional words. The nature of the secondary dialectisms in the dialects ofEastern Siberiais described more in detail. The colloquial vocabulary, which is presented in the Transbaikalian’s written business language of the XVIII-th c., is regarded due to application of principles of the complex identification of regional and dialect words. It was revealed that it contains genetically heterogeneous groups of <b>regionalisms.</b> In this connection, the lexical-semantic groups of words are determined, among which two types of <b>regionalisms</b> exist: a) <b>regionalisms</b> of northern Russian origin and b) <b>regionalisms</b> - local (autochthonous) loan words. </p...|$|R
