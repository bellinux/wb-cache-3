2500|$|Yellowcard {{announced}} on May 15 via Myspace {{that the first}} single from Paper Walls would be [...] "Light Up the Sky". This song was released to iTunes and radio on June 5. Soon after its <b>release,</b> <b>Paper</b> Walls became the second most popular album on iTunes and the most popular album in the alternative section. On July 9, Yellowcard released Paper Walls on the group's Myspace music player to give fans {{a taste of what}} was to come on the new album. Paper Walls was released in the U.S. on July 17 (July 16 on iTunes) in an additional CD/DVD format, as Lights and Sounds was the previous year. The DVD contains exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of the band, an extensive photo gallery and two additional live bonus tracks. In June 2007, Yellowcard was voted to do AOL Sessions Under Cover. It was released on July 20 and featured two songs from Paper Walls. The album debuted at No. 13 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 40,000 copies in its first week.|$|E

50|$|A variant {{was to use}} a {{slightly}} roughened steel sheet atop the cover sheet, producing a laminate with a matte surface. A similar effect can be achieved using various types of <b>release</b> <b>paper</b> between the steel press plate and the decorative melamine surface.Some users considered this more attractive than the gleaming, absolutely flat surface created by the highly polished stainless steel separators. After being removed from the press, the individual laminates were sanded on the phenolic kraft side to a uniform thickness. This sanding operation also increased the back surface area so the more secure bonding to a substrate such as a kitchen counter could be achieved.|$|E

James would later rejoin the band in July 2006 after finishing his studies, and after Yellowcard's 2007 <b>release</b> <b>Paper</b> Walls, Pete Mosely would also return. He describes the current situation of the band as [...] "We just toned it down and it's more of just a hobby for us".

50|$|Impact {{printers}} create noise {{when the}} pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures {{may have to}} be used in quiet environments. They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to non-impact printers. While they support fanfold paper with tractor holes well, single-sheet paper {{may have to be}} wound in and aligned by hand, which is relatively time-consuming, or a sheet feeder may be utilized which can have a lower paper feed reliability. When printing labels on <b>release</b> <b>paper,</b> they are prone to paper jams when a print wire snags {{the leading edge of the}} label while printing at its very edge. For text-only labels (e.g. mailing labels), a daisy wheel printer or band printer may offer better print quality and a lower risk of damaging the paper.|$|E

In August, they played a show in the studio in Los Angeles that was streamed on their MySpace page, while taking song requests directly from fans via the MySpace Instant Messenger. There have also been several other promotional attempts by the band in the month following the album's release.

50|$|Decorative {{laminates}} {{were made}} by impregnating large sheets of kraft paper with phenolic resin, which was then partially cured (B-staged by passing through a long drying oven) and cut to sheet lengths at the oven exit. The dry treated sheets were stiff and somewhat brittle. A decorative sheet (solid colored, or wood-grained, or patterned), impregnated with melamine resin and B-staged and cut to length {{in a similar manner}} to the phenolic core sheets, was laid on a polished stainless steel press plate. Then several plies or layers of kraft paper impregnated with a phenolic resin were placed on top of the decorative layer. The number of plies of kraft used yielded products of varying thickness depending upon end-use requirements. Next, a sheet of <b>release</b> <b>paper</b> that would not bond to the phenolic resin was placed on top of the phenolic kraft and following this a mirror image build-up of the assembly already on the press plate. Finally, another polished stainless steel press plate was placed on top of the pack assembly. On {{the other side of this}} plate another similar assembly was built until there were several laminates in one press pack to go into a single opening in the hydraulic press. The huge hydraulic presses, perhaps 5 feet by 12 feet, had many heated openings thus many laminates could be produced in a single press cycle of about one hour duration. Great pressure (in excess of 1000 psi and heat to 150 degrees Celsius) were applied to each press pack. The B-staged melamine and phenolic resins first flowed to bond the interlaminar plies together, then the plastic resins thermoset to provide a very durable product that could tolerate much heat and abrasion.|$|E

40|$|<b>Release</b> <b>paper</b> is {{a special}} paper grade with one or both sides coated with non-sticking materials. Silicone is {{currently}} the only material used to produce <b>release</b> <b>paper</b> at the industrial level. Its remarkable properties and availability ensure product quality and sustainability of the industrial production. Meanwhile, the stability of silicone polymers raises serious environmental problems in terms of paper substrate recyclability. Studies are currently under way to evaluate the ability of phosphate esters as {{a new class of}} compounds capable of developing non-adhesive surface properties. This paper presents initial attempts to coat the paper with phosphate esters and to assess phosphate ester / fibrous substrate and phosphate ester / adhesive interactions. The results show that this class of compounds exhibits non-adhesive properties and, when coated on paper under certain conditions, can lead to a non-sticking surface. Despite {{the fact that there is}} a long way to achieve ester anchoring to surface fibers and to control the peeling force from an adhesive tape, preliminary results are encouraging...|$|E
40|$|T his process {{consists}} of applying a 0. 005 inch clear plastisol top coat to a textured or smooth surfaced <b>release</b> <b>paper.</b> The plastisol is subse-quently gelled {{and can be}} printed at this stage. Gelation can be obtained at temperatures from 250 ’ F to 320 ’ F. The plastisol foam layer is coated directly onto the clear top coat and passed through an infrared or gas fired oven to gel the foam. This step is taken to avoid strikethrough of the foam plastisol when the fabric is laminated (1) to the foam. The fabric is coated with {{a thin layer of}} acrylic latex adhesive and is bonded to the warm gelled foam in the nip of a chromed steel and rubber back-up roll. The final &dquo;sandwich&dquo; laminate is passed through a tunnel oven and is expanded. The foamed laminate is then stripped from the <b>release</b> <b>paper</b> and can be embossed mechanically, if desired. The resultant product may vary from 0. 020 inches to 0. 150 inches in thickness depend-ing upon the time and temperature of expansion and the blow ratio of the foam composition.
