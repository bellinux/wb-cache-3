500|$|Early in 2013, the European Food Safety Authority {{issued a}} {{declaration}} that three specific neonicotinoid pesticides pose an acute risk to honey bees, and the European Commission (EC) proposed a two-year ban on them. David Goulson, who led {{one of the}} key 2012 studies at the University of Stirling, said the decision [...] "begs the question {{of what was going on}} when these chemicals were first approved." [...] The chemical manufacturer Bayer said it was [...] "ready to work with" [...] the EC and member states. [...] In April 2013, the European Union voted for a two-year restriction on neonicotinoid insecticides. [...] The ban will restrict the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam for use on crops that are attractive to bees. Eight nations voted against the motion, including the British government, which [...] argued that the science was incomplete. The ban can be seen as an application of the [...] "precautionary principle", established at the 1992 <b>Rio</b> <b>Conference</b> on the Environment and Development, which advocates that [...] "lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation." ...|$|E

40|$|Since the Stockholm and <b>Rio</b> <b>Conferences</b> (1972 e 1992), it {{is evident}} the effort of {{environmental}} law in promoting sustainable development. But in the complex scenario of climate change, that imposes {{a profound impact on}} human life and the entire biosphere, all measures that could help address its effects are essentials. In that period, disaster and energy law has also emerged to face similar challenges: risk management; prevention and compensation; access of vulnerable groups to natural resources and services; political resistance to create and execute sustainable policies and, above all, climate mitigation and adaptation. As those fields are closer, what lessons environmental law and governance could exchange with disaster and energy law? Based on comparative studies that recognize the need for a coordinated legal approach, from theoretical/practical perspective, this paper aims to analyze the synergy that can be explored from those linkages...|$|R

50|$|For {{conferences}} {{such as the}} WSSD (World Summit {{on sustainable}} Development), much of the media attention it received was focused on its failures rather than what it had achieved.
