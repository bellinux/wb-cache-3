5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the PW1500G mount generates less {{strain on}} the turbine <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> than the A320neo's PW1100G, it doesn't suffer from {{start-up}} and bearing problems but still from premature combustor degradation. After 28,000 engine hours in 14 in-service aircraft with a powerplant dispatch reliability of 99.9%, Swiss replaced an engine pair in May 2017 after 2,400 hr while AirBaltic replaced another one in June. An updated combustor liner with a 6,000-8,000 hr limit has been developed and a third generation for 2018 will raise it to 20,000 hr in benign environments.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 1983, Bristow Helicopters AS332L Super Puma (G-TIGD) {{crashed on}} landing at Aberdeen. During the {{approach}} to Aberdeen from the North Hutton platform, a loud bang was heard, followed by severe vibration. A PAN call was made to ATC by the crew. Shortly before landing control was lost and the helicopter struck the runway heavily on its side. 10 of 16 passengers received serious injuries. A tail boom panel had become detached in flight and damaged all five tail rotor blades. The resulting imbalance to the tail <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> led to the separation of this unit and subsequent loss of control.|$|E

50|$|The Bell XV-3 (Bell 200) is an American {{tiltrotor}} aircraft {{developed by}} Bell Helicopter for a joint research program between the United States Air Force and the United States Army {{in order to}} explore convertiplane technologies. The XV-3 featured an engine mounted in the fuselage with driveshafts transferring power to two-bladed <b>rotor</b> <b>assemblies</b> mounted on the wingtips. The wingtip <b>rotor</b> <b>assemblies</b> were mounted to tilt 90 degrees from vertical to horizontal, designed to allow the XV-3 to take off and land like a helicopter but fly at faster airspeeds, similar to a conventional fixed-wing aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The GP-B gyro {{consists}} of a nearly-perfect spherical rotating mass made of fused quartz, which provides a dielectric support for {{a thin layer of}} niobium superconducting material. To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings, the <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 RPM, the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered, the extreme rotational symmetry, lack of friction, and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.|$|E
25|$|After {{the broken}} {{transmission}} from the SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team, {{the position and}} situation of the SEALs became unknown. Members of SEAL Team 10, U.S. Marines, and aviators of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment were prepared to dispatch a quick reaction force, but command for launch from higher special operations headquarters was delayed {{for a number of}} hours. A quick reaction force finally launched, consisting of two MH-47 Special Operations Aircraft of the 160th, two UH-60 conventional Army aviation Black Hawk helicopters, and two AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The two MH-47s took the lead. Upon reaching Sawtalo Sar, the two MH-47s received small arms fire. During an attempt to insert SEALs who were riding in one of the MH-47 helicopters, one of Ahmad Shah's men fired an RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade, which struck the transmission below the rear <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly,</b> causing the aircraft to immediately plummet to the ground, killing all eight 160th Army Special Operations Aviators and crew, and all eight Navy SEALs who were passengers. Both commanders of the 160th, Ground commander LCDR Erik S. Kristensen, of SEAL Team 10, and aviation element commander Major Stephen C. Reich, were killed in the shootdown. Command and control (C2) at this point was lost, and neither visual nor radio contact could be established with the SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team. At this point, which was late in the afternoon, storm clouds were moving in over the region. The aircraft returned to their respective bases, and a massive search began, at first from the ground, and then with aviation assets.|$|E
500|$|Analysis of {{the cockpit}} area found there was bird residue and {{feathers}} on the windshield and center post. The remains of 15cowbirds were found within [...] {{of the end of}} Runway 20L. These birds, the NTSB found, had collided with the aircraft structure. Examination of the two engines found evidence of foreign objects, which consisted of minute fragments of feathers. The objects had blocked cooling ports, and had damaged the <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> inside the engine. It was found the left engine had encountered 14 separate bird strikes and the right engine had encountered five. When the birds entered the engine, they caused the compressors to stall; these were the two loud bangs the witnesses heard as the aircraft took off. As the aircraft passed over the perimeter fence, the left engine flamed out, and the trail of smoke was unburned fuel passing through the hot combustion and turbine sections. Investigators determined it was possible the flight crew had managed to restart the left engine.|$|E

2500|$|Vertical-axis wind {{turbines}} (or VAWTs) have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically. One {{advantage of this}} arrangement is that the turbine {{does not need to}} be pointed into the wind to be effective, which is an advantage on a site where the wind direction is highly variable. It is also an advantage when the turbine is integrated into a building because it is inherently less steerable. [...] Also, the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground, using a direct drive from the <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly</b> to the ground-based gearbox, improving accessibility for maintenance.

50|$|For {{helicopters}} with contra-rotating rotors‚Äîalso {{known as}} Coaxial mounted‚Äîone {{over the other}} on the same rotor shaft (Like a Kamov KA-50), helicopter control requires interaction between the two rotors. Howevererent rotor masts (Like a Boeing CH-47 Chinook) uses differential collective pitch to change the pitch attitude of the aircraft. To pitch nose down and accelerate forward, the pilot decreases collective pitch on the front rotor and increases collective pitch on the rear rotor proportionally. Conversely, the synchropter and transverse-mounted rotor counter rotating rotorcraft have two large horizontal <b>rotor</b> <b>assemblies</b> mounted side by side, (like a Bell/Boeing V-22 tilt rotor) helicopters use differential collective pitch to affect the roll of the aircraft. All of these configurations use differential cyclic pitch to control movement about the yaw axis, tilting the rotors in opposite directions to cause the aircraft to spin {{in the direction of the}} tilted rotors.|$|R

2500|$|At 11:53, as the {{helicopter}} approached Sotra {{off the coast}} of Bergen, several witnesses observed the flight, stating that nothing was out of the ordinary until the sound suddenly changed and {{the helicopter}} started to sway.

With all control lost, it crashed on the islet of Skitholmen between the islands of Tur√∏y and Toft√∏y at 11:54:35 local time and exploded on impact. Most of the wreckage then slid off the islet into the sea. A video recording of the detached main rotors spinning to earth was made shortly afterwards.

2500|$|On 2 June 2016, {{following}} {{the crash of}} an H225 in Norway which revealed a potential safety issue with the main <b>rotor</b> <b>assembly,</b> the EASA issued an emergency airworthiness directive that grounded the H225 fleet; by July 2016, 80 per cent of the worldwide fleet had been grounded as a result, while some operators such as the French military continued to operate its fleet. In October 2016, the grounding order by the EASA was lifted; some countries, including the United Kingdom and Norway, chose to maintain operational restrictions for the type. [...] Norwegian operator Statoil, who had contracted the CHC H225 which crashed, maintained it will not return to using the helicopter even if restrictions are lifted. [...] The company has instead relied on the Sikorsky S-92 to meet its needs since the crash.

50|$|A {{tiltrotor}} is {{an aircraft}} which generates lift and propulsion {{by way of}} one or more powered rotors (sometimes called proprotors) mounted on rotating engine pods or nacelles usually at the ends of a fixed wing or an engine mounted in the fuselage with drive shafts transferring power to <b>rotor</b> <b>assemblies</b> mounted on the wingtips. It combines the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft. For vertical flight, the rotors are angled so the plane of rotation is horizontal, lifting the way a helicopter rotor does. As the aircraft gains speed, the rotors are progressively tilted forward, with the plane of rotation eventually becoming vertical. In this mode the wing provides the lift, and the rotor provides thrust as a propeller. Since the rotors can be configured to be more efficient for propulsion (e.g. with root-tip twist) and it avoids a helicopter's issues of retreating blade stall, the tiltrotor can achieve higher speeds than helicopters.|$|R
50|$|Tandem rotors are two {{horizontal}} main <b>rotor</b> <b>assemblies</b> mounted {{one behind}} the other. Tandem rotors achieve pitch attitude changes to accelerate and decelerate the helicopter {{through a process}} called cyclic pitch. To pitch forward and accelerate, both rotors increase the pitch at the rear and reduce the pitch at the front (cyclic)keeping torque the same on both rotors, flying sideways is achieved by increasing the pitch {{on one side and}} reducing pitch on the other. Yaw control develops through opposing cyclic pitch in each rotor. To pivot right, the front rotor tilts right and the rear rotor tilts left. To pivot left, the front rotor tilts left and the rear rotor tilts right. All rotor power contributes to lift, and it is simpler to handle changes in the center of gravity fore-aft. However, it requires the expense of two large rotors rather than the more common one large main rotor and a much smaller tail rotor. The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is the most common tandem rotor helicopter.|$|R

40|$|Modern {{balancing}} {{methods for}} flexible and rigid rotors are explored. Rigid rotor balancing is performed at several hundred rpm, {{well below the}} first bending mode of the shaft. High speed balancing is necessary when the nominal rotational speed {{is higher than the}} first bending mode. Both methods introduce weights which will produce rotor responses at given speeds that will be exactly out of phase with the responses of an unbalanced rotor. Modal balancing seeks to add weights which will leave other rotor modes unaffected. Also, influence coefficients can be determined by trial and error addition of weights and recording of their effects on vibration at speeds of interest. The latter method is useful for balancing rotors at other than critical speeds and for performing unified balancing beginning with the first critical speed. Finally, low-speed flexible balancing permits low-speed tests and adjustments of <b>rotor</b> <b>assemblies</b> which will not be accessible when operating in their high-speed functional configuration. The method was developed for the high pressure liquid oxygen turbopumps for the Shuttle...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of vibration modes subject to parametric variation {{has long been}} observed to cause curious effects, notably those of localisation and frequency curve veering. These phenomena have great significance in practical applications: localisation is responsible for unexpectedly high levels of response in periodic structures, for example in turbine <b>rotor</b> <b>assemblies,</b> and frequency curve veering has shown correlation {{with a variety of}} critical behaviours, for example in the stability analysis of helicopter vibrations. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the behaviour and derives new system properties with respect to parameter perturbations.

The work outlined in this project has focused on the use of hydrogen to remove individual or all sintered NdFeB magnets from large commercial <b>rotor</b> <b>assemblies,</b> with the aim of re-using the underlying structure once the magnets are removed. Masking agents were successfully used to protect some regions on commercial assemblies during hydrogen decrepitation which resulted in targeted removal of specific magnets. The thermal and mechanical impact of the hydrogen decrepitation process was assessed during hydrogen processing. For all forms of sintered NdFeB scrap the surface condition of the magnets is important as oxidation has been shown to inhibit the onset of the hydrogen decrepitation process. In this work a systematic study has been performed on the early stages of oxidation in atmospheric conditions using raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and 3 -D laser confocal microscopy.
