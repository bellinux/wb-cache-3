5|$|Alex Funke, {{who worked}} on The Lord of the Rings, {{directed}} the film's miniatures unit. These include 1/24th and 1/100th scale miniatures of Miraz's castle. A scale model was built of the Narnians' cave hideouts during the climactic battle, which the actor playing the giant Wimbleweather was filmed against. One of the improvements made over the previous film {{was to make the}} centaurs walk during dialogue scenes, so Cornell John as Glenstorm wore Power <b>Risers</b> (mechanical stilts with springs), to mimic a horse's canter and height. The animatronic Minotaur heads were also improved to properly lip sync, although this was not as successful as hoped and had to be revamped digitally.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are diurnal {{and require}} {{daylight}} {{to find their}} food. They are not early <b>risers,</b> instead waiting until the sun has warmed their roosting sites before feeding. All species are generally highly social and roost, forage and travel in colourful and noisy flocks. These vary in size depending on availability of food; in times of plenty, flocks are small and number a hundred birds or less, while in droughts or other times of adversity, they may swell up to contain thousands or even {{tens of thousands of}} birds; one record from the Kimberley noted a flock of 32,000 little corellas. Species that inhabit open country form larger flocks than those of forested areas.|$|E
25|$|The service core {{contains}} service <b>risers</b> {{and shared}} facilities, including lifts, a fire stair, dumb waiter for office files, tearooms, and large toilet and shower rooms. The fire stair {{in the service}} core retains original finishes, including black and white terrazzo stair treads and <b>risers,</b> black-painted metal balustrades with black plastic handrails, textured stair undersides, and vinyl tile clad walls with contrasting inset floor numerals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Riser's</b> grandfather, A. Hartwell <b>Riser,</b> {{was a city}} {{alderman}} from 1942 to 1950 in Ruston in Lincoln Parish. <b>Riser</b> {{was born}} in Columbia to Hartwell Neil <b>Riser,</b> Sr. (1934-1985), and the former Lillian Marie Gore (born 1937), who married in Caldwell Parish in 1956. After her husband's death, Lillian <b>Riser</b> married Herschel Gentry, Jr., of Monroe. Neil <b>Riser</b> graduated in 1980 from Caldwell Parish High School in Columbia.|$|R
50|$|There are <b>risering</b> aids {{that can}} be {{implemented}} to slow the cooling of a <b>riser</b> or decrease its size. One is using an insulating sleeve and top around the <b>riser.</b> Another is placing a heater around only the <b>riser.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cable that is run between {{floors in}} non-plenum areas is rated as <b>riser</b> cable. The fire {{requirements}} on <b>riser</b> cable {{are not as}} strict. Thus, plenum cable can always replace <b>riser</b> cable, but <b>riser</b> cable cannot replace plenum cable in plenum spaces.|$|R
25|$|In {{low-rise}} structures, {{the support}} rooms (chillers, transformers, boilers, pumps and air handling units) {{can be put}} in basements or roof space—areas which have low rental value. There is, however, {{a limit to how}} far this plant can be located from the area it serves. The farther away it is the larger the <b>risers</b> for ducts and pipes from this plant to the floors they serve and the more floor area these <b>risers</b> take. In practice this means that in highrise buildings this plant is located on 'plant levels' at intervals up the building.|$|E
25|$|Sulphur {{improves}} the {{machinability of steel}} by forming low shear strength inclusions in the cutting zone. These inclusions are stress <b>risers</b> that weaken the steel, allowing it to deform more easily.|$|E
25|$|The master {{parachutist}} badge is 38mm {{in width}} at the widest {{part of the}} wings and 31mm {{from the top of}} the wreath to the bottom of the parachute where the <b>risers</b> meet in a point.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{variation}} of suspension density along the <b>riser</b> column {{and the effect}} of <b>riser</b> exit geometry on bed hydrodynamics and heat transfer in the upper region of a circulating fluidized (CFB) <b>riser</b> column. The experiments are conducted in a CFB <b>riser</b> column which is 102 mm x 102 mm in bed cross-section (square), 5. 25 m height, with a return leg of the same dimension. The unit is made up of interchangeable plexiglass columns. The superficial primary air velocity is varied between 4. 2 and 6. 4 m/s. The suspension density profile along the <b>riser</b> height is influenced by the exit geometry. With a 90 ° <b>riser</b> exit geometry, the suspension density profile in the upper region of the CFB <b>riser</b> column increases towards the <b>riser</b> exit. This particular trend has beeb observed for about 2 m length in the top region of the <b>riser.</b> The change in suspension density profile in the top region influences the variation of heat transfer coefficient. With a 90 ° <b>riser</b> exit geometry, the suspension density increases towards the <b>riser</b> exit, which in turn increases the heat transfer coefficient. The effect of <b>riser</b> exit geomentry on hydrodynamics and heat transfer is significant for about 2 m length in the upper region of the <b>riser</b> column.

50|$|The Lower <b>Riser</b> Package is a {{mechanical}} device to protect an oil well located underwater (subsea) and used during an oil well intervention. The LRP {{is essentially a}} mini blow out preventer (BOP). The lower <b>riser</b> package consists of a connector to the subsea oil well, a series of safety valves and a connection point at the top for connection to the <b>riser</b> pipe. The <b>riser</b> pipe is essentially a mini Marine <b>riser</b> and has a maximum inside diameter of 7 inches. A marine <b>riser</b> has a maximum inside diameter of 19 inches.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Riser's</b> grandfather, Clarence <b>Riser</b> (1893-1925), {{a native}} of Natchez, Mississippi, was killed, along with a brother-in-law, in a sawmill {{explosion}} in Ouachita Parish in northeastern Louisiana. <b>Riser's</b> father, Larkin <b>Riser,</b> Sr., known as L. T. <b>Riser</b> (January 10, 1922 [...] - [...] July 15, 2015), {{was three years old}} at the time. Ola Magee <b>Riser,</b> the mother of <b>Riser,</b> Sr., then married his step-father, Clem Matthews. <b>Riser,</b> Sr., was among the last surviving members of the Civilian Conservation Corps and served in the United States Army. He retired after forty years of employment at the Roundtree Olds Cadillac dealership in Shreveport. He was a long-time deacon at the Heflin Baptist Church in Heflin in south Webster Parish and an active fisherman and gardener. He is interred at Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Creston in Natchitoches Parish.|$|R
25|$|In May 1951, it was {{reported}} that the Meteor 4's tail unit lost half its strength when the skin tore. The skin tearing was found to originate at rivet holes, access panels or discontinuous stringers (stress <b>risers)</b> due to metal fatigue.|$|E
25|$|In most lugged steel frames, the lugs have {{a simple}} pointed shape. The lug's curves {{maximize}} {{the strength of the}} joint, while minimizing the possibility of stress <b>risers,</b> which would otherwise make the frame prone to cracking {{at the end of the}} lug.|$|E
25|$|On the surface, blue fire {{hydrants}} {{in the streets}} are dry <b>risers</b> connected to the Metro fire control system. If a fire breaks out in tunnels, firefighters connect the red fire hydrant with the blue terminals to power the subway system. This decoupling prevents accidental flooding.|$|E

The rib {{reinforcements}} are 310 g/m2 Dacron, with the trailing edge reinforcement fabricated of 175 g/m2 polyester. The lines are all sheathed Kevlar and 1.1 and 1.7mm in diameter or, optionally, 0.6 and 0.9mm micro unsheathed lines. The <b>risers</b> are made from 20mm wide Polyamida strapping.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{requirement of}} the reactor for the Fischer–Tropsch process is to remove {{the heat of the}} reaction. This type of reactor contains two banks of heat exchangers which remove heat; the remainder of which is removed by the products and recycled in the system. The formation of heavy waxes should be avoided, since they condense on the catalyst and form agglomerations. This leads to fluidization. Hence, <b>risers</b> are operated over 570nbsp&K.|$|E
25|$|The staircases, made of wood, {{provided}} {{access to}} {{all levels of the}} temple, with a landing at each floor. The southwest staircase was completely finished, but the staircase in the northwest corner was never completed—it was roughed in with temporary boards resting on the <b>risers.</b> Workmen used this staircase {{to gain access to the}} building during its construction, especially during the winter of 1845–1846, when persons were using the other staircase to reach the attic for ordinance work.|$|E

25|$|<b>Riser</b> Angle Monitoring. On drillships, <b>riser</b> angle {{monitoring}} can be {{fed into}} the DP system. It may be an electrical inclinometer or based on USBL, where a <b>riser</b> angle monitoring transponder is fitted to the <b>riser</b> and a remote inclinometer unit is installed on the Blow Out Preventer (BOP) and interrogated through the ship’s HPR.|$|R
25|$|The mainstaircase was {{flanked by}} smooth, {{variegated}} marble columns in antis. Ten marble steps {{lead up to}} a landing. In the east wall of the intermediate landing is a fountain. The stairs diverge at the intermediate landing, with nine more steps on {{the north and south}} leading to the second floor landing. The stringer, <b>risers,</b> and treads are all made of marble. The banister is of cast iron in a rinceau and cartouche pattern, with a handrail encased in red velvet.|$|E
25|$|The one-room {{interior}} of the Charles Sweeney Cabin has a loft accessible in the northwest corner by a dog-leg stairway. The stairway has many of its original balusters. It also has original trim on the stringers, the structural member of the stairway that supports the treads and <b>risers.</b> The square newel and rail are formed from one piece of an oak branch. There is a small closet under the staircase that has its original four-paneled door with concave, quarter-circle corners on the raised panels.|$|E
25|$|An ample gallery {{raised on}} a local-stone podium spans {{the width of the}} facade, the central one-third portion {{projecting}} forward approximately six feet in a square form. Defining the porch is a series of Corinthian columns raised upon a concrete balustrade, one at each intersection of two perpendicular planes. These columns support a full-entablature, ornate cornice and balustered parapet with pommels over each column. Bilateral stairs access the verandah from either side of the projecting central section. The steps contain marble treads and polychrome tile <b>risers.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In July 2011, <b>Riser</b> {{released}} an EP under his label, D.R.E.A.M. Brigade Recordings. The EP, titled 21st Century Electric Church Music, {{is a collection}} of songs compiled by different artists and includes <b>Riser's</b> song, [...] "Ghetto Blastuh". <b>Riser</b> then began collaborating with Lamar's Black Hippy cohort and TDE label-mate, Ab-Soul. <b>Riser</b> was featured on [...] "Beautiful Death", from Ab-Soul's 2012 project, Control System. In 2013, <b>Riser</b> signed a recording contract with Israeli music producer Borgore's record label Buygore, as well as his management company, Buygore Management. Around that time, <b>Riser</b> also signed a production deal with Chest Rockwell Entertainment, founded by Greg Ogan and Spencer Neezy. On April 22, 2015, <b>Riser</b> {{released an}} EP titled Modern Medicine, which he mixed, mastered, produced and recorded by himself.

25|$|In 1884 she {{purchased}} {{an unfinished}} farmhouse in the Santa Clara Valley and began building her mansion. Carpenters were hired {{and worked on}} the house day and night until it became a seven story mansion. She did not use an architect and added on to the building in a haphazard fashion, so the home contains numerous oddities such as doors and stairs that go nowhere, windows overlooking other rooms and stairs with odd-sized <b>risers.</b> Many accounts attribute these oddities to her belief in ghosts.|$|E
25|$|This {{casting process}} is {{advantageous}} for very complex castings, that would regularly require cores. It is also dimensionally accurate, requires no draft, {{and has no}} parting lines so no flash is formed. As compared to investment casting, it is cheaper {{because it is a}} simpler process and the foam is cheaper than the wax. <b>Risers</b> are not usually required {{due to the nature of}} the process; because the molten metal vaporizes the foam the first metal into the mold cools more quickly than the rest, which results in natural directional solidification.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} has {{two sets}} of pews divided by a broad center aisle. A serpentine balcony supported by iron columns covers the northern third, with a glazed screen creating a narthex. At the south end, a pulpit and lectern front a dais with Communion {{table in front of}} a dossal curtain is set in a crenellated Tudor Gothic wooden surround between {{two sets of}} organ pipes. On either side are the choir <b>risers.</b> The stained glass windows are set in a geometric pattern, each one having a diagonal stripe suggesting heraldric origin, with a floral design in yellow or pink at the top.|$|E

50|$|The marine <b>riser</b> is {{connected}} to the wellhead on the sea bed and therefore the tensioner must manage the differential movements between the <b>riser</b> and the rig. If there were no tensioner and the rig moves downward, the <b>riser</b> would buckle; if the rig rises then high forces would be transmitted to the <b>riser</b> and it would stretch and be damaged.|$|R
5000|$|While {{focusing}} on music production after P!stol P!stol's disbandment, <b>Riser</b> {{got a phone}} call from his longtime high-school friend, Derek Ali, better known as MixedByAli, the in-house mixing engineer of West Coast indie record label, Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). Ali asked <b>Riser</b> to come by the studio and record vocals with an artist he was producing for named Kendrick Lamar, a Compton-based rapper. Lamar and <b>Riser</b> had an instant musical synergy, with Lamar finding <b>Riser's</b> voice to be very original and complementary to his own. Lamar appreciated that <b>Riser</b> used his voice as a musical instrument to add more soul to tracks. In 2009, <b>Riser</b> was featured on Lamar's debut extended play (EP), The Kendrick Lamar EP, on a bonus track titled [...] "Determined". Lamar and <b>Riser</b> collaborated again in 2010, for Lamar's Overly Dedicated project, appearing on the song [...] "Barbed Wire". In 2011, <b>Riser</b> was featured on Lamar’s Section.80 project, lending his vocals on the tracks, [...] "Keisha's Song" [...] and [...] "Ronald Reagan Era".|$|R
