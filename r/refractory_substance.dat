6000|$|An {{objection}} to the foregoing theory will, perhaps, {{be drawn from the}} plutonic rocks not being separated into two evidently distinct series, of different specific gravities; although, like the volcanic, they have been liquified. In answer, it may first be remarked, that we have no evidence of the atoms of any one of the constituent minerals in the plutonic series having been aggregated, whilst the others remained fluid, which we have endeavoured to show is an almost necessary condition of their separation; on the contrary, the crystals have generally impressed each other with their forms. (The crystalline paste of phonolite is frequently penetrated by long needles of hornblende; from which it appears that the hornblende, though the more fusible mineral, has crystallised before, or at the same time with a more <b>refractory</b> <b>substance.</b> Phonolite, as far as my observations serve, in every instance appears to be an injected rock, like those of the plutonic series; hence probably, like these latter, it has generally been cooled without repeated and violent disturbances. Those geologists who have doubted whether granite could have been formed by igneous liquefaction, because minerals of different degrees of fusibility impress each other with their forms, could not have been aware of the fact of crystallised hornblende penetrating phonolite, a rock undoubtedly of igneous origin. The viscidity, which it is now known, that both feldspar and quartz retain at a temperature much below their points of fusion, easily explains their mutual impressment.

In this reactor {{a fraction of}} substrate is used by suspended biomass and the remaining by attached biomass resulting in the competition between the two growths for the substrate. The combination of suspended and attached growth provides the system with enhanced biomass concentration and sludge age more than those in ASP. Similar to attached growth system, the hybrid bioreactor ensures considerable efficiency for treating toxic and <b>refractory</b> <b>substances</b> in wastewater. For the process design of hybrid bioreactor a suitable mathematical model is required.

The polysaccharide fraction of AOM has been related to (bio) fouling in micro-filtration and ultrafiltration, and reverse osmosis membranes. However, so far, the chemical structure of the polysaccharides released by bloom-forming algae is not well understood. In this study, dissolved fraction of AOM produced by three algal species (Chaetoceros affinis, Nitzschia epithemoides and Hymenomonas spp.) was characterized using liquid chromatography–organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. Chemical structure of polysaccharides isolated from the AOM solutions at stationary phase was analyzed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR).

A model was developed to relate the macroscopic functioning of biological filters used for eliminating dissolved organic matter in drinking water treatment to the kinetics of the basic microbiological processes involved. The processes considered are (1) exoenzymatic hydrolysis of macro-molecular dissolved organic compounds; (2) growth of bacteria controlled by monomeric organic substrates; (3) adsorption/desorption of bacteria onto the solid support; and (4) bacterial mortality caused mainly by protozoan predators. The model calculates the vertical distribution of fixed bacterial biomass and the effluent concentration in biodegradable organic matter from the characteristics of influent water for given values of contact time and temperature. The model was calibrated and validated by comparison with observed data set from pilot and full-size filters run in the Neuilly-sur-Marne and Choisy-le-Roi plants (Parisian suburbs).

In marinc snow, bacterial biomass and production rates increased exponentially and in gellike aggregates (GEA-considered as late-stage marine snow) reached values 2 - 3 orders of magnitude higher than in ambient water. Specific growth rates of marine snow-associated bacteria (0. 3 l-l. 76 d-I) were similar to ambient water bacteria; however, they were significantly lower in GEA (0. 08 - 0. 3 1 d I). Concentrations of dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) in aggregates were up to 80 PM. Despite these high concentrations of DFAA, the organic C: N ratio increased significantly over the 3 months of the investigation period, ranging from 6. 7 to 17. 3 and indicating that <b>refractory</b> <b>substances</b> accumulate in aging aggregates.

METHODS: The detritus of leaves, branches and litter (3 g) previously dried were incubated in decomposition chambers containing 1 L of inoculum. The chambers were maintained at 24 ± 2 °C in aerobic condition. The DO concentrations dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and DIC were evaluated. The consumption of DO was adjusted to a first-order kinetic model. The hourly rates of DO consumption, DIC production and O/C ratios were determined. RESULTS: The DO consumption (2. 62 mg. g- 1) and DIC production (1. 20 mg. g- 1) were higher in leaves decomposition, and smaller in litter (1. 50 and 0. 42 mg. g- 1, respectively). Inversely, the O/C ratio was higher in the decomposition of litter (3. 56). The rates of DO consumption (0. 50 mg. g- 1. h- 1) and DIC production (0. 41 mg. g- 1. h- 1) were greatest in the early decomposition of leaves. CONCLUSIONS: Short sampling intervals are key to understanding the dynamics of decomposition in the leaching phase. Higher consumption of DO in leaves decomposition indicated a higher content of labile compounds in this detritus. The highest O/C ratios in the litter decomposition can be attributed to its higher content of <b>refractory</b> <b>substances.</b> Variations in DO consumption rates and in O/C ratios over time suggest that the leachate is heterogeneous, comprising labile and refractory fractions, analogous to the detritus as a whole.

40|$|The {{physically}} reasonable {{assumption that}} the seed bodies which initiated the accretion of the individual asteroids, planets, and comets (subsequently these objects are collectively called planetoids) formed by stochastic processes requires a radius distribution function which is unique except for two scaling parameters: {{the total number of}} planetoids and their most probable radius. The former depends on the ease of formation of the seed bodies while the second is uniquely determined by the average pre-encounter velocity, V, of the accretable material relative to an individual planetoid. This theoretical radius function can be fit to the initial asteroid radius distribution which [Anders, 1965] derived from the present-day distribution by allowing for fragmentation collisions among the asteroids since their formation. Normalizing the theoretical function to this empirical distribution reveals that there were about 102 precollision asteroids and that V = (2 - 4) x 10 - 2 km/sec which was presumably the turbulent velocity in the Solar Nebula. Knowing V we can determine the scale height of the dust in the Solar Nebula and consequently its space density. The density of accretable material determines the rate of accretion of the planetoids. From this we find, for example, that the Earth formed in about 8 x 106 yr and it attained a maximum temperature through accretion of about 3 x 103 [deg]K. From the total mass of the terrestrial planets and the theoretical radius function we find that about 2 x 103 planetoids formed {{in the vicinity of the}} terrestrial planets. Except for the asteroids the smaller planetoids have since been accreted by the terrestrial planets. About 15 % of the present mass of the terrestrial planets was accumulated by the secondary accretion of these smaller primary planetoids. There are far fewer primary planetoids than craters on the Moon or Mars. The craters were likely produced by the collisional breakup of a few primary planetoids with masses between one-tenth and one lunar mass. This deduction comes from comparing the collision cross sections of the planetoids in this mass range to that of the terrestrial planets. This comparison shows that two to three collisions leading to the breakup of four to six objects likely occurred among these objects before their accretion by the terrestrial planets. The number of these fragments is quite adequate to explain the lunar and Martin craters. Furthermore the mass spectrum of such fragments is a power-law distribution which results in a power-law distribution of crater radii of just the type observed on the Moon and Mars. Applying the same analysis to the planetoids which formed in the vicinity of the giant planets reveals that it is unlikely that any fragmentation collisions took place among them before they were accreted by these planets due to the integrated collision cross section of the giant planets being about three orders of magnitude greater than that of the terrestrial planets. We can thus anticipate a marked scarcity of impact craters on the satellites of these outer planets. This prediction can be tested by future space probes. Our knowledge of the radius function of the comets is consistent with their being primary planetoids. The primary difference between the radius function of the planetoids which formed in the inner part of the solar system and that of the comets results from the fact that the seed bodies which grew into the comets formed far more easily than those which grew into the asteroids and the terrestrial planets. Thus in the outer part of the Solar Nebula the principal solid material (water and ammonia snow) accreted into a huge (~ 1012 +) number of relatively small objects (comets) while in the inner part of the nebula the solid material (hard-to-stick <b>refractory</b> <b>substances)</b> accumulated into only a few (~ 103) large objects (asteroids and terrestrial planets).

Based on the thermochemical properties of the fine aerosol, the relative amounts of the volatile and refractory compounds were estimated. It {{was found that the}} thermally refractory (possibly higher molecular weight) compounds dominated the TC composition. Their contribution to TC was higher in the daytime than in the nighttime samples. The relative share of WSOC also showed a statistically significant diel variation as did its refractory fraction. Anhydrosugars and phenolic acids were determined by GC-MS and their diel variation was studied. Based on the decrease of their relative concentrations between the biomass burning and transition periods and their distinctly different diel variations, we suggest that the phenolic acids may undergo chemical transformations in the aerosol phase, possibly towards more <b>refractory</b> compounds (humic-like <b>substances,</b> HULIS), as has been suggested previously. These conclusions are supported by the results of the thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the same filter samples...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} {{represents}} {{a major component}} of the world surface carbon reserves. The total carbon in dead organic matter in the forest floor and in the underlying mineral soil has been estimated to be 1450 x 10 " 9 t C, exceeding the amount stored in living vegetation by a factor of two or three (Schlesinger 1977; Meentemeyer et al., 1982; Jenkinson, 1988). Mineralization and humification represent important processes in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Schlesinger (1990) estimated that about 0. 7 % of the annual terrestrial net primary production is sequestered in <b>refractory</b> humic <b>substances</b> carbon. Organic matter of forest soils is composed of a mixture of above- and belowground plant residues (primary resources), microbial residues (secondary resources), and humic compounds (Swift et al., 1979). Humic compounds are formed concomitantly during the microbial decomposition of primary and secondary resources. The conceptual view of soil organic matter in the present study is that of a continuum ranging from fresh plant litter to humic substances, the final products of humification. A complete separation of plant remains and humic compounds is not possible, {{due to the fact that}} organic matter at all stages of degradation and humification is present simultaneously in natural soils, albeit at different amounts. The way in which the objective of this research will be addressed is the study of the chemical structural changes during humification of major plant components, namely lignin and aliphatic biomacromolecules. This is achieved by the analysis of bulk samples in comparison with different fractions. The fractionation procedure is chosen according to the suitability for the compound class under investigation. The data obtained in this way reveal that previous hypotheses on the humification processes in soils are unrealistic. In a final step the results obtained on the structural chemical trends of the individual components are combined with evidence from the literature and a hypothesis is proposed for the major humification processes in forest soils.

40|$|The Sunset {{semi-continuous}} carbon analyzer (SCCA) is {{an instrument}} widely used for carbonaceous aerosol measurement. Despite previous validation work, {{in this study}} we identified a new type of SCCA calculation discrepancy caused by the default multipoint baseline correction method. When exceeding a certain threshold carbon load, multipoint correction could cause significant total carbon (TC) underestimation. This calculation discrepancy was characterized for both sucrose and ambient samples, with two protocols based on IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environments) (i. e., IMPshort and IMPlong) and one NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) -like protocol (rtNIOSH). For ambient samples, the IMPshort, IMPlong and rtNIOSH protocol underestimated 22, 36 and 12 % of TC, respectively, with the corresponding threshold being ~ 0, 20 and 25 μgC. For sucrose, however, such discrepancy was observed only with the IMPshort protocol, indicating the need of more <b>refractory</b> SCCA calibration <b>substance.</b> Although the calculation discrepancy could be largely reduced by the single-point baseline correction method, the instrumental blanks of single-point method were higher. The correction method proposed was to use multipoint-corrected data when below the determined threshold, and use single-point results when beyond that threshold. The effectiveness of this correction method was supported by correlation with optical data...|$|R
40|$|The {{release of}} PGF 2 alpha and PGE 2, progesterone, androgens and oestradiol in vitro, and the {{aromatase}} {{activity in the}} brain of the male lizard Podarcis sicula sicula during three different phases of the reproductive period were evaluated. In addition, the effects of salmon GnRH, substance P, salmon GnRH antagonist, substance P antagonist, PGF 2 alpha, PGE 2 and acetylsalicylic acid on the release of prostaglandins and sex steroids and on aromatase activity in the brain were evaluated during the same three phases. PGF 2 alpha, oestradiol and aromatase activity were higher during the refractory phase, androgens during the fighting phase, and progesterone during the mating phase, while PGE 2 was lower during the refractory phase. Treatment with salmon GnRH increased PGF 2 alpha, oestradiol and aromatase activity, but decreased the amount of androgens released. Substance P decreased PGF 2 alpha, oestradiol and aromatase activity, but increased the amount of androgens released. PGF 2 alpha increased oestradiol and aromatase activity, but decreased the amount of androgens released. Acetylsalicylic acid decreased PGF 2 alpha, oestradiol and aromatase activity, but increased the amount of androgens released. These data suggest that salmon GnRH and substance P have different roles in reproductive processes, with opposite mechanisms, in {{the central nervous system}} of this male lizard: salmon GnRH seems to be involved in regulating the <b>refractory</b> phase, while <b>substance</b> P plays a role in regulating the fighting phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the current paper was to review the literature and discuss the degree of evidence for various treatment strategies for status epilepticus (SE) in adults. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for relevant literature from 1966 to January 2005. Furthermore, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was sought. Recommendations are based on this literature and on our judgement of {{the relevance of the}} references to the subject. Recommendations were reached by informative consensus approach. Where {{there was a lack of}} evidence but consensus was clear we have stated our opinion as good practice points. The preferred treatment pathway for generalised convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is intravenous (i. v.) administration of 4 mg of lorazepam or 10 mg of diazepam directly followed by 15 - 18 mg/kg of phenytoin or equivalent fosphenytoin. If seizures continue for more than 10 min after first injection another 4 mg of lorazepam or 10 mg of diazepam is recommended. Refractory GCSE is treated by anaesthetic doses of midazolam, propofol or barbiturates; the anaesthetics are titrated against an electroencephalogram burst suppression pattern for at least 24 h. The initial therapy of non-convulsive SE depends on the type and the cause. In most cases of absence SE, a small i. v. dose of lorazepam or diazepam will terminate the attack. Complex partial SE is initially treated such as GCSE, however, when <b>refractory</b> further non-anaesthetising <b>substances</b> should be given instead of anaesthetics. In subtle SE i. v. anaesthesia is required...|$|R
