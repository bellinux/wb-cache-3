5|$|In 1758, Johnson {{began to}} write a weekly series, The Idler, which ran from 15 April 1758 to 5 April 1760, {{as a way to}} avoid {{finishing}} his Shakespeare. This series was shorter and lacked many features of The <b>Rambler.</b> Unlike his independent publication of The <b>Rambler,</b> The Idler was published in a weekly news journal The Universal Chronicle, a publication supported by John Payne, John Newbery, Robert Stevens and William Faden.|$|E

Ignoring the protestations of his wife, Black leaves to {{investigate}} the parkland where one of the earlier bodies was uncovered. A park ranger discusses that case with him, telling Black that the body was found by an unidentified <b>rambler.</b> Black believes this man was the murderer. Elsewhere, Dion returns home, where he is belittled and emasculated by his overbearing mother, Marie (Linda Sorensen).|$|E
5|$|Ongoing {{problems}} with avionics systems were {{addressed in the}} Jolly Well program, completed in 1964, which improved components of the AN/ASQ-38 bombing navigational computer and the terrain computer. The MADREC (Malfunction Detection and Recording) upgrade fitted to most aircraft by 1965 could detect failures in avionics and weapons computer systems, and was essential in monitoring the Hound Dog missiles. The electronic countermeasures capability of the B-52 was expanded with Rivet <b>Rambler</b> (1971) and Rivet Ace (1973).|$|E

5|$|The B-52D was a {{dedicated}} long-range bomber without a reconnaissance option. The Big Belly modifications allowed the B-52D to carry heavy loads of conventional bombs for carpet bombing over Vietnam, while the Rivet <b>Rambler</b> modification added the Phase V ECM systems, which {{was better than}} the systems used on most later B-52s. Because of these upgrades and its long range capabilities, the D model was used more extensively in Vietnam than any other model. Aircraft assigned to Vietnam were painted in a camouflage colour scheme with black bellies to defeat searchlights.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of <b>Rambler</b> 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.|$|E

25|$|On May 1, 1954, Nash and Hudson Motor Car Company {{announced}} a merger, and the successor corporation was named American Motors Corporation (AMC).

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Gremlin line by VAM in 1974, which became the company's smallest and most affordable model, created {{a gap between the}} lower end <b>Rambler</b> American line and the larger, top Classic (Matador) line; the situation was also applicable to the performance Javelin line despite being discontinued in 1973. The difference in size and engine series between the <b>Rambler</b> American and the Gremlin was not enough for VAM to create the impression of a more solid and more importantly a diverse product line since both cars were perceived as belonging to the same economy level, which would also mean the creation of internal competition. The VAM <b>Rambler</b> American was restricted to the economy segment since its introduction to the Mexican market, the only exceptions to this being the luxury limited edition <b>Rambler</b> American Hartop (<b>Rambler</b> American 440H in US) for 1963 and 1965, as well as the sporty <b>Rambler</b> American Rally (<b>Rambler</b> American Rogue and Hornet Rallye X/Hornet X in US) from 1969 through 1974. The model was shifted from the economy to the mid-segment, as an all-new generation introduced for 1975. This didn't just readjust the company's full product line, but was also an opportunity to rejuvenate the compact line itself. By this time, the Hornet-based <b>Rambler</b> American had been on the market for five years and saw continued sales and positive image. The name was simplified from <b>Rambler</b> American to just American, marking the discontinuation of the <b>Rambler</b> brand in Mexico. The greatest change was the creation of the new luxury American ECD trim level followed by a revised and improved American Rally and American base models, which helped to distance the line further from the Gremlin. The cars in all versions obtained substantial updates and upgrades.|$|E
