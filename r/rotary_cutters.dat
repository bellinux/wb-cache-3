It is very important each piece is perfectly aligned {{in order to prevent}} an uneven or sloppy appearance and to prevent rework. <b>Rotary</b> <b>cutters</b> revolutionized quiltmaking when they appeared in late 1970s. A rotary cutter offers even the shakiest of hands the ability to produce perfect, even slices and minimizes the chance of error.|$|E
25|$|With {{large-scale}} projects like quilts, {{it is often}} advantageous to have a rotary cutter and mat. A rotary cutter is a cutting tool with a round blade, {{making it easy to}} cut a smooth, continuous line. <b>Rotary</b> <b>cutters</b> come with different sized blades: a larger blade is useful for large projects with straight lines, while a smaller blade is helpful for small areas or curved lines. A rotary mat protects tables and surfaces from the blade, while also protecting the cutting edge from damage. A quilting ruler can also be used, to help ensure that all pieces are cut to consistent sizes. Quilting rulers are made of clear plastic and have marked grid-lines {{across the surface of the}} ruler. This type of ruler makes it possible to cut a piece of fabric in the correct width or length without having to use a measuring tape and fabric chalk. Measurements have to include a seam allowance.|$|E

5000|$|The first <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter</b> was {{introduced}} by the Olfa company in 1979 for garment making, however, it was quickly adopted by quilters. Prior to {{the invention of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter,</b> quilters traced handmade templates of the necessary shapes onto the wrong side of fabric and added 1/4-inch seam allowances all around. Templates were often handmade of (cereal box type) cardboard and the pencil wore down the edges with repeated tracings, rendering them inaccurate; new templates would be made several times until all the patchwork pieces were cut. Pieces were usually cut one at a time with dressmaking scissors, which were often heavy and had long blades that were designed for cutting large pieces for garments but were cumbersome to use for cutting small pieces for patchwork. The <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter</b> gained almost immediate widespread use among quilters after its introduction and, along with the accompanying development of strip techniques, revolutionized quilting.|$|R

50|$|Milling is the {{machining}} process of using <b>rotary</b> <b>cutters</b> to remove material from a workpiece advancing (or feeding) {{in a direction}} at an angle with the axis of the tool. It covers {{a wide variety of}} different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations. It {{is one of the most}} commonly used processes in industry and machine shops today for machining parts to precise sizes and shapes.|$|E
50|$|Larger <b>rotary</b> <b>cutters</b> {{require more}} {{powerful}} tractors to effectively operate. Tractor dealers can recommend {{the right size}} brush hog for any of their tractors, or tractor and brush hog sizing charts {{are available on the}} Internet. Calculators used to estimate the time required to mow different size areas with different size cutters are also available and can be used to help decide which brush hog is the best investment for different situations.|$|E
50|$|The blades on a <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter</b> {{can have}} top speeds of over 150 mph. Therefore the kinetic energy enables the blades {{to cut through}} saplings and small trees up to several inches/centimetres in diameter. Consequently, these mowers can be very {{dangerous}} and contact with the blades would cause severe bodily injury or death.|$|R
25|$|When {{making a}} quilt it is {{important}} to mark the fabric that you are cutting in order {{to have some kind of}} guidance when cutting the fabric, or you could use a quilting ruler and <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter.</b> When marking the fabric it is advised that you use a fabric marker, which is a marker that washes out when the quilt is washed or will fade away after repeated washes.|$|R
50|$|Two archetypes of {{this type}} of mower are the Bush Hog which is made by Bush Hog, Inc. Selma, Alabama and the Flex-Wing by RhinoAg Gibson City, Illinois.

50|$|Flock worker's lung can be {{prevented}} with engineering controls that protect workers from inhaling flock. Engineering controls to prevent inhalation of flock can include using guillotine cutters rather than <b>rotary</b> <b>cutters,</b> and ensuring that blades are sharp, since dull blades shear off more respirable particles. Flocking plants have also implemented medical surveillance programs for workers to diagnose cases at an earlier stage. Another technique for preventing flock worker's lung is cleaning the workplace with alternatives to compressed air {{in order to avoid}} resuspending particulates in the air.|$|E
50|$|For modest {{manufacturing}} volumes, wood dowels {{are typically}} manufactured on industrial dowel machines {{based on the}} same principles as the <b>rotary</b> <b>cutters</b> described above. Such machines may employ interchangeable cutting heads of varying diameters, thus enabling the machines to be quickly changed to manufacture different dowel diameters.Typically, the mechanism is open-ended, with material guides at the machine's entry and exit to enable fabrication of continuous dowel rod of unlimited length. Since the 19th century, some of these dowel machines have had power feed mechanisms to move the stock past the cutting mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Compact utility {{tractors}} require special, smaller implements than full-sized agricultural tractors. Very common implements {{include the}} box blade, the grader blade, the landscape rake, the {{post hole digger}} (or post hole auger), the <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter</b> (slasher or a brush hog), a mid- or rear-mount finish mower, a broadcast seeder, a subsoiler and the rototiller (rotary tiller). In northern climates, a rear-mounted snow blower is very common; some smaller CUT models are available with front-mounted snow blowers powered by mid-PTO shafts. Implement brands outnumbere tractor brands, so CUT owners have {{a wide selection of}} implements.|$|R
50|$|A variant design uses a wheel-shaped blade {{mounted on}} a sliding shuttle {{attached}} to a rail. This type of paper cutter {{is known as a}} <b>rotary</b> paper <b>cutter.</b> Advantages of this design include being able to make wavy cuts, perforations or just score the paper without cutting, with the use of various circular blades. It is also almost impossible for the user to cut him/herself, except while changing the blade. This makes it safer for home use. Higher-end versions of <b>rotary</b> paper <b>cutters</b> are used for precision paper cutting and are popular for cutting down photographs.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1820s Edwin Beard Budding, a {{machinist}} or [...] "mechanician", {{was employed}} by Edward's son, John, at Thrupp. It was while Budding {{was working at}} Thrupp that Lewis' machine was developed to use <b>rotary</b> <b>cutters,</b> and Budding realised that this machine could be adapted for other purposes. Using gears, a revolving horizontal shaft and three blades he developed a machine to cut grass, which until then had been cut manually, using a scythe. This resulted in the world's first lawn mower being invented at Thrupp. It received its patent in 1830. Budding is also credited with {{the invention of the}} screw adjustable spanner.|$|E
50|$|A smaller mower {{used for}} lawns and sports grounds (playing fields) {{is called a}} lawn mower or grounds mower, which is often self-powered, or may also be small enough to be pushed by the operator. Grounds mowers have reel or <b>rotary</b> <b>cutters.</b> Larger mowers or mower-conditioners are mainly used to cut grass (or other crops) for hay or silage and often place the cut {{material}} into rows, which {{are referred to as}} windrows. Swathers (or windrowers) are also used to cut grass (and grain crops). Prior to the invention and adoption of mechanized mowers, (and today in places where use a mower is impractical or uneconomical), grass and grain crops were cut by hand using scythes or sickles.|$|E
5000|$|A {{rotary cutter}} {{is a tool}} {{generally}} used by quilters to cut fabric. It consists of a handle with a circular blade that rotates, thus the tool's name. Rotary cutter blades are very sharp, can be resharpened, and are available in different sizes: usually smaller blades are used to cut small curves, while larger blades are used to cut to straight lines and broad curves. Several layers of fabric can be cut simultaneously with a sharp (fresh) blade, {{making it easier to}} cut out patchwork pieces of the same shape and size than with scissors. Quilters use <b>rotary</b> <b>cutters</b> with specially designed templates and rulers made of approximately 1/8-inch thick clear or color-tinted plastic.|$|E
