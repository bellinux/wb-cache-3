5|$|After the Nazi {{seizure of}} power in 1933, Hess was {{appointed}} Deputy Führer of the NSDAP and received a post in Hitler's cabinet. He was the third {{most powerful man in}} Germany, behind only Hitler and Hermann Göring. In addition to appearing on Hitler's behalf at speaking engagements and rallies, Hess signed into law much of the legislation, including the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, which stripped the Jews of Germany of their <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead-up to the Holocaust.|$|E

5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E
5|$|Although Quatermass 2 was financially successful, its {{box office}} {{performance}} was eclipsed by the massive success of another Hammer film, The Curse of Frankenstein, {{which was to}} be the first of their many Gothic horror films. As a result it would be ten years before Hammer adapted the next Quatermass serial for the cinema with Quatermass and the Pit in 1967. Quatermass 2 was, however, the first film for which Hammer pre-sold the distribution <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, a financial model that would quickly become the norm for subsequent Hammer productions.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland was a {{committed}} non-interventionist who had campaigned {{in opposition to}} expansion and imperialism. He refused to promote the previous administration's Nicaragua canal treaty, and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations. Cleveland's Secretary of State, Thomas F. Bayard, negotiated with Joseph Chamberlain of the United Kingdom over fishing <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waters off Canada, and struck a conciliatory note, despite the opposition of New England's Republican Senators. Cleveland also withdrew from Senate consideration the Berlin Conference treaty which guaranteed an open door for U.S. interests in the Congo.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Kirby also {{suggested}} that there was much scope for expanding {{the reach of the}} limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend to the protection of due process rights as implicit constitutional <b>rights,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of an explicit bill of rights.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico, {{topographical}} officer George W. Hughes {{reported to}} Secretary of State John M. Clayton that a railroad across the isthmus was a “feasible and practical” idea. Clayton then instructed Robert P. Letcher, the minister to Mexico, {{to negotiate a}} treaty to protect Hargous' rights. The United States' proposal gave Mexicans a 20% discount on shipping, guaranteed Mexican <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> zone, allowed the United States to send in military if necessary, and gave the United States most-favored-nation status for Mexican cargo fees. This treaty, however, was never finalized.|$|E
5|$|In Northern Ireland, unionists took {{exception}} to the appearance of McGuinness election posters there given that Northern Ireland citizens were not eligible to vote in this Republic of Ireland election.

5|$|Leo {{tried to}} gain {{the support of the}} Holy See against Bohemond, {{promising}} to unite the Armenian Church with Rome. Pope Innocent III sent Cardinal Soffred Gaetani to Antioch in late spring 1203. Bohemond declined to meet the papal legate, stating that the patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem had excommunicated him for his debate with the Hospitallers. Gaetani mediated a reconciliation between Bohemond and the Hospitallers, but Bohemond insisted that the papal legate could not be mentioned in the agreement, because the Holy See could not make a judgement about feudal <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> principality.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the time}} of McCarthy, the word McCarthyism has entered American speech as a general term {{for a variety of}} practices: aggressively {{questioning}} a person's patriotism, making poorly supported accusations, using accusations of disloyalty to pressure a person to adhere to conformist politics or to discredit an opponent, subverting civil and political <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name of national security, and the use of demagoguery are all often referred to as McCarthyism.

5|$|The British had ceded {{some power}} in Egypt with the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1922 {{and more in}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936.

The treaty recognized Egyptian claims of sovereignty in Sudan in return for British <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nile valley and the Suez Canal. It allowed for unrestricted immigration of Egyptians to Sudan and {{for the return of}} Egyptian troops. The Sudanese were not consulted.|$|E

5|$|The Committee on Territories again {{rejected}} Weaver's bill, but {{approved a}} compromise measure {{that opened the}} Unassigned Lands, Cherokee Outlet, and Neutral Strip to settlement. Congress debated the bill over several months, while the tribes announced their resistance to their lands becoming a territory; according to an 1884 Supreme Court decision, Elkv. Wilkins, Native Americans were not citizens, and thus would have no voting <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new territory. When Weaver returned to Iowa to campaign for re-election, the bill was still in limbo. Running again on a Democratic–Greenback fusion ticket, Weaver was re-elected to the House in 1886 with a 618-vote majority.|$|E
5|$|The Kettle Creek Path {{used by the}} Native Americans {{historically}} {{linked the}} Cowanesque River with the West Branch Susquehanna River via Kettle Creek. It is possible that Native Americans camped on the creek while hunting and fishing in the area. An Indian village existed {{at the mouth of}} the creek until it was destroyed by the military in 1763. In 1784, at the Treaty at Fort Stanwick, much of Pennsylvania's Northern Tier, including the Kettle Creek watershed, was purchased from the Iroquois, Delaware, and Wyandott for $7000. The Indians retained hunting <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area until 1804.|$|E
