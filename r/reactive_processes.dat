50|$|Normal B {{cells of}} a {{germinal}} center possess rearranged immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes, and each isolated B cell possesses a unique IgH gene rearrangement. Since Burkitt lymphoma and other B-cell lymphomas are a clonal proliferative process, all tumor cells from one patient {{are supposed to}} possess identical IgH genes. When the DNA of tumor cells is analyzed using electrophoresis, a clonal band can be demonstrated, since identical IgH genes will move to the same position. On the contrary, when a normal or reactive lymph node is analyzed using the same technique, a smear rather than a distinct band will be seen. This technique is useful since sometimes benign <b>reactive</b> <b>processes</b> (e.g. infectious mononucleosis) and malignant lymphoma {{can be difficult to}} distinguish.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} part of the last century, a {{parallel}} concept called Unit Processes was used to classify <b>reactive</b> <b>processes.</b> Thus oxidations, reductions, alkylations, etc. formed separate unit processes and were studied as such. This was natural considering the close affinity of chemical engineering to industrial chemistry at its inception. Gradually however, the subject of chemical reaction engineering has largely replaced the unit process concept. This subject looks at the entire body of chemical reactions as having a personality of its own, independent of the particular chemical species or chemical bonds involved. The latter does contribute to this personality in no small measure, but to design and operate chemical reactors, a knowledge of characteristics such as rate behaviour, thermodynamics, single or multiphase nature, etc. are more important. The emergence of chemical reaction engineering as a discipline truly signaled the severance of the umbilical cord connecting chemical engineering to industrial chemistry, and served to cement the truly unique character of this discipline.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} graph games with ω-regular winning {{conditions}} {{is the foundation}} for modeling and synthesizing <b>reactive</b> <b>processes.</b> In the case of stochastic <b>reactive</b> <b>processes,</b> the corresponding stochastic graph games have three players, two of them (System and Environment) behaving adversarially, and the third (Uncertainty) behaving probabilistically. We consider two problems for stochastic graph games: the qualitative problem asks for the set of states from which a player can win with probability 1 (almost-sure winning); and the quantitative problem asks for the maximal probability of winning (optimal winning) from each state. We consider ω-regular winning conditions formalized as Müller winning conditions. We present optimal memory bounds for pure (deterministic) almost-sure winning and optimal winning strategies in stochastic graph games with Müller winning conditions. We also study the complexity of stochastic Müller games and show that both the qualitative and quantitative analysis problems are PSPACE-complete. Our results are relevant in synthesis of stochastic <b>reactive</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|E

Though highly applicable, their theory is limited to models that can express event histories as discrete sequences.

We then use this algebra to reconstruct the theory of <b>reactive</b> <b>processes</b> in our generic setting, and prove characteristic laws for sequential and parallel processes, {{all of which have}} been mechanically verified in the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant.

The films were characterized concerning their chemical composition and mechanical properties. The {{results showed that}} the films, in both systems, have similar properties. Co-sputtered films are amorphous, whereas in the <b>reactive</b> <b>process</b> a gradual l oss of cristallinity is observed with the increase of C content in the films. The hardness and the adhesion are similar for both systems. The increase of C alloying to the films led to the improvement of both their hardness and adhesion. The tribological performance of the coatings was tested by ball-on-disk. The films deposited by co-sputtering present better results than the reactive deposited ones. With the increase of C content in these coatings an increase of the wear resistance is observed, reaching in the best case a wear coefficient of 3. 1 × 10 - 16 m³/N×m. In the films deposited by <b>reactive</b> <b>process,</b> low wear coefficients can also be reached but no regular trend with increasing C contents can be observed...|$|R

40|$|Aluminum oxide {{is used in}} many {{applications}} as hard coating, for example on cutting tools. In addition to this, alumina has very good insulating properties, which makes it suitable for sensor applications on metal substrates. In these applications, the main challenge is to produce defect free thin films under economical aspects. Up to now, many alumina deposition processes are based on RF sputtering, typically with low deposition rates. Reactive sputtering from an aluminum target in an oxygen/argon atmosphere leads to higher deposition rates but makes a process control essential to sustain a stable process. HIPIMS offers a tool for tailoring the film properties, but the <b>reactive</b> <b>process</b> control is more challenging. Therefore, investigations were carried out using different types of a <b>reactive</b> <b>process</b> control to stabilize the process.

40|$|With {{the demand}} {{of a low}} cost and high quality TCO layer in thin films solar cell {{applications}} the need of production process for ZnO:Al films suited for large area coatings in industry became apparent. Throughout the last years strong effort {{have been made in}} order to use Al-doped ZnO films on glass as substrates for amorphous or amorphous/microcrystalline silicon solar cells. The material promises better properties compared to the conventionally used SnO 2 :F films due to the possibility of a tailored surface texture for optimized light trapping. With the rise of production capacities the first sputtering coaters for large area deposition of ZnO:Al are now being set up. On lab scale, best optical and electrical properties and etch morphologies are achieved by RF sputtering of ceramic targets. With reactive magnetron sputtering it is possible to produce high quality films on large area at low target cost, while increased demands on process control of the <b>reactive</b> <b>process</b> limit process yield and reproducibility up to now. In order to fully exploit the potential of the <b>reactive</b> sputtering <b>process,</b> the optimum operation point has to be stabilization during deposition and adjusted throughout the lifetime of the targets. Nowadays even cost efficient sintered ceramic ZnO:Al 2 O 3 targets with high conductivity can be sputtered by using DC power and thus offer an interesting alternative to the <b>reactive</b> <b>process.</b> At slightly higher costs they offer an advantage in reliability, yield and process stability.
