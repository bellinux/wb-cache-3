40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve salt {{corrosion}} and frost resistance of cement-soil, the waste tire rubber powder was mixed into cement-soil to form <b>rubberized</b> cement-soil. In the salt corrosion and freeze-thaw cycle (SCFT) conditions, compressive strength of <b>rubberized</b> cement-soil increases first and then decreases with rubber content increasing. The more numbers of SCFT cycles, the more strength slip increases. But in high concentration conditions, the strength of <b>rubberized</b> cement-soil with 5 %- 10 % rubber content reduces. With the solution concentration or SCFT cycles number increasing, peak stress of <b>rubberized</b> cement-soil and common cement-soil gradually reduces, but strength slip of <b>rubberized</b> cement-soil is lower than of cement-soil. Studies indicate that the performance of <b>rubberized</b> cement-soil surpasses common cement-soil decided by the relationship between <b>rubberized</b> cement-soil skeleton elastic behavior and coupling expansive force...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the fatigue performance of <b>rubberized</b> porous European mix (PEM) and control PEM and the influence introducing methods of crumb rubber modifier (CRM) on the fatigue performance of PEM. Four PEM mixtures were used: <b>rubberized</b> PEM in dry process, <b>rubberized</b> PEM in wet process, <b>rubberized</b> PEM with terminal blend binder, and control styrene–butadiene–styrene (SBS) modified PEM. Dynamic modulus and direct tension fatigue tests were performed with an asphalt mixture performance tester system. The fatigue test data were analyzed by the simplified viscoelastic continuum damage theory. There were four main results. First, the rutting resistance of the <b>rubberized</b> PEM in the dry process {{was similar to that}} of the wet process but slightly lower than that of the <b>rubberized</b> PEM with the terminal blend binder and SBS modified PEM. Second, the fatigue cracking resistance of the <b>rubberized</b> PEM in the dry process was {{similar to that of the}} wet process but significantly lower than those of the <b>rubberized</b> PEM with the terminal blend binder and SBS modified PEM. Third, the use of smaller size CRM and transpolyoctenamer (TOR) in the dry process may have made the properties of the dry process PEM close to those of the wet process. However, the 10 % CRM or 4. 5 % TOR used in the study could not make <b>rubberized</b> PEMs produce longer fatigue life like the control SBS modified PEM. Fourth, the introduction of SBS into <b>rubberized</b> PEM by the terminal blend method may have significantly improved the fatigue performance of PEM...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{disposal}} of used tires {{is a major}} environmental problem throughout the world which causes environmental hazards. Crumb rubber is a waste material that is ideal for use in concrete applications. The {{aim of this study}} is achieved to use of rubber waste as partial replacement of fine aggregate to produce <b>rubberize</b> concrete in M 30 mix. Different partial replacements of crumb rubber (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 %) by volume of fine aggregate are cast and test for compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength and stress-strain behavior. The results showed that there is a reduction in all type of strength for crumb rubber mixture, but slump values increase as the crumb rubber content increase from 0 % to 20 %. Meaning that crumb rubber mixture is more workable compare to normal concrete and also it is useful in making light weight concrete. It is recommended to use the rubberized concrete for non structural applications...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{is a major}} {{mechanism}} {{resulting in}} flexible pavement distress. Pavement distress results into rutting which lead to structural failure in the asphaltic roads. This is due to axle load applied {{on the surface of}} flexible roads and cause permanent pavement deformation. Saad and Ammar (2015) states that the causes of rutting and fatigue in asphalt pavement are a result of accumulation of cracks, aging of binder, repeated axial loading and environmental conditions. The asphalt surfaced roads in Butterworth experience permanent pavement deformation at the asphalt wearing course surface and this result in the decrease of the road service life. The main aim of this research is to investigate the problems associated with rutting and improve the asphalt wearing course surface by selecting the most appropriate asphalt mix design from three selected mixes of unmodified and modified asphalt parameters. These parameters are pure asphalt- 60 / 70 (unmodified control mix design), <b>rubberize</b> asphalt of rubber crumbs blended with bitumen (modified asphalt) and AE- 2 polymer modified asphalt (modified asphalt). The objectives of this study were met throught the conduction of laboratory tests which comprised a total of 18 briquettes from the 3 mix design parameters, whereby six (6) briquettes of each mix design were used to test the fatigue resistance of asphalt and its characteristics, through the use of Marshall test and Dynamic creep test. The main parameters that affected the rutting are the volumetric composition of the mix design. The asphalt mix compositions are the aggregate properties, bituminous binder properties, gradation and angularity of aggregate. The volumetric composition affects the voids in mix (VIM) and the stability of the final asphalt mix in place on the roads. The most effective asphalt mix design was rubberized asphalt. This is due to the properties of the rubber crumb binder to display good characteristics of high VIM and high stiffness thus resisting fatigue on the road. This extends the service life of asphalt roads and performs well under heavy traffic loa...|$|E

25|$|Study {{results of}} the {{long-term}} acoustic benefits of <b>rubberized</b> asphalt are inconclusive. Initial application of <b>rubberized</b> asphalt may provide 3–5 decibels (dB) reduction in tire-pavement source noise emissions; however, this translates to only 1–3 decibels (dB) in total traffic noise level reduction (due to the other components of traffic noise). Compared to traditional passive attenuating measures (e.g., noise walls and earth berms), <b>rubberized</b> asphalt provides shorter-lasting and lesser acoustic benefits at typically much greater expense.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Among the diversified use of coir geotextiles, its {{use as a}} {{protective}} covering to improve crop productivity and to reduce weed problem assumes to be much significant. An experiment has been conducted at Kumbazha, in Pathanamthitta district, Kerala, India to evaluate {{the different types of}} coir geotextiles and polythene as soil mulch. The treatments include different mulching materials like natural needled felt, black needled felt, <b>rubberized</b> coir, black polythene and transparent polythene along with a control plot (no mulch). The experiment was laid out in Completely Randomized Design with six replications. The test crops used were bhindi (var. Salkeerthi) and pineapple (var. Mauritius). The study reveals that with bhindi crop growth parameters like plant height, leaf number and lateral spread were increased by mulching with <b>rubberized</b> coir and transparent polythene. These two mulches caused early flowering and increased fruit yield. Coir materials as mulch recorded a yield increase ranging from 67 to 196 %. Observations also reveal that weeds were not grown in plots mulched with black polythene, transparent polythene and <b>rubberized</b> coir. <b>Rubberized</b> coir as mulch enhanced the fruit yield in the case of pineapple, which is followed by natural needled felt and transparent polythene. Black polythene resisted weed growth up to 7 MAP, whereas <b>rubberized</b> coir and transparent polythene suppressed weeds up to 8 MAP. Though the weeds were grown in other treatments the weeds count was significantly lower than that of control plot. Mulching with transparent polythene enhanced the soil temperature whereas <b>rubberized</b> coir lowered soil temperature. More over all mulched treatments had a favourable influence in increasing soil moisture. Observing the biodegradability and eco-friendly nature of coir it could be inferred that <b>rubberized</b> coir can serve as good mulch for bhindi and pineapple with minimum weed problem...|$|R

In this study, by treating the crumb rubber with Polyacrylamide (PAM), we have improved properties of the <b>rubberized</b> mortar. Specifically, the compressive and flexural strengths of the specimen at 56 days were improved up to 19 % and 27 %, respectively. Dramatically, the anti-corrosion property of this new <b>rubberized</b> mortar is much superior to that of the original mortar. The addition of rubber also turned crack from fragility crack to ductility crack. To show the impacts of PAM modification, the specimens of <b>rubberized</b> mortar with and without PAM modification, were observed with SEM images. Experimental results showed that PAM treatment of crumb rubber is an effective means to improve the mechanical properties of the <b>rubberized</b> mortar; lends itself to possible commercial applications...|$|R
