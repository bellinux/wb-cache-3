40|$|Mean {{temperatures}} for {{the normal}} period (1961 - 90) from 513 stations in Sweden, {{together with their}} geographical positions, are used to derive temperature sums and average lengths of the growing season for different threshold values as functions of latitude and altitude. Maps are drawn showing the distribution of these temperature indices. Swedish <b>regional</b> <b>average</b> forest <b>yield</b> is well correlated with the temperature sums for the threshold value 5 °C (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0. 89). Solar radiation data for the period 1983 - 91 from 14 stations in Sweden are used to estimate global radiation reaching the earth's surface during clear days and during days irrespective of cloudiness. This data set {{is also used to}} derive global radiation sums expressed as functions of latitude and altitude. Corrections for an approximate adjustment of temperature indices to the soil surface level and with respect to local continentality/maritimity are proposed.

30|$|The {{regional}} differences manifest {{themselves in the}} <b>average</b> <b>regional</b> <b>yields.</b> In the period of 2003 to 2008, the <b>average</b> winter wheat <b>yield</b> south of Hanover was always above 8 t/ha, above 7 t/ha south of Oldenburg and generally below 7 t/ha in the north-east. Maize yields behave rather similarly, with dry maize silage (33 % dry matter content) having the best yields to the south. The margin between the different parts of LS is, however, smaller for maize than for wheat and varies generally around 15 t/ha. As {{can be seen in}} Figure 4, the areas with the largest maize production coincide with areas where only little wheat is grown and where feed for livestock is in high demand.|$|R
30|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} in designing weather index insurance in developing countries {{is the lack of}} long term yield and weather data (Osgood et al. 2007; Kapphan 2011). In some cases, the level of aggregation of yield data is also a problem. Some researchers argue that it is more accurate to include yield or input use data (for calibrating indices) derived from plot level information/surveys than taking <b>regional</b> or national <b>average</b> <b>yield</b> or input use. For instance, Laajaj and Carter (2009) find that basis risk could be minimized using the village level area-yield index derived from plot and household level survey data. Morduch (2006) shows the relevance of long-term data on the same households through randomized location decisions to see the benefits of weather index insurance for the poor. However, care should be taken in any form of calibrating weather index insurance to non-weather variables since this will alter natural covariate relationships between weather and loss. Instead, the more practical approach is to allow a suite of products with different triggers that can be offered to farm households with different risk requirements and needs (Turvey and McLaurin 2012).|$|R
40|$|The {{challenges}} to food security posed by climate change require unprecedented efforts {{and ability to}} simulate and predict the interactions between crop growth dynamics, and the environment and crop management at various scales. This calls for model coupling and fusion efforts, which aims to explore the interaction of agro-ecological processes across different scales. In this research, we proposed a coupling framework between two widely used crop models, the process-based and site-specific Decision Support System for Agro-Technology Transfer (DSSAT) model, and the cropping zone centered Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ) model, with the intention to establish a coupling procedure between them, and to consequently enhance the micro foundation and improve {{the performance of the}} AEZ model. The procedure takes three major steps: (1) derive, calibrate and validate the key cultivar parameters using DSSAT, (2) translate these cultivar parameters into AEZ eco-physiological parameters and validate them using AEZ and DSSAT, (3) apply AEZ with these enhanced eco-physiological parameters and compare the new results with the old ones. An illustrative application of this procedure to japonica rice production in Northeast China is carried out for individual year between 1980 and 1999. The application results in a significant improvement in the spatial performance of the AEZ model. Calibration of the crop genetic parameters increases <b>regional</b> <b>average</b> potential <b>yield</b> from 6. 5 t/ha, which is substantially lower than the observed yield of 7. 3 t/ha in 2000 to 9. 3 t/ha. Predicted rice planting areas using the refined AEZ parameterization expands significantly to coincide with the paddy field map of 2000 generated by remote sensing applications. Importantly, the procedure presents a convenient way to update the AEZ model with calibrated genetic parameters, which reflecting observed technological progresses at farm sites...|$|R
40|$|Ability to make large-area yield {{prediction}} before {{harvest is}} important in many aspects of agricultural decision-making. In this study, canopy reflectance band ratios (NIR/RED, NIR/GRN) of paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) at booting stage, from field measurements conducted from 1999 to 2005, were correlated with the corresponding yield data to derive regression-type yield prediction models {{for the first and}} second season crop, respectively. These yield models were then validated with ground truth measurements conducted in 2007 and 2008 at eight sites, of different soil properties, climatic conditions, and various treatments in cultivars planted and N application rates, using surface reflectance retrieved from atmospherically corrected SPOT imageries. These validation tests indicated that root mean square error of predicting grain yields per unit area by the proposed models were less than 0. 7 T ha(- 1) for both cropping seasons. Since village is the basic unit for national rice yield census statistics in Taiwan, the yield models were further used to forecast <b>average</b> <b>regional</b> <b>yields</b> for 14 selected villages and compared with officially reported data. Results indicate that the <b>average</b> <b>yield</b> per unit area at village scale can be forecasted with a root mean square error of 1. 1 T ha(- 1) provided no damaging weather occurred during the final month before actual harvest. The methodology can be applied to other optical sensors with similar spectral bands in the visible/near-infrared and to different geographical regions provided that the relation between yield and spectral index is established.

30|$|Cultivated lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) is an {{important}} cool-season legume, particularly within countries in North America, Australia, South Asia, West Asia, and North Africa [9]. The seeds are a cheap source of protein with a high vitamin and mineral content, thus contributing to the fight against hidden hunger. However, lentil yields are generally low. The most recent available data show that globally in 2014, 4.5  million tons of lentils was produced on 4.8  million hectares of land [10] for an <b>average</b> <b>yield</b> of 0.94  tons ha− 1.
