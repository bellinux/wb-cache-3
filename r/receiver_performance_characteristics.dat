The results include typical <b>receiver</b> <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as time-to-first-fix (TTFF), time-to-lock (TTL) for cold, warm and hot starts, as well as acquisition and reacquisition performance and receiver sensitivity. Testing for low earth orbit operation was performed using a Spirent GPS simulator that was used to generate scenarios. Many of the tests were performed multiple times (20 to 100 times) to ensure the results are statistically meaningful. As this receiver is designed to operate in a space environment, navigation performance as well as baseline solution was analysed...|$|E

Area under the ROC curve is another measure of test performance. All of these parameters are not intrinsic to the test and are determined by the clinical context in which the test is employed. High sensitivity corresponds to high negative predictive value and is the ideal property of a “rule-out” test. High specificity corresponds to high positive predictive value and is the ideal property of a “rule-in” test.

A DES-DT system with pulsed X-rays and rapid kV switching was used to examine calcifications in simulated pulmonary nodules. Low-voltage, high-voltage, and soft-tissue or bone-subtracted tomograms of the desired layer thicknesses were reconstructed from the image data acquired during a single tomographic scan, bone-subtracted images, and a scan angle of 40 °.

For DES-DT, the SNR for the simulated pulmonary nodules increased about 63 %.

40|$|The {{major role}} of {{angiogenesis}} in cancer development has driven many researchers {{to investigate the}} prospects of noninvasive cancer imaging based on assessment of microvascular perfusion. The limited results so far {{may be caused by}} the complex and contradictory effects of angiogenesis on perfusion. Alternatively, assessment of ultrasound contrast agent dispersion kinetics, resulting from features such as density and tortuosity, has shown a promising potential to characterize angiogenic effects on the microvascular structure. This method, referred to as contrast-ultrasound dispersion imaging (CUDI), is based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging after an intravenous contrast agent bolus injection. In this paper, we propose a new spatiotemporal correlation analysis to perform CUDI. We provide the rationale for indirect estimation of local dispersion by deriving the analytical relation between dispersion and the correlation coefficient among neighboring time-intensity curves obtained at each pixel. This robust analysis is inherently normalized and does not require curve-fitting.

Under IEEE 802. 11 a 5 GHz WLAN standard, OFDM was chosen as the modulation scheme for transmission because of its well-known ability to avoid multi-path effects while achieving high data rates. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the performance of the IEEE 802. 11 a WLAN standard receiver over flat fading Nakagami channels in a worst case, pulse-noise jamming environment, for the different combinations of modulation type (binary and non-binary modulation) and code rate specified by the WLAN standard. <b>Receiver</b> <b>performance</b> with Viterbi soft decision decoding (SDD) will be analyzed for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) alone and for AWGN plus pulse-noise jamming. Moreover, the performance of the IEEE 802. 11 a WLAN standard receiver will be examined both in the scenario where perfect side information is considered to be available (optimum receiver) and when it is not (sub-optimum receiver). In the sub-optimum receiver scenario, the <b>receiver</b> <b>performance</b> is examined both when noise-normalization is utilized and when it is not.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a joint hashing/watermarking scheme {{in which a}} short hash of the host signal is available to a detector. Potential applications include content tracking on public networks and forensic identification. The host data into which the watermark is embedded are selected from a secret subset of the full-frame discrete cosine transform of an image, and the watermark is inserted through multiplicative embedding. The hash is a binary version of selected original image coefficients. We propose a maximum-likelihood watermark detector based on a statistical image model. The availability of a hash as side information to the detector modifies the posterior distribution of the marked coefficients. We derive Chernoff bounds on the <b>receiver</b> operating <b>characteristic</b> <b>performance</b> of the detector. We show that host-signal interference can be rejected if the hash function is suitably designed. The relative difficulty of an eavesdropper’s detection problem is also determined; the eavesdropper does not know the secret key used. Monte Carlo simulations are performed using photographic test images. Finally, various attacks on the watermarked image are introduced to study the robustness of the derived detectors. The joint hashing/watermarking scheme outperforms the traditional “hashless ” watermarking technique.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis {{is devoted to}} analyzing the problem of masking a reflected radar signal, in order to degrade the radar <b>receiver's</b> <b>performance.</b> This is to be accomplished by appropriately choosing the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a power constrained colored noise interference to be generated either by the target itself or by pre-positioned "friendly" noise makers. The goal in either case is to generate interference signals that result in decreased receiver probability of detection, P(D), for a given receiver probability of false alarm, P(F). Efforts to identify appropriate PSD's of the power constrained interference were carried out by evaluating the receivers' P(D) {{as a function of}} P(F) for two specific target models. The performance results for the various receivers investigated demonstrate that the noise interference generated by the noise makers can achieve significant levels of degradation, while the target generated noise interference tends to improve rather than degrade the radar <b>receiver's</b> <b>performance.</b> In all cases considered, the sine squared shaped noise interference PSD is more effective at degrading the <b>receiver</b> <b>performance</b> than any other kind of PSD analyzed.

This paper addresses two issues {{in the context of}} direct-sequence code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems: i) linear minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) channel estimation based on a pilot transmission and ii) impact of channel estimation errors on coherent <b>receiver</b> <b>performance.</b> A simple characterization of the MMSE estimator in terms of a bank of filters is derived. A key channel <b>characteristic</b> controlling system <b>performance</b> is the normalized coherence time, which is approximately the number of symbols over which the channel remains strongly correlated. It is shown that the estimator performance is characterized by an effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) —the product of the pilot SNR and the normalized coherence time. A simple uniform averaging estimator is also proposed that is easy to implement and delivers near-optimal performance if properly designed. The receivers analyzed in this paper are based on a time–frequency RAKE structure that exploits joint multipath-Doppler diversity. It is shown that the overall <b>receiver</b> <b>performance</b> is controlled by two competing effects: shorter coherence times lead to degraded channel estimation but improved inherent <b>receiver</b> <b>performance</b> due to Doppler diversity, with opposite effects for longer coherence times. Our results demonstrate that exploiting Doppler diversity can significantly mitigate the error probability floors that plague conventional CDMA receivers under fast fading due to errors in channel estimation.
