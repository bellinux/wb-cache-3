50|$|Original {{plans for}} XX Bomber Command to employ two combat wings in China (the 58th and 73rd Combat Bomb Wings) were changed on 2 March 1944 when limited numbers of {{operational}} B-29s resulted in only the 58th CBW assigned.

50|$|AO-7 was {{the second}} Phase 2 {{satellite}} (Phase II-B). At launch, the satellite had a mass of 28.6 kg and it was placed into a 1444 x 1459 km orbit. It is shaped as an octahedron 360 mm high and 424 mm in diameter. It has a circularly-polarized, canted turnstile VHF/UHF antenna system and HF dipole. Four radio masts mounted at 90 degree intervals {{on the base of}} the satellite and two experimental repeater systems provided store-and-forward for Morse code and teletype messages ("codestore") as it orbited around the world.

The ALSEP <b>Redundant</b> <b>Command</b> Receiver {{is a solid}} state receiver with active redundancy {{that may be used}} to receive either PM or PM-FM type signals. This receiver includes two identical electrically separate receivers, consisting of an r £ converter, and IF and Audio Amp, and a power isolator. In addition, the redundant receiver has an rf power divider referred to an an rf coupler, and a selection circuit referred as an audio combiner. The failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis shows, in a systematic way, the effect of part, pin, and receiver redundancy on system performance. Specifically these analyses have identified the only single point failure mechanism, have showed which piece part failure modes result in minor degradation at most and may be eliminated from the reliability calculation, and have verified that Receivers A and B are failure isolated.

40|$|A data-communication {{protocol}} {{has been}} devised to enable secure, reliable remote control of processes and equipment via a collision-based network, while using minimal bandwidth and computation. The network {{could be the}} Internet or an intranet. Control is made secure by use of both a password and a dynamic key, which is sent transparently to a remote user by the controlled computer (that is, the computer, located {{at the site of}} the equipment or process to be controlled, that exerts direct control over the process). The protocol functions in the presence of network latency, overcomes errors caused by missed dynamic keys, and defeats attempts by unauthorized remote users to gain control. The protocol is not suitable for real-time control, but is well suited for applications in which control latencies up to about 0. 5 second are acceptable. The encryption scheme involves the use of both a dynamic and a private key, without any additional overhead that would degrade performance. The dynamic key is embedded in the equipment- or process-monitor data packets sent out by the controlled computer: in other words, the dynamic key is a subset of the data in each such data packet. The controlled computer maintains a history of the last 3 to 5 data packets for use in decrypting incoming control commands. In addition, the controlled computer records a private key (password) that is given to the remote computer. The encrypted incoming command is permuted by both the dynamic and private key. A person who records the command data in a given packet for hostile purposes cannot use that packet after the public key expires (typically within 3 seconds). Even a person in possession of an unauthorized copy of the command/remote-display software cannot use that software in the absence of the password. The use of a dynamic key embedded in the outgoing data makes the central-processing unit overhead very small. The use of a National Instruments DataSocket(TradeMark) (or equivalent) protocol or the User Datagram Protocol makes it possible to obtain reasonably short response times: Typical response times in event-driven control, using packets sized. 300 bytes, are < 0. 2 second for commands issued from locations anywhere on Earth. The protocol requires that control commands represent absolute values of controlled parameters (e. g., a specified temperature), as distinguished from changes in values of controlled parameters (e. g., a specified increment of temperature). Each command is issued three or more times to ensure delivery in crowded networks. The use of absolute-value <b>commands</b> prevents additional (<b>redundant)</b> <b>commands</b> from causing trouble. Because a remote controlling computer receives "talkback" in the form of data packets from the controlled computer, typically within a time interval < or = 1 s, the controlling computer can re-issue a command if network failure has occurred. The controlled computer, the process or equipment that it controls, and any human operator(s) {{at the site of the}} controlled equipment or process should be equipped with safety measures to prevent damage to equipment or injury to humans. These features could be a combination of software, external hardware, and intervention by the human operator(s). The protocol is not fail-safe, but by adopting these safety measures as part of the protocol, one makes the protocol a robust means of controlling remote processes and equipment by use of typical office computers via intranets and/or the Internet...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe INTELSAT V {{communications}} satellite {{was designed and}} assembled by the Ford Aerospace and Communications Corporation of Palo Alto, California, for the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (INTELSAT). The Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT) is the designated United States representative to INTELSAT and also performs technical service for INTELSAT in monitoring the design, fabrication, and test of {{communications satellite}}s. The TT&C subsystem consists of two functionally <b>redundant</b> and independent <b>command</b> and telemetry channels, the major elements of which are shown in Figure 1. The telemetry subsystem provides two data channels for formatting and transmitting data received from sensors, transducers, and status indicators in the various subsystems of the spacecraft. In addition, the output of a command receiver can be connected to a telemetry transmitter to form a ranging transponder. The telemetry unit can provide normal or dwell PCM data in NRZ-M format modulated on a 32 KHz subcarrier. The telemetry transmitter phase modulates one of the data subcarriers or ranging tones on a 4 GHz band downlink carrier. The transmitter output is routed directly to an earth coverage conical horn for transmission {{at a level of}} approximately 0. 0 dbW. The transmitter output can also be routed through a zone communications channel TWTA to a telemetry omni-directional bicone antenna for extended coverage. Commands and ranging tones are received on a 6 GHz band uplink carrier through dual Omni pattern antennas. The received signal is routed through a passive filter to the two command receivers where the frequency modulated command or ranging tones are detected. The command tones are routed to the command units for processing. The command transmission is either a command message, consisting of 58 serial bit, or a command execute. The command message includes the address of the command unit which is to be used and what specific command function is to be executed. The command units provide the capability for pulse, discrete relay, and proportional relay command functions required by the various subsystems of the spacecraft...|$|R

The project was initiated in the summer of 1987 and has involved several dozen undergraduate students. SURFSAT is designed to radiate at either the milliwatt or microwatt level in four bands: Sband (2. 29 GHz), X-band (8. 45 GHz), Ku-band (15. 33 GHz) and Ka-band (32 GHz). The signals will be received by a new 34 -meter DSN research antenna at Goldstone, California. Performance of the new Ku-band link will be analyzed and compared to the performance of the more standard X-band link. The S-band and Ku-band signals will be used to support DSN spacecraft acquisition tests and training. Other experiment objectives have also been identified, including spacecraft position and orbit determination demonstrations utilizing ground-based connected-element interferometers. It will also carry an optical beacon to demonstrate the possibility of communicating at infra-red wavelengths. The basic SURFSAT satellite is a solar powered cube, 12 inches on each side, that will tumble through space. Attitude stabilization is not required, and the satellites will not have a propulsion subsystem or batteries. Signals are to be radiated in all directions. <b>Redundant</b> <b>command</b> receivers will enable transmit modes of one milliwatt, one microwatt, and OFF.
