40|$|Traditionally, it {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that current reinvestments leads to future growth, and hence that there exists a negative relationship between dividend payout ratios and subsequent <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> at both the company and market level. Surprisingly, more recent research found {{a positive relationship between}} these two variables, rationalised in terms of management signalling positive future prospects through higher dividend payouts. Following the methodology developed by Arnott and Asness (2003), this study conducted an analysis in to which hypothesis is supported at the market level (proxied by the All Share Index) in South Africa, and how these findings compared to international market level findings. Furthermore, the findings were analysed {{within the context of the}} political and economic conditions unique to the South African market over the 1960 - 2014 study period. The results indicated a negative relationship between the payout ratio and subsequent <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> from 1960 to 2014. When the time period was subdivided into periods before and after 1994 (a year considered to be a structural break in South African political-economic history), a positive relationship was found from 1960 - 1994, while a negative relationship was found from 1994 - 2014. The possible explanations for this contradiction were investigated. For the counterintuitive pre- 1994 result, several literature-based tests were conducted in order to eliminate possible explanations other than the link between payout ratio and <b>earnings</b> <b>growth.</b> Firstly, the tests were repeated for three and five year <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> periods. With regard to the five year period, although the coefficient for the payout ratio was positive from 1960 - 2014, the results were statistically insignificant. The subdivided regression periods, 1960 - 1994 and 1994 - 2014, also indicated less significant results. For the three year <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> period, the regression test generated positive coefficients for the payout ratio variable for all the time periods, with both sub-periods being statistically significant. The difference between the ten and three year subsequent <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> findings may have been as a result of South Africa companies making better long-term (ten year) than short-term (three year) investments during that time period. In addition, the possible impact of share repurchases, earnings yields as <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> predictors (i. e. the market valuation impact), and the possible role of mean reversion were all either considered, or statistically tested. Although the former two played no role, it was found that mean reversion was a statistically stronger predictor of future <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> on the index level than payout ratio. As the above result s differ not only from most (but not all) international studies, and also from the one company-level study previously conducted for South Africa, these differences were further investigated. In terms of the latter, it was found that the most likely reason for the discrepancy was that the previous researcher, who confined her study to JSE-listed industrial stocks, used nominal <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> data as opposed to real growth data. It is argued that this is an incorrect approach. Nonetheless, given that means reversion is as good, if not a better, predictor of <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> at the market level in South Africa, the traditional hypothesis that a higher payout ratio implies <b>reduced</b> future <b>earnings</b> <b>growth,</b> cannot be ruled out for the JSE...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} documents a large dispersion {{in long-term}} <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecasts among financial analysts covering the same stock. This suggests that while analysts believe long-term <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> is predictable, they face significant uncertainty when estimating it. This thesis examines the effect long-term <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecast dispersion {{has on the}} firm that receives long-term <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecasts, and investors who follow analysts’ stock recommendations based on valuations that incorporate long-term <b>earnings</b> <b>growth.</b> The first essay examines determinants of voluntary <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> guidance by management, and investigates analysts’ reactions to the guidance. The second essay examines trading strategies based on superior analysts’ long-term <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecasts. The results of the first essay indicate that there is pervasive upward bias in managers’ <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> guidance. As {{a result of this}} bias, managers are more likely to issue <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecasts in years of negative short-term earnings surprises and when analysts have low initial long-term <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecasts. The finding that managements’ <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecasts primarily convey good news is in contrast to the generally negative nature of management short-term earnings guidance, and suggests that different incentives drive firms’ disclosure of different financial information. Moreover, analysts respond to managements’ <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> guidance by increasing their long-term <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecasts. This finding sheds new light on the over-optimism hypothesis in analysts’ long-term <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecasts, suggesting the bias could be management induced. However, with regard to analysts’ response, the findings suggest that analysts sacrifice precision in long-term <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecasts for deliberate upward bias. This bias is not subject to ex post scrutiny and is designed to maintain or increase analysts’ target prices, even though short-term earnings may warrant a lower target price. Results in the second essay show a contemporaneous association between long-term <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecast accuracy, one-year ahead earnings forecast accuracy, and stock recommendation profitability. Despite these results, a model that predicts the profitability of future stock recommendations based on the analyst’s historical one-yea ahead earnings forecast accuracy and long-term <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> forecast accuracy, is not found...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide {{evidence}} {{on the relationship between}} payout ratio and future <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> in companies listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. This thesis addresses the lack of studies globally on the predictive nature of payout policy on future <b>earnings</b> <b>growth,</b> especially in Finland where the subject has not been studied previously to this extent to the knowledge of the author. New evidence is provided on the relationship that exists between payout ratio and <b>earnings</b> <b>growth,</b> and other variables seen to affect <b>earnings</b> <b>growth.</b> The study follows closely and earlier study conducted Zhou and Ruland (2006) in the US market. The data employed in this study is sourced from the Thomson One Banker database in addition to which data was gathered manually. The sample consists of companies listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange between the years 2000 - 2010. The final sample consists of 398 firms years and 47 companies. The relationship between dividend payout ratio and <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> is studied with a multiple regression on three levels; one year, three year and five year growth. The independent variables considered in the study are company size, leverage, return on assets, earnings yield, lagged <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> and future asset growth. In addition, tests on the robustness of the results were conducted on an alternative measure of earnings, additional measures of past <b>earnings</b> <b>growth,</b> asset growth and abundance of growth opportunities. Payout ratio is found to be positively associated with future <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> on one, three and five-year <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> periods. Results are statistically significant on one and three-year growth periods. The results of the study do not find support for mean reversion in earnings or the free cash flow theory, which have been previously suggested as explanations for the positive association between <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> and payout ratio. Instead, the tests of robustness indicate that payout ratio can only explain <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> on the one-year period. When lagged <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> and asset growth are controlled for on more than one growth period, both variables subsume the explanatory power of payout ratio indicating growth in asset, i. e. investment and lagged <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> explain future <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> more than payout ratio does...|$|R
