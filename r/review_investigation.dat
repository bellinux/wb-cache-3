40|$|OBJECTIVE: To <b>review</b> <b>investigation</b> and {{management}} of some common long-term complications associated with cancer chemotherapy and radiation therapy. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Databases searched using MeSH key words "cancer chemotherapy," "cancer chemotherapy complications," "radiation therapy," and "radiation therapy complications" included Ovid and CANCERLIT. Overall the literature {{in this area is}} not strong; treatment guidelines and consensus conferences generally are lacking. Recommendations in this paper are mainly {{based on the results of}} individual studies and case reports, as few randomized controlled trials have been performed. Where appropriate, recommendations incorporate results of published treatment guidelines and consensus conferences. MAIN MESSAGE: For most solid tumours, patients should be most frequently monitored during the first 3 years after completing initial treatment for cure. Follow-up monitoring usually incorporates physical examination as well as radiologic and laboratory investigations. Patients should not be lost to follow up once treatment is completed, but monitored regularly, especially while they are at highest risk for disease recurrence. Long-term complications associated with cancer therapy include postsplenectomy sepsis syndrome; central and peripheral nervous system toxicities; ocular complications; thyroid, pituitary, testicular, or ovarian dysfunction; pulmonary toxicity; vascular or lymphatic, gastrointestinal, or osseous complications; genitourinary problems; and possible secondary malignancy. CONCLUSION: Primary care physicians are key to facilitating appropriate follow up of treated cancer patients. To do this, they must be aware of practical aspects of monitoring {{and management}} of therapy-related complications...|$|E
40|$|Paper Session - China's New Dynamics of Urbanization, Migration, and Labor Market Reform: II: {{abstract}} no. 44243 Urban {{governance in}} western countries transformed significantly from managerialism to entrepreneurialism {{over the past two}} decades. In China, with the adoption of 'market socialism' since late 1970 s, central government has carried out new policies to establish new industrial areas including development zones to attract foreign direct investments. The new industrial area becomes economy entity endowed with administrative power which brings about new urban governance pattern. In this paper, we take Tianjin Binhai New Area-a typical rapidly developing new district in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region as an example, and analyze the basic operation mechanisms and institutional cooperation through literature <b>review,</b> <b>investigation</b> and interviews of management committee. It is indicated that urban governance in Tianjin Binhai New Area is institutional and spatial fragmented, which improves flexibility and efficiency in attracting investment but results in new governance form. The traditional top-down route pushed by local government is not fit for new industrial area. In addition, the rise of entrepreneurialism governance is discussed. Conflicts and competition between different functional districts have emerged, including competing for investments, conflicts in infrastructure construction and industrial structure. To solve such problems, the study examines the increasing cooperation among hierarchical management organizations, including primary land development, district promotion and building transportation network, and argues that more institutional cooperation among management agencies, non-state organizations and private sectors is needed to achieve effective urban governance in new industrial area. link_to_OA_fulltextAnnual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers (AAG), New York City, N.

Anna Croiset van der Kop versus Reinder van der Meulen This article explores the {{controversy in the}} beginning of the 20 th century between de Dutch slavists Anna Croiset van der Kop and Reindert van der Meulen, author of the book De Hollandsche Zee- en Scheepstermen in het Russisch (Dutch Nautical Terms in Russian). After publication, she reacted with an undeniably negative and unusually elaborate review (72 pages!), written not in Dutch, but in Russian and published in one of the most leading, scientific series in Russia. Van der Meulen has never directly reacted to this review: in 1959 he published a supplement to his earlier work from 1909 : Nederlandse woorden in het Russisch (Dutch words in Russian), not mentioning Croiset van der Kops name, nor her review. Obviously he felt hurt by her merciless criticism. The article focuses on the motives underlying her strong reaction. It will be argued that her severe criticism was not really inspired by Van der Meulen’s subject, but by his failing research methods. Furthermore, it will be pointed out that this review seemed to offer her an opportunity to measure up to her Dutch colleagues and to present herself internationally as a slavist. On the basis of the now available data it is hard to say, which motives really brought Croiset van der Kop to write her <b>review.</b> <b>Investigation</b> of her archives, preserved in St- Petersburg, and until now hardly studied, may perhaps reveal her real motives. </p...|$|E

These patients had been recruited for a medication <b>review</b> <b>investigation</b> throughout a period of 12 months over the period April 2003 until April 2004. Patient information was acquired by connecting the medical record with the complete prescription record and pharmaceutical record. Each patient was assessed twice by two independent reviewers {{on the basis of a}} patient profile in combination with the extracted medical record and using a structured procedure. A summed MAI score, percent agreement, kappa, positive and negative agreement as well as intra-class correlation coefficient were calculated for each criterion. Medication appropriateness was assessed with the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) by an independent panel of Dutch hospital and community pharmacists. The overall percentage agreement was 83 %. For each of the 10 different medication appropriateness questions it ranged from 79 to 100 % for appropriate and from 47 to 60 % for inappropriate ratings. The overall chance adjusted inter-rater agreement reached a moderate kappa score of 0. 47. The overall intra-group agreement was very good with an overall percentage of 98 and a kappa score of at least 0. 84 (all schemes).

40|$|With the {{awareness}} of sustainability in the built environment, implementing natural ventilation to provide cooling has become revitalized. But maintaining a healthy indoor environment, especially for those high-rise residential buildings, could be an issue. The purpose of this review is to systematically <b>review</b> <b>investigation</b> methods (On-site measurements, physical scale modeling (wind tunnel and water channel experiments) and different computational fluid dynamics turbulence models (DNS, RANS and LES) for these practical concerns and knowledge gaps with regard to air flow around building and to indentify effective investigation methods with the ultimate goal to find optimum ventilation for HRR buildings. Physical scale modeling can be more controllable for airflow and building configurations, but the accuracies {{of them are still}} arguable. On-site measurement is a somewhat dear approach. Regarding to its accuracy, it still could under-predict the roof concentration. CFD is a fast, cost effective, risk reduction and safe method for examining the issue regarding to airflow and pollutant dispersion around the building. But the accuracies of each different turbulence model are different. DNS can provide the most accurate results in finite volume calculations; but it is impractical for simulations due to large computational requirements. LES can over-predict the lateral pollutant concentration in the wake region of the building and requires somewhat larger computational demand and times. Although RANS is the most commonly used model for pollutant dispersion and infection control issues, it over-predicts surface concentrations downwind of the sources. The research also discovered that the vertical cross contaminant dispersion has not been widely studied, especially on the high-rise buildings, and the concentration fluctuation rates in the unsteady atmospheric environment has been missed.

40|$|During the {{transition}} of the XIX to the XXth century, several changes {{took place in the}} dominant moral psychiatric paradigm. In the movement, that opposes the former romantic and normative vision of behaviour and intentions, the primacy of observation and description emerges as a superior clinical method, organizing knowledge and investigation. Kraepelin in one of the main figures that emerges, with a remarkable masterpiece, his "Treatise of Psychiatry", including several editions, each one resulting in reformulations according to the new data he obtained. Comparing Kraepelin's work - or other contemporary authors - with posterior essays on thought and language in shizophrenia would be incongruous, because the irreducibility of a clinical to an experimental method. The aim of this paper is merely to show the relation between clinical descriptions and the resulting hypothesis or constructs. Description is viewed as a systematic exploration of the psychopathological reality and an important source of scientific intuitions. This is what has happened with the work of Kraepelin, Bleuler and many others, from which we can extrapolate the ideas for knowledge produced in laboratorial context. In particular, we shall <b>review</b> <b>investigation</b> data about thought and language, produced between the sixties and the eighties, a very fertile scientific period in this area of knowledge and, which has, almost disappeared. In fact, today's literaure about thought diosorder in schizophrenia is based predominantly on the neuropsychological paradigm with the use of test batteries that evaluate cognitive deficits. The importance of this perspective is that it enables the development of response indicators with the psychopharmacological therapies and the implementation of rehabilitation programs. However, it doesn't contain the richness of the period mentioned earlier.

SSA is required to administer its disability programs in a fair and unbiased manner. Nevertheless, the proportion of African American applicants allowed benefits has been historically lower than the proportion of white applicants. These allowances rate differences have occurred with respect to disability determinations made by state Disability Determination Service offices and in decisions made at the hearings level by Administrative Law Judges (ALJ). In response to GAO's 1992 report, SSA initiated an extensive study of racial disparities in ALJ decisions, but methodological weaknesses preclude conclusions being drawn from it. The study [...] the results of which were not published [...] set out to analyze {{a representative sample of}} cases to determine whether race significantly influenced disability decisions, while simultaneously controlling for other factors. SSA officials told GAO that, by 1998, they found no evidence that race significantly influenced ALJ decisions. However, GAO was unable to draw these same conclusions due to weaknesses in sampling and statistical methods evident in the limited documentation still available for GAO's review. Concurrent with SSA's study of racial disparities, SSA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) took some limited steps at the hearings level to address possible racial bias in ALJ decision-making. OHA instituted a mandatory diversity sensitivity training course for ALJs. Additionally, OHA increased its efforts to recruit minorities for ALJ and other legal positions by attending conferences for minority bar associations, where SSA distributed information and gave seminars on how to become an ALJ. Finally, in keeping with its commitment to provide fair and impartial hearings, SSA established a new process under the direction of OHA for the <b>review,</b> <b>investigation,</b> and resolution of claimant complaints about alleged bias or misconduct by ALJs. ...|$|E

Recognizing that unsafe environments impact learning, school administrators have been forced to address an increasing number of safety concerns within the high school setting. These concerns include school shootings and other violent crimes, increasing signs of student alienation and disconnect from school, high incidents of harassment and bullying behaviors, lack of student support systems, and weakening adult/student relationships at home and at school. This study addressed these concerns with an investigation into the working, safe-school climate strategies, supportive variables, trends, and important recommendations that were embedded in the literature's documented conversations and research findings regarding safe schools and high school climates. The methods employed in this literature <b>review</b> <b>investigation</b> combined both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Spanning the years around the Columbine shooting, 1995 through 2003, 204 literature sources were explored. The safe-school climate sources included textbooks; books and reports from states, the United States government, and other countries; state and national educational membership association books and journals; newspapers; and additional books and journals from book stores and university libraries. Four climate dimensions, ecology, milieu, organization, and culture, served as a literature framework. A detailed coding system, including letters and symbols, was developed to identify and categorize 39 safe-school climate variables and 11 federal recommendations. A massive literature cross-reference matrix was assimilated to show the changes in variable focus over time. The literature review findings, regarding the 39 variables and 11 federal recommendations for safe schools, provided valuable strategies for administrators to utilize. However, 26 of the 39 variables and 6 of the 11 federal recommendations became a definite nonfocus in the literature over time. Administrators often turned to the literature sources to address current and future challenges. Therefore, it was imperative that useful information and recommendations be uncovered in the literature. High school administrators must do everything they possibly can to promote a safe-school environment. This study was significant because it revealed the literature's multiple safe-school climate variables, strategies, and recommendations for administrators to utilize as they searched for new ways to make their schools safer for all students...|$|E
