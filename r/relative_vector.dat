50|$|User {{selected}} Targets are initially highlighted with a {{small box}} whilst MARPA resolves the relative motion by comparing the relative motion of the target on the screen with the true, actual motion (speed) of the tracking vessel. Once resolved the acquiring box will become either a Circle for safe targets or a triangle for dangerous targets. MARPA can indicate further information with 2 very different but similar looking vectors: True Vectors and Relative Vectors. True heading and speed of a target can be ascertained with a True Vector, {{the length of the}} line indicates the distance the target will actually cover per duration of vector, usually 6 or 3 minutes (this is user selectable) although, range permitting, the 6 minute vectors provide quicker mental calculation of speed. E.g. True 6min vector (TV6) of 0.75 NM indicates the target's true speed is 7.5 Knots, the direction of this vector indicates the vessels heading relative to the tracking vessel or its electronically fed heading if one exists. The relative motion of a target can be seen with Relative vectors, these just show the future position of the target on the Radar screen as per Vector Duration, again usually 6 or 3 minutes depending on range in use. A <b>relative</b> <b>vector</b> of 6 minutes (RV6) would be a line representing the movement of the target for the next 6 minutes. Most colour Radar displays can show both TV and RV simultaneously. It is essential that users of MARPA do not get confused between RV and TV, especially on Radars that can not display both TV and RV. True vectors allow users to, at a glance, determine the aspect of a target, something that is virtually impossible to do without manually plotting, Relative vectors provide users with, at a glance, information about which vessels pose a collision risk, a RV pointing at the centre of the Radar screen indicates there is a risk of collision. All the information pertaining to a target is also available numerically however when tracking multiple targets this information distracts the user from the image, with proper training, viewing vectors is much safer.|$|E

We construct a sequential algorithm for portfolio investment that asymptotically achieves {{the wealth of the}} best piecewise constant rebalanced portfolio tuned to the underlying individual sequence of price <b>relative</b> <b>vectors.</b> Without knowledge of the investment duration, the algorithm can perform as well as the best investment algorithm that can choose both the partitioning of the sequence of the price <b>relative</b> <b>vectors</b> as well as the best constant rebalanced portfolio within each segment based on knowledge of the sequence of price <b>relative</b> <b>vectors</b> in advance.

The regret with respect to the best piecewise constant strategy is at most O(ln(n)) in the exponent, where n is the investment duration. This method is also extended in [2] to switching among a finite collection of candidate algorithms, including the case where such transitions are represented by an arbitrary side-information sequence.

The typical kinematic positioning process requires a set of GPS observations from two separate receivers: the user and the reference.

In a field survey, those measurements must be taken simultaneously. In this study, on the other hand, the user and reference observations were taken separately using the same GPS receiver.

In the nineteenth century, the problem was solved for resolved double stars, for which the <b>relative</b> <b>vector</b> from the primary star to the secondary is observable. For astrometric binaries, however, for which this <b>relative</b> <b>vector</b> is not observable, an exact solution was very recently found by Asada, Akasaka and Kasai by assuming no observational errors.

40|$|The {{existence}} of trapped modes in coupled electromagnetic waveguides is experimentally investigated for configurations with {{different degrees of}} symmetry supporting hybrid modes.

The experimental results evidence as an increasing aperture of the configuration can improve the confinement of the mode instead of generating additional leakage channels.

We are able to model the magnetostriction in terms of uniaxial stress on the sample created by magnetic interactions between neighboring Ni atoms along the c-axis.

40|$|Abstract- The {{security}} of complex networks with multiple elements {{is very difficult}} to evaluate and characterize by numbers. The interaction between the network elements, the different layer topologies and the numerous features makes the security quantification almost impossible. On the other side, the lack of security benchmarking is very problematic for the budget and invests allocation by companies. Numerical economical indexes for the costs and potential benefits are used to set the budgets. The security is not be quantified and it cannot be mapped to these economical indexes, thus the budget is not set objectively. This paper suggests a novel framework for quantification of network security, thus security benchmarking. The <b>relative</b> <b>vector</b> expresses the different layers, physical connections, operation risk, and human resources. The benchmark is relative and not absolute value, which is an indirect indication for the security. The relative security vector maps to economical values and helps the management to take the decisions. The suggested framework extends the common standards like ISO 27000, BSI, ITIL, which characterize single network elements or processes in corporations. This framework is the missing link between the security standards, subjective expert analysis and the monetary instruments. The benchmarking is not saying if a system is secured, then it gives a relative indirect comparison between systems.
