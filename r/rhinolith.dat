5000|$|A <b>rhinolith</b> is a {{calculus}} {{present in}} the nasal cavity. The word {{is derived from the}} roots [...] and , literally meaning [...] "nose stone". It is an uncommon medical phenomenon, {{not to be confused with}} dried nasal mucus. A <b>rhinolith</b> usually forms around the nucleus of a small exogenous foreign body, blood clot or secretion by slow deposition of calcium and magnesium salts. Over a period of time, they grow into large irregular masses that fill the nasal cavity. They may cause pressure necrosis of the nasal septum or lateral wall of nose. Rhinoliths can cause nasal obstruction, epistaxis, headache, sinusitis and epiphora. They can be diagnosed from the history with unilateral foul smelling blood stained nasal discharge or by anterior rhinoscopy. On probing probe can be passed around all its corners. In both CT and MRI <b>rhinolith</b> will appear like a radiopaque irregular material. Small rhinoliths can be removed by foreign body hook. Whereas large rhinoliths can be removed either by crushing with luc's forceps or by Moore's lateral rhinotomy approach.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. An antrolith is a calcified mass {{within the}} maxillary sinus. The {{origin of the}} nidus of {{calcification}} may be extrinsic (foreign body in sinus) or intrinsic (stagnant mucus and fungal ball). Most antroliths are small and asymptomatic. Larger ones may present as sinusitis with symptoms like pain and discharge. Case Report. We report {{a case of a}} 47 -year-old lady who presented with heaviness {{on the left side of}} the face and loosening of the left 2 nd molar tooth since two months. CT scan of the osteomeatal complex and paranasal sinuses showed an opacification of bilateral maxillary sinus and an amorphous area of bone density in the left maxillary sinus. Because of the size of the mass, benign neoplasms were considered in the differential diagnosis. During an endoscopic sinus surgery, it was found to be an antrolith, which was successfully managed by antrostomy and Caldwell-Luc Surgery. Discussion. Antrolith is a rare condition. <b>Rhinoliths</b> are known to invade into the maxillary antrum, but a localised lesion in the antrum is very unusual. A case of an isolated antrolith is presented for its rarity and for differential diagnosis of localised antral disease. Conclusion. Antrolith should be considered as differential diagnosis of unilateral radio-opaque paranasal sinus lesions...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 9 -year-old girl who {{presented}} with a complaint of a malodorous bloody discharge from the left naris. The patient had previously undergone a complete repair of left-sided cleft lip and palate. Clinical examination revealed hyperplasia of the nasal mucosa on the left side. X-ray examination of the nasal cavity demonstrated a radiopaque structure that resembled a tooth and a radiopaque mass similar to an odontoma that was adherent to the root of the suspected tooth. With the patient under general anesthesia, the structure was removed. On gross inspection, the structure was identified as a tooth with a <b>rhinolith</b> attached to the surface of its root. Microscopic examination revealed normal dentin and pulp tissue. A nonspecific inflammatory infiltrate was observed around the <b>rhinolith,</b> and areas of regular and irregular mineralization were seen. Some mineralized areas exhibited melanin-like brownish pigmentation. Areas of mucus with deposits of mineral salts were also observed. Rare cases of an intranasal tooth associated with a <b>rhinolith</b> have been described in the literature.

40|$|THE SUBJECT {{of nasal}} calculi has {{intrigued}} men {{since the very}} beginning of western medical literature.

40|$|Introduction A <b>rhinolith</b> is a rock {{which forms}} in the nose. It occurs from the {{solidification}} of mucus and nasal debris: by mineral salts, calcium, magnesium phosphate and carbonate, and it leads to unilateral obstruction of the nasal airway followed by inflammatory changes of the nasal mucus membrane and paranasal cavities. This inflammatory process {{may lead to a}} purulent form with complications, intracranial propagation and dacryocystitis. Case report This is a case report of a patient with rhinolithiasis, 30 years of age, complaining of breathing difficulties for 10 years, with nasal secretion, reduced olfactory function and headaches. She underwent the following procedures: frontal rhinoscopy, epipharyngoscopy, nasal mucus analysis (fungi and bacteria), x- ray check-up as well as pathohistological analysis of the removed <b>rhinolith.</b> Discussion and conclusion The significance of computer tomography of paranasal cavities was confirmed in coronal lines, as the most valid radiological analysis which provides adequate diagnosis, differential diagnosis and helps in making the decision on surgical treatment. Surgery is obligatory and in most cases it is endonasal endoscopy. Bigger nasal stones (rhinoliths), progressing into the surrounding anatomic structures, are treated using rhinotomy and trepanation (Caldweell-Luc). In cases of greater rhynolits with propagation into neighboring anatomic areas, cases of surgical treatment by lateral rhynotomy and trepancy of the sinuses (Caldwel-Luc) were shown...|$|E

In this case, a 34 -year-old male was ad- mitted to our clinic with {{complaints}} of nasal obstruction, halitosis and foul-smelling purulent nasal discharge. History of the patient revealed a septoplasty procedure completed about one year ago. Anterior rhinoscopy and nasal endoscopic exami- nation of the patient revealed that both nasal cavities were filled with foreign bodies. After the removal of these materials, the foreign bodies were identified as <b>rhinolith</b> particles with 2 x 5 cm X-ray film cut-out sheets embedded within. We thought the X-ray film sheets were used for nasal packing following the previous septoplasty. The X-ray film sheets had eventually become rhinoliths over time.

As demonstrated by this case report, postoperative follow-up after septoplasty is important, and iatrogenic foreign bodies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an adult patient with rhinolithiasis.

40|$|Background: Intranasal surgery {{under general}} {{anaesthesia}} has potential to complicate immediate postoperative recovery period with multitude of respiratory problems. These include from mild respiratory distress to oxygen desaturation to moderate to significant laryngospasm. These {{problems can be}} mitigated by employing some innovative manoeuvres by anaesthesiologists to achieve smooth and safe recovery. Study setting: The study was conducted at PAF Hospital MM Alam after permission from the hospital ethics committee from March 2013 to December 2013. Level of evidence: The study conforms to level 1 b of evidence rating scale. Study design: This randomised control trial included 120 American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I patients aged less than 40  years of both genders, undergoing intranasal surgery under general anaesthesia, who were randomly {{divided into two groups}} naming Throat Wash (TW) group or Simple Suction (SS) group. Patients of both groups were induced general anaesthesia as per set protocol while TW group was subjected to throat wash after removal of throat pack while SS group was only suctioned under direct laryngoscopy. Incidence of any adverse respiratory event in immediate post-extubation period was recorded for further comparison. Results: 1. 6 % patients in TW group developed laryngospasm as compared to 15 % patients of SS group (P <  0. 0001). 4. 8 % patients of TW group and 44. 9 % patients of SS group developed moderate to significant respiratory problems respectively (P <  0. 0001). 5 % patients in SS group had to re-intubated as compared to none in the TW group (P <  0. 00001). Debris recovered during throat wash in TW group included clogs of blood, pieces of bones, cartilage and polyps, <b>rhinolith,</b> and wax from the packing gauze as compared to only some clots of blood in the SS group. Conclusion: Throat wash, after removal of throat pack in nasal surgery, ensures clearer airway and decreases the risk of adverse respiratory events in immediate post-extubation period. The adverse sequel due to un-recognised debris in the upper airway is minimised resulting in smooth recovery and rapid discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit...|$|E
