50|$|There {{are four}} main types of free {{machining}} steel: leaded, <b>resulfurized,</b> rephosphorized and super. Super free-machining steels are alloyed with tellurium, selenium, and bismuth.|$|E
40|$|Residual {{stresses}} {{induced by}} orthogonal cutting in AISI 316 L standard and <b>resulfurized</b> steels have been investigated, with {{attention given to}} {{the role played by}} the cutting parameters, such as cutting speed, feed rate, tool geometry and tool coating. Depth profiles of residual stress have been determined using the X-ray diffraction technique. The effect of cutting conditions and tool nature on residual stresses are analyzed in association with thermal and mechanical events, recorded during the cutting tests. The tool temperature distribution has been determined by a specific CCD infrared camera technique and the cutting forces by a Kistler table set up on the lathe. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study aims at {{evaluating}} {{the influence of}} fatigue strain range on hydrogen embrittlement of <b>resulfurized</b> high strength steel on low-cycle fatigue tests. Previously, samples were charged with hydrogen (H) under different conditions. The presence of H causes softening effects on the cyclic behavior {{and a reduction in}} fatigue life of samples in comparison with uncharged samples. The explanation of this behavior is based on quantitative analyses of fracture surfaces as well as the microstructure by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, enthalpy changes, associated with the main H trapping sites, were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This study has enhanced the understanding of the variables that most influence the fatigue behavior of this type of steel charged with hydrogen...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} study aims {{to quantify}} the release activation energy (Ea) of hydrogen (H) from lattice sites, reversible or irreversible, where the H can be trapped. Moreover, enthalpy changes associated with the main hydrogen (H) trapping sites can be analyzed by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In this technique, the peak temperature measurement is determined at two different heating rates, 3 ºC/min y 5 ºC/min, from ambient temperature to 500 °C. In order to simulate severe conditions of hydrogen income into <b>resulfurized</b> high strength steel, electrolytic permeation tests were performed on test tubes suitable for fatigue tests. Sometimes during charging, H promoters were aggregated to electrolytic solution. Subsequently, the test tubes were subjected to flow cycle fatigue tests. Finally, irreversible trap which anchor more strongly H atoms are MnS inclusions. Its role on hydrogen embrittlement during fatigue tests is conclusive...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissolution}} of MnS inclusions enriched in chromium (30 to 40 wt pct Cr) and the corrosion susceptibility of <b>resulfurized</b> stainless steel were studied in various NaCl- and NaClO 4 -based solutions by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), and the electrochemical microcell technique. It {{has been shown that}} chromium-enriched inclusions do not undergo dissolution under free corrosion conditions. By contrast, electrochemical {{dissolution of}} inclusions occurs at high potential values (above 500 mV vs saturated calomel electrode) in all the solutions, followed by stable pitting. It has also been shown that some areas containing chromium-enriched inclusions exhibited stable pitting at low potentials (below 100 mV vs saturated calomel electrode) in the electrolytes with chloride ions. Field-emission SEM experiments have revealed that the matrix undergoes dissolution around these inclusions. An assumption is proposed for describing pitting corrosion mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the dissolution of MnS inclusions at the OCP value and 400 mVversus SCE on the chemical composition of passive films and the electrochemical behaviour of <b>resulfurized</b> austenitic stainless steel was studied in 1 M NaClO 4, pH 3, solution using SIMS, XPS, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the electrochemical microcell technique. The electrochemical dissolution (at 400 mV versus SCE) of inclusions occurred uniformly along the interface and this process was almost complete after 25 min immersion. A small amount of sulfur was detected on the matrix that exhibited a wide passive range. By contrast, the dissolution process under free corrosion was not uniform along the interface and numerous inclusions were partly dissolved. Grains close to the completely dissolved inclusions showed an active behaviour. This was connected with the adsorption {{of a large number}} of sulfur on the surface. In the two cases, the presence of sulfur species on the surface was also found to enhance the kinetics of cathodic reactions...|$|E
40|$|Fig. 17 Tool-face crater {{development}} for carbide tools cutting cold-rolled <b>resulfurized</b> steels at 600 fpm. Feed, 0. 0046 ipr; depth of cut, 0. 100 in.; rake angle, — 7 deg; clearance angle, 7 dog; nose radius, 0. 03 in.; cutting fluid, none. practice, the tool life of carbide tools is usualy {{expressed in terms}} of a given wear land such as the 0. 030 -in. value specified by the American Standards Association. Crater traces for carbide tools that have cut dry at 600 fpm for 27 min are shown in Fig. 17. The traces in the second column are taken parallel to the major cutting edge in the plane of maximum crater depth, while the traces in the first column were taken in a direction perpendicular to the major cutting edge and at the point of greatest crater depth. The corresponding wear-land curves are shown in the lower portion of Fig. 17. When Tc is 27 min the value of maximum crater depth is seen to be nearly the same in all cases. On the other hand the tool-chip contact length a is found to decrease significantly with sulfur content. The ex-tent of wear land w after 27 min of cutting is found to vary in-versely as the square of the contact length a for the steels of dif-ferent sulfur content. A scale drawing of the crater and wear-land values after 27 min of cutting at 600 fpm is shown in the lower left portion of Fig. 17. The center of the crater is seen to be very much closer to the cutting edge for the sulfurized steel...|$|E
