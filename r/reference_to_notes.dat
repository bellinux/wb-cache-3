40|$|I {{argue that}} Williams’s doctor stories {{must be remembered}} on our syllabi due to {{contemporary}} discursive trends in medical ethics. Treating “The Use of Force” as a case study, I create parallels between its representation of resistance to diphtheria anti-toxin and the rhetoric of “anti-vaxxers” like Jenny McCarthy, Andrew Wakefield, Michelle Bachmann, and Bill Maher. I trace the contemporary resurgence of the anti-vaccination activism that plagued Williams’s own medical career, adapting concepts from Bruno Latour’s “Has Critique Run Out of Steam?” The potential threat to public health has been graphically illustrated by recent vaccine-preventable outbreaks of the measles in New York, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Indiana, and Minnesota, {{as well as of}} mumps, rubella, polio, and whooping cough across the world. I show, with <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>notes</b> from Williams’s unused introduction to The Farmer’s Daughter, that “The Use of Force,” by emphasizing the morally ambiguous struggle between a patient’s (or parents’) choice and a physician’s responsibility, reveals the underlying rhetorical structure of contemporary medical ethics and provides a new way for readers born after the success of the DPT, MMR, and other vaccines to see the consequences of forgetting that struggle...|$|E

Drug-delivery approaches have diversified {{over the last two}} decades with the emergence of nanotechnologies, smart polymeric systems and multimodal functionalities. The intended target for specific treatment of disease is the key defining developing parameter. One such area which has undergone significant advancements relates to ocular delivery. This has been expedited by the development of material advancement, mechanistic concepts and through the deployment of advanced process technologies. This review will focus on the developments within lens-based drug delivery while touching on conventional and current methods of topical ocular drug delivery. A summary table will provide quick <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> the key findings in this area. In addition, the review also elucidates current theranostic and diagnostic approaches based on ocular lenses...|$|R
5000|$|Given {{the lack}} of {{integration}} of the subjects covered: arboriculture, empire, entail and, evolution, with most commonality between the latter pair, it strongly suggests that the manuscript submitted for printing solely comprised the main body text of Matthew's management rules, and his criticism of other planters. The <b>references</b> <b>to</b> appendices are printed in the footer area of the pages 2, 3, 4 and 135 (the only place where they are called appendices, abbreviated [...] "App.") and in the footer of page 293 (not abbreviated: [...] "* See Appendix F."), plus an additional <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>Note</b> B from within the body text on page 374. Note D is omitted from direct mention, save the Contents page. Interestingly, the title <b>to</b> <b>Note</b> D on page 376 reads, Note D, p. 4., as if accommodating the oversight in the second instalment (see below) was easier and less costly than reprinting, or adding to page 4, even at the proofing stage. The addendum is not mentioned throughout the body text, but is appended {{to the list of}} appendices on the eighth Contents page. The Contents page for the appendices is entirely separate {{from the rest of the}} book's Contents listing, which is otherwise neatly balanced and spaced to occupy its seven pages span.|$|R
