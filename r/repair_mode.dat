Mother-child dyads were videotaped at home interacting in naturally occurring contexts. Videotapes were analyzed and coded for communication breakdowns and repair attempts made by the child. Repairs were further analyzed according to the type of repair strategy used, changes in prosidy, and whether the <b>repair</b> <b>mode</b> involved problematic or non-problematic behavior. In most situations, this group of children attempted to repair breakdowns in communication that occurred while interacting with their mothers. Most children used both nonproblematic and problematic behaviors and were less likely to use augmentations as a repair strategy than repetitions and substitutions. Some repetitions and some augmentations involved the use of gestures or vocalizations with increased emphasis or prosidy. Possible links between repair strategies involving increased prosidy and the use of problem behaviors are discussed together with the implications and significance of these finding in relation to early intervention for children with significant communication impairments.

We used chromosomal reporter substrates to specifically monitor NHEJ of single I-SceI-induced-DSB for detailed comparison of classical and alternative end-joining.

40|$|Abstract — Built-in self-repair (BISR) {{technique}} {{has been widely}} used to repair embedded random access memories (RAMs). This paper presents a reconfigurable BISR (ReBISR) scheme for repairing RAMs with different sizes and redundancy organizations. An efficient redundancy analysis algorithm is proposed to allocate redundancies of defective RAMs. In the ReBISR, a reconfigurable built-in redundancy analysis (ReBIRA) circuit is designed to perform the redundancy algorithm for various RAMs. Also, an adaptively reconfigurable fusing methodology is proposed to reduce the repair setup time when the RAMs are operated in normal mode. Experimental {{results show that the}} ReBISR scheme can achieve high repair rate (i. e., the ratio of the number of repaired RAMs to the number of defective RAMs). The area cost of the ReBISR is very small, which is only about 2. 7 % for four RAMs (one 4 Kbit RAM, one 16 Kbit RAM, one 128 Kbit RAM, and one 512 Kbit RAM). Moreover, the time overhead of redundancy analysis is very small. Embedded memories are among the most widely used cores in current system-on-chip (SOC) implementations.

Hitherto, the uracil base excision repair (BER) pathway {{has only been}} described in two archaeons, the crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilumand the euryarchaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, which are hyperthermophiles and use single-nucleotide replacement. In the former the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site intermediate is removed by the sequential action of a 5 ′-acting AP endonuclease and a 5 ′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase, whereas in the latter the AP site is primarily removed by a 3 ′-acting AP lyase, followed by a 3 ′-phosphodiesterase.

Nuclei are incubated in a mixture containing [3 H]thymidine triphosphate and bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate in a 1 : 5 ratio. The 3 H at the density of parental DNA in alkaline CsCl density gradients is then a measure of repair. In nuclei prepared from WI 38 cells 30 min after irradiation, repair replication is UV dependent and proceeds at approximately the in vivo rate for 5 min. Repair replication is reduced in irradiated nuclei or in nuclei prepared immediately after irradiation. It is Mg 2 +-dependent and stimulated by added ATP and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. No repair replication is observed in nuclei from xeroderma pigmentosum (complementation group A) cells. However, upon addition of coliphage T 4 endonuclease V, which specifically nicks DNA containing pyrimidine dimers, repair replication is observed in nuclei from irradiated xeroderma pigmentosum cells and is stimulated in WI 38 nuclei.

The reliability indicators of the power supply system for the nuclear power plant auxiliaries are the conditional probabilities of conjoined blackout of one, two, and three sections of the reliable power supply conditional upon an initiating event emerging and the blackout of one, two, and three reliable power-supply sections under the normal operational mode. Furthermore, they also are the blackout periodicity of one and conjointly two, three, and four sections of normal operation under the block normal operational mode. It is established that the blackout of one bus section of normal operation and one section of reliable power-supply system of the auxiliaries that does not lead to complete blackout of the plant auxiliaries may occur once in three years.

40|$|Each {{organism}} stores its {{genetic information}} in large DNA molecules, present in most cells. DNA {{is composed of}} four different nucleotides, abbreviated as G,A,T,and C, which make up the genetic code that is translated into proteins. An intermediate between DNA and protein is the RNA, that is generated by a process called transcription, during which one strand of the double DNA helix serves as a template and is read by a scanning RNA polymerase complex. As a result, a messenger RNA molecule is produced, that in turn forms a template for protein synthesis. It is of major importance that changes (mutations) in the genetic code of the DNA are limited to a minimum. Although mutations {{form the basis of}} biological diversity, they can also be the starting point of carcinogenesis in multicellular species. The genomic DNA is continuously challenged by a variety of damaging agents, interfering with cellular processes that involve DNA metabolism. Of many of those reagents, the nature of the resulting lesion has been established. Various chemical compounds, inducing bulky adducts, and also UV-irradiation cause distortions and bending of the DNA helix. Ionising irradiation and oxygen radicals afe known to generate single and double strand breaks in the DNA, while exposure to alkylating agents can lead to various types of modification of single nucleotides. Also, intracellular processes can enhance the intrinsic instability of some of the DNA bonds and can lead to alterations in the DNA, e. g. via hydrolysis and oxidation. Mutations are generated if these modified nucleotides mispair during DNA replication (prior to cell division). which can also happen spontaneously. This will in many cases lead to incorporation of a wrong nucleotide, thus generating a 'mismatch' which, when wrongly processed, can lead to a change of the genetic code. All organisms have developed an intricate network of DNA <b>repair</b> <b>modes</b> to remove the lesions before they can exert their deleterious effects...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the application of}} model-based diagnosis to the debugging of functional programming languages. We describe the generation of a logic system description out of the evaluation trace of a program and discuss the differences in perspective that arise out {{of the lack of}} a structurally complete specification for the program. We present two different approaches for diagnosing faults that result in incorrect executions. The first (simpler and quicker) approach uses a fixed system description based on the evaluation trace, and the second (more accurate) approach incorporates the search for a repair that will correct the fault, expressed in terms of fault modes corresponding to possible repairs. We describe the algorithm for computing diagnoses based on repairs, discuss how the faster algorithm can be used for focusing search before the second algorithm computes replacements, and finally present some example results.
