In 1970, the Auto Club incurred the wrath of Los Angeles city councilman Marvin Braude when it opposed an initiative that would have authorized diversion of state fuel tax revenues away from road construction to <b>reducing</b> <b>smog</b> and expanding mass transit. Braude ran for the Auto Club's board {{the next year and}} lost, then promptly sued the Auto Club over alleged unfairness in its election procedures that enabled the incumbent board to make itself self-perpetuating. His lawsuit dragged on for over 15 years and involved two trials and three appeals, all of which Braude ultimately won. In the end, the Auto Club was forced to revise its election procedures to give board outsiders a better chance of actually winning seats, and it was ordered to pay Braude's attorney's fees. Furthermore, the Braude case revealed that the Auto Club had been exploiting several loopholes in California corporate law, which caused the state Legislature to enact a comprehensive revision of the California Nonprofit Corporation Law in 1978.|$|E

In 1998 the province unveiled the Emissions Trading Regulation, which establishes limits {{on the amount of}} Nitrogen and Sulfur oxides into the atmosphere from the electricity sector. The Drive Clean Program was introduced in 1999. This program forces mandatory vehicle inspection and maintenance with the intention of <b>reducing</b> <b>smog.</b> The provincial government created two pieces of legislation the Industry emissions Nitrogen Oxides and Sulphur Dioxide and the Air pollution- local Air Quality Regulation. The former puts a cap on seven major industrial sectors while the latter further updates air standards and other tools to better improve environmental standards. Ontario also in 2010 passed a new regulation called the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission. This regulation established progressively stricter standards for new automobiles within the 2011-2016 model years, to stay in line with the USA national standards. In the same year, the provincial {{government of}} Ontario also shut down its last coal fired power plants.|$|E

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{may affect}} athletic performance. In Los Angeles, contaminants include carbon monoxide, ozone, peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) and nitrogen oxides, whereas in older European cities, such as Sarajevo, "reducing smog" {{of sulfur dioxide}} is the main hazard. The carbon monoxide and ozone levels expected in Los Angeles this summer could affect the athletes' performance in endurance events at the Olympic Games. Carbon monoxide may also impair psychomotor abilities, and PAN causes visual disturbances. The only likely physiologic consequence from <b>reducing</b> <b>smog</b> {{is an increase in}} the workload of the respiratory system and thus a decrease in endurance performance. While carbon monoxide has been blamed for myocardial infarctions, nitrogen oxides for pulmonary edema and sulfur dioxide for deaths due to respiratory failure, the only illnesses that {{are likely to be more}} frequent than usual among young athletes exposed to high levels of these pollutants are upper respiratory tract infections. Therapeutic tactics include the avoidance of pollution, the administration of oxygen, vitamin C and vitamin E, and general reassurance...|$|E

30|$|The {{increasing}} demand for various industrial purposes such as alternative source of energy, industrial solvents, cleansing agents and preservatives, has necessitated increased production of ethanol (Brooks 2008). Furthermore, ethanol by fermentation offers {{a more favorable}} trade balance, enhanced energy security, and a major new crop for a depressed agricultural economy. Ethanol is considerably less toxic to humans than is gasoline (or methanol). Ethanol also <b>reduces</b> <b>smog</b> formation because of low volatility; its photochemical reactivity and low production of combustion products. Furthermore, low levels of smog-producing compounds are formed by its combustion (Wyman and Hinman 1990). In addition, the low flame temperature of ethanol results in good engine performance.|$|R
40|$|Effective {{evaluation}} {{of air pollution}} control strategies {{requires the use of}} validated and reliable mathematical models that can relate pollutant emissions to atmospheric air quality. The primary objective of this research program has been to develop a fundamental modeling capability to assess the effectiveness of air pollution control measures in <b>reducing</b> <b>smog.</b> An important aspect of the development has been to simplify the preparation of input data and operational use of the resulting model. The system has been designed to be used by air pollution agencies with relatively little experience in atmospheric physics and chemistry. The assumptions commonly employed in model formulations have been evaluated to ensure a valid representation of the physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere. As part of this project a new set of objective analysis procedures has been developed to generate meteorological fields from sparse and discrete surface level observations (Publications 6 a and 6 b).

25|$|Oxygenate {{blending}} adds oxygen-bearing compounds such as MTBE, ETBE, ethanol, and biobutanol. The {{presence of}} these oxygenates reduces {{the amount of carbon}} monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust gas. In many areas throughout the US, oxygenate blending is mandated by EPA regulations to <b>reduce</b> <b>smog</b> and other airborne pollutants. For example, in Southern California, fuel must contain 2% oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6% ethanol in gasoline. The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline (RFG) or oxygenated gasoline, {{or in the case of}} California, California reformulated gasoline. The federal requirement that RFG contain oxygen was dropped on 6 May 2006 because the industry had developed VOC-controlled RFG that did not need additional oxygen.|$|R

Much has been made about the renewable transport fuel obligations and the impact the production of biofuel can have on the environment, but there has been less consideration of more small scale biomass heating systems. This work examines the life cycle impacts of the production and use of three such systems using waste wood in the South West of England. Burning of wood in the UK was reduced after the introduction of legislation to <b>reduce</b> <b>smog</b> in the 1950 s, and so the impact of the emissions from the boilers has been examined.

40|$|A ``Cool Communities`` {{strategy}} of lighter-colored reroofs and resurfaced pavements, and shade trees, can directly lower annual air conditioning bills in Los Angeles (LA) by about $ 100 million (M), cool {{the air in}} the LA Basin (thereby saving indirectly $ 70 M more in air conditioning), and <b>reduce</b> <b>smog</b> exceedance by about 10 %, worth another $ 360 M, for a total savings of about $ 0. 5 billion per year. Trees are most effective if they shade buildings; but they are still very cost effective if they merely cool the air by evapotranspiration. Avoided peak power for air conditioning can be about 1. 5 GW (more than 15 % of LA air conditioning). Extrapolated to the entire US, the authors estimate 20 GW avoided and potential annual electricity savings of about $ 5 [...] 10 B in 2015. To achieve these savings, they call for ratings and labels for cool materials, buildings` performance standards, utility incentive programs, and an extension of the existing smog-offset trading market (RECLAIM) to include credit for cool surfaces and trees.

30|$|Combustion {{of fossil}} fuel {{is what we}} think of as burning {{processes}} basically a reaction with oxygen. Fossil fuels are composed primarily of hydrocarbons. The amount of energy released during combustion is dependent on the oxidation state of the carbons in the hydrocarbon which is related to the hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio. The more hydrogen per carbon, the lower the oxidation state and the more energy that will be released during the oxidation reaction. The presence of oxygenates in fuels reduces the amount of carbon monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust gas. Oxygenate blending is basically the addition of oxygen-bearing compounds such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and ethanol to gasoline/diesel. Throughout the USA, oxygenate blending is mandated by EPA regulations to <b>reduce</b> <b>smog</b> and other airborne pollutants. For example, in Southern California, a fuel must contain 2  % oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6  % ethanol in gasoline (Removal of reformulated gasoline oxygen content requirement (national) and revision of commingling prohibition to address non-oxygenated reformulated gasoline (national), 2006). The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline (RFG) or oxygenated gasoline. Ethanol-blended fuel has been a great success in Brazil where ethanol is being used as a primary fuel for several decades; E- 85 to E- 100 are the most common in them. Several countries in the European Union also use ethanol-blended gasoline due to environmental consideration. In India, the government has mandated up to 5  % ethanol for metro cities, recently for all over the country, and has a plan to extend it up to 10  % in the future (Government to take a call on ethanol price soon, 2011). Thus, in the case of a blended fuel (oxy-diesel, reformulated gasoline), in addition to the H/C ratio, the O/C ratio would be a parameter of interest (Sarpal et al. 1997).|$|R
40|$|Previous {{atmospheric}} modeling {{efforts that}} {{concentrated on the}} Los Angeles Basin suggested beneficial and significant air quality impacts from cool cities strategies. This paper discusses an extension of similar modeling efforts to three regions, Atlanta GA, Dallas - Ft. Worth TX, and Nashville TN, that experience smog and air quality problems. According to the older ozone air quality standard (120 ppb), these regions were classified as serious, moderate, and marginal, respectively, but {{may be out of}} compliance with respect to the newer, 80 -ppb/ 8 -hours standard. Results from this exploratory modeling work suggest a range of possible impacts on meteorological and air quality conditions. For example, peak ozone concentrations during each region's respective episode could be decreased by 1 - 6 ppb (conservative and optimistic scenarios, respectively) in Nashville, 5 - 15 ppb in Dallas - Fort Worth, and 5 - 12 ppb in Atlanta following implementation of cool cities. The reductions are generally smaller than those obtained from simulating the Los Angeles Basin but are still significant. In all regions, the simulations suggest, the net, domain-wide effects of cool cities are reductions in ozone mass and improvements in air quality. In Atlanta, Nashville, and Dallas, urban areas benefiting from <b>reduced</b> <b>smog</b> reach up to 8460, 7350, and 12870 km{sup 2 } in area, respectively. Results presented in this paper should be taken as exploratory and preliminary. These will most likely change during a more comprehensive modeling study to be started soon {{with the support of the}} US Environmental Protection Agency. The main purpose of the present project was to obtain the initial data (emission inventories) for these regions, simulate meteorological conditions, and perform preliminary sensitivity analysis. In the future, additional regions will be simulated to assess the potential of cool cities in improving urban air quality...|$|R
