50|$|Instead it is {{desirable}} to transfer just that information related to changes made to the existing database.

40|$|CC-BY-NC-NDThe paper {{contributes}} to the research in accounting and {{the debate about the}} nature of carbon footprint reporting for society. The paper utilises numbers and narratives to explore changes in carbon footprint using UK national carbon emissions data for the period 1990 ??? 2009 and six years (2006 ??? 2011) of carbon emissions data for the FTSE 100 group of companies and a case study that focuses on the UK mixed grocery sector. Our argument is that existing approaches to framing carbon disclosure generate malleable, inconsistent and irreconcilable numbers and narratives. In this paper we argue for an alternative framing of carbon disclosure informed by a <b>reporting</b> <b>entities</b> business model. Specifically, we suggest, that a <b>reporting</b> <b>entity</b> disclose its carbon???material stakeholder relations. This alternative, we argue, would increase the visibility of carbon generating stakeholder relations and avoid some of the difficulties and arbitrariness associated with framing carbon disclosure around a <b>reporting</b> <b>entity</b> boundary where judgements have to be made about responsibility and operational control...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} a <b>reporting</b> <b>entity</b> is very {{important}} for reaching the needed level of the quality of financial information. Usually, within a conceptual framework for financial accounting can be found special paragraphs that deal with the question of <b>reporting</b> <b>entity</b> delineation. As this paper is public sector oriented, conceptual frameworks taken into account come from the sets of regulations concerning governmental accounting. New Zealand financial accounting standards, US federal accounting standards and International Public Sector Accounting Standards are considered. The main hypothesis of this paper is that <b>reporting</b> <b>entity</b> is an organization and that financial reports have to project the financial aspect both of its fundamental states and flows and of its main functions and intentions. The analyses of the conceptual frameworks taken into account confirm this hypothesis.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the topical {{behavior}} in a large scale.

To make the behavioral data appropriate for the spatial learning in the CNN, we propose several reduction steps to form the topical metrics and to place them homogeneously like pixels in the images. The experimental result shows both temporal and spatial gains when compared against a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. A new learning framework called the spatially connected convolutional networks (SCCN) is introduced to predict the topical metrics more efficiently...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an approach for inter-organisational sustainability reporting. This approach {{is based on}} an open source software tool "Sustainable Online Reporting Model" developed at the University of Oldenburg. The idea of sustainability reporting across a single <b>reporting</b> <b>entity</b> like a company originated from the field of financial reporting. Later on Kasperzak (2003) presented an approach in which a network of corporations is treated as a single economic entity with the aim to get an extended consolidated financial statement. This approach is considered to fuel current discussions in sustainability reporting around issues like: Where to set reporting boundaries and how to enlarge <b>reporting</b> <b>entities.</b> This paper is research in progress. First, the idea of inter-organisational sustainability reporting is presented. The focus here is to enlarge reporting boundaries to an inter-organisational entity and to create a sustainability report covering an inter-organisational perspective. Such report from a collective perspective opens a window of new opportunities and provides added value compared to current sustainability <b>reports</b> of single <b>entities.</b> Second, a reference architecture for an "Inter-organisational Sustainable Online Reporting Model" is proposed...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the links between implementing ISA 540 and mitigating the practice of smoothing reported net earnings using write-offs of accounts receivable and inventory by <b>reporting</b> <b>entities</b> in Poland. The research question stems from the previous analysis carried out by the author in which evidence was provided that <b>reporting</b> <b>entities</b> in Poland in the period 2000 – 2010 effectively used write-offs of accounts receivable and inventory in order to mitigate fluctuations of reported net earnings. This paper provides evidence that before implementing ISA 540 <b>reporting</b> <b>entities</b> used write-offs of receivables and inventory for income smoothing in effective manner, however in the period after implementing the standard (2009 – 2014) no link was observed between the write-offs and reduced fluctuations of reported net earnings. The research has been carried out using Wilcoxon signed-rank test used to check equality of medians of mean deviations of net earnings before write-offs of receivables and inventory and mean deviations of net earnings after write-offs. For the period before implementing ISA 540 there are grounds to reject the hypothesis of equality of medians of mean deviations of net earnings, however in the post-adoption period there is no justification to reject the hypothesis of equality of medians. The research provides evidence of positive impact of ISA 540 mitigating the processes of accounting earnings management. The indicated regularity does not apply to banks, because within this group of companies we have not observed the use of write-offs of loan receivables {{in order to reduce the}} variability of net earnings before implementing ISA 540 and in the period following the implementation of the standard...|$|R
