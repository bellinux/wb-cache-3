50|$|Negative attitudes against gay {{and lesbian}} men and women remain entrenched. A European Union member poll, {{conducted}} in 2006, showed Lithuania at 17% support for gay marriage and 12% for <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>adoption.</b> Another study, conducted in 2006, showed that 42% of respondents would agree on a same-sex civil partnership law, 12% - same-sex marriage, 13% - right to adopt. The support for same-sex couples’ rights diminished significantly since then and continue this trend. A 2012 study revealed a 10% support for same-sex partnerships, 7% for same-sex marriages, while an identical study in 2013 showed only a 7% support for partnerships and 5% support for marriages.|$|R

50|$|In February 2008, a {{court in}} Israel ruled that {{same-sex}} couples are now permitted {{to adopt a}} child even if that child is not biologically related to either parent.

50|$|Both {{male and}} female {{same-sex}} sexual activity has been legal since 1887, when a new Penal Code was promulgated.

5000|$|In 2010, in a {{landmark}} trial, the 4th Class of the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil (STJ) acknowledged, unanimously, that homosexual couples {{have the right}} to adopt children. The court, consisting of five judges discussed a case of two women who had recognized the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>adoption</b> by the Federal Court of Rio Grande do Sul. The State Public Prosecutor, however, appealed to the STJ. The court denied the public prosecutor's request, saying that for such cases, the child's will must be respected. [...] "This trial is historic because it gives to human dignity, dignity of minors and the two women", said the reporter, Luis Felipe Solomon. [...] "We affirm that this decision is an orientation that in cases like that, you should always serve the interests of the child, that being is adopted", the minister João Otávio de Noronha said. The Superior Court of Justice decision creates a legal precedent that would allow gay couples to abandon the practice currently used for individual adoption to avoid legal problems.|$|E

5000|$|On 1 December 2013, a {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held in}} Croatia, its third referendum since becoming independent. The referendum, organized by the citizen initiative For the family, proposed an amendment that would define marriage as a union {{between a man and}} a woman, thus creating {{a constitutional}} prohibition against same-sex marriage. Milanović opposed the proposal and told HRT that he would vote against it. The government advised citizens to vote against it, but the referendum passed with 65% votes in favour. Milanović was unhappy that the referendum had taken place at all, saying, [...] "I think it did not make us any better, smarter or prettier." [...] He also said that the referendum does not change the existing definition of marriage according to Croatian laws. He further announced the upcoming enactment of the Law on Partnership, which will enable same-sex persons to form a lifetime partnership union, which would share the same rights as that of marriage proper, apart from the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>adoption.</b> On 12 December 2013 the Government passed the proposed Bill, and the Parliament passed the Life Partnership Act in July 2014.|$|E
50|$|Crime with legally owned {{firearms}} is rare, with 45 recorded {{incidents in}} 2016 (compared {{to the total}} number of over 800,000 legally possessed firearms).

50|$|On 22 December 2015, {{following}} the 20 December 2015 referendum, which prevented same-sex marriage becoming legal in Slovenia (see below), independent deputy Jani Möderndorfer {{introduced a bill}} to give same-sex partnerships all the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> marriage, except <b>adoption</b> and in vitro fertilisation.

50|$|Thompson's {{campaign}} disavowed his supporters' effort, {{which was}} speculated to have failed {{because it had}} been scheduled for the day before Thanksgiving and due to lack of realtime donation tracking feedback.
