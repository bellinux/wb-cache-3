40|$|On {{cloudless}} days in summer, longwave irradiance {{was measured}} with a radiometer and was calculated from a <b>radiation</b> <b>chart</b> using records from radiosondes released at regular intervals. The {{results show that the}} chart underestimated the longwave flux density at the ground by up to 40 W/m^(- 2), corresponding to an extra atmospheric emissivity of up to 0. 12. The extra emissivity was correlated with turbidity during the day, and on turbid days it showed a diurnal variation with a maximum at noon. It is suggested that emission in the atmospheric window from dust, pollen and spores may account for some of the observed excess...|$|E
40|$|Finally, {{our results}} may be {{compared}} to those of similar experiments carried out by Falckenberg (12) which extend over a more limited range of moisture. Falckenberg’s values for the emissivity are much higher than ours, for instance for 0. 0005 gr/cma of water he finds 6. 7 percent emission, for 0. 0015 gr/cma he has 13. 4 percent, and for 0. 0075 gr/cni 2 he has 17. 5 percent, the figures referring to the same temperature of 20 ’ for water vapor as ours. On the other hand, we might derive some information from the results obtained by Hottel and Mangelsdorf (9) on steam. The values of the latter work are intermediate between those of Falckenberg and ours.

40|$|The loco-regional {{control of}} NSCLC remains a major {{challenge}} {{but it is a}} requirement for cure: classical radiation schedule delivering dose in the range of 60 to 65 Gy yield a very poor local control (less than 20 %). Recent triais have clearly demonstrate {{that it was possible to}} improve the local control and this translate in a clear survival benefit. This was observed with accelerated hyperfractionated <b>radiation</b> (<b>CHART</b> and HART) but also with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy approach (Furuse, Schaake-Koning triais). The recent major technological development both in treatment planning and radiation delivery has opened the road to look for an escalation in the total radiation dose far above the past threshold dose of 65 Gy. What have we learned from the current experience? It is possible to go above this limit of 65 Gy but doses escalation is often limited by the tolerance of normai tissues especially the amount of irradiated normal lung. To overcome this restriction, the current philosophy is to treat only the gross tumor volume and to avoid any elective nodal irradiation. This implies to have a good mediastinal evaluation (PET is particularly useful). Indeed, nodal failures are reported to be a rare event while controlling the primary tumor remains the challenge. Doses as high as 90 Gy can be delivered but there is a paradoxal issue: this is often only possible for small tumors probably not requiring this high dose while larger tumors can not be treated to this level. The second problem is the issue of repopulation: increasing treatment duration by only using daily 2 Gy per fraction will certainly not be as effective as expected: the only solution is either using an hyperfractionating schedule or higher daily dose (concomitant boost technique). Additional studies are clearly needed to see the real impact of this approach on a large population scale and not only to very select patients able to follow the guidelines for very complicate set-up (the ditterent gating techniques). Fufthermore, longer follow-up will be needed to assess the possible late eftects at the level of the lung and the heart. Last but not least, this technique should be in a next step be part of a multimodal approach...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the quality of involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) on clinical outcome in patients with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) in complete remission (CR) after six to eight cycles of mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone-doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (MOPP-ABV) chemotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review of clinical and radiologic data, <b>radiation</b> <b>charts,</b> simulator films, and megavoltage (MV) photographs was performed. IFRT consisted of 24 Gy to all initially involved nodal areas and 16 - 24 Gy to all initially involved extranodal sites. Major violations were defined as no or only partial irradiation of an originally involved area, or a total dose < 90 % of the prescribed dose. RESULTS: Of the 739 patients who were enrolled in the trial between 1989 and 2000, 57 % achieved a CR; 152 of 172 patients randomized to IFRT actually received radiotherapy; and in 135 patients, quality control was performed. The overall major violation rate was 47 %, predominantly concerning target volumes. The total dose was correct in 81 % of the patients.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the potential predictive value of histology in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with curatively intended radiotherapy. In a collaborative effort among all the Swedish Oncology Departments, clinical data were collected for 1146 patients with a diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer subjected to curatively intended irradiation (>= 50 Gy) during the years 1990 to 2000. The included patients were identified based on a manual search of all medical and <b>radiation</b> <b>charts</b> at the oncology departments from which the individual patient data were collected. Only patients who did not have a histological diagnosis date and death date/last follow-up date were excluded (n = 141). Among the 1146 patients with non-small cell carcinoma eligible for analysis, 919 were diagnosed with either adenocarcinoma (n = 323) or squamous cell carcinoma (n = 596) and included in this study. The median survival for the 919 patients was 14. 8 months, while the 5 -year survival rate was 9. 5 %. Patients with adenocarcinoma had a significantly better overall survival compared with patients with squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0. 0062, log-rank test). When comparing different stages, this survival benefit was most pronounced for stages IIA-IIB (p< 0. 0001, log-rank test). The difference in survival between the two histological groups was statistically significant in a univariate Cox analysis (p = 0. 0063) as well as in two multivariate Cox analyses including demographic and treatment variables (p = 0. 037 and p = 0. 048, respectively). In this large population based retrospective study we describe for the first time that patients with adenocarcinoma have a better survival after curatively intended radiation therapy in comparison with squamous cell carcinoma patients, particularly those with clinical stages IIA-IIB.

40|$|The of {{the hybrid}} Operation room (an {{operation}} room combined with advanced radiological X-ray equipment) is gaining popularity, {{as it is}} now the preferred room to perform (complex) endovascular aortic procedures. The fixed C-arms equipped in these rooms make it possible to gain very high image quality, add the use of advanced 3 D imaging techniques to the procedure, while the room is optimized for the use of X-ray radiation. Moreover, with a hybrid OR, including these advanced imaging options, combined with evolving stent graft designs, more patients with an aortic aneurysm become eligible for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), resulting in the fact that both more EVARS, as well as that more complex EVARs, are nowadays performed. Unfortunately, the transition from a standard operation room with a mobile C-arm towards a Hybrid OR with a fixed C-arm is also complicated by the much higher radiation dose rates as a result of using fixed C-arms. When the operating team does not adapt their working habits, they will be at risk to absorb much high radiation dose per procedure, and they are at risk to reach their yearly dose limits when working in a hybrid operating environment. In this thesis, we studied the radiation dose outcomes at three different levels, and for each level, we studied both the effects of radiation exposure to the patient, as well as the effects of the absorbed radiation doses to the surgical staff. The first level included the cumulative radiation dose outcomes per type of procedure. Using the cumulative radiation dose outcomes, we were able to analyse the efficiently for new radiation and imaging techniques on reducing the radiation dose rate. We have shown that for noncomplex (for example bifurcated EVARs) radiation dose can double when a similar process is performed in a Hybrid OR vs. a standard OR. Additionally, we studied the efficacy of new techniques which may be able to reduce the intraoperative dose, for example, an advanced image processing upgrade which can reduce the radiation in the Hybrid OR or the use of new imaging strategies such as 3 D road mapping using contrast-enhanced Cone beam CT. In the second level,we studied which procedural steps during the variety of EVAR procedures accords for very high radiation dose and which EVAR steps are relatively safe. The primary goal {{of this study was to}} analyse radiation dose fluctuations during the procedure and to extract the procedural steps that accord to relatively high radiation dose exposure and analyse which EVAR procedural steps are relatively safe. In the third and deepest level, we studied the effect of a variety of radiation dose predictors, such as BMI, C-arm angulation and rotation, and field size on the initial intraoperative radiation dose rate. This level was independent of the specific procedure in which the image was used, but dose rates were analysed for each acquired image or X-ray run. The outcomes of these radiation prediction models were translated to an instant patient <b>radiation</b> risk <b>chart</b> and an instant operator <b>radiation</b> risk <b>chart.</b> These charts included the predicted radiation dose for both the patient and the operator, as well as the predicted time they can use these settings until dose thresholds are reached (2 Gray skin threshold for patient sand 20 milliSieverts/year for the operator).

The sample of the 5 patients per institution was randomly selected at the EORTC Data Center. All 12 departments participated.

All participants used linear accelerators with a minimum of 6 MeV photon-beam energy. In general, the patients were eligible, documentation of clinical data was fair to good and there were no systematic major protocol deviations. The actual total dose was 44. 7 +/-a standard deviation (S. D.) of 4. 6 Gy. Some variation was found in the fraction size.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: 2 D, conventional therapy plans were designed according to the specifications of CHART for 18 patients with NSCLC (Stages Ib, IIb, IIIa, and IIIb). Further plans were generated with the omission of elective nodal irradiation (ENI) from the treatment portals (2 D minus ENI plans [2 D-ENI plans]). Both sets were inserted in the patient's planning computed tomographies (CTs). These reconstructed plans were then compared to alternative, three-dimensional treatment plans which had been generated de novo, with the omission of ENI: 3 D minus elective nodal irradiation (3 D-ENI plans). Dose delivery to the planning target volumes (PTVs) and to the organs at risk were compared between the 3 sets of corresponding plans. The potential for dose escalation of each patient's 2 D-ENI and 3 D-ENI plan beyond 54 Gy, standard to CHART, was also determined. RESULTS: PTV coverage was suboptimal in the 2 D CHART and the 2 D-ENI plans. Only in the 3 D-ENI plans did 100 % of the PTV get > or = 95 % of the dose prescribed (i. e., 51. 5 Gy [51. 3 - 52. 2]). Using 3 D-ENI plans significantly reduced the dose received by the spinal cord, the mean and median doses to the esophagus and the heart. It did not significantly reduce the lung dose when compared to 2 D-ENI plans. Escalation of the dose (minimum > or = 1 Gy) with optimal PTV coverage was possible in 55. 5 % of patients using 3 D-ENI, but was possible only in 16. 6 % when using the 2 D-ENI planning strategy. CONCLUSIONS: 3 DCRT is fundamental to achieving optimal PTV coverage in NSCLC. A policy of omission of elective nodal irradiation alone (and using 2 D technology) will not achieve optimal PTV coverage or dose escalation. 3 DCRT with omission of ENI can achieve true escalation of CHART in 55. 5 % of tumors, depending on their site and N-stage...|$|R
