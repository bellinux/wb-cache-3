50|$|Unlike other {{twin-engine}} large {{transport aircraft}} in service at the time, the Boeing 737 was designed with a single rudder panel and single <b>rudder</b> <b>actuator.</b> The single rudder panel is controlled by a single hydraulic Power Control Unit (PCU).

Wolk published his opinion that rudder failure was the likely cause of USAir 427 crash in the Pennsylvania Law Weekly, October 10, 1994. On October 25 he appeared on CBS Evening News with Reporter Dan Rather October 25, 1994, and offered comments about possible rudder failure. After the longest investigation in aviation history, more than {{four and a half years}} later, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded the probable cause was rudder failure.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} two inverse simulation methods based on continuous system simulation principles to a ship model which incorporates a <b>rudder</b> <b>actuator</b> sub-model with saturation and rate limits. One approach depends on feedback principles while the other {{involves the use of}} an approximate differentiation method. If the actuator is operating in a linear fashion the two inverse simulation methods give very similar results. However, the differentiation method cannot be used with hard limiting and nonlinear oscillatory phenomena may cause problems with the feedback approach in such cases. An approximate two-stage procedure that avoids these difficulties is presented. Inverse simulation allows the onset of limiting to be detected and can provide useful insight about vehicle handling and manoeuvrability more directly thab conventional simulation methods...|$|E

5000|$|On 21 May 2009 a T-38 Talon {{from the}} test pilot school on a {{training}} flight crashed 12 {{miles north of}} Edwards AFB, killing the student pilot Major Mark Paul Graziano and severely injuring the student navigator Major Lee Vincent Jones. An accident investigation determined that the crash was caused when the aircraft's rudder operating mechanism disconnected the flight controls from the <b>rudder</b> <b>actuators</b> and caused the rudder to deflect 30 degrees to the left. This induced an uncontrollable yaw and a resulting roll, causing the aircraft to depart controlled flight, a condition that is unrecoverable in the T-38. The report stated that contributing factors to the crash were a structural fatigue failure or structural break in a critical component or bolt, and a maintenance error in which a nut or cotter pin did not properly secure a bolt connecting two critical components. Citing two historical cases of rudder failure, the report concluded that maintenance error was the more likely cause. The investigation concluded that [...] "insufficient supervisory oversight {{and a lack of}} discipline of the training process" [...] in the Maintenance unit existed in relation to the mishap aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Observing the {{progress}} in the technology of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) than it can be foreseen that in future the role of manned combat aircraft will be taken over more and more by unmanned systems. The abandonment of pilots allows for more freedom in the aerodynamic and structural design of vehicles in regard to weight or acceleration. However, new stealth constraints will have a severe impact on the freedom of scope. The design of UCAV configurations {{is driven by the}} special requirements of up-coming missions, as for instance the capabilities of long endurance flights joined with low observability. The new military demands have a crucial impact on the aerodynamic shape, and, hence, require new solutions for maneuver control in respect to integration of engine in- and outlets, ailerons and <b>rudders,</b> <b>actuators</b> and other devices. In particular UCAVs are suited to the exploitation of non-conventional control technologies, such as aerodynamic morphing, flow control, or thrust vectoring. This paper presents a numerical investigation of innovative leading edge morphing for aircraft applications and explores the feasibility of such technologies to enhance the manoeuverability of unmanned combat aerial vehicles. It is in particular concerned with the investigation of effectiveness of morphing devices for the aerodynamic control of UCAVs under the special constraints of needed low radar signature. One focal point of this work is the possibility to generate additional lift or role moments for UCAVs flying at different angles of attack without using classical flaps which would increase the risk of detection by higher radar signatures. Therefore, the objective of the numerical investigations is the evaluation of the potential and limitations of morphing leading edges especially for the enhancement of the maneuverability of Delta- and Lambda-wing configurations with their vortex-dominated flow field. Of special interest is flow control at high angles of attack (AoA) by targeting a minimized shape adaptation in order to generate needed additional lift, to induce rolling moments or {{to reduce the risk of}} the potential deleterious effects of vortex breakdown...|$|R
40|$|Support vector {{machines}} (SVM) {{are proposed}} {{in order to}} obtain a robust controller for ship course-keeping. A cascaded system is constructed by combining the dynamics of the <b>rudder</b> <b>actuator</b> with the dynamics of ship motion. Modeling errors and disturbances are taken into account in the plant. A controller with a simple structure is produced by applying an SVM and L 2 -gain design. The SVM is used to identify the complicated nonlinear functions and the modeling errors in the plant. The Lagrangian factors in the SVM are obtained using on-line tuning algorithms. L 2 -gain design is applied to suppress the disturbances. To obtain the optimal parameters in the SVM, then particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is incorporated. The stability and robustness of the close-loop system are confirmed by Lyapunov stability analysis.

40|$|The {{effect of}} vehicle {{configuration}} and {{flight control system}} performance on the roll agility of a modern fighter aircraft has been investigated. A batch simulation of a generic F- 18 Hornet was used to study the roll agility {{as measured by the}} time to roll through 90 deg metric. Problems discussed include definition of agility, factors affecting the agility of a vehicle, the development of the time to roll through 90 deg agility metric, and a simulation experiment. It is concluded that the integral of stability or wind axis roll rate should be used as a measure of the roll measure traversed. The time through roll angle 90 deg metric {{is considered to be a}} good metric for measuring the transient performance aspect of agility. Roll agility of the F- 18, as measured by 90 deg metric, can be improved by 10 to 30 percent.

40|$|The flow {{around an}} {{axisymmetric}} hull, {{with and without}} appendages, is investigated using large eddy simulation (LES), detached eddy simulation (DES), and Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) models. The main objectives {{of the study is}} to investigate the effect of the different simulation methods and to demonstrate the feasibility of using DES and LES on relatively coarse grids for submarine flows, but also to discuss some generic features of submarine hydrodynamics. For this purpose the DARPA Suboff configurations AFF 1 (bare hull) and AFF 8 (fully appended model) are used. The AFF 1 case is interesting because it is highly demanding, in particular for LES and DES, due to the long midship section on which the boundary layer is developed. The AFF 8 case represents the complex flow around a fully appended submarine with sail and aft <b>rudders.</b> An <b>actuator</b> disc model is used to emulate some {{of the effects of the}} propulsor for one of the AFF 8 cases studied. Results for the AFF 8 model are thus presented for both “towed” and “self-propelled” conditions, whereas for the bare hull, only a “towed” condition is considered. For the AFF 1 and the “towed” AFF 8 cases experimental data are available for comparison, and the results from both configurations show that all methods give good results for first-order statistical moments although LES gives a better representation of structures and second-order statistical moments in the complex flow in the AFF 8 case...|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} of modern fighter airplanes to sustain flight at high angles of attack and/or moderate angles of sideslip {{often results in}} immersion of part of such an airplane in unsteady, separated, vortical flow emanating from its forebody or wings. The flows from these surfaces become turbulent and separated during flight under these conditions. These flows contain significant levels of energy over a frequency band coincident with that of low-order structural vibration modes of wings, fins, and control surfaces. The unsteady pressures applied to these lifting surfaces {{as a result of}} the turbulent flows are commonly denoted buffet loads, and the resulting vibrations of the affected structures are known as buffeting. Prolonged exposure to buffet loads has resulted in fatigue of structures on several airplanes. Damage to airplanes caused by buffeting has led to redesigns of airplane structures and increased support costs for the United States Air Force and Navy as well as the armed forces of other countries. Time spent inspecting, repairing, and replacing structures adversely affects availability of aircraft for missions. A blend of rudder-control and piezoelectric- actuator engineering concepts was selected as a basis for the design of a vertical-tail buffet-load-alleviation system for the F/A- 18 airplane. In this system, the <b>rudder</b> <b>actuator</b> is used to control the response of the first tail vibrational mode (bending at a frequency near 15 Hz), while directional patch piezoelectric actuators are used to control the second tail vibrational mode (tip torsion at a frequency near 45 Hz). This blend of two types of actuator utilizes the most effective features of each. An analytical model of the aeroservoelastic behavior of the airplane equipped with this system was validated by good agreement with measured results from a full-scale ground test, flight-test measurement of buffet response, and an in-flight commanded rudder frequency sweep. The overall performance of the system was found to be characterized by reductions, ranging from 70 to 30 percent, in vertical-tail buffeting under buffet loads ranging from moderate to severe. These reductions were accomplished with a maximum commanded rudder angle of +/- 2 deg at 15 Hz and about 10 lb (. 4. 5 kg) of piezoelectric actuators attached to the vertical tail skin and operating at a peak power level of 2 kW. By meeting the design objective, this system would extend the vertical-tail fatigue life beyond two aircraft lifetimes. This system is also adaptable to other aircraft surfaces and other aircraf...|$|E
40|$|During {{return to}} flight {{servicing}} of the rudder speed brake (RSB) for each Space Shuttle Orbiter, inspectors discovered numerous small pits {{on the surface}} of the # 4 right hand side honeycomb panel that covers the <b>rudder</b> speed brake <b>actuators.</b> Shortly after detection of the problem, concurrent investigations were initiated to determine the extent of damage, the root cause, and to develop a repair plan, since fabrication of a replacement panel is impractical for cost, schedule, and sourcing considerations.

It documents the cause and contributing factors of the pitting, the means used to isolate each contributor, and the supporting evidence for the primary cause of the pitting.

5000|$|Building on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin {{modified}} {{a commercial}} {{variant of the}} C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB). This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130. [...] Modifications made to the HTTB included extended chord ailerons, a long chord rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and dorsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct mechanical linkages assisted by hydraulic boost, to fully powered controls, in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the hydraulic control valves of the appropriate boost unit. The HTTB first flew on 19 June 1984, with civil registration of N130X. After demonstrating many new technologies, {{some of which were}} applied to the C-130J, the HTTB was lost in a fatal accident on 3 February 1993, at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, in Marietta, Georgia. [...] The crash was attributed to disengagement of the rudder fly-by-wire flight control system, resulting in a total loss of rudder control capability while conducting ground minimum control speed tests (Vmcg). The disengagement was a result of the inadequate design of the <b>rudder's</b> integrated <b>actuator</b> package by its manufacturer; the operator's insufficient system safety review failed to consider the consequences of the inadequate design to all operating regimes. A factor which contributed to the accident was the flight crew's lack of engineering flight test training.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} a new {{experimental}} system for studies about the integrated course and active appendages control is introduced. The {{research focuses on}} fast ships. The appendages considered are moving flaps, fins, and a T-foil. They are used for motion smoothing. The fast ships use powerful waterjets that can be oriented for course control, instead of using <b>rudders.</b> When an <b>actuator</b> moves, course control is disturbed. An integrated actuators and course control system is needed. This is a main target of our research. A departing point for the research is to provide an experimental system for control studies. This system consists of an autonomous scaled physical model and an external support system (ESS).

40|$|Buffet is an {{aeroelastic}} phenomenon {{associated with high}} performance aircraft especially those with twin vertical tails. In particular, for the F/A- 18 aircraft at high angles of attack, vortices emanating from wing/fuselage leading edge extensions burst, immersing the vertical tails in their wake. The resulting buffet loads on the vertical tails are a concern from fatigue and inspection points of view. Recently, a 1 / 6 -scale F- 18 wind-tunnel model was tested in the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at the NASA Langley Research Center {{as part of the}} Actively Controlled Response Of Buffet Affected Tails (ACROBAT) Program to assess the use of active controls in reducing vertical tail buffeting. The starboard vertical tail was equipped with an active rudder and the port vertical tail was equipped with piezoelectric actuators. The tunnel conditions were atmospheric air at Mach 0. 10. By using single-input-single-output control laws at gains well below the physical limits of the actuators, the power spectral density of the root strains at the frequency of the first bending mode of the vertical tail was reduced by as much as 60 percent up to angles of attack of 37 degrees. Root mean square (RMS) values of root strain were reduced by as much as 19 percent. The results herein illustrate that buffet alleviation of vertical tails can be accomplished using simple active control of the <b>rudder</b> or piezoelectric <b>actuators.</b> In fact, as demonstrated herein, a fixed gain single input single output control law that commands piezoelectric actuators may be active throughout the high angle-of-attack maneuver without requiring any changes during the maneuver. Future tests are mentioned for accentuating the international interest in this area of research...|$|R
