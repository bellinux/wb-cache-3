Sheet steel is then <b>roll-formed</b> into the final profiles used for framing. The sheets are zinc coated (galvanized) to prevent oxidation and corrosion.

40|$|Conventional {{methods of}} form-roll design and {{manufacture}} for Cold <b>Roll-Forming</b> of thin-walled metal sections have been entirely manual, time consuming {{and prone to}} errors, resulting in inefficiency and high production costs. With the use of computers, lead time can be significantly improved, particularly for those aspects involving routine but tedious human decisions and actions. This thesis describes the development of computer aided tools for producing form-roll designs for NC manufacture in the CAD/CAM environment. The work was undertaken to modernise the existing activity of a company manufacturing thin-walled sections. The investigated areas of the activity, including the design and drafting of the finished section, the flower patterns, the 10 to 1 templates, and the rolls complete with pinch-difference surfaces, side-rolls and extension-contours, have been successfully computerised by software development. Data generated by the developed software can be further processed for roll manufacturing using NC lathes. The software has been specially designed for portability to facilitate its implementation on different computers. The Opening-Radii method of forming was introduced as a subsitute to the conventional method for better forming. Most of the essential aspects in roll design have been successfully incorporated in the software. With computerisation, extensive standardisation in existing roll design practices {{and the use of}} more reliable and scientifically-based methods have been achieved. Satisfactory and beneficial results have also been obtained by the company in using the software through a terminal linked to the University by a GPO line. Both lead time and productivity in roll design and manufacture have been significantly improved. It is therefore concluded that computerisation in the design of form-rolls for automation by software development is viable. The work also demonstrated the promising nature of the CAD/CAM approach...|$|R

50|$|Galvalume {{steel sheet}} is carbon steel sheet coated with aluminium-zinc alloy by a {{continuous}} hot-dip process. The nominal coating composition is 55% aluminium and 45% zinc. A small but important addition of silicon {{is included in}} the coating alloy. It is added not to enhance the corrosion performance, but to provide good coating adhesion to the steel substrate when the product is <b>roll-formed,</b> drawn, or bent during fabrication.Galvalume steel sheet combines the excellent barrier corrosion protection of aluminium with the galvanic protection of zinc. The result is a coating that lasts a long time, a coating that provides cut-edge protection along sheared edges, and therefore, a coating that offers excellent protection to steel sheet. Although there are a few exceptions, for most applications in most types of environment, Galvalume steel sheet is the preferred product when long-term resistance to atmospheric corrosion is desired. It outlasts a galvanized coating of comparable thickness, and offers cut-edge protection that is not available with aluminium-coated sheet. This cut-edge protection means there is less rust-staining along sheared edges, at scratches, and other imperfections in the coating. Also, since the coating is so resistant to corrosion, it retains a very bright surface appearance when exposed to most atmospheres. These attributes make Galvalume steel sheet the preferred material for roofing. The superior corrosion resistance of Galvalume steel sheet is achieved by the presence of microscopic zinc-rich and aluminium-rich areas within the coating. The aluminium-rich areas, which corrode very slowly, provide the long-term durability while the zinc-rich areas, which corrode preferentially, provide galvanic protection. Galvalume metals are made with steel panels having a coating of corrosion resistant aluminium-zinc alloy applied by a continuous hot dip process. The nominal composition of the coating is 55% aluminium, 43.5% zinc and 1.5% silicon. Galvalume is the trade name for this patented sheet steel product. The alloy coating of aluminium and zinc combines the best properties of both metals. It has the corrosion resistance and heat reflectivity characteristic of aluminium coatings, with the formability and galvanic protection of cut edges characteristic of zinc coatings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} half century roll forming has become a highly {{productive}} metal forming technology, well-established in the industry for the manufacturing of mass products. About 8 % of the annual world production of steel is processed by roll forming mills. Roll forming technology enables the manufacturing of profile-shaped products with an extremely wide spectrum of geometrical shapes. In lightweight construction, the utilization of <b>roll-formed</b> structures of high and ultra-high-strength steels has increased remarkably in the recent years. However, the application of those types of steel entails some disadvantages resulting in a decreasing forming capacity and enormous efforts to reach the required dimensional accuracy. Until a profile leaves the roll forming machine with the target quality, it is mostly necessary to align the forming rolls several times. Sometimes even design changes are required. This is the result of unreliable process planning. Furthermore, typical profile failures such as twist, flare and spring-back occur even stronger compared to mild steels. Nowadays, it is usual to control the dimensional accuracy of the profiles after the last forming stand. This kind of quality control has the following disadvantage: manufacturing errors are detected very late. Therefore, a continuous quality control process and an active manipulation during the forming process promise a large potential for an improvement of the dimensional accuracy and an increase of roll forming productivity...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{roll-forming}} {{has been adopted}} as a technique to improve the strength against crack propagation in railway axles, but very few scientific analyses and studies of the phenomenon {{are available in the}} literature. For this reason, the Maraxil Project was started in order to give the opportunity of experimentally and theoretically investigating some aspects related to this technological process in the case of railway axles made of EA 4 T, a typical steel for manufacture of high speed axles. Firstly, an experimental campaign on small-scale SE(B) specimens was carried out for determining the crack propagation behavior at stress ratios below - 1, which correspond to the ones in presence of the high compressive residual stresses due to the roll-forming procedure. At the same time, the compressive residual stress field along the radial direction and due to the rollforming process was evaluated from axles coming from the production using both hole-drilling and x-ray diffractometry methods. The results obtained from crack propagation tests and residual stress field measurements were used together to build up a predictive crack growth model in presence of very high compressive stresses. This model was, then, validated through dedicated experimental crack propagation tests carried out on full-scale <b>roll-formed</b> axles made of EA 4 T; good agreement was found between the model and the experiments...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the potential impact of the use of advanced high strength steel (AHSS) to form traditional cold-formed steel structural members. In this study, shell finite element models are constructed, and geometric and material nonlinear collapse analysis performed, on simulated lipped channel cross-section cold-formed steel members <b>roll-formed</b> from AHSS. AHSS sheet is currently being used in automotive applications with thickness ranging from 0. 35 to 0. 8 mm (0. 0138 to 0. 0315 in.) and yield strengths from 350 to 1250 MPa (51 to 181 ksi). However, AHSS has not yet been employed in cold-formed steel construction. To assess the impact of the adoption of AHSS on cold-formed steel member strength a group of forty standard structural lipped channel cross-sections are chosen from the Steel Framing Industry Association product list and simulated with AHSS material properties. The stress-strain models used in this study are based on AHSS in production, including dual-phase and martensitic steels. The simulations consider compression with work on bending about the major axis in progress. Three different bracing conditions are employed so that the impact of local, distortional, and global buckling, including interactions can be explored. Due to the higher yield stresses of AHSS the potential for interaction and mode switching is anticipated to be greater in these members compared with conventional mild steels. The simulations provide a direct means to assess the increase in strength created by the application of AHSS, while also allowing for future exploration of the increase in buckling mode interaction, imperfection sensitivity, and strain demands inherent in the larger capacities. The work is intended to be an initial step in a longer-term effort to foster innovation in the application of new steels in cold-formed steel construction...|$|E

The {{selected}} profiled steel sheets for the testing are namely called ‘Bondek II’ (corrugated steel sheet) and the specimen models was made by BHP Steel Building Products (M) Sdn. Bhd. Shah Alam. The Bondek II steel sheeting is <b>roll-formed</b> from hotdipped, zinc coated, and chromate passivated high-strength grade BHP Zinc Hi- Ten steel strip. Bondek II (corrugated sheet) has sheet thickness t = 1 mm, depth of fold /* = 54 mm, sheet width a = 600 mm and length of models is / = 1000 mm. A compressive test was carried on the Bondek II specimen models. The experimental investigation was on four full-scale models of profiled sheet subjected to in-plane axial compressive loading, P. The model tested included two models without door opening. The size of door opening is 180 mm width and 700 mm height which has been converted from the standard door size of 900 mm width x 2100 mm (3 ft x 7 ft). The results of specimens without opening obtained from the experimental work are used as guide to the specimens with door opening. The parameters measured and determined are lateral deflection, buckling and ultimate load capacity. From the experimental test, the load displacement curve and stress-strain pattern was plotted and identified. From this study, the ultimate load capacity of compressed profiled steel with door opening was identified to be smaller than that without opening. This may be because the opening reduced the carrying capacity of the models. The openings also tend to increase the deflection of the models. The specimen with opening is noticed to buckle much faster than without opening. It was also found that the buckling shape occurred at different location for each specimen. The average ultimate load capacity for the specimens without opening determined from the experimental test carried out is 159. 95 kN and the ultimate load capacity for the specimens with door opening is 109. 15 kN. The average percentage different of ultimate load between specimens without opening and with opening is approximately 32 percent...|$|E
