5000|$|These were {{intended}} for use in Operation Herkules, the planned but never-executed Italo-German invasion of Malta. Ten of them were specially modified to each carry a captured Russian KV-1 or KV-2 heavy tank.

30|$|Handrim {{propulsion}} causes detrimental compressive joint contact {{forces that}} {{could contribute to}} the development of a shoulder impingement syndrome. Because of that the importance of the problem, the mechanisms of the development of these forces and approaches for their reduction have been a topic of many research studies [17 – 19]. Vegger et al. examined shoulder joint contact force for two wheelchair speeds and two levels of resistance by using kinematic data and kinetic data from a sensored handrim. Their study revealed that shoulder contact force is relatively low when wheelchair propulsion has low-intensity [18]. Morrow et al. used kinematic and kinetic data to estimate shoulder joint contact force during various arm loadings such as level propulsion, <b>ramp</b> propulsion, and <b>weight</b> relief lift activities. They revealed that shoulder joint contact forces during <b>ramp</b> propulsion and <b>weight</b> relief lift activities are markedly higher than those during level propulsion [19].|$|R

2500|$|This barge was a Type A {{altered to}} carry and rapidly {{off-load}} the submersible tanks (Tauchpanzer) developed {{for use in}} Sea Lion. They {{had the advantage of}} being able to unload their tanks directly into water up to [...] in depth, several hundred yards from shore, whereas the unmodified Type A had to be firmly grounded on the beach, making it more vulnerable to enemy fire. The Type B required a longer external ramp (11 meters) with a float attached to the front of it. Once the barge anchored, the crew would extend the internally stowed ramp using block and tackle sets until it was resting on the water’s surface. As the first tank rolled forward onto the <b>ramp,</b> its <b>weight</b> would tilt the forward end of the ramp into the water and push it down onto the seabed. Once the tank rolled off, the ramp would bob back up to a horizontal position, ready for the next one to exit. The Navy High Command increased its initial order for 60 of these vessels to 70 in order to compensate for expected losses. A further five were ordered on 30 September as a reserve.|$|R
50|$|The {{program was}} delayed several times, at first due to underestimating the {{developmental}} complexity and manufacturing learning {{curve of the}} production composite construction, and later due to the technical difficulties of correcting a pitch damping problem and developing the stall-warning system. By the end of development, the Starship had grown larger in cabin volume than the King Air 350 while having the same gross <b>ramp</b> <b>weight</b> of 15010 lb. Starship development cost $300 million. The first production Starship flew on April 25, 1989.|$|E
50|$|The A380 {{requires}} {{service vehicles}} with lifts capable {{of reaching the}} upper deck, as well as tractors capable of handling the A380's maximum <b>ramp</b> <b>weight.</b> When using two jetway bridges the boarding time is 45 min, and when using an extra jetway to the upper deck it is reduced to 34 min. The A380 has an airport turnaround time of 90-110 minutes. In 2008 the A380 test aircraft were used to trial the modifications made to several airports to accommodate the type.|$|E
50|$|Brake release {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} {{at the start of}} a runway, just prior to brake release for take-off. This is the <b>ramp</b> <b>weight</b> minus any fuel used for taxiing. Major airports may have runways that are about 2 miles (3 km) long, so merely taxiing from the terminal to the end of the runway might consume up to a ton of fuel. After taxiing, the pilot lines up the aircraft with the runway and puts the brakes on. On receiving take-off clearance, the pilot throttles up the engines and releases the brakes to start accelerating along the runway in preparation for taking off.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose:A new cone-beam CT scanner for image-guided {{radiotherapy}} (IGRT) can independently {{rotate the}} source and the detector along circular trajectories. Existing reconstruction algorithms are not suitable for this scanning geometry. The authors propose and evaluate a three-dimensional (3 D) filtered-backprojection reconstruction for this situation. Methods:The source and the detector trajectories are tuned to image a field-of-view (FOV) that is offset {{with respect to the}} center-of-rotation. The new reconstruction formula is derived from the Feldkamp algorithm and results in a similar three-step algorithm: projection <b>weighting,</b> <b>ramp</b> filtering, and weighted backprojection. Simulations of a Shepp Logan digital phantom were used to evaluate the new algorithm with a 10 [*]cm-offset FOV. A real cone-beam CTimage with an 8. 5 [*]cm-offset FOV was also obtained from projections of an anthropomorphic head phantom. Results:The quality of the cone-beam CT images reconstructed using the new algorithm was similar to those using the Feldkamp algorithm which is used in conventional cone-beam CT. The real image of the head phantom exhibited comparable image quality to that of existing systems. Conclusions:The authors have proposed a 3 D filtered-backprojection reconstruction for scanners with independent source and detector rotations that is practical and effective. This algorithm forms the basis for exploiting the scanner’s unique capabilities in IGRT protocols...|$|R
50|$|The final 2000A {{configuration}} had tuning-fork-type noise dampers {{and improved}} insulation to reduce cabin noise and redesigned exhaust stacks for more efficient engine airflow. Stall strips {{placed on the}} front wing to enhance stall behavior were removed. Elimination of the stall strips reduced stall speed by up to 9 kn, which allows the 2000A to takeoff from shorter runways. The 2000 had standpipes in the fuel tanks to artificially limit fuel capacity so the aircraft would meet a target payload weight. The standpipes were removed in the 2000A, increasing fuel capacity by 31 gal. Both the maximum <b>ramp</b> <b>weight</b> and takeoff weight were increased by 500 lb and zero fuel weight was increased 400 lb.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturers are {{required}} to calculate ACNs for new aircraft as they come into service and publish the results in flight manuals. The tables give ACN values for two weights, one at the maximum total weight authorized and the other at the operating weight when empty. If an aircraft is operating at an intermediate weight, the ACN value can be calculated by a linear variation between the limits. Extrapolation is not permissible. ACN is calculated {{with respect to the}} center of gravity position, which yields the critical loading on the critical gear. Normally, the aftmost center of gravity, or CG position, appropriate to the maximum gross apron (ramp) mass, or <b>ramp</b> <b>weight,</b> is used to calculate the ACN. In exceptional cases, the forwardmost CG position may make the nose-landing gear loading more critical.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to assess the}} feasibility of an eight-passenger, supersonic-cruise long range business jet aircraft that could be converted into a military missile carrying interceptor. The baseline passenger version has a flight crew of two with cabin space for four rows of two passenger seats plus baggage and lavatory room in the aft cabin. The <b>ramp</b> <b>weight</b> is 61, 600 pounds with an internal fuel capacity of 30, 904 pounds. Utilizing an improved version of a current technology low-bypass ratio turbofan engine, range is 3, 622 nautical miles at Mach 2. 0 cruise and standard day operating conditions. Balanced field takeoff distance is 6, 600 feet and landing distance is 5, 170 feet at 44, 737 pounds. The passenger section from aft of the flight crew station to the aft pressure bulkhead in the cabin was modified for the interceptor version. Bomb bay type doors were added and volume is sufficient for four advanced air-to-air missiles mounted on a rotary launcher. Missile volume {{was based on a}} Phoenix type missile with a weight of 910 pounds per missile for a total payload weight of 3, 640 pounds. Structural and equipment weights were adjusted and result in a <b>ramp</b> <b>weight</b> of 63, 246 pounds with a fuel load of 30, 938 pounds. Based on a typical intercept mission flight profile, the resulting radius is 1, 609 nautical miles at a cruise Mach number of 2. 0...|$|E
40|$|A Mach- 3. 0, 250 -passenger, 6500 -n. mi. range SST configuration's {{alternative}} use of fixed-planform or variable-sweep wings {{is presently}} evaluated, {{with a view}} to effects on aerodynamics, mission performance, and sizing. After preliminary design, the fixed and variable-wing configurations were resized to perform missions incorporating subsonic cruise segments of as much as 4000 n. mi.; the effect of subsonic segment length on design gross weight and block time was then ascertained. Due to the reduced supersonic efficiency of the variable-sweep aircraft, over one-half of the 6500 -n. mi. mission would have to be flown subsonically for its sizing to reach a lower <b>ramp</b> <b>weight</b> than that of its fixed-geometry counterpart...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{variable}} sweep wing technology with relaxed static stability requirements on a supersonic-cruise executive jet with transatlantic range was assessed.

The baseline concept has a <b>ramp</b> <b>weight</b> of 64, 500 pounds {{with a crew}} of two and eight passengers. Its Mach 2. 0 cruise range is nearly 3, 500 nautical miles; its Mach 0. 9 cruise range is over 5, 000 nautical miles. Takeoff, landing, and balanced field length requirements were calculated for a composite variant and are all less than 5, 000 feet...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{interest}} {{surrounds the}} design of the next generation of single-aisle commercial transports in the Boeing 737 and Airbus A 320 class. Aircraft designers will depend on advanced, next-generation turbofan engines to power these airplanes. The focus {{of this study is to}} apply single- and multi-objective optimization algorithms to the conceptual design of ultrahigh bypass turbofan engines for this class of aircraft, using NASA s Subsonic Fixed Wing Project metrics as multidisciplinary objectives for optimization. The independent design variables investigated include three continuous variables: sea level static thrust, wing reference area, and aerodynamic design point fan pressure ratio, and four discrete variables: overall pressure ratio, fan drive system architecture (i. e., direct- or gear-driven), bypass nozzle architecture (i. e., fixed- or variable geometry), and the high- and low-pressure compressor work split. <b>Ramp</b> <b>weight,</b> fuel burn, noise, and emissions are the parameters treated as dependent objective functions. These optimized solutions provide insight to the ultrahigh bypass engine design process and provide information to NASA program management to help guide its technology development efforts...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a methodology for sizing Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) transports and how the capabilities of the Flight Optimization System (FLOPS) have been expanded using that methodology. In this approach, BWB transports are sized {{based on the number of}} passengers in each class that must fit inside the centerbody or pressurized vessel. Weight estimation equations for this centerbody structure were developed using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). This paper shows how the sizing methodology has been incorporated into FLOPS to enable the design and analysis of BWB transports. Previous versions of FLOPS did not have the ability to accurately represent or analyze BWB configurations in any reliable, logical way. The expanded capabilities allow the design and analysis of a 200 to 450 -passenger BWB transport or the analysis of a BWB transport for which the geometry is already known. The modifications to FLOPS resulted in differences of less than 4 percent for the <b>ramp</b> <b>weight</b> of a BWB transport in this range when compared to previous studies performed by NASA and Boeing...|$|E
40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} to evaluate the feasibility of a transonic biplane consisting of a forward-mounted swept-back lower wing, a rear-mounted swept-forward upper wing, and a vertical fin connecting the wings at their tips. This wing arrangement results in significant reductions in induced drag relative to a monoplane designed with the same span, and it allows for a constant-section fuselage shape while closely matching an ideal area distribution curve for M = 0. 95 cruise. However, no significant reductions in <b>ramp</b> <b>weight</b> were achieved for the biplane relative to a monoplane with the same mission capability. Flutter analyses of the biplane revealed both symmetric and antisymmetric instabilities that occur well below the required flutter speed. Further studies {{will be required to}} determine if acceptable flutter speeds can be achieved through the elimination of the instabilities by passive means or by active controls. Configurations designed for other missions, especially those with lower Mach numbers and lower dynamic pressures, should be examined since the geometries suitable for those design constraints might avoid the weight penalties and flutter instabilities which prevent exploitation of induced drag benefits for the configuration studied...|$|E
