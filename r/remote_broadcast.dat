25|$|On September 11, 1987, Rather marched off-camera {{in anger}} {{just before a}} <b>remote</b> <b>broadcast</b> of the program when it {{appeared}} that CBS Sports' coverage of a U.S. Open tennis semifinal match between Steffi Graf and Lori McNeil was going to overrun into time allotted for his program. Rather was in Miami covering the visit to the city by Pope John Paul II. When the tennis match ended sooner than expected at 6:32p.m. Eastern Time, Rather {{was nowhere to be}} found. Six minutes of dead air followed before he returned to the broadcast position; nearly half of the audience watched and waited. Rather apologized for the outburst the next day. By 1990, the CBS Evening News was in third place behind ABC's World News Tonight with Peter Jennings and NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw.|$|E

25|$|Early {{programming}} often featured live musical {{performances by}} a band composed of Westinghouse employees. The station provided its first <b>remote</b> <b>broadcast</b> on January 2, 1921, airing a religious service from Calvary Episcopal Church. The Calvary services {{soon became a}} regular Sunday evening offering, and were continued until 1962. On January 15, 1921, at 8 p.m., KDKA broadcast a speech on European relief by Herbert Hoover from the Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh, that was carried ten miles (sixteen kilometers) by a telephone line connection to Westinghouse's East Pittsburgh Works. On July 2, 1921, an announcer repeated the ringside commentary, sent by telegraph, from the Jack Dempsey - Georges Carpentier fight in New Jersey. On August 5, 1921, KDKA became the first radio station to broadcast a major league professional baseball game, when announcer Harold W. Arlin called the Pittsburgh Pirates-Philadelphia Phillies game from Forbes Field. In the fall of that year, the station became the first to broadcast a college football game. In 1922, KDKA hosted political humorist Will Rogers in his first radio appearance.|$|E
500|$|As {{financial}} losses mounted, the B finally ceded the New YorkWashington {{market to}} the Pennsylvania Railroad altogether, discontinuing all passenger service north of Baltimore on Saturday, April 26, 1958, and bringing the venerable Royal Blue to an end. As the engineer {{was about to}} ease the locomotive's throttle open for the Royal Blue's final departure from Washington Union Station at 3:45p.m., the event was covered in a trainside <b>remote</b> <b>broadcast</b> by Edward R. Murrow on a CBS network See It Now television special. The train's 7:49p.m. arrival at Jersey City Terminal was met by news reporters from The New York Times, the New York Post, Life magazine and The Saturday Evening Post, on hand to cover the legendary Royal Blues demise. In an editorial the next day, the Baltimore Sun lamented {{the end of the}} Royal Blue, saying it [...] "may {{have been one of the}} most famous named trains in history". [...] The New York Times, in a [...] article accompanied by a photograph of train engineer Michael Goodnight bidding farewell to a 7-year old passenger, said [...] "It was a sad and simple story yesterday as the nation's oldest railroad discontinued its crack Royal Blue and its five other passenger trains...end sixty-eight years of continuous through service, operated in a gentlemanly fashion...a kind of ante-bellum, gracious way of life...and the reputation for very special service." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{originally}} announced by New Jersey's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority that the 2017 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve would feature a live performance from Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall by an unannounced artist. However, {{it was later}} announced by the CRDA that {{there would not be}} a broadcast from Atlantic City during the special, citing [...] "scheduling conflicts and other considerations", and that an attempt would be made for 2018 instead. Robert Mulcahy, chairman of the board for the CRDA, stated to the Philadelphia Inquirer that Live Nation (which was to fund the broadcast using cash left over from beach concerts, promoted under a larger contract with the CRDA, that were cancelled due to weather) was unable to book an act that could meet the approval of Dick Clark Productions. Mulcahy added that local casinos declined offers to cover the costs of the proposed broadcast, as they preferred to host parties for their guests rather than book major concert acts on New Year's Eve. The opportunity to host a <b>remote</b> <b>broadcast</b> during NYRE was an aspect of a larger contract to continue hosting the DCP-produced Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, which prescribed the availability of [...] "promotional accommodations" [...] for the city in other DCP-produced programming, such as New Year's Rockin' Eve and the Billboard Music Awards.|$|E

Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240 lines of resolution on BBC television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly.
