5|$|On the Taaienberg, Tiesj Benoot (Lotto–Soudal) led the peloton, with Boonen {{right behind}} him. A ten-rider group {{broke away from}} the peloton over the climb, with Benoot and Boonen joined by Roelandts, Cancellara, Boom, Vanmarcke, Daniel Oss (BMC) and three other Etixx–Quick-Step riders (Terpstra, Štybar and Trentin). On the next climb, the Boigneberg, Cancellara's <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur</b> failed and it took more than a minute for his team to bring him a {{replacement}} bike, putting him a long way behind the other favourites. Shortly afterwards, the breakaway was caught by the chasing group; the combined group was then caught by another group that contained Sagan and Kwiatkowski to create a 20-man lead group, although Štybar soon suffered a puncture and fell out of the group. Cancellara, meanwhile, was in a group led by his teammates Yaroslav Popovych and Markel Irizar around two minutes behind.|$|E
25|$|Control cables are routed along mounts {{on the top}} tube, or {{sometimes}} inside the top tube. Most commonly, this includes the cable for the rear brake, but some mountain bikes and hybrid bicycles also route the front and <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur</b> cables along the top tube.|$|E
25|$|On {{a bicycle}} {{with only one}} gear change {{mechanism}} (e.g. rear hub only or <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur</b> only), the number of possible gear ratios {{is the same as}} the number of usable gear ratios, which is also the same as the number of distinct gear ratios.|$|E

25|$|There {{is seldom}} {{any need to}} change both front and <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs</b> {{simultaneously}} so it is generally more suitable for casual or inexperienced cyclists.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} chainrings with {{half-step}} {{differences between the}} larger two and multi-range differences between the smaller two, e.g. chainrings 24-42-46 and cogset 12-14-16-18-21-24-28-32-36. This general arrangement is suitable for touring with most gear changes being made using the <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur</b> and occasional fine tuning using the two large chainrings. The small chainring (granny gear) is a bailout for handling steeper hills, but it requires some anticipation {{in order to use}} it effectively.|$|E
25|$|The chain stays run {{parallel}} to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket shell to the rear fork ends or dropouts. When the <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur</b> cable is routed partially along the down tube, it is also routed along the chain stay. Occasionally (principally on frames made since the late 1990s) mountings for disc brakes will {{be attached to the}} chain stays. There may be a small brace that connects the chain stays in front of the rear wheel and behind the bottom bracket shell.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of road cycling, compact {{drivetrain}} typically refers to double cranksets with a smaller (usually 110mm) bolt circle diameter than the standard 130mm or Campagnolo's 135mm. As of 2006, {{all of the major}} component manufacturers such as Shimano and Campagnolo offer compact cranks in their midrange and high-end product lines. The compact crankset provides a compromise between the standard road double crankset (with 39/52 or 39/53 tooth chainrings) and the road triple (with 30/42/52 or 30/39/53 tooth chainrings). The compact crankset has two chainrings and typical ratios are 34/48, 34/50 and 36/50. This provides nearly the same lower gear ratios as a triple but without the need for a third chainring, a triple front derailleur and a long cage <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur.</b> Both Shimano and Campagnolo recommend and sell front derailleurs specifically designed for compact cranksets, claiming better shifting.|$|E
50|$|In 1949 Campagnolo {{introduced}} the Gran Sport, a more refined {{version of the}} then already existing, yet less commercially successful, cable-operated parallelogram <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs.</b>|$|R

50|$|When both {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs</b> are {{used with a}} geared hub, {{the result is a}} very wide-ranging drivetrain, at the expense of {{increased}} weight and complexity.|$|R
25|$|The {{combination}} of 3 chainrings and an 8-sprocket cogset does {{not result in}} 24 usable gear ratios. Instead it provides 3 overlapping ranges of 7, 8, and 7 gear ratios. The outer ranges only have 7 ratios rather than 8 because the extreme combinations (largest chainring to largest rear sprocket, smallest chainring to smallest rear sprocket) result in a very diagonal chain alignment which is inefficient and causes excessive chain wear. Due to the overlap, there will usually be some duplicates or near-duplicates, so that there might only be 16 or 18 distinct gear ratios. It may not be feasible to use these distinct ratios in strict low-high sequence anyway due to the complicated shifting patterns involved (e.g. simultaneous double or triple shift on the <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur</b> and a single shift on the front derailleur). In the worst case there could be only 10 distinct gear ratios, if the percentage step between chainrings {{is the same as}} the percentage step between sprockets. However, if the most popular ratio is duplicated then it may be feasible to extend the life of the gear set by using different versions of this popular ratio.|$|E
500|$|Klein held {{a patent}} (...) for an {{improved}} {{method of routing}} cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame. The front and <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur</b> cables were routed through the down tube, and the rear brake cable through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.|$|E
2500|$|On {{a bicycle}} {{with more than}} one gear change {{mechanism}} (e.g. front and <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur),</b> these three numbers can be quite different, depending on the relative gearing steps of the various mechanisms. [...] The number of gears for such a derailleur equipped bike is often stated simplistically, particularly in advertising, and this may be misleading.|$|E
5000|$|Low {{normal or}} rapid rise <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs</b> return the chain {{to the largest}} {{sprocket}} on the cassette when no cable tension is applied. While this was once a common design for <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs,</b> it is relatively uncommon today. [...] In mountain biking and off-road cycling, the most critical gear changes occur on uphill sections, where riders must cope with obstacles and difficult turns while pedalling under heavy load. This derailleur type provides an advantage over high normal derailleurs because gear changes to lower gears occur {{in the direction of}} the loaded spring, making these shifts easier during high load pedalling.|$|R
50|$|Two-speed rear hubs, {{that the}} rider shifted by back pedalling, were common, but some {{featured}} external <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs</b> with 3 or 5 gear ratios and automotive-like gear shifters {{mounted on the}} top tube.|$|R
50|$|There are {{at least}} two methods {{employed}} by <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs</b> to maintain the appropriate gap between the upper jockey wheel and the rear sprockets as the derailleur moves between the large sprockets and the small sprockets.|$|R
2500|$|The seat stays {{connect the}} top of the seat tube (often at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork dropouts. [...] A {{traditional}} frame uses a simple set of paralleled tubes connected by a bridge above the rear wheel. When the <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur</b> cable is routed partially along the top tube, it is also usually routed along the seat stay.|$|E
2500|$|External gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} {{sprockets}} involved are readily visible. There may be up to 4 chainrings attached to the crankset and pedals, and typically between 5 and 11 sprockets making up the cogset attached to the rear wheel. Modern front and rear derailleurs typically consist of a moveable chain-guide that is operated remotely by a Bowden cable attached to a shifter mounted on the down tube, handlebar stem, or handlebar. A shifter may be a single lever, or a pair of levers, or a twist grip; some shifters may be incorporated with brake levers into a single unit. When a rider operates the shifter while pedalling, the change in cable tension moves the chain-guide from side to side, [...] "derailing" [...] the chain onto different sprockets. The <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur</b> also has spring-mounted jockey wheels which take up any slack in the chain.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Sagan (...) {{was dropped}} on the Cole Grade, but some {{teammates}} folded back to help him reintegrate the main group, which he did. In the run-in to Escondido, world champion Philippe Gilbert (...) was distanced, and Luis Amaran of [...] took a nasty spill, but was able to remount and finish the stage. Jones and Stemper were finally caught with [...] to go. As the two shook hands to congratulate {{each other for the}} big effort, Lieuwe Westra (...) jumped out of the peloton, and was joined by Francisco Mancebo (...) [...] Sagan then had problems with his <b>rear</b> <b>derailleur</b> and was soon relegated {{to the back of the}} peloton, where he sorted out the problem without leaving the saddle. The Mancebo-Westra duo cooperated well, taking advantage of the sprinters' teams confusion, and managed to resist. Westra outsprinted Mancebo to take 's second win of the year and the 10 seconds bonification. Sagan won the sprint of the bunch, coming in six seconds after the escapees. Thanks to their long escape, Jones earned the mountains classification jersey while his fellow escapee Stemper won the [...] "Most Courageous" [...] rider jersey.|$|E
50|$|A {{wireless}} {{system that}} can be retrofitted onto any bicycle was announced in 2016. The front and <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs</b> remain place, while a wireless gear-change controller {{is added to the}} handlebar, with configureation of the system via an iOS/Android app, and customization can be added to the button controllers via the Bluetooth app.|$|R

25|$|At {{an extreme}} {{opposite}} {{from a single}} speed bicycle, hub gears can be combined with both front and <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs,</b> giving a very wide-ranging drivetrain {{at the expense of}} weight and complexity of operation- there are a total of three sets of gears.

50|$|In the 1970s, Japanese {{manufacturers}} introduced {{their own}} version of the derailleurs. The Japanese bicycle company, SunTour introduced the slant parallelogram <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs</b> which were tilted back allowing the cage to be located farther away from the freewheel than the European version. This allowed for the chain to shift more smoothly from gear to gear. The Japanese version of the derailleur became the standard and still is today.|$|R

50|$|In early March 2006, some pro riders {{were seen}} riding with Shimano {{electronic}} shifting groupsets; further {{testing in the}} pro-ranks continued during the next 2 years. In late 2009, Shimano released their electronically shifted Dura-Ace Di2 groupset, consisting of battery powered, servo actuated front and <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs</b> controlled by electronic bar-end or brake lever integrated shifting paddles. Other components such as the crankset and brakeset are carryovers from the standard Dura-Ace 7900 group.|$|R
50|$|High {{normal or}} top normal <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs</b> return the chain to the {{smallest}} sprocket on the cassette when no cable tension is applied. This is the regular pattern used on most Shimano mountain, all Shimano road, and all SRAM and Campagnolo derailleurs. In this condition, spring pressure {{takes care of the}} easier change to smaller sprockets. In road racing the swiftest gear changes are required on the sprints to the finish line, hence high-normal types, which allow a quick change to a higher gear, remain the preference.|$|R
50|$|In 1924, the French bicycle company, Le Cyclo, {{introduced}} a gear-shifting bicycle with a two sprocket freewheel, {{which would allow}} riders to go uphill with more ease. In the late 1920s, Le Cyclo began using both front and <b>rear</b> <b>derailleurs</b> in combination with a double chainring giving the bicycle twice as many gears. In the early 1930s, Le Cyclo invented a four sprocket freewheel and several years later the company combined the four sprocket freewheel with a triple chainring giving the bicycle twelve gears.|$|R
