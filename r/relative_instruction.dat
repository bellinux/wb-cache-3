40|$|Performance {{comparisons}} {{across different}} computer architectures cannot usually separate the architectural contribution from various implementation and technology contributions to performance. This paper compares an example implementation from the RISC and CISC architectural schools (a MIPS M/ 2000 and a Digital VAX 8700) on {{nine of the}} ten SPEC benchmarks. The organizational similarity of these machines provides an opportunity to examine the purely architectural advantages of RISC. The RISC approach offers, compared with VAX, many fewer cycles per instruction but somewhat more instructions per program. Using results from a software monitor on the MIPS machine and a hardware monitor on the VAX, this paper shows that the resulting advantage in cycles per program ranges from slightly under a factor of 2 to almost a factor of 4, with a geometric mean of 2. 7. It also demonstrates the correlation between cycles per instruction and <b>relative</b> <b>instruction</b> count. Various reasons for this correlati [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis of}} Anna-Maria Papadaki realizes {{a meeting between}} apophatic {{theology}} of the orthodox Church and of abstract art, and specifically the artistic creation and the theoretical writings of the artists of Russian Avant-Garde, of W. Kandinsky and P. Klee. The path of theological apophaticism and of painterly abstraction looks common, {{although there is a}} basic difference: the fathers express the experience of the vision of God, and the artists only a hope for this vision, but a creative dialogue is possible. During their effort to meet God, the artists use apophatic names and expressions, which approach apophatic theology, for example “zero” as expressed by Malevich and the “not being” of Maximus the Confessor. They also use affirmative expressions, like the beauty and the light, and they unknowingly separate absolute and relative beauty and light, (created and non-created in theological terms), concluding an apophaticism of beauty and light, through believing that absolute beauty and light can never be depicted. Through all these they accept that the Being they search is transcendental and that they can’t come to know it, but they also express the hope that they can meet with an energy or a power of it, expressing unknowingly the distinction between substance and energy in God, believing that not only the divine substance is unknown by man, but also the substance of the created beings. Although orthodox theology and abstract art were frequently accused for rejecting the material world, in reverse they counter it in a positive way, as we can see through the use of dissimilar symbols, through the effort to know the words of the beings (which the artists call formulas or enigmas), and through the consideration of the world as a fellow traveler in a common course. This body of the world is considered to be in a perpetual movement, and the <b>relative</b> <b>instruction</b> of Klee comes to meet the instruction of Maximus and of John of Damascus about the same subject. This body is been demonstrated by the model of the hierarchy of Dionysius and the spiritual triangle of Kandinsky and the artist or the saint has the responsibility of its unification, not only in a theoretical or an abstract way, but actually, with sacrifices and persecutions. All the above have a clear eschatological dimension, as expressed in the thought of Kandinsky. Another meeting is realized through the dialogue between the art of the orthodox Church, and especially the icon, and abstract art, considering not only the style, but also the ontology of the two artistic expressions. At the end, a dialogue between theology and the nihilism or atheism that potentially exists in modern art, takes place, and concludes that a creative opening to the world is possible. The conclusion of this thesis is that abstract art, an important part of civilization, frequently accused for atheism or nihilism, meets here with orthodox theology and mainly apophaticism, in a dialogue that proves that theology is so holistic that it even can contain the universality of abstract art. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of analogical <b>instruction,</b> <b>relative</b> to explicit <b>instruction,</b> for {{the acquisition of}} a complex motor skill and subsequent performance under pressure was investigated using a modified (seated) basketball shooting task. Differences in attentional resource allocation associated with analogy and explicit learning were also examined using probe reaction times (PRT). Access to task-relevant explicit (declarative) knowledge was assessed. The analogy and explicit learning groups performed equally well during learning and delayed retention tests. The explicit group experienced a drop in performance during a pressured transfer test, relative to their performance during a preceding retention test. However, the analogy group's performance was unaffected by the pressure manipulation. Results from PRTs suggested that both groups allocated equal amounts of attentional resources to the task throughout learning and test trials. Analogy learners had significantly less access to rules about the mechanics of their movements, relative to explicit learners. The results are interpreted {{in the context of}} Eysenck and Calvo's (1992) processing efficiency theory and Masters's (1992) theory of reinvestment. © 2009 Human Kinetics, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
