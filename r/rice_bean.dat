50|$|Housewarming in South Korea {{is called}} Jib-Deul-Yi (집들이), and it {{involves}} the customary practice of hosting a small gathering after moving into a new home. Friends, relatives, and neighbors are shown around the house while being served food and drinks. Traditionally, {{the owner of the}} new home would invite a shaman (무당 mudang) to perform a shamanist ritual (gut) on the evening of move-in day. However, today people prefer to celebrate the completion of home construction somewhat differently. In Ongjin-gun, Gyeonggi-do, it is called the deulchari (들차리), and the owner will select an evening to invite friends and villagers to show them around while serving them food. The food served is usually bibimbap (비빔밥) mixed with <b>rice,</b> <b>bean</b> sprouts, and gangtu (a type of seaweed). People celebrate late into the night by playing an hourglass-shaped drum (장구 janggu) and singing. People who live in the Seongnam area have a similar celebration when they build or move into a new home. Their guests prepare matches or candles, which symbolizes their wishes for the household to rise and prosper. People offer detergent and toilet paper as moving-in presents, which signifies that everything will go well.|$|E
50|$|Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi and Ohashi, {{previously}} Phaseolus calcaratus, is a warm-season annual vine legume {{with yellow}} flowers and small edible beans. It is commonly called ricebean or <b>rice</b> <b>bean.</b> To date, {{it is little}} known, little researched and little exploited. It {{is regarded as a}} minor food and fodder crop and is often grown as intercrop or mixed crop with maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or cowpea (V. unguiculata), as well as a sole crop in the uplands, on a very limited area. Like the other Asiatic Vigna species, ricebean is a fairly short-lived warm-season annual. Grown mainly as a dried pulse, it is also important as a fodder, a green manure and a vegetable. Ricebean is most widely grown as an intercrop, particularly of maize, throughout Indo-China and extending into southern China, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In the past it was widely grown as lowland crop on residual soil water after the harvest of long-season rice, but it has been displaced to a great extent where shorter duration rice varieties are grown. Ricebean grows well on a range of soils. It establishes rapidly and has the potential to produce large amounts of nutritious animal fodder and high quality grain.|$|E
