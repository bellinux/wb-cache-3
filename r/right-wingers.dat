5|$|On {{his trip}} to Israel in October 1985, Weizsäcker was greeted on arrival by his Israeli counterpart, President Chaim Herzog. The {{president}} was given a full honor-guard welcome at Ben-Gurion Airport; among Cabinet ministers who lined up {{to shake his hand}} were <b>right-wingers</b> of the Herut party, the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, who had previously refused to greet German leaders. Weizsäcker's visit was the first by a head of state, but not the first by a West German leader, as Chancellor Willy Brandt had paid a visit to Israel in June 1973. During a four-day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986, Weizsäcker addressed a joint session of the Houses of Parliament, the first German to be accorded that honor.|$|E

25|$|The {{shop steward}} {{movement}} worried many <b>right-wingers,</b> {{who believed that}} socialists were fomenting a Bolshevik revolution in Britain. A Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was founded, but it attracted only existing left-wing militants, with the British Socialist Party and Workers Socialist Federation joining many Socialist Labour Party activists in it.|$|E
25|$|After the Labour Party {{lost the}} 1951 election, {{he became the}} Chairman of Keep Left, Bevan's {{political}} group.

25|$|Although Finland had had {{residual}} pro-German sentiments from Imperial Germany's critical support {{during the}} Civil War, those sentiments were dented by the Nazi ideology, especially its undemocratic totalitarism. Finland had democratic traditions {{dating back to}} at least the 16th century, and after the failed rebellions by left-wingers and <b>right-wingers,</b> the Finns were rather alienated by the brutal policies of the new Germany.|$|E
25|$|Thus, in the {{elections}} of that year Miari and Peled were elected to the Knesset. Peled's parliamentary term coincided with the tense atmosphere of {{the outbreak of the}} First Intifada. However, he was far from confining himself to the hotly controversial issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, taking great interest in a great spectrum of subjects, on some of which he found common ground with staunch <b>right-wingers.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Bossy set a scoring {{record for}} <b>right-wingers</b> with 147 points while also winning the Stanley Cup and Conn Smythe Trophy. However, far more {{attention}} {{was given to}} Gretzky who not only won the Hart Trophy and Art Ross Trophy, but also shattered scoring records with an unheard of 212 points and 92 goals. Bossy aspired {{to be the best}} player of his era but fell short, as the Hart and Art Ross Trophies were two of the awards that eluded Bossy during his career, going to Guy Lafleur, Trottier, and Gretzky. Although the Islanders swept the Oilers in the 1983 final to win a fourth consecutive championship, Gretzky and his Oilers still received the most attention.|$|E

25|$|Benítez's {{preferred}} {{formation is}} a 4–2–3–1 which he adopted {{during his time}} at Valencia and Liverpool. He has often been praised for his tactical acumen particularly in European ties, setting his team up to exploit opposition weaknesses. His calm demeanour and tactical changes at half time of the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final were said to give players belief they could battle back from 3–0 down, although he had to correct his plans when {{it was pointed out}} to him his new formation would require 12 players on the pitch. Benítez often plays key players in unorthodox positions to suit a formation – notably converting both Steven Gerrard (in the 2005–06 season) and Dirk Kuyt into <b>right-wingers.</b> As a right winger/midfielder, Steven Gerrard had the most productive seasons winning wise, claiming a Champions League title, and an FA Cup.|$|E
25|$|In the 1994–95 season, Jágr won {{his first}} Art Ross Trophy as the scoring {{champion}} of the NHL. He tied Eric Lindros with 70 points but won based on his 32 goals to Lindros' 29. The next year, Jágr set a record for most points, 149, by a European-born player. Both his 62 goals and 87 assists from that season still stand as career-highs. His 1995–96 totals for assists and points stand as the records for <b>right-wingers</b> in those categories. After the 1997–98 season, captain Ron Francis signed with the Carolina Hurricanes, leaving Jágr the Penguins' captaincy. From 1997–98 to 2000–01, Jágr would win four-straight NHL scoring titles. In 1999, he would win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's Most Valuable Player, {{as well as the}} Lester B. Pearson Award. In 1998, he led the Czech Republic to a gold medal at the Nagano Olympics.|$|E
25|$|A {{nationalist}} at heart, Kekkonen's ideological roots lay in {{the student}} politics of newly independent Finland and in the radicalism of the right-wing. He joined the Academic Karelia Society (Akateeminen Karjala-Seura), an organisation favouring Finland's annexation of East Karelia, but resigned from it in 1932 along with over 100 other moderate members because of the organisation's support for the 1932 far-right Mäntsälä rebellion. According to Johannes Virolainen, a longtime Agrarian and Centrist politician, some Finnish <b>right-wingers</b> hated and mocked Kekkonen for the decision and cast him as a power-hungry opportunist. Kekkonen chaired Suomalaisuuden Liitto, another nationalist organisation, from 1930 to 1932. In 1933, Kekkonen joined the Agrarian League (later renamed the Centre Party) {{and in the same}} year also became a civil servant at the Ministry of Agriculture. During his time there Kekkonen made his first unsuccessful attempt at getting elected to the Finnish Parliament.|$|E

25|$|Callaghan {{was popular}} with Labour MPs and {{was elected to}} the Shadow Cabinet every year while the Labour Party was in {{opposition}} from 1951 to 1964. He was now a staunch Gaitskellite on the right wing. He was Parliamentary Adviser to the Police Federation from 1955 to 1960 when he negotiated an increase in police pay with the then general secretary Arthur Charles Evans. He ran for the Deputy Leadership of the party in 1960 as an opponent of unilateral nuclear disarmament, and despite the other candidate of the Labour right (George Brown) agreeing with him on this policy, he forced Brown to a second vote. In November 1961, Callaghan became shadow chancellor. When Hugh Gaitskell died in January 1963, Callaghan ran to succeed him, but came third in the leadership contest, which was won by Harold Wilson. However, he did gain the support of <b>right-wingers,</b> such as Denis Healey and Anthony Crosland, who wanted to prevent Wilson from being elected leader but who also did not trust George Brown.|$|E

500|$|Another {{development}} of Heathenry emerged within the occult völkisch movement known as Ariosophy. One of these völkisch Ariosophists was the Austrian occultist Guido von List, who established {{a religion that}} he termed [...] "Wotanism", with an inner core that he referred to as [...] "Armanism". List's Wotanism was based heavily on the Eddas, although over time {{it came to be}} increasingly influenced by the occult teachings of the Theosophical Society. List's ideas were transmitted in Germany by prominent <b>right-wingers,</b> and adherents to his ideas were among the founders of the Reichshammerbund in Leipzig in 1912, and they included individuals who held key positions in the Germanenorden. The Thule Society founded by Rudolf von Sebottendorf developed from the Germanenorden, and it displayed a Theosophically-influenced interpretation of Norse mythology.|$|E

500|$|The SPLC {{stated that}} The Daily Stormer owed its success to the online imageboard 4chan {{becoming}} popular among racists, as both websites use similar memes and rhetorical styles. One meme the website has used is to overlay photographs of Taylor Swift with anti-Semitic quotations, including those by Hitler. The website puts triple parentheses around {{the names of}} Jews, a far-right meme created by fellow website The Right Stuff. Jacob Siegel of The Daily Beast wrote that the website was growing in popularity amongst a younger audience due to its use of humor, and was attracting activists of other anti-political correctness ideologies—such as Gamergaters, men's rights activists and opponents of Social Justice Warriors—who would not usually identify with fascism. The SPLC has also documented Anglin's involvement in and encouragement of culture jamming by making hyperbolic statements in fake online accounts as women and minorities. He has also said that [...] "ridiculous" [...] statements such as [...] "gas the kikes", if repeated in media coverage, can work to desensitize the public to the Holocaust. He also believes that his extreme right-wing rhetoric can normalize less extreme <b>right-wingers</b> such as Trump.|$|E

[...] But - also like the holier-than-thou <b>right-wingers</b> - RBNs promote bigotry, intolerance, hatred, sexism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, pseudo-science, irrationality, dogmatic historical revisionism, violence, and so forth.|$|E
