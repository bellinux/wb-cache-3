5|$|Most of the <b>refectory</b> (dining hall) {{range to}} the south of the cloister and the dorter range to the east, which {{contained}} the chapter house and dormitory, have yet to be excavated. Only the western end of the <b>refectory</b> range has been excavated; it presents a vaulted undercroft, three bays of which survive, above which the <b>refectory</b> was located on the first floor. A service passage survives between the kitchen and the <b>refectory.</b> The western part of the undercroft was used as a buttery in the late Middle Ages but would have had severely restricted headroom due to its raised floor.|$|E
5|$|The <b>refectory</b> of {{the monastery}} is a {{rectangular}} brick building which contains a dining hall for the brethren {{as well as several}} kitchens and pantries. The Church of John the Theologian adjoins it from the east. The outside is segmented by pilasters and displays window surrounds reminiscent of traditional Eastern Orthodox church architecture. The <b>refectory</b> was erected in 1713, taking the place of the original wooden <b>refectory.</b> Its interior was overhauled in 1827 and 1837 and the restoration work was undertaken from 1976 to 1981.|$|E
5|$|The <b>refectory</b> {{projected}} {{south from}} {{the centre of}} the range, as was usual in Cistercian monasteries. This is now almost completely demolished save for the north wall, although the foundations survive underground and have been excavated. It was a long hall with a dais for the abbot and important guests at the south end. There was a pulpit in the west wall to allow a monk to read to the community during the meal. The kitchen lies west; it had a central fireplace, as was Cistercian custom, and was placed to allow food to be served through hatches both to the choir monks' <b>refectory</b> and to the separate dining hall for the lay brothers on the west side.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} 'Student Zones' in the <b>refectories</b> {{offering}} Pool and Table Tennis facilities.|$|R

The gatehouse, gates, mounting block with six steps and west wall {{can also be seen}} attached to the farmhouse.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, {{the monastery}} {{frequently}} lost and regained its ownership rights. On the funds of the monastery's new hegumen Afanasiy (a protégé of prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski), the monastery's old buildings were demolished, and new ones {{were built in}} their place. In 1604, the Gate Church of Ss. Peter and Paul was constructed, in 1609 - the Mykilska <b>Refectory,</b> and the Transfiguration Cathedral in 1609-1611. Under his rule, the monastery was considered as the second lavra (cave monastery) in Ukraine.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{built in}} the Middle Ages by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych, the monastery {{comprises}} the Cathedral itself, the <b>Refectory</b> of St. John the Divine, built in 1713, the Economic Gates, constructed in 1760 and the monastery's bell tower, which was added c. 1716–1719. The exterior of the structure was re{{built in the}} Ukrainian Baroque style in the 18th century while the interior remained in its original Byzantine style. The original cathedral was demolished by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s, but was reconstructed and opened in 1999 following Ukrainian independence in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} {{consists of}} an arcade of cloisters on three sides, surrounding several vaulted rooms including the sacristy, chapter house and warming house. These rooms were situated under the original dormitory. At {{the other end of}} the building, below what was formerly the abbess' chambers and the great hall, are two rooms and the main passage. On the north side, underneath the original <b>refectory,</b> is the undercroft.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} buildings {{include the}} priory church, {{which was a}} 15th-century replacement for the earlier 13th-century structure, infirmary, barn and 16th-century prior's lodging which was converted into a farmhouse. The whole site was arranged around a central cloister from which only the east wall and west wall of the chapter house remain, the sacristy, <b>refectory,</b> chapter house, lady chapel and parlour having been demolished. The former district council and parliamentary constituency both took their name from the priory.|$|E
50|$|David Gareja (დავითგარეჯის სამონასტრო კომპლექსი) is a rock-hewn Georgian Orthodox monastery complex {{located in}} the Kakheti region of Eastern Georgia, on the half-desert slopes of Mount Gareja, some 60-70 km {{southeast}} of Georgia's capital Tbilisi. The complex includes hundreds of cells, churches, chapels, <b>refectories</b> and living quarters hollowed out of the rock face.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, {{the college}} became co-educational, {{with the college}} enrolling boys for the first time. This led to the {{building}} of a new wing, incorporating a Woodwork room. From 1987 onwards the college no longer catered for boarding students, and the dormitories and <b>refectories</b> were converted into science laboratories and further classrooms.|$|R
50|$|The high {{proportion}} of Catholics in the area during those years is attested to {{by the fact that}} there are seven Catholic churches, one boys Catholic High school (threatened with closure), two girls Catholic high schools, four primary Catholic schools (one defunct), and various Catholic halls and <b>refectories</b> all within a three-mile radius.|$|R
5|$|When the {{building}} was finished, it had two classrooms, a kitchen, a laundry room, a pantry, and a main entrance on the first floor. On the second floor, there were three classrooms and a chapel with an adjoining sacristy. The third floor was a living area for the teaching sisters. It had eight cells, a kitchen, a <b>refectory,</b> and a community room. All in all, {{the building}} was a permanent convent and a temporary parochial school.|$|E
5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site; the family emblem is emblazoned, in stone, with the motto, above the fireplace in the Top <b>Refectory.</b> At {{the far end of the}} same room, once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, carved into the minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit. Anno Domini 1523. Et sicut fuit sic fiat.|$|E
5|$|The {{church and}} {{infirmary}} have almost entirely vanished, but the site boasts {{some of the}} finest and best-preserved monks' living quarters still surviving in southern England. The buildings round the cloister are still roofed and habitable and many of the rooms retain their vaults. Among the most important preserved rooms are the chapter house, the <b>refectory</b> with its magnificent arch braced wooden vault and the painted chamber. Much of the abbey's medieval tiled flooring remains. Other major survivals include the abbey gatehouse, which still provides entrance to the visitor, the moat and fishponds. Cleeve is open to the public.|$|E
50|$|The Talbot Campus is {{situated}} at Fern Barrow on the Poole {{side of the}} boundary with Bournemouth. It is where the main University buildings are located, including the students' union and the main library. The campus also contains cafes and <b>refectories,</b> Dylan's and The ground up bars, a doctors' surgery, shop and a branch of Santander.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} dormitories ('dorms') and <b>refectories</b> ('refs') {{are located on}} the College grounds for {{boarders}} and day-boys alike. Dorms and refs are segregated by year, and students tend to receive larger, more private and more privileged accommodation as they advance through the years(i.e. students move from large dormitories to single rooms, and from the College's original accommodation facilities to newly built accommodation).|$|R
50|$|By the Renaissance, the Last Supper was a {{favorite}} subject in Italian art, especially in the <b>refectories</b> of monasteries. These depictions typically portrayed the reactions of the disciples to {{the announcement of the}} betrayal of Jesus. Most of the Italian depictions use an oblong table, and not a semi-circular one, and sometimes Judas is shown by himself clutching his money bag.|$|R
5|$|The cloisters were {{restored}} in the 20thcentury, and {{the stained glass}} windows contain the images of some 130saints. The cloister garth contains a modern sculpture entitled The water of life by Stephen Broadbent. The <b>refectory</b> roof is dated 1939 and was designed by F.H.Crossley. The east window with reticulated tracery was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and is dated 1913. The stained glass in the west window, depicting the Creation, was designed by Ros Grimshaw and installed in 2001 to celebrate the Millennium. On the refectory's west wall there is a tapestry depicting Elymas being struck with blindness which was woven at Mortlake in the 17thcentury from a cartoon by Raphael. The heraldic paintings on the north wall represent {{the arms of the}} Earls of Chester.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} {{began in}} 1181. The monastic quarters {{and the church}} were built over the following three decades. The central cloister was bordered on the north by the church, on the west by a barrel-vaulted great nave, on the east by the sacristy, the priory cell, and the chapter house, and on the south by the kitchen, the pantry and the <b>refectory</b> (dining hall). Some of the buildings were given seven-foot-thick (2m) walls with slit windows, {{to serve as a}} refuge in case the Moors returned to the area. The church was built {{in the shape of a}} Latin cross with a nave divided into four sections, and a sanctuary with three square apses. Its presbytery had a central square topped by a pentagon.|$|E
5|$|After Hearst {{conveyed}} {{his enthusiasm}} for the project, Beloso sold Byne the stones for $85,000, including the cloister, the chapter house, the <b>refectory</b> and the dormitory for novices. With Byne's commission, Hearst was to pay $97,000, a price roughly equivalent to $ as of 20. Byne started immediately on the project, organizing men and materials, and beginning the removal of stones. Hearst's main architect Julia Morgan sent her associate architect Walter T. Steilberg who arrived on March 9, 1931. Steilberg recommended that Hearst buy the old church portal, which he did, at Byne's price of $1,500. Under the direction of Byne and Steilberg, the monastery was carefully labeled as it was dismantled stone by stone. Antonio Gomez, the local foreman praised by Byne and Steilberg, numbered the blocks on architectural drawings and painted the number in red {{on the back of}} each stone.|$|E
50|$|Devotional {{images of}} the Madonna and Child were {{produced}} in very large numbers, often for private clients. Scenes of the Life of Christ, the Life of the Virgin, or Lives of the Saints were also made in large numbers for churches, particularly scenes associated with the Nativity and the Passion of Christ. The Last Supper was commonly depicted in religious <b>refectories.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fr. Vissac had two French priests {{from the}} diocese, Frs. Froger and Schmitt, earn their MA from the University of London, England, and they {{returned}} to teach. After 20 years Fr. Vissac handed over the reins to Fr. Froger, Rector from 1903 to 1913, and again from 1915 to 1916. Fr. Froger also did the oil paintings {{on the walls of}} the priests' and boarders' <b>refectories.</b>|$|R
40|$|Heat {{treatment}} {{is a vital}} process in the manufacturing of automotive parts. Heat {{treatment is}} needed to alter the physical properties of the materials used for manufacturing the parts. The need for altering the physical properties of the materials is governed by some specific processes such as cutting, machining, drawing, and properties needed during service. Heat treatment ovens/furnaces use {{a large amount of}} energy. An improvement in the energy efficiency of these ovens/furnaces can result in significant energy savings. There are several proven technologies which are available for improving the energy efficiency of these ovens/furnaces including but are not limited to: combustion efficiency improvements, minimizing flue gas losses, change of furnace/oven indoor atmosphere, oxygen enrichment, plugging of unwanted openings, and minimizing wall losses. Supply chain industries to support the implementation of these energy efficient technologies in some cases can be very energy intensive themselves. For example, minimization of wall losses requires improving the integrity of the oven/furnace shell. This in turn requires the installation of good high temperature <b>refectories.</b> Manufacturing of high temperature <b>refectories</b> itself is a very energy inefficient process because a lot of waste heat is generated during this process and is not recovered. The current paper describes a case study involving waste heat recovery in a high temperature <b>refectories</b> manufacturing plant. The study was based upon the applications of Process Heating Assessment and Survey Tool (PHAST). The objective {{of the study was to}} make the manufacturing process of high temperature refractory energy efficient so that the cost of refurbishing the ovens/furnaces used in the automotive industries can become more affordable and ultimately result in reducing the energy costs making automotive industries more competitive. 1...|$|R
