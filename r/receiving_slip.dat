40|$|Setting: South Africa has {{the third}} highest {{tuberculosis}} (TB) burden in the world. Intensified case finding, recommended by WHO, {{is one way}} to control TB. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a paper slip method for TB contact tracing. Method: TB patients were offered paper slips to give to their contacts, inviting them for TB screening. The number of contacts screened and the proportion diagnosed with TB was calculated. Contacts that returned to the clinic after <b>receiving</b> the <b>slips</b> were interviewed. A focus group discussion (FGD) with TB patients was held to determine their acceptability. Results: From 718 paper slips issued, a 26 % TB contact tracing rate was found, with a 12 % case detection rate. The majority (68 %) of contacts were screened within 2 weeks of <b>receiving</b> the <b>slip.</b> Age and gender were not significantly associated with time to screening. 16 % of the contacts screened did not reside with the TB patients. 98 % of the contacts said the method was acceptable. FGD findings show that this method is acceptable and may prevent stigma associated with TB/HIV. Conclusion: This simple, inexpensive method yields high contact tracing and case detection rates and potentially would yield additional benefits outside households...|$|R

5000|$|For the hour-long season 1 episode, [...] "Try to Remember," [...] {{originally}} {{broadcast on}} February 9, 1987, ALF tries to simulate a jacuzzi by bringing Kate's electric mixer into the bathtub, thus receiving an electrical shock that caused amnesia. Fusco ended the original episode {{with a public}} service announcement from ALF himself, warning of the dangers from mixing water and electricity. Despite this, NBC reported that a child attempted to recreate the scenario and nearly electrocuted himself in the process (Fusco confirmed {{that the child was}} unharmed); Fusco was forced to refilm the opening sequence, replacing the electric mixer with a manual egg beater. ALF's amnesia is instead caused by a cranial concussion <b>received</b> after <b>slipping</b> in the shower (a [...] "thud" [...] is heard rather than a [...] "zap"), with all mentions of being shocked either overdubbed with new dialogue or deleted entirely (including ALF's public service announcement). This edited version was utilized for a Fall 1988 rebroadcast, as well as all future U.S. and Canadian syndicated airings.|$|R
25|$|Many {{differentials}} {{have no way}} {{of limiting}} the amount of engine power that gets sent to its attached output shafts. As a result, if a tire loses traction on acceleration, either because of a low-traction situation (e.g., - driving on gravel or ice) or the engine power overcomes available traction, the tire that is not <b>slipping</b> <b>receives</b> little or no power from the engine. In very low traction situations, this can prevent the vehicle from moving at all. To overcome this, there are several designs of differentials that can either limit the amount of slip (these are called 'limited-slip' differentials) or temporarily lock the two output shafts together to ensure that engine power reaches all driven wheels equally.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The omohyoid {{muscle is}} a long, thin muscle {{consisting}} of superior and inferior bellies and an intermediate tendon, which runs obliquely in the lateral cervical region. The omohyoid {{is important in}} neck dissections {{because it is the}} surgical landmark for level III and IV lymph node metastases. METHODS: In the present study, the anterior and posterior triangle of the neck was dissected in 35 male cadavers and observed for variations in the omohyoid bilaterally. Observations were focused on variations in number, attachments, and position of omohyoid. RESULTS: Among the 35 cadavers studied, double omohyoid was present in one cadaver, inferior belly originated from the clavicle in three cadavers, superior belly merged with the sternohyoid in two cadavers, and the omohyoid <b>received</b> additional <b>slips</b> from the sternum in one cadaver. Standard attachment and position of the omohyoid was observed in the remaining cadavers. CONCLUSION: Variations of this muscle are important because of its close relation to the large vessels and brachial plexus. Because of the direct adhesion of the intermediate tendon to the anterior wall of the internal jugular vein and its connection with it through a thin lamina of the pretracheal layer of the cervical fascia, the contraction of the omohyoid muscle has a direct effect on the lumen of this vessel...|$|R

[...] Eric Harvey of Pitchfork gave the album a 7.5 out of 10 and wrote [...] "Reznor's unique capacity to commingle raging industrial bangers with ballads and ambient instrumental passages appears in its best form since The Downward Spiral, and here gains much of the focus and restraint that many remember used to be his calling card." [...] Daphne Carr of LA Weekly said, [...] "Musically, it's his most adventurous work since The Fragile, and his business model is inspired—if unsustainable." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin complained that [...] "a few tracks, such as 'The Four of Us Are Dying,' go on for far too long", but then said [...] "Reznor recovers with a barn burner like 'Demon Seed'".|$|R
