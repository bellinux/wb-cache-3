50|$|The 3D trap itself {{generally}} {{consists of}} two hyperbolic metal electrodes with their foci facing each other and a hyperbolic <b>ring</b> <b>electrode</b> halfway between the other two electrodes. The ions are trapped {{in the space between}} these three electrodes by AC (oscillating) and DC (static) electric fields. The AC radio frequency voltage oscillates between the two hyperbolic metal end cap electrodes if ion excitation is desired; the driving AC voltage is applied to the <b>ring</b> <b>electrode.</b> The ions are first pulled up and down axially while being pushed in radially. The ions are then pulled out radially and pushed in axially (from the top and bottom). In this way the ions move in a complex motion that generally involves the cloud of ions being long and narrow and then short and wide, back and forth, oscillating between the two states. Since the mid-1980s most 3D traps (Paul traps) have used ~1 mtorr of helium. The use of damping gas and the mass-selective instability mode developed by Stafford et al. led to the first commercial 3D ion traps.|$|E

Currently, {{the superiority of}} tripolar concentric <b>ring</b> <b>electrodes</b> over disc electrodes, in particular, in accuracy of Laplacian estimation, has been demonstrated {{in a range of}} applications.

5000|$|The RRDE is an {{important}} tool for characterizing the fundamental properties of electrocatalysts used in fuel cells. For example, in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, dioxygen reduction at the cathode is often enhanced by an electrocatalyst comprising platinum nanoparticles. When oxygen is reduced using an electrocatalyst, an unwanted and harmful by-product, hydrogen peroxide, may be produced. Hydrogen peroxide can damage the internal components of a PEM fuel cell, so oxygen-reduction electrocatalysts are engineered {{in such a way}} as to limit the amount of peroxide formed. An RRDE [...] "collection experiment" [...] can be used to probe the peroxide generating tendencies of an electrocatalyst. [...] In this experiment, the disk is coated with a thin layer bearing the electrocatalyst, and the disk electrode is poised at a potential which reduces the oxygen. Any products generated at the disk electrode are then swept past the <b>ring</b> <b>electrode.</b> The potential of the <b>ring</b> <b>electrode</b> is poised to detect any hydrogen peroxide that may have been generated at the disk.|$|E
5000|$|In general, {{narrowing}} {{the gap between}} the disk outer diameter and the ring inner diameter allows probing of systems with faster kinetics. A narrow gap reduces the [...] "transit time" [...] necessary for an intermediate species generated at the disk to successfully reach the <b>ring</b> <b>electrode</b> and be detected. Using precision machining techniques, it is possible to make gaps between 0.1 and 0.5 millimeters, and narrower gaps have been created using microlithography techniques.|$|E
50|$|It is {{desirable}} for an RRDE {{to have a}} large collection efficiency if only {{to assure that the}} current signal measured at the <b>ring</b> <b>electrode</b> is detectable. On the other hand, it also desirable for an RRDE to have a small transit time so that short-lived (unstable) intermediate products generated at the disk survive long enough to be detected at the ring. The choice of actual RRDE dimensions is often a trade-off between a large collection efficiency or a short transit time.|$|E
