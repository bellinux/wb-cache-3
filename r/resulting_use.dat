50|$|In the press, {{articles}} are mostly written in German, sometimes also in French. On TV {{and on the}} radio, Luxembourgish is mainly used. Spoken Luxembourgish used in news broadcasts tends to be strongly influenced by standard German in pronunciation and idiom. Radio broadcasters are under pressure to translate news releases sourced from German press agencies in real time and have no special training in the prose style of Luxembourgish. As a result, news tends to be superficially translated into Luxembourgish. Syntax mostly follows standard German and many words and idioms from standard German appear unmodified. Phonology is also affected with the <b>resulting</b> <b>use</b> of intonation phrases alien to Luxembourgish.|$|E
50|$|While {{profitability}} is {{a significant}} consideration, most profitable use is rarely the actual use that a property is put to. Most often the <b>resulting</b> <b>use</b> {{is based on a}} compromise among the often competing factors. Many sciences have moved past the belief that we can be entirely objective in our observations. In physics, for example, the effect of the mass of the billiards player on the trajectory of the ball can actually be measured. (*cite) The model, of highest and best use inclines the practitioner not only towards a clock-like model, but also towards a reductionist view - that the norm represents the group. But this is clearly a poor representation in real estate transactions where buyers and sellers represent many sets of values, opportunities and goals, giving rise to a range of acceptable market value.|$|E
5000|$|Nicotine, {{the primary}} psychoactive {{chemical}} in cigarettes, is highly addictive. [...] The <b>resulting</b> <b>use</b> of tobacco {{is the single}} greatest cause of preventable death globally. Smoking leads most commonly to diseases affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer). It also causes peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. On average, each cigarette smoked is estimated to shorten life by 11 minutes. Starting smoking earlier in life and smoking cigarettes higher in tar increases the risk of these diseases. The World Health Organization estimates that tobacco caused 5.4 million deaths in 2004 and 100 million deaths {{over the course of the}} 20th century. Cigarettes produce an aerosol containing over 4,000 chemical compounds, including nicotine, carbon monoxide, acrolein, and oxidant substances. Over 50 of these are carcinogens.|$|E

5000|$|The Court of Arbitration was {{the first}} court in New South Wales, a state of Australia which dealt {{exclusively}} with industrial relation disputes {{in the early twentieth}} century. Justice Lance Wright claims that it perhaps {{was the first}} court of its type in the world. [...] The court was unique at that time as it was the first court of its type to deal with labour relations between employer and employees on a compulsory basis. [...] Previous arbitration measures between employer and employee had been on a voluntary basis or had been based on the criminal justice system through the use of criminal penalties.The conventional economic model is that both employer and employee enjoy equal bargaining power to set wages and conditions. [...] This asserts that both parties are able to agree on a fair market price for the cost of labour free from distortions. However, where employers or employees group together, these outcomes can be distorted particularly in “boom” or “bust” economic conditions. The purpose of the court was to change the manner in which employers and employees negotiated pay and conditions. It was an attempt to reduce the power imbalances between employer groups or employee unions that arose from using collective bargaining, and the <b>resulting</b> <b>use</b> of that market power to influence wages, and also to reduce the threat of lockout or strikes to achieve those ends.|$|E

A recent project managed by an advisory group to The Swedish Energy Agency comprises comprehensive audits, calculations and implementation with the focus to reduce the use of energy in five different office buildings. The average annual use of energy (heat + electricity) before measures is of the order of 200 kWh/m 2 and the expected <b>resulting</b> <b>use</b> of energy after measures is on average of the order of 100 kWh/m 2 total building area.

40|$|Our {{approach}} aims {{at helping}} to produce adequate requirements, both clear and precise enough {{so as to}} provide a sound basis to the overall development. Our idea here is to nd a way to combine both advantages of use cases and of formal speci cations. We present a technique for improving use case based requirements, using the formally grounded development of the requirements speci cation, and that results both in an improved requirements capture, and in a requirement validation. The formally grounded requirements speci cation is written in a " notation, using both diagrams and text, with a formal counterpart (written in the Casl and Casl-Ltl languages). Being formally grounded, our method is systematic, and it yields further questions on the system that will be reected in the improved use case descriptions. The <b>resulting</b> <b>use</b> case descriptions are of high quality, more systematic, more precise, and its corresponding formally grounded speci cation is available. We illustrate our approach on part of the Auction System case study...|$|E

40|$|Background: Well-designed {{interventions}} {{can improve}} the communication skills of physicians. Since {{the understanding of the}} current situation is essential for designing effective interventions, this study was performed to determine medical interns ’ confidence and use of communication skills. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was performed in spring 2013 within 3 branches of Islamic Azad University (Tehran, Mashhad, and Yazd), on 327 randomly selected interns. Data gathering instrument was a questionnaire with 14 items for confidence and 17 items for use of communication skills. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics as well as Spearman and Mann- Whitney U tests. Results: Students ’ confidence and use of communication skills was evaluated moderate. There was a significant positive correlation between students ’ confidence and use of communication skills (r= 0. 42, p= 0. 001). Male students reported higher scores for confidence and use of communication skills compared to female, but this was not significant (p= 0. 055 and p= 0. 292, respectively). Conclusion: Considering significant correlation between confidence and use of communication skills, designing educational interventions is recommended for development of confidence and <b>resulting</b> <b>use</b> of communication skills in medical students...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the risk factors}} for weight loss over 8 % in full-term newborns at postpartum discharge from a Baby Friendly Hospital. MethodsThe cases were selected from a cohort of infants belonging to a previous study. Healthy full-term newborns with birth weight ≥ 2. 000 g, who were exclusively breastfed were included and excluded twins and those undergoing phototherapy {{as well as those}} discharged after 96 h of life. The analyzed maternal and neonatal variables were maternal age, parity, ethnicity, type of delivery, maternal diabetes, gender, gestational age and appropriate weight for age. Adjusted multiple and univariate Cox regression analyses were used, considering as significant p 8 % were cesarean delivery and older maternal age. At the adjusted multiple regression analysis, the model to explain the weight loss was cesarean delivery (Relative risk 2. 27, 95 % of Confidence Interval 1. 54 – 3. 35). ConclusionsThe independent predictor for weight loss> 8 % in exclusively breastfed full-term newborns in a Baby-Friendly Hospital was the cesarean delivery.

While available knowledge and technologies exist to provide suitable fit-for-purpose recycled water, concern exists relating to water quality issues, particularly microbial pathogens and chemicals-of-concern. At times these concerns result in the requirement for overtreatment of recycled water, which can lead to potentially valuable water reuse projects becoming too costly and inefficient to be viable. The risks from both microbial pathogens and chemicals-of-concern can vary {{depending on the type of}} recycled water, the type of pathogen or chemical present and their numbers or concentration, the water treatment employed and the <b>resulting</b> <b>use</b> of the recycled water.

Our method efficiently exploits all available information and avoids the bias problem. In the absence of detailed knowledge, the ME approach reduces to standard uniformity and independence assumptions. Our implementation using a prototype version of DB 2 UDB shows that ME improves the optimizer’s cardinality estimates by orders of magnitude, resulting in better plan quality and significantly reduced query execution times...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) While many persuasive {{communications}} tend to {{be perceived}} as increasing consumer choice, others, such as public service announcements, more or less forcefully restrict that choice. This research examines the effects of threats to freedom on receptivity to message information, {{as a function of the}} level of construal at which the message is processed. The findings indicate that consumers are more open to high threat message information at high (vs. low) levels of construal, and this pattern holds when construal level is manipulated via message wording (study one) or is non-consciously primed prior to message exposure (study two). Also, the results point to the level of detail at which the message is considered, and the <b>resulting</b> <b>use</b> of persuasion knowledge, as the underlying reason for this pattern of results (study three). Specifically, at high levels of detail (i. e. low construal) there is a greater use of persuasion knowledge and lower information receptivity in face of high threat to freedom messages. At low level of detail (high construal), by contrast, persuasion knowledge use is lower and receptivity to information in freedom threatening messages higher...|$|E
