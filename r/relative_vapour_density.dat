Increased UV radiation increases the photolysis rates for several tropospheric gases, in particular ozone.

40|$|A new {{kinetic model}} for heating and {{evaporation}} of Diesel fuel droplets is suggested. The model {{is based on}} the introduction of the kinetic region in the immediate vicinity of the heated and evaporating droplets, where the dynamics of molecules are described in terms of the Boltzmann equations for vapour components and air, and the hydrodynamic region. The effects of finite thermal conductivity and species diffusivity inside the droplets and inelastic collisions in the kinetic region are taken into account. Diesel fuel is approximated by n-dodecane or a mixture of 80 % n-dodecane and 20 % p-dipropylbenzene. In both cases, the evaporation coefficient is assumed equal to 1. The values of temperature and <b>vapour</b> <b>density</b> at the outer boundary of the kinetic region are inferred from the requirement that both heat flux and mass flux of vapour (or vapour components) in the kinetic and hydrodynamic regions {{in the vicinity of the}} interface between these regions should be equal. Initially, the heat and mass fluxes in the hydrodynamic region are calculated based on the values of temperature and <b>vapour</b> <b>density</b> at the surface of the droplet. Then the values of temperature and <b>vapour</b> <b>density</b> at the outer boundary of the kinetic region, obtained following the above-mentioned procedure, are used to calculate the corrected values of hydrodynamic heat and mass fluxes. The latter in their turn lead to new corrected values of temperature and <b>vapour</b> <b>density</b> at the outer boundary of the kinetic region etc. It is shown that this process quickly converges for the cases analysed in the paper, and it leads to self-consistent values for both heat and mass fluxes. The model is applied to the analysis of heating and evaporation of Diesel fuel droplets with initial radii and temperature equal to 5 μm and 300 K, immersed into gas with temperatures in the range 800 – 1200 K and pressure equal to 30 bar. It is shown that in all cases the kinetic effects lead to a decrease in droplet surface temperature and an increase in the evaporation time. The kinetic effects on the droplet evaporation time are shown to increase with increasing gas temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) is an {{important}} chiral molecule, the R-isomer of which {{is used in the}} manufacture of several pharmaceutical products and is currently produced by means of biotransformation. The knowledge of thermodynamic properties of PAC is essential to improve the process involving the separation of PAC from the organic solvent, used in the biotransformation process to extract PAC from the aqueous broth. In spite of its importance, limited experimental vapour pressure data is available on PAC in the literature. Hence, in this study, the physical and thermodynamic properties of PAC are predicted using structure property correlations combined with equations of state, and also molecular simulation as the first step to optimize the process design for the production of PAC. The properties predicted include liquid and <b>vapour</b> <b>densities</b> at co-existence, enthalpy of vaporization, saturation pressure, critical point and normal boiling point. The liquid and <b>vapour</b> <b>densities</b> at coexistence and the critical point data from both the methods are found to be in agreement. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{heat balance}} of the intact {{cucumber}} leaf was examined by measuring leaf temperature and environmental factors, and transpiration rate and leaf conductance were calculated in course of time. When the leaf was radiated, leaf temperature, transpiration rate and leaf conductance rose rapidly and thereafter varied with the air conditions. Air temperature and saturation deficit affected the amplitudes of leaf conductance oscillation (period of 25 - 30 min); the amplitudes were larger at lower air temperatures and at higher saturation deficits. The saturation deficit influenced stomatal behaviour directly through change in <b>vapour</b> <b>density</b> difference (⊿w) between inside of the leaf and the air, and stomatal response to air humidity {{was found in the}} physical process. However, the air temperature did not relate to ⊿w, as ⊿w was almost constant even when the air temperature was changed, for the reason that saturation <b>vapour</b> <b>density</b> inside of the leaf increased exponentially with temperature rise in the leaf. Thus, it seems that stomatal response to air temperature could not be caused directly through the physical process, but could be caused mainly through the physiological functions...|$|R
40|$|The greater {{susceptibility}} to desiccation of the Rhizobiurn legurninosarum group of rhizobia {{compared with the}} slow-growing rhizobia {{is related to the}} different amounts of water retained by these groups of bacteria at any <b>relative</b> <b>vapour</b> pressure, rather than differences in rates of water movement into or out of the bacteria. The higher retention of water by the R. legurninosarum group at any rela-tive vapour pressure is related to greater availability of adsorptive surface area, and to higher surface energies resulting in a greater affinity for water. Although the internal osmotic pressure is greater in the slow-growing group than in the R. leguminosarum group, it is concluded that differences in internal solute concentra-tions cannot account for the different adsorption isotherms found for these groups. Montmorillonitic clay protects the fast-growing R. leguminosarum group from the effects of desiccation, but not the slow-growing group. Ca-montmorillonite retains greater quantities of water at any <b>relative</b> <b>vapour</b> pressure than either group of bacteria.

40|$|Traditionally, balloon-based {{radiosonde}} soundings {{are used}} to study the spatial distribution of atmospheric water vapour. However, this approach cannot be frequently employed due to its high cost. In contrast, GPS tomography technique can obtain water vapour in a high temporal resolution. In the tomography technique, an iterative or non-iterative reconstruction algorithm is usually utilised to overcome rank deficiency of observation equations for water vapour inversion. However, the single iterative or non-iterative reconstruction algorithm has their limitations. For instance, the iterative reconstruction algorithm requires accurate initial values of water vapour while the non-iterative reconstruction algorithm needs proper constraint conditions. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a combined iterative and non-iterative reconstruction approach for the three-dimensional (3 -D) water vapour inversion using GPS observations and COSMIC profiles. In this approach, the non-iterative reconstruction algorithm is first used to estimate water <b>vapour</b> <b>density</b> based on a priori water vapour information derived from COSMIC radio occultation data. The estimates are then employed as initial values in the iterative reconstruction algorithm. The largest advantage {{of this approach is}} that precise initial values of water <b>vapour</b> <b>density</b> that are essential in the iterative reconstruction algorithm can be obtained. This combined reconstruction algorithm (CRA) is evaluated using 10 -day GPS observations in Hong Kong and COSMIC profiles.
