5|$|Since the {{creation}} of the Tribunal in 1994, only one constitutional reference has been made to it. Constitutional <b>Reference</b> <b>No.</b> 1 of 1995 arose from the issue of the application of Article 22H(1) of the Constitution in relation to Article 5(2A), which was and is still not yet in force. The matter was referred by President Ong Teng Cheong to clarify the scope of the application of both Articles. The Government was represented by Chan Sek Keong and Soh Tze Bian of the Attorney-General's Chambers, and the Presidency by Joseph Grimberg and Walter Woon.|$|E
500|$|A foetus, {{even at a}} late {{stage of}} pregnancy, is not {{protected}} by the law of homicide (rather, other offences have been created to prevent the proscribed harm). To qualify, the victim must have an [...] "independent existence". This was confirmed in 1998 in Attorney General's <b>Reference</b> (<b>No.</b> 3 of 1994), even where the foetus is viable and could have survived if born before the offence was committed. The confused rationale appears to match the complicated moral and biological distinction on which it is based; there is huge social significance placed upon birth and thus the law is unlikely to change [...] Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights {{has not yet been}} interpreted to conflict with the English law. Instead, in Vo v France, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that most definitions were within the margin of appreciation set aside to national law. The death of a child after birth from injuries sustained before birth would only constitute murder if the requisite intent [...] that the child would die after birth [...] was present. Other forms of homicide would also be applicable.|$|E
500|$|Attempts {{are governed}} by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981, which states that [...] "if, with intent to commit an offence to which , a person does an act {{which is more than}} merely preparatory to the {{commission}} of the offence, he is guilty of attempting to commit the offence". A required element is intent, or mens rea. In R v Pearman, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales confirmed that the definition of intent in the 1981 Act {{is the same as the}} definition in the common law. The common law gives intention [...] "its normal meaning: purpose or aim", with judges advised not to, in the majority of cases, attempt to complicate the definition. Conditional intent [...] where somebody has an intent to commit a crime only in certain circumstances [...] has also been deemed acceptable for an indictment for attempting a crime. In Attorney-General's Reference (Nos. 1 and 2 of 1979), the Court of Appeal explained that the intention to steal [...] "anything that was worth stealing could form the basis of an attempt charge if the indictment was drafted carefully". This was a procedural solution to a previous apparent contradiction, but the suggested drafting may not demonstrate sufficient proximity between the defendant's actions and what he was planning to steal. A mens rea requirement is added to the attempt of crimes of strict liability (where there is no intent or merely objective recklessness), although the ruling in Attorney General's <b>Reference</b> (<b>No.</b> 3 of 1992) makes this less certain.|$|E

2500|$|A purposive {{approach}} to statutory interpretation was mandated in Singapore in 1993 by {{the enactment of}} section 9A of the Interpretation Act, which requires a court to prefer an interpretation that would [...] "promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) ... to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object".
