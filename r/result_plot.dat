40|$|Abstract — Emission of {{terahertz}} (THz) radiation as {{a result}} of optical rectification of intense femtosecond laser pulses on chiral metamaterials has been observed. The chiral metamamaterials has simplified fabrication design but still capable to exhibit different refractive index for each circular polarization. Nonlinear response of metamaterials was observed by terahertz emission spectroscopy. The <b>result</b> <b>plot</b> clearly shows that the terahertz signal is sufficiently fit with a square of laser power. The phenomenon can be referred as optical rectification and can be exploited for the development of new THz sources...|$|E

Ideally, we hope as many as incidents happen within the high risk area with a given size. Therefore, the curve from a good model should {{be close to the}} upper left corner. Examples of this plot are shown in Figures 3, 4, 5, 6. Similar to ROC analysis, we can use area under the curve (AUC) to compare the performance of different models by a single score. Because a good model has the curve close to the upper left corner, AUC of a good model should be close to 1. It is easy to see that a random guess model has AUC= 0.5. Therefore, AUC of a bad model should be close to or less than 0.5.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} rice bran and {{carboxymethyl}} cellulose (CMC) on the oxidative stability of smoked chicken sausages were determined. Lipid oxidation was analyzed at several different days of chilled storage (n= 3, for all measurements). Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values and peroxide value (PV) of smoked chicken sausages increased throughout the nine days of storage (4 °C). Chicken sausage formulated with Red Palm Mid Fraction (RPMF) showed significantly lower TBA value {{compared to the}} samples prepared with chicken fat (p< 0. 05). However,-carotene content showed the highest significant value (p< 0. 05) in sausage incorporated with RPMF. It was concluded that the utilization of RPMF significantly reduced the oxidation of lipid, which was indicated, by the TBA values. This study also showed that {{the small amount of}} dietary fiber (rice bran) also improve the oxidative stability of smoked chicken sausages. It can be suggest that the time for oxidation study need longer storage duration to see the good <b>result</b> <b>plot</b> and changes that occur can be determined clearly...|$|E

30|$|Plot data. For {{assessing}} {{the accuracy of}} the IA calibrations, we leveraged plot data gathered one year post fire that was used in Miller and Thode (2007) and Miller et al. (2009 a) for which we had both initial and extended RdNBR-based severity assessments already entered in our severity database (Table 1). The plot data were collected by different teams and methods for ground-based assessment methods of CBI severity, and forest metrics were slightly different. As a <b>result,</b> <b>plot</b> size varied between years. Plots were circular with 90 m diameter for fires that occurred from 2001 to 2002, 60 m for 2004 fires, and 30 m for 2006 fires. Plots sampled in the SNFPA planning area were located at least 300 m apart on randomly placed transects. A stratified random procedure was used to generate potential plot locations for the 2006 fires in northwest California using a preliminary severity map. The CBI was not collected in fires that occurred during 2001, but was evaluated over the entire plot in subsequent years. Data collected to characterize fire effects on trees included status (live or dead), species, diameter at breast height (dbh), scorch height, crown base height (CBH), and percent of crown volume scorched. Tree data were collected for each tree in the 30 m diameter plots. The numbers of trees less than 10 cm in diameter were counted by species. In plots that were 60 m and 90 m in diameter, tree data were measured in four 10 m diameter subplots and tallied into 10 -centimenter size classes. We estimated whether dead trees were killed by the fire or were already dead prior to the fire by presence or absence of dead needles as well as bark and wood consumption patterns. Live pre-fire trees are rarely consumed by fire (Pyne et al. 1996). But survival of pre-fire snags is dependent upon snag condition and fire intensity (Laudenslayer 1997, Skinner 2002). Pre- and post-fire BA was calculated from the diameters of trees thought to have been alive prior to the fire and alive after the fire, respectively. Pre- and post-fire CC was estimated using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS; Dixon 2002). The FVS-derived estimates of individual tree crown cover assume that trees are healthy and unaffected by fire or disease. We therefore adjusted FVS-computed CC using equations for modeling crown shape for northern California conifer species (Biging and Wensel 1990). (See Miller et al. [2009 a] for more complete details on the CC calculations.) As USDA Forest Service vegetation classification standards require 10 % tree CC for an area to be classified as forested, we only used plots in this study for which FVS indicated ≥ 10 % pre-fire tree CC (Brohman and Bryant 2005).|$|E
40|$|Pybinding is a Python {{package for}} {{numerical}} tight-binding calculations in solid state physics. The main features include: 	 	Declarative model construction - The user {{just needs to}} describe what the model should be, but not how to build it. Pybinding {{will take care of}} the numerical details of building the Hamiltonian matrix so users can concentrate on the physics, i. e. the quantum properties of the model. 	 	 	Fast compute - Pybinding's implementation of the kernel polynomial method allows for very fast calculation of various physical properties of tight-binding systems. Exact diagonalization is also available through the use of scipy's eigenvalue solvers. The framework is very flexible and allows the addition of user-defined computation routines. 	 	 	Result analysis and visualization - The package contains utility functions for post-processing the raw result data. The included plotting functions are tailored for tight-binding problems to help visualize the model structure and {{to make sense of the}} results. 	 The code interface is written in Python with the aim to be as user-friendly and flexible as possible. Under the hood, C++ 11 is used to accelerate demanding tasks to deliver high performance with low memory usage. See the documentation for more details: [URL] Changelog for version 0. 9 	Added support for Kwant v 1. 3. x and improved Model. tokwant() exporting of multi-orbital models. Updated requirements 	 	This version includes extensive internal improvements and raises the minimum requirements for installation. Starting with this release, only Python >= 3. 5 is supported. Newer versions of the scientific Python packages are also required: numpy >= 1. 12, scipy >= 0. 19 and matplotlib >= 2. 0. 	 	 	On Linux, the minimum compiler requirements have also been increased to get access to C++ 14 for the core of the library. To compile from source, you'll need GCC >= 5. 0 or clang >= 3. 5. 	 Multi-orbital models 	 	Improved support for models with multiple orbitals, spins and any additional degrees of freedom. These can now be specified simply by inputting a matrix as the onsite or hopping term (instead of a scalar value). For more details, see the "Multi-orbital models" section of the documentation. 	 	 	Lifted all limits on the number of sublattices and hoppings which can be defined in a Lattice object. The previous version was limited to a maximum of 128 onsite and hopping terms per unit cell (but those could be repeated an unlimited number of times to form a complete system). All restrictions are now removed so that the unit cell size is only limited by available memory. In addition, the memory usage of the internal system format has been reduced. 	 	 	Added a 3 -band model of group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides to the Material Repository. The available TMDs include: MoS 2, WS 2, MoSe 2, WSe 2, MoTe 2, WTe 2. These are all monolayers. 	 Composite shapes 	Complicated system geometries can now be created easily by composing multiple simple shapes. This is done using set operations, e. g. unions, intersections, etc. A complete guide for this functionality is available in the "Composite shapes" section of the documentation. Kernel polynomial method 	 	The KPM implementation has been revised and significantly expanded. A guide and several examples are available in the "Kernel polynomial method" section of the documentation (part 9 of the Tutorial). For a complete overview of the available methods and kernels, see the chebyshev section of the API reference. 	 	 	New builtin computation methods include the stochastically-evaluated density of states (DOS) and electrical conductivity (using the Kubo-Bastin approach). 	 	 	The new low-level interface produces KPM expansion moments which allows users to create their own KPM-based computation routines. 	 	 	The performance of various KPM computations has been significantly improved for CPUs with AVX support (~ 1. 5 x speedup on average, but also up to 2 x in some cases with complex numbers). 	 	 	Added a method for calculating spatial LDOS using KPM. See the "Kernel Polynomial Method" tutorial page and the KPM. calc_spatial_ldos API reference. 	 	 	Improved single-threaded performance of KPM. calc_dos by ~ 2 x by switching to a more efficient vectorization method. (Multiple random starter vectors are now computed simultaneously and accelerated using SIMD intrinsics.) 	 	 	Various KPM methods now take advantage of multiple threads. This improves performance depending on the number of cores on the target machine. (However, for large systems performance is limited by RAM bandwidth, not necessarily core count.) 	 	 	LDOS calculations for multiple orbitals also take advantage of the same vectorization and multi-threading improvements. Single-orbital LDOS does not benefit from this but it has received its own modest performance tweaks. 	 	 	Long running KPM calculation now have a progress indicator and estimated completion time. 	 Miscellaneous 	 	Added the pb. save() and pb. load() convenience functions for getting result objects into/out of files. The data is saved in a compressed binary format (Python's builtin pickle format with protocol 4 and gzip). Loaded files can be immediately plotted: result = pb. load("file. pbz") and then <b>result.</b> <b>plot()</b> to see the data. 	 	 	The eigenvalue solvers now have a calc_ldos method for computing the local density of states as a function of energy (in addition to the existing calc_spatial_ldos). 	 	 	Improved plotting of Lattice objects. The view can now be rotated by passing the axis="xz" argument, or any other combination of x, y and z to define the plotting plane. 	 Deprecations and breaking changes 	 	Added Lattice. add_aliases() method. The old Lattice. add_sublattice( [...] ., alias=name) way of creating aliases is deprecated. 	 	 	The greens module has been deprecated. This functionality is now covered by the KPM methods. 	 	 	The internal storage format of the Lattice and System classes has been revised. This shouldn't affect most users who don't need access to the low-level data. 	 General improvements and bug fixes 	 	StructureMap can now be sliced using a shape. E. g. s = pb. rectangle(5, 5); smap 2 = smap[s] which returns a smaller structure map cut down to the given shape. 	 	 	Plotting the structure of large or periodic systems is slightly faster now. 	 	 	Added 2 D periodic supercells to the "Shape and symmetry" section of the tutorial. 	 	 	Added a few more examples to the "Plotting guide" (view rotation, separating sites and hoppings and composing multiple plots). 	 	 	Fixed broken documentation links when using the online search function. 	 	 	Fixed slow Hamiltonian build when hopping generators are used...|$|E
