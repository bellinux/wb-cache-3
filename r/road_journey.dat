A footpath runs adjacent to the Felling bypass and the journey by foot from Gateshead town centre takes some fifteen minutes. A journey east to Heworth Interchange also takes around fifteen minutes. Two designated cycle routes run past the stadium. These are Hadrian's Way, which provides access from Tynemouth in the east and Wylam in the west, and the Keelman's Way, which runs along the south bank of the River Tyne towards Blaydon-on-Tyne.|$|E

2500|$|In 1924, the Great Western Railway {{started a}} service to {{transport}} cars on rail trucks through the tunnel between Pilning and Severn Tunnel Junction.

Although {{nationwide}} bus service is available between major cities, flying is safer, especially for foreigners. There are occasional highway robberies by bandits or militant groups. The roads are also dangerous due to accidents and lack of security forces.|$|R
50|$|Later that year, a {{timber bridge}} was {{built over the}} river and {{subsequently}} Ross became an important stopover on <b>road</b> <b>journeys</b> between Launceston and Hobart.

2500|$|At {{this time}} there was very little {{connecting}} its two parts, aside from ferries and a circuitous journey via Goole (a <b>road</b> <b>journey</b> from Grimsby to Beverley, the headquarters, being something just under 100 miles). It was promised by the government that the Humber Bridge would make it a more viable unit. [...] By 1975 the bridge was planned to open in 1977. [...] The bridge was finally opened on 24 June 1981, providing a permanent link between North and South, and cutting the journey from Grimsby to Beverley to a mere 30 or so miles, but it did not secure Humberside's future.|$|E

[...] Sir Alan Cobham had {{encouraged}} local authorities to build airfields {{as part of his}} 'Municipal Aerodromes Scheme' in the late 1920s. In May 1936, scheduled air services were started by Railway Air Services using the de Havilland Dragon and de Havilland Express to fly from Plymouth to Haldon, then across the Bristol Channel to Cardiff Municipal Airport before recrossing the Bristol Channel to Weston and then flying on to Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport. The distance from Cardiff to Weston is less than [...] across the water, however the <b>road</b> <b>journey</b> would have been around [...] or a trip on the Aust Ferry before the Severn Bridge opened in 1966, although the Severn Tunnel enabled rail travel between South Gloucestershire and South Wales.|$|E

50|$|Originally, all {{the main}} routes by which goods might leave the Potteries {{involved}} {{a combination of}} road and river transport out to the ports and the coastal trade routes. <b>Road</b> <b>journeys</b> by these routes varied between 20 and 40 miles in length and progress was slow. Because roads were in a poor state before the introduction of turnpikes, many of the finished goods were broken in transit, substantially reducing the profitability of pottery production.|$|R

50|$|The {{economic}} {{advantage of the}} project {{is that it will}} eliminate transshipment costs at import and export ports, as well as the long <b>road</b> <b>journeys</b> to reach these ports, thereby offering significant cost savings in the overall freight charge. Barges can be loaded directly close to the point of manufacture, and discharged within a couple of hundred kilometres of the final point of delivery. Transport cost savings are estimated at more than US$1,000 per FEU (forty-foot equivalent container).|$|R
50|$|While a reefer {{will have}} an {{integral}} refrigeration unit, they rely on external power, from electrical power points (“reefer points”) at a land based site, a container ship or on quay.

Motels peaked in popularity in the 1960s with rising car travel, only to decline in response to competition from the newer chain hotels that became commonplace at highway interchanges as traffic was bypassed onto newly constructed freeways. Several historic motels are listed on the US National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
