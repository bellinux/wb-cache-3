5|$|Stuart McCall {{was born}} in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Scottish parents Andy, a former {{professional}} footballer, and Jean McCall. He was the couple's third child after Leslie and Janette, who were 20 and 15 respectively when Stuart was born. The family home was just <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> from Leeds United's Elland Road ground where McCall would spend many Saturday afternoons watching United, dreaming of following his father and playing for Leeds, even after {{the family moved to}} Wortley.|$|E
5|$|Whisked {{away from}} her home and her beloved, Sue is in despair until Hal appears outside her window with a ladder. The {{attempted}} elopement fails when the mistress catches Hal in the act and dismisses him. She awaits Sue to descend and <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> before halting her and forcing her back inside. The father pulls up {{to a place of}} business and Hal, who is walking by, attempts to greet the father. The angry father ignores him, but Hal turns and sees the wigmaker's store next to him. An idea strikes him and he pays a photographer to get a photo of the father on the way out, which further angers him. Hal then sends a message to Sue, that he will come and claim her the following day, disguised as her father.|$|E
5|$|Resulting {{from the}} 1986 Popplewell Report into {{the safety of}} sports grounds and the later Taylor Report, the {{capacity}} of St Andrew's was set at 28,235 for safety reasons, but it was accepted that the stadium had to be brought up to modern all-seated standards. After the last home game of the 1993–94 season, the Kop and Tilton Road terraces were demolished– fans took home a significant proportion as souvenirs– to be replaced {{at the start of}} the new season by a 7,000-seat Tilton Road Stand, continuing <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> into the 9,500-seat Kop which opened two months later. The 8,000-seat Railway Stand followed in 1999; ten years later, this was renamed the Gil Merrick Stand, in honour of the club's appearance record-holder and former manager– but the Main Stand has still to be modernised. In 2017, the club website listed the stadium capacity as 29,409.|$|E

Michele Navarra soon drove <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and the gunmen opened fire, {{riddling}} the car with two hundred bullets. Navarra died instantly along with a friend (unconnected with the Mafia); he was giving a lift to another doctor, Giovanni Russo. Leggio proclaimed himself boss of Corleone and over the next five years he and his men hunted down and killed around fifty more of Navarra's remaining supporters.|$|E
25|$|Two rival teenage gangs, the Jets (White) and the Sharks (Puerto Rican immigrants), {{struggle}} {{for control of}} the neighborhood somewhere in the Upper West Side of New York City amidst the police (Prologue). They are warned by Lt. Schrank and Officer Krupke to stop fighting on their beat. The police chase the Sharks off, and then the Jets plan how they can assure their continued dominance of the street. The Jets' leader, Riff, suggests setting up a rumble with the Sharks. He plans to make the challenge to Bernardo, the Sharks' leader, that night at the neighborhood dance. Riff wants to convince his friend and former member of the Jets, Tony, to meet the Jets at the dance. Some of the Jets are unsure of his loyalty, but Riff is adamant that Tony is still one of them ("Jet Song"). Riff meets Tony while he's working at Doc's Drugstore to persuade him to come. Tony initially refuses, but Riff wins him over. Tony is convinced that something important is <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> ("Something's Coming").|$|E
25|$|England's innings {{was more}} solid than Australia's - {{the first seven}} batsmen made 21 and three passed 50 - but fell 15 runs short in the first innings. Geoff Pullar (33) and David Sheppard (31) {{struggled}} along with Sheppard edging a ball to the ground near Alan Davidson and Pullar caught by Richie Benaud only for Barry Jarman to signal that it wasn't a chance. Benaud had both men floundering at times, but they stuck to their work until Benaud caught Pullar off his own bowling on 62/1 and had Sheppard taken <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> by Garth McKenzie for 65/2. This brought Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey the crease to see out the session. After tea Dexter sent the ball crashing to the boundary ten times {{as he and his}} vice-captain added 80 runs in 76 minutes. Cowdrey (21) was willing to watch until he hooked Bobby Simpson straight into the hands of Bill Lawry and at ten to six Dexter's confidence - and the lengthening shadows - got the better of him and he drove over a ball from Benaud and was bowled for 70. Alan Smith joined Ken Barrington as a nightwatchman and they saw the day end on 169/4. Barrington thrashed six boundaries off Benaud and Simpson (1/52) in his first 25 runs the next day, adding 51 with Smith (21), who was caught behind when Garth McKenzie was brought into the attack and made several balls left awkwardly off the pitch. Barrington now reverted to his typical, grinding self, taking 210 minutes over his last 40 runs with Peter Parfitt feeling his way to 80 off 244 minutes. Finally the Surrey batsman lost his concentration and skied Benaud to Peter Burge at mid-off for 78 and was replaced by the equally pedestrian Fred Titmus, who prodded his way to 21 in 104 minutes. The end came suddenly, Titmus and Parfitt were caught off Benaud (6/115), McKenzie (3/78) had Barry Knight out for a duck and Fred Trueman for 19 after he hit a six and 2 fours adding 27 runs in 20 minutes for the last wicket with Brian Statham as 361/6 became 362/9 and 389 all out.|$|E

They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And {{so that was}} a big surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast. She comes <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did. Anna’s reaction was priceless to that. I haven’t seen the scene yet, but it was hilarious to do it." ...|$|E

Pinafore in the London suburbs, and Policeman 100-A in a {{companion}} piece, Antony and Cleopatra, a one-act French farce adapted by Charles Selby in 1842. [...] Soon {{he took over}} the larger role in Pinafore of Dick Deadeye, touring the English provinces. [...] He created the role of Sergeant of Police in the Paignton performance of The Pirates of Penzance in 1879. [...] He also had a part in Number One <b>Round</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corner,</b> a farce that played as a companion piece with Pinafore. In his early days with the company, there were complaints from reviewers that he tended to sing flat, but such complaints soon ceased. [...] He became known for his excellent diction.|$|E

2500|$|After Ortiz's {{scheduled}} rematch against Andre Berto {{fell through}} when Berto {{tested positive for}} a banned substance, his promotional team quickly found a late replacement in Josesito Lopez. However, {{just days before the}} fight was scheduled to take place, Ortiz was announced as the opponent for Saúl Álvarez in the main event of a Pay-Per-View show entitled [...] "Knockout Kings" [...] scheduled for September 15, 2012 if he were to defeat Lopez. Ortiz fought Lopez at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on June 23. In an exciting fight, both fighters repeatedly engaged in competitive exchanges, as opposed to the one-sided bout predicted by many members of the press. At the beginning of the tenth round, Ortiz's team threw in the towel when the fighter complained of a broken jaw, subsequently cancelling his possible bout with Alvarez. After the fight, Ortiz stated, [...] "Josesito broke my jaw, I had my mouth open and he broke my jaw. I couldn't close my mouth. It happened early in the (ninth) <b>round.</b> <b>The</b> <b>corner</b> wanted me to continue but I just couldn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|Evans made a third tour to Australia in 1954/55. He {{missed the}} first Test, after failing to recover from sunstroke. His deputy, Keith Andrew, came into the team to make his Test debut. Evans {{returned}} to the team for the second Test, but fared poorly with the bat scoring three and four. In the third Test at Melbourne he added some useful runs, in the first innings he scored 20 in a 54-run sixth wicket stand with Colin Cowdrey, in the second he added 22. He took five catches in the match including a leg-side one to dismiss Neil Harvey which began Australia's collapse from 77/2 to 111 all out. Neville Cardus described the catch: [...] "Harvey flicked the seventh ball of the morning (from Tyson) <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and this time Evans dived full length to the right, clutching the ball in his out-stretched glove". In the fourth Test Evans made his highest score of the series, an innings of 37 in 36 minutes, sharing a 51-run partnership with Trevor Bailey. After Australia were dismissed for 111 in their second innings (for the second successive match), it set England a target of 94 to win the match. Evans came to the wicket with only four needed and with only one needed he scored a boundary that won the match and retained the Ashes. The fifth and final Test was disrupted by heavy rain in New South Wales which had also led to the Hunter Valley floods. The match was drawn after no play was possible until the fourth day, Evans scored 10 in England's innings and took two catches.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the hours}} {{following}} the race, conspiracy theories emerged {{on social media}} around the circumstances concerning what happened when Rosberg lost the lead to Hamilton on lap 29. They suggested the incident {{was an act of}} revenge for the collision between the German driver and Hamilton at the Belgian Grand Prix two weeks prior. Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart felt the move was [...] "a bit too easy" [...] and appeared to indicate the error was done on purpose: [...] "I thought [...] could have least made an effort to get <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> I first thought 'that's wise', because he knew it wasn't a difficult thing to believe; the second time I thought: 'Hello, what's going on here?'" [...] Wolff denied the allegations that the mistake was deliberate, suggesting Rosberg was under pressure because of the Drivers' Championship battle but admitted it was not common for Rosberg to perform the same error twice: [...] "Only a paranoid mind could come up with such an idea." [...] Rosberg responded by stating Hamilton's fast pace prompted him to push hard and that while he could have successfully executed the corner, there was a large probability of flat-spotting one of his tyres and driving onto the run-off area was the safer choice. He stated he had heard about the theory but that there was [...] "no possible reason" [...] for him to purposely run off the track. Television pictures apparently showed Wolff smiling after moments after Rosberg's error with the team principal asserting that the broadcast was not live and stated the transmission of pit-to-car radio about Hamilton reducing his pace to conserve tyre life for a late race attack did not indicate the whole perception.|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{were set}} 240 to win, but Tyson had Arthur Morris caught for 4 by Colin Cowdrey. As [...] "Les Favell got going, his wicket went tumbling", bowled for 30 by Bob Appleyard. Neil Harvey and Richie Benaud took the score to 75/2 by stumps and over 50,000 {{supporters}} {{came on the}} fifth day to see them knock off the remaining runs, but what they got was [...] "the fastest and most frightening sustained spell of fast bowling seen in Australia". as Tyson sent Australia crashing to 111 all out – the dreaded Triple Nelson – and England won by 128 runs. Australia added only 36 runs that morning as Tyson took 6/16 off 6.3 eight-ball overs, 7/27 in the innings, hurtling down from the Richmond End and slightly into the breeze, but at enormous pace. The first wicket to fall was [...] "a phenomenal piece of cricket" [...] described by Neville Cardus as [...] "Harvey flicked the seventh ball of the morning (from Tyson) <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and this time Evans dived full length to the right, clutching the ball in his out-stretched glove". Evans had anticipated Harvey's stroke and had moved to leg before making his [...] "prodigious leap" [...] and [...] "thought this almost his best catch". Richie Benaud chopped the ball onto his stumps trying to hook, Keith Miller managed to block four shooters in a row from Statham, edging the last for four through his pads, but at the other end saw the ball ricochet off the shoulder of his bat, and deflect off Len Hutton's outstretched hand for Bill Edrich to leap backwards and take the catch. Graeme Hole in his final Test innings, edged Brian Statham behind to Evans, Len Maddocks couldn't repeat his first innings heroics and was bowled first ball by a Tyson yorker that he dug out, only to see it spin back into his wicket. Ray Lindwall, fearing a Tyson bouncer after Sydney, played back to a full-length ball and was lbw for a second ball duck, Ron Archer made 15 before he was bowled by a Statham yorker, and Bill Johnston lasted only three balls before he hung his bat outside off-stump and was caught behind off Tyson to end the innings on 111, with captain Ian Johnson unbeaten with 4. The match finished well before lunch and the Melbourne Cricket Club caterers were left with thousands of unsold meat pies as the crowd deserted the ground.|$|E
