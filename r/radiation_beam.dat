If not all of the <b>radiation</b> <b>beam</b> is absorbed or scattered in the patient, the portion that passes through may be measured and used to produce images of the patient.|$|E
25|$|Spiral multidetector CT uses 16, 64, 254 or more {{detectors}} during {{continuous motion}} of the patient through the <b>radiation</b> <b>beam</b> to obtain fine detail images in a short exam time. With rapid administration of intravenous contrast during the CT scan, these fine detail images can be reconstructed into three-dimensional (3D) images of carotid, cerebral, coronary or other arteries.|$|E
25|$|An {{enhancement}} of virtual simulation is 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), {{in which the}} profile of each <b>radiation</b> <b>beam</b> is shaped to fit {{the profile of the}} target from a beam's eye view (BEV) using a multileaf collimator (MLC) and a variable number of beams. When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor, the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced, allowing a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades the {{electron}} spin resonance (ESR) technique has been widely adopted for dosimetry of the <b>radiation</b> <b>beams</b> used in <b>radiation</b> therapy. In particular, alanine dosimtery is nowadays recognized as an international standard system for transfer dosimetry and for high doses. This is because among the various solid-state dosimeters the alanine ESR detectors present several advantages such as: tissue equivalence, linearity of its dose-response over a wide range, high stability of radiation induced free radicals, no destructive read-out procedure, no sample treatment before EPR signal measurement. In this presentation the main applications of ESR dosimetry for the characterization of various <b>radiation</b> <b>beams</b> used in clinical applications (such as photons, electrons, protons, charged ions and neutrons) will be reported. The possibility of improvement of ESR sensitivity to various <b>radiation</b> <b>beams</b> achieved through the use of additives will be discussed by considering the features of suitable dopants. Furthermore, since the ESR techniques is able to detect the interactions between free radicals produced by various types of radiations, recently this technique has been applied to provide information about the the linear energy transfer (LET) of the beams. These applications aimed at discriminating different <b>radiation</b> <b>beams</b> will be outlined...|$|R
25|$|External beam {{radiation}} therapy uses a linear accelerator to produce high-energy x-rays that are directed in a beam towards the prostate. A technique called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) {{may be used}} to adjust the <b>radiation</b> <b>beam</b> to conform with the shape of the tumor, allowing higher doses to be given to the prostate and seminal vesicles with less damage to the bladder and rectum. External {{beam radiation}} therapy is generally given over several weeks, with daily visits to a radiation therapy center. New types of radiation therapy such as IMRT have fewer side effects than traditional treatment. Eleven centers in the United States are now using proton therapy for prostate cancer, which uses protons rather than X-rays to kill the cancer cells. Researchers are also studying types of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to treat prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Medical grade linacs {{accelerate}} electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, {{in which}} the RF power creates a standing wave. Some linacs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines {{tend to have a}} horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical linacs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease. The LINAC produces a reliable, flexible and accurate <b>radiation</b> <b>beam.</b> The versatility of LINAC is a potential advantage over cobalt therapy as a treatment tool. In addition, the device can simply be powered off when not in use; there is no source requiring heavy shielding – although the treatment room itself requires considerable shielding of the walls, doors, ceiling etc. to prevent escape of scattered radiation. Prolonged use of high powered (>18MeV) machines can induce a significant amount of radiation within the metal parts of the head of the machine after power to the machine has been removed (i.e. they become an active source and the necessary precautions must be observed).|$|E
2500|$|Several {{treatment}} alternatives may {{be available}} for a given medical condition, with significantly different costs yet no statistical difference in outcome. Such scenarios offer the opportunity to maintain or {{improve the quality of}} care, while significantly reducing costs, through comparative effectiveness research. Writing in the New York Times, David Leonhardt described how the cost of treating {{the most common form of}} early-stage, slow-growing prostate cancer ranges from an average of $2,400 (watchful waiting to see if the condition deteriorates) to as high as $100,000 (<b>radiation</b> <b>beam</b> therapy): ...|$|E
25|$|Stereotactic {{radiation}} is a specialized type of external <b>beam</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy. It uses focused <b>radiation</b> <b>beams</b> targeting a well-defined tumor using extremely detailed imaging scans. Radiation oncologists perform stereotactic treatments, {{often with the}} help of a neurosurgeon for tumors in the brain or spine.|$|R

25|$|Virtual simulation, {{the most}} basic form of planning, allows more {{accurate}} placement of <b>radiation</b> <b>beams</b> than is possible using conventional X-rays, where soft-tissue structures are often difficult to assess and normal tissues difficult to protect.|$|R
2500|$|Improvements in {{computers}} and treatment delivery technology {{have led to}} more complex radiotherapy treatment options. One such new technology is using IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy), which can change the shape and intensity of the <b>radiation</b> <b>beam</b> making [...] "beamlets" [...] at different points across and inside the breast. This allows for better dose distribution within the breast while minimizing dose to healthy organs such as the lung or heart. However, there {{is yet to be}} a demonstrated difference in treatment outcomes (both tumor recurrence and level of side effects) for IMRT in breast cancer when compared to conventional radiotherapy treatment. In addition, conventional radiotherapy can also deliver similar dose distributions utilizing modern computer dosimetry planning and equipment. External beam radiation therapy treatments for breast cancer are typically given every day, five days a week, for five to 10 weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Linear accelerators emit {{high energy}} X-rays; {{the process is}} usually {{referred}} to as [...] "X-ray therapy" [...] or [...] "photon therapy." [...] The term [...] "gamma ray" [...] is usually reserved for photons that are emitted from a radioisotope such as cobalt-60 (see below). Such radiation is not substantially different from that emitted by high voltage accelerators. In linear accelerator therapy, the emission head (called [...] "gantry") is mechanically rotated around the patient, in a full or partial circle. The table where the patient is lying, the [...] "couch", can also be moved in small linear or angular steps. The combination of {{the movements of the}} gantry and of the couch makes possible the computerized planning of the volume of tissue {{that is going to be}} irradiated. Devices with a high energy of 6MeV are the most suitable for the treatment of the brain, due to the depth of the target. The diameter of the energy beam leaving the emission head can be adjusted to the size of the lesion by means of collimators. They may be interchangeable orifices with different diameters, typically varying from 5 to 40mm in 5mm steps, or multileaf collimators, which consist of a number of metal leaflets that can be moved dynamically during treatment in order to shape the <b>radiation</b> <b>beam</b> to conform to the mass to be ablated. [...] Linacs are capable of achieving extremely narrow beam geometries, such as 0.15 to 0.3mm. Therefore, they can be used for several kinds of surgeries which hitherto had been carried out by open or endoscopic surgery, such as for trigeminal neuralgia, etc. The exact mechanism of its effectiveness for trigeminal neuralgia is not known; however, its use for this purpose has become very common. Long-term follow-up data has shown it to be as effective as radiofrequency ablation, but inferior to surgery in preventing the recurrence of pain.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} whether the position of head and neck cancer patients during radiotherapy could be determined from portal images of oblique <b>radiation</b> <b>beams.</b> Currently applied additional anterior posterior (AP) and lateral verification beams could then be abandoned. Method: The patient position was determined from portal images of the oblique <b>radiation</b> <b>beams</b> and compared with that determined from AP and lateral verification beams. Seven hundred and fifty-one portal images of 18 different patients were analyzed. Results: The set-up errors of patients that were treated with oblique gantry angles could be determined with the same accuracy from the oblique beams as from the AP and lateral verification beams in the ventrodorsal and craniocaudal direction. An additional AP beam was necessary to obtain the same accuracy in the lateral direction, because the used beam directions were relatively close to lateral. The position verification of patients treated with both oblique gantry angles and isocentric table rotations was more accurate if AP and lateral verification beams were used. Conclusions: For patients treated with an irradiation technique with oblique gantry angles (and no isocentric table rotations) position verification can be performed by using these oblique <b>radiation</b> <b>beams.</b> (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
