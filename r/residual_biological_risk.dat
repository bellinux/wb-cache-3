40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{cross-sectional}} {{survey on}} knowledge and perception of occupational <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> among workers in several occupations {{was carried out}} in the industrial area of Rome. METHODS: The study {{was carried out in}} the period of March-April 2010 using a questionnaire with 33 items on the following areas: a) socio-demographic data; b) perception of the <b>biological</b> <b>risks</b> in ordinary occupational activity; c) knowledge about biological risks; d) <b>biological</b> <b>risks</b> in the working environment. The questionnaire was submitted to a convenience sample of workers of an industrial area in Southern Rome. RESULTS: 729 participants entered the study from the following work activities: food, catering, service, farming and breeding, healthcare, school and research (males 57. 2 %; mean age 37. 4 years, SD = 10. 9). Significant associations were found between different activity areas with respect to the relevance of the <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> (p = 0. 044) and the perception of the <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> (p < 0. 001). With respect to vehicles of infectious agents, the highest percentages of the most common <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> exposures were: air and physical contact for the catering and food group, 66. 7 % and 61. 90 % respectively; air and blood for the health and research group, with 73. 50 % and 57. 00 % respectively; and physical contact and blood for the service group, 63. 10 % and 48. 30 %. Significant difference of proportions were found about the prevalent effect caused by the biological agents was the occurrence of infectious diseases (59. 90 % food group, 91. 60 % health and research and 79. 30 % service group) (p < 0. 001). The perception of knowledge resulted in a good rank (sufficient, many or complete) in the food and catering group, 78. 3 % with significant difference compared to other professions (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: All participants show good knowledge the effects induced by biological agents and it is significant that almost half of the respondents are aware of the risks concerning allergies.

Special aims were to characterise 30 - and 35 -year old persons in the county with respect to lifestyle factors and <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> markers. The association between lifestyle and <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> factors were studied, as well as the effect of lifestyle changes on <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> markers. Sub-aims were to determine if there was an effect of the health promotion programme on hard end-points (mortality from ischaemic heart disease) in the community, and to evaluate the dietary instrument used. Study population and methods: All health care centres in the former County of Skaraborg participated in the Live for Life programme, and as one part of the programme 30 - and 35 -year old persons in the county were invited to a health dialogue using a "Health Curve". A nurse carried out this health interview. Information about dietary habits was obtained by using a specially designed self-instruction questionnaire. Register data were used for studying changes in mortality from ischaemic heart disease as a possible effect of the intervention programme. Results and conclusions: Detailed information has been obtained about lifestyle factors and <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> markers from the health dialogues. Women reported better dietary habits and lower alcohol consumption than men, while men smoked less, experienced less mental stress and reported less psychological strain. Dietary habits were more favourable at the age of 35 years than at the age of 30, both in men and women. The specially designed dietary questionnaire showed good between-method correlation for fat and fibre with a 3 -day food record and there was a significant association with dietary habits measured with the questionnaire and serum cholesterol concentration. The dietary questionnaire proved to be a useful tool as part of the health dialogue. Those who improved their lifestyle (dietary and physical activity habits were studied in this respect) also improved their <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> markers. In communities offering the health dialogue there was a more favourable development concerning <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> markers such as body mass index and serum cholesterol concentration compared with communities with a community health strategy only. In one of the communities of Skaraborg (Habo), which participated to full extent in the Live for Live programme, premature mortality from ischaemic heart disease decreased substantially compared with the rest of Sweden. This may be an effect of improvements in both primary and secondary prevention in co-operation between the community and primary health care...|$|R

Their occurrence in surface waters and also in soil raises concerns {{about the risk of}} the development of resistant bacteria and other potential chronic effects. AOPs (UV/H 2 O 2, Fenton, photo-Fenton, and UV/TiO 2) and ozonation proved effective for degrading these emerging contaminants due to hydroxyl radical formation, surpassing the efficacy of conventional methods. In addition, the main degradation mechanisms of these drugs as well as data on <b>residual</b> <b>biological</b> activity were analyzed...|$|R
