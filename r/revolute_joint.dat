40|$|This work {{presents}} an approach for the modeling and numerical optimization of ball joints within a Marker-less Motion Capture (MoCap) framework. In skeleton based approaches, kinematic chains {{are commonly used}} to model 1 DoF <b>revolute</b> <b>joints.</b> A 3 DoF joint (e. g. a shoulder or hip) is consequently modeled by concatenating three consecutive 1 DoF <b>revolute</b> <b>joints.</b> Obviously such a representation is not optimal and singularities can occur. Therefore, we propose to model 3 DoF joints with spherical joints or ball joints using the representation of a twist and its exponential mapping (known from 1 DoF <b>revolute</b> <b>joints).</b> The exact modeling and numerical optimization of ball joints requires additionally the adjoint transform and the logarithm of the exponential mapping. Experiments with simulated and real data demonstrate that ball joints can better represent arbitrary rotations than the concatenation of 3 <b>revolute</b> <b>joints.</b> Moreover, we demonstrate that the 3 <b>revolute</b> <b>joints</b> representation {{is very similar to}} the Euler angles representation and has the same limitations in terms of singularities. 1...|$|R

Substitution of this kind of human <b>joints</b> with <b>revolute</b> (hinge) <b>joints</b> in robots changes the kinematics of the joints.

40|$|Abstract Purpose – Aims {{to discuss}} how a Cartesian {{parallel}} robot with flexure <b>revolute</b> <b>joints</b> can effectively perform miniaturized assembly tasks. Design/methodology/approach – The results of the test and validation phase of a Cartesian parallel robot designed for miniaturized assembly are shown. The workspace volume is a cube with 30 mm side and the target accuracy is 1 mm. Each of the three robot legs has a prismatic-planar architecture, with a cog-free linear motor and a planar joint realized using ten superelastic flexure <b>revolute</b> <b>joints.</b> Flexure joints are adopted {{in order to avoid}} stick-slip phenomena and reach high positioning accuracy; their patented construction is relatively low-cost and allows a quick replacement in case of fatigue failure. Findings – The tests on the prototype are very encouraging: the measured positioning accuracy of the linear motors is ^ 0. 5 mm; on the other hand, the effects of unwanted rotations of flexure joints and hysteresis of the superelastic material are not negligible and must be properly compensated for in order to fully exploit the potential performance of the machine. Practical implications – The introduction of this robotic architecture can fulfil the needs {{of a wide range of}} industrial miniaturized assembly applications, thanks to its accurate positioning in a relatively large workspace. The cost of the machine is low thanks to its extreme modularity. Originality/value – The combination of Cartesian parallel kinematics, cog-free linear motors and superelastic flexure <b>revolute</b> <b>joints</b> allows one to obtain very good positioning performance...|$|R
