40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{irregular}} acoustic properties of pink noise and its improper {{use as a}} common <b>reference</b> <b>sound</b> <b>source,</b> and proposes hi-pass pink noise as a new <b>reference</b> <b>sound</b> <b>source.</b> Hi-pass pink noise can be identified as a sound source created by eliminating unnecessary energy below the audible pitch range in pink noise. Compared to regular pink noise, hi-pass pink noise of 20 Hz had a minimum of 20 % reduction in energy and a marginal increase of 0. 7 dBFS amplitude, while hi-pass pink noise of 40 Hz had 30 % reduction in energy and 1. 6 dBFS marginal increase in amplitude. In spite of such changes in physical features, hi-pass pink noise does not produce any audible difference. The paper also suggests that Comfortable Maximum Level (CML) can be utilized as a standard volume when comparing multiple sound sources...|$|E
40|$|Sound power {{describes}} a sound source {{regardless of its}} environment and is useful in noise control applications, but can be cumbersome and time consuming to measure. Sound power levels can rank different sound sources and is often restricted in noise control legislation. An acoustic camera records a sound field with a microphone array. Due to properties of the array, and by using beamforming algorithms, an acoustic camera can separate sound from different directions. The acoustic camera measures sound pressure from a sound source. By assuming directivity properties the sound power of a sound source {{can be derived from}} the sound pressure. In this thesis an acoustic camera has been evaluated in order to determine sound power estimation performance and sound source separation ability. This is tested by six different measurement set-ups in an anechoic chamber. Two different sound sources are used in the trials: one <b>reference</b> <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> and one disturbing sound source. The <b>reference</b> <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> has a calibrated and documented sound power level to which the measurement results are compared. Measurements were performed at 1 to 5 m distance from the acoustic camera with both sound sources. The influence of a disturbing sound source on the <b>reference</b> <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> sound power level was measured with the sound sources separated 0. 65 m to 2. 6 m. The measurements show that the sound power level could at best be determined within 1 dB. The acoustic camera can separate different sound sources well. Influence from a disturbing sound source, 10 dB SPL stronger and distanced 1 m from a <b>reference</b> <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> was 2 to 3 dB for mid-frequency one-third octave bands at 5 m measurement distance. Measuring sound power with an acoustic camera is fast and mobile compared to room interaction methods and sound intensity measurements. The results of this thesis are useful when measuring sound power levels, especially for sound sources such as chimney outlets, wind power stations and big objects that can not be moved or do not fit in a room.

The motivation for the work presented here was to analyse the possibilities for quantitative acoustic measurements in an environement that was not designed for acoustic measurements and where reverberations, shear layer refraction and turbulence distort the sound field. Extensive acoustic measurements were performed using a linear microphone array with 104 microphones {{on the floor of}} the hall. Room acoustics effects were investigated with a <b>reference</b> <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> and the sound field of the rotors was measured for different configurations. The results show that reflections fron the ceiling and side walls interfere with the direct sound field and influence the measure directivity due to strong local variations of the sound pressure level from one microphone position to the next.

This paper presents multiple moving speaker tracking using an 8 ch microphone array system installed on a mobile robot. This problem {{is difficult because}} the system does not assume that <b>sound</b> <b>sources</b> and/or the microphone array are fixed. Our solutions consist of two key ideas – time delay of arrival estimation, and multiple Kalman filters. The former localizes multiple <b>sound</b> <b>sources</b> based on beamforming in real time. Non-linear movements are tracked by using a set of Kalman filters with different history lengths {{in order to reduce}} errors in tracking multiple moving speakers under noisy and echoic environments.

This paper describes the implementation of acoustic modeling for design purposes by incrementally increasing model fidelity and validating the accuracy of the model while predicting the noise of sources under various conditions. During FY 07, a simple-geometry Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) model was developed and validated using a physical mockup and acoustic measurements. A process for modeling the effects of absorptive wall treatments and the resulting reverberation environment were developed. During FY 08, a model with more complex and representative geometry of the Orion Crew Module (CM) interior was built, and noise predictions based on input noise sources were made. A corresponding physical mockup was also built. Measurements were made inside this mockup, and comparisons were made with the model and showed excellent agreement. During FY 09, the fidelity of the mockup and corresponding model were increased incrementally by including a simple ventilation system. The airborne noise contribution of the fans was measured using a sound intensity technique, since the sound power levels were not known beforehand. This is opposed to earlier studies where <b>Reference</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>Sources</b> (RSS) with known sound power level were used. Comparisons of the modeling result with the measurements in the mockup showed excellent results. During FY 10, the fidelity of the mockup and the model were further increased by including an ECLSS (Environmental Control and Life Support System) wall, associated closeout panels, and the gap between ECLSS wall and mockup wall. The effect of sealing the gap and adding sound absorptive treatment to ECLSS wall were also modeled and validated...|$|R
40|$|On {{account of}} LN Akustikmiljö AB, the sound energy {{absorption}} of various rooms was estimated using two methods; {{by measuring the}} steady-­‐state sound pressure levels in the rooms when excited by a <b>reference</b> <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> and by measuring the reverberation time. The reason for the comparison was that the reverberation time was not always a satisfactory measure of the acoustical performance of rooms, {{even though it was}} the only requirement in Swedish standard SS 25268 : 2007 [1]. Thus, it was suggested to try alternative methods to measure the acoustical performance of the rooms. Measurements were performed in 18 rooms with varying volume and acoustical treatment. The equivalent absorption area of each room was calculated from both methods. Comparison between the two methods showed large differences in the equivalent absorption area; however which value was the best representation of the actual real situation is a complex problem, which varies with the dimensions and acoustical treatment of the room and the frequency band and will need further research...|$|E

In FY 09, the physical mockup developed in FY 08, with interior geometric shape similar to Orion CM (Crew Module) IML (Interior Mode Line), was used to validate SEA (Statistical Energy Analysis) acoustic model development with realistic ventilation fan sources. The sound power levels of these sources were unknown a priori, as opposed to previous studies that RSS (<b>Reference</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>Source)</b> with known sound power level was used. The modeling results were evaluated based on comparisons to measurements of sound pressure levels over a wide frequency range, including the frequency range where SEA gives good results. Sound intensity measurement was performed over a rectangular-shaped grid system enclosing the ventilation fan source. Sound intensities were measured at the top, front, back, right, and left surfaces of the and system. Sound intensity at the bottom surface was not measured, but sound blocking material was placed tinder the bottom surface to reflect most of the incident sound energy back to the remaining measured surfaces. Integrating measured sound intensities over measured surfaces renders estimated sound power of the source. The reverberation time T 6 o of the mockup interior had been modified to match reverberation levels of ISS US Lab interior for speech frequency bands, i. e., 0. 5 k, 1 k, 2 k, 4 kHz, by attaching appropriately sized Thinsulate sound absorption material to the interior wall of the mockup. Sound absorption of Thinsulate was modeled in three methods: Sabine equation with measured mockup interior reverberation time T 60, layup model based on past impedance tube testing, and layup model plus air absorption correction. The evaluation/validation was carried out by acquiring octave band microphone data simultaneously at ten fixed locations throughout the mockup. SPLs (Sound Pressure Levels) predicted by our SEA model match well with measurements for our CM mockup, with a more complicated shape. Additionally in FY 09, background NC noise (Noise Criterion) simulation and MRT (Modified Rhyme Test) were developed and performed in the mockup to determine the maximum noise level in CM habitable volume for fair crew voice communications. Numerous demonstrations of simulated noise environment in the mockup and associated SIL (Speech Interference Level) via MRT were performed for various communities, including members from NASA and Orion prime-/sub-contractors.

40|$|In “What We Hear, ” Jason Leddington (ms) argues {{against two}} claims about sounds and hearing. The {{first is that}} sounds are proper objects of hearing—that sounds are {{inaccessible}} to other senses. The second is that only sounds are heard directly—one hears <b>sound</b> <b>sources</b> only in virtue of hearing sounds. Leddingtonʼs main target is the second claim, so it is my focus. Leddingtonʼs case against the second claim turns on arguing against Phenomenological Independence, the claim that, as presented in auditory experience, sounds seem independent from ordinary material things and happenings. He claims that auditory experiences present <b>sound</b> <b>sources</b> as being available for primitive demonstrative reference (Phenomenological Intimacy) and that this tells against the Phenomenological Independence of <b>sounds</b> from <b>sound</b> <b>sources.</b> He also argues that Phenomenological Independence is incompatible with Phenomenological Binding, the claim that auditory experiences present sounds as bound to their sources. Since Phenomenological Independence fails, Leddington argues, we do not hear ordinary material things or <b>sound</b> <b>sources</b> indirectly by or in virtue of hearing the sounds they make (the Berkeleyan view). Instead, he advocates the Heideggerian view, according to which one hears sources in hearing their sounds and, therefore, “hearing a sound involves an unmediated experience of its source ” (ms 6). Leddington thus argues from a claim about the apparent relations among objects of auditory awareness to a conclusion about the relations among auditory experiences— from the claim that audible <b>sounds</b> and audible <b>sources</b> seem bound and not independent to the claim that one hears <b>sources</b> in hearing <b>sounds.</b> My work on sounds and hearing has emphasized the possibility of audition-based demonstrative <b>reference</b> to <b>sound</b> <b>sources,</b> as Leddington mentions (ms 13).

A potential solution to this problem is the use of shadow algorithms from computer graphics. These algorithms can provide a way to efficiently simulate <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> occlusion in real-time and in a physically plausible manner. Two simulation prototypes are presented, one for fixed-position <b>sound</b> <b>sources</b> and another for moving <b>sound</b> <b>sources...</b>|$|R

This work proposes a <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> number and directions estimation method by using the delay information of microphone array. An eigenstructure-based generalized cross correlation method is proposed to estimate time delay between microphones. Upon obtaining the time delay information, the <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> direction and velocity can be estimated by least square method. In multiple <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> case, the time delay combination among microphones is arranged such that the estimated sound speed value falls within an acceptable range. By accumulating the estimation results of <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> direction and using adaptive K-means++ algorithm, the <b>sound</b> <b>source</b> number and directions can be estimated. I...|$|R
