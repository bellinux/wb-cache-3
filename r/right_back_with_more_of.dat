STUFF...", occasionally paired with shifting his head to reveal the ubiquitous sign behind the stage reading simply [...] "STUFF", and [...] "This is me saying 'bye'" [...] {{was one of his}} favorite closing lines) were the antithesis of the smooth TV host (such as Gary Owens, who hosted the syndicated version in its first season). Barris joined in with the eccentricity of the format, using unusual props, dressing in colorful and somewhat unusual clothing (such as the occasional hat pulled over his head, if not his eyes), he became yet another performer of the show, and for many, quite a cult hero. Dubbed [...] "Chuckie Baby" [...] by his fans, Barris was a perfect fit with the show's goofy, sometimes wild amateur performers and its panel of three judges (including regulars Jamie Farr, Jaye P. Morgan, Rex Reed and Arte Johnson). In addition, there was a growing [...] "cast of characters", including an NBC stage carpenter who played [...] "Father Ed," [...] a priest who would get flustered when his cue cards were deliberately turned upside-down; Canadian comedian Murray Langston, who as [...] "The Unknown Comic" [...] wore a paper bag over his head (with cut-outs for his eyes, mouth, and even a box of Kleenex), and [...] "Gene Gene the Dancing Machine" [...] (Gene Patton), arguably the most popular member of the [...] "cast", the show's prop man, [...] who would show up and dance whenever the band played the song [...] "Jumpin' at the Woodside". In the early 1980s, Patton was even pointed out by tour guides of incoming NBC tours as his onscreen character, {{while at the same time}} adhering to his more typical off-camera work duties.|$|R

Listen to a Constant Deviants album {{and you will be}} reminded why the combination of smooth turntablism and strong wordplay is the ultimate classic recipe." [...] Lafayette Hicks The Hip Hop Foundation stated, [...] "M.I. is a talented lyricist that walks the thin line perfectly between being thought-provoking and not being overly complicated. He has a distinct elderly-statesman like voice that commands respect but still blends nicely with the production. The subject matter is versatile as he touches on the street life in one breath then comes <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a <b>more</b> philosophical approach. It’s basically the duality of man that isn’t all good or all bad. One thing that really stuck out to me is M.I.’s hooks. They’re catchy and melodic, tying together his verses nicely and displaying his ability as a great songwriter as opposed to just a 16 bars rapper." ...|$|R
