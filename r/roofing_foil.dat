40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} a design of the steel {{structure}} of the factory hall situated {{near the city of}} Brno. The hall has a rectangular shape with the dimensions of 42 x 18 m and the saddle roof at the angle of 5 % and the roof top 8 m above the ground. The transverse bond consists of a truss girder with a span of 18 m placed on the columns by joints. The columns are fixed in the transverse direction. The purlin is 6 m long and it is placed on the truss by joints. The curtain wall is made of sandwich panels and the roof is composed of layers of a trapezoidal steel plate, isolation and <b>roofing</b> <b>foil...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis {{is a new}} family house with project office in Uherský Brod. Family house is located on flat land in {{a short distance from}} the city center. The building is two-floor. In the first floor is located entrance to the building, storeroom, utility room, living room, sbathroom, WC and project office with own entrance and WC. From the first floor is also entrance to the terrace and garden. In the second floor is situated bedroom with dressing room, two bedrooms, bathroom and WC. From one of the bedroom is possible to access to the balcony. The roof above the first floor is flat, the roof above second flat is mono-pitched roof. The building is made of structural masonry system Porotherm 30 P+D, insulation system EPS 100 F, roof truss from bonded girder, <b>roof</b> covering <b>foil</b> Fatrafol. Garage is designed as a detached building roofed with a flat roof. Garage is made of the structural system Porotherm 30 P+D. Project Documentation is created in AutoCAD...|$|R
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} based on a project of medical centre in Vizovice. The medical centre is {{designed}} as a three-floor building with a receding top floor. Building foundations are designed from foundation pads and strips from reinforced concrete, the load-bearing masonry is designed from hollow clay blocks ZELUS, a reinforced concrete ceiling is designed as a bracing element. The medical centre is roofed by a flat roof with a PVC covering. This thesis deals with the budget and time plan of the whole construction, transport accessibility of the building, building maintenance instructions and maintenance costs for 25 years, daylighting of room number 1. 32, an engineering report of construction site equipment and its drawing, a design of lifting mechanism of the site equipment, a plan for transport of concrete and concreting the floor slabs. The thesis is mainly focused on roofing of the medical centre, technological regulation for the roofing and reinforced concrete floor slabs is elaborated, as well as a control and test plan for the floor slabs from the reinforced concrete and for the <b>roof</b> PVC <b>foil...</b>|$|R
50|$|The mosque has two tall minarets {{which are}} {{separated}} by three octagonal stages. There are galleried balconies that separate each stage of the minaret. There are turnip-shaped domes {{on the top of}} the minarets. There is a large rectangular prayer hall inside the mosque with a flat <b>roof</b> supported by <b>foiled</b> arches. There is a series of arched openings in the minarets as well as the walls of the rectangular terrace. The mosque has two stories and unlike other mosques, it does not have a dome. There is an old clock installed during the early 20th century. A Madrasa is operated from the mosque, where learning of Islam is imparted.|$|R
40|$|This project {{addresses}} a cascade two-storey detached {{house with a}} residential unit on the 1 st floor, which is designed for 4 - 5 people, and massage parlor on the 2 nd floor. The house is to be bulit on the undeveloped outskirts of the village Větřní on a sloping land with a slant of approximately 25 %. The building, including the massage parlor on the 2 nd floor, is accessible from a local road. The main entrance {{is located on the}} 1 st floor on the northern side of the house. It is accessible from a staircase which is protected against adverse weather conditions by a wooden pergola. Vertical structures are designed from the Porotherm system. As far as the roof structure is concerned, it combines extensive green roofing with damp proof <b>foil</b> <b>roof</b> insulation...|$|R
40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{section of}} half {{the top of a}} single-wide manufactured home has been studied in the Large Scale Climate Simulator (LSCS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A small roof cavity with little room for insulation at the eaves is often the case with single-wide units and limits practical ways to improve thermal performance. The purpose of the current tests was to obtain steady-state performance data for the roof cavity of the manufactured home test section when the roof cavity was insulated with fiberglass batts, blown-in rock wool insulation or combinations of these insulations and powder-filled evacuated panel (PEP) insulation. Four insulation configurations were tested: (A) a configuration with two layers of nominal R{sub US}- 7 h {center_dot} ft{sup 2 } {center_dot} F/BTU (R{sub SI}- 1. 2 m{sup 2 } {center_dot} K/W) fiberglass batts; (B) a layer of PEPs and one layer of the fiberglass batts; (C) four layers of the fiberglass batts; and (D) an average 4. 1 in. (10. 4 cm) thick layer of blown-in rock wool at an average density of 2. 4 lb/ft{sup 3 } (38 kg/m{sup 3 }). Effects of additional sheathing were determined for Configurations B and C. With Configuration D over the ceiling, two layers of expanded polystyrene (EPS) boards, each about the same thickness as the PEPs, were installed over the trusses instead of the <b>roof.</b> Aluminum <b>foils</b> facing the attic and over the top layer of EPS were added. The top layer of EPS was then replaced by PEPs...|$|R
5000|$|Fuselage era Chryslers all {{featured}} a full width loop style chrome front bumper. Quad headlamps and grille were recessed inside the loop, with differing grille inserts for each series. Turn signal and parking lamps were recessed into the bumper below the head lamps. Body sides were simple and smooth with a subtle character line originating {{at the front}} bumper, descending slightly {{for the length of}} the car, and ending at the wrap-around rear bumper. On Town and Country wagons, this character line was also the location of the lower molding surrounding the standard wood grain side paneling, simulated cherry for 1969. The fuselage profile extended the length of a full sized “long roof” made for a rather striking looking wagon. At the trailing edge of the long roof, body sides, D pillars, and a unique <b>roof</b> top air <b>foil</b> formed one continuous arch over the tailgate opening. The airfoil directed airflow from the roof downward and over the tail gate window, intended to keep the glass clear of dirt accumulation.|$|R
