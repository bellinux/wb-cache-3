Because of difficulties and subjectivity of human interpretation, automatic and computerized analysis of dermoscopic images has opened an important research area.

When KF was filled in EK matrix, it could greatly improve the impact strength of EK composite by reducing crack formation and inhibiting crack propagation. The KF/EK composite has good tribological properties. It keeps the high friction low wear performance advantage of EK, and solves its problem of forming difficulty.

5000|$|The boron {{concentration}} of ulexite is commercially significant because boron compounds {{are used in}} producing materials for many branches of industry. Boron is primarily used in the manufacturing of fiberglass along with heat resistant borosilicate glasses such as traditional Pyrex, car headlights, and laboratory glassware. Borosilicate glass is desirable because adding B2O3 lowers the expansion coefficient, therefore increasing the thermal shock resistance of the glass. Boron and its compounds are also a common ingredients in soaps, detergents, and bleaches, which contributes to the softening of hard water by attracting the calcium ions. Boron usage in alloy and metal production has been increasing because of its excellent metal oxide solubilizing ability. Boron compounds are used as a <b>reinforcing</b> <b>agent</b> in order to harden metals for use in military tanks and armor. Boron is used extensively for fire retardant materials. Boron is an essential element for plant growth and is frequently used as a fertilizer, however in large concentrations boron can be toxic, and therefore boron is a common ingredient in herbicides and insecticides. Boron {{is also found in}} chemicals used to treat wood and as protective coatings and pottery glazes. [...] Additionally, when ulexite is dissolved in a solution of carbonate, calcium carbonate forms as a by-product. This by-product is used in large amounts by the pulp and paper industry as a paper filler and as a coating for paper that allows for improved printability (Demirkiran and Kunkul, 2011).Recently, as more attention is being given to obtaining new sources of energy, the use of hydrogen as a fuel for cars has come to the forefront. The compound sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is currently being considered as an excellent hydrogen storage medium due to its high theoretical hydrogen yield by weight for future use in cars. Piskin (2009) validates that the {{boron concentration}} in ulexite can be used as the boron source or the starting material in the synthesis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4).|$|E
