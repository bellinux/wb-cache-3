There is however, considerable evidence of increased <b>risk.</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>market</b> liberalization increases consumption volatility and heightens countries' vulnerability to crises. The poor are least equipped to cope with increased volatility, and they are most affected by financial crises.

Financial openness delivers the poor few benefits in terms of increased access to credit and other financial services, and it constrains governments' redistributive efforts and anti-poverty fiscal policies.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model to}} explain why both business angels and venture capitalists exist in the <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> <b>market.</b> Venture capitalists should earn their opportunity costs while business angels need not. From this observation, we identify where business angels and venture capitalists have their distinctive competitive advantages in the venture capital market. Venture capitalists can be more competitive if the required size of investments and the possibilities of risk-reducing information production are larger. Business angels can be more competitive if the required size of investments and the possibilities of the investor’s contributions are smaller. 2 In this article we try to explain why two different forms of risk capital exist simultaneously in the entrepreneurial equity market. The two most popular equity investors in new ventures are informal venture investors 1 (more popularly referred to business angel investors) and venture capitalists. While research has acknowledged {{the presence of these}} two distinct forms, each with different prices, different contract structures and different return expectations, researchers rarely speculate about why these two distinct capital suppliers exist in the market in the first place.

40|$|Concepts like {{corporate}} governance have been developed, {{due to the}} needs of the owners to supervise the management and influence the directions of the acquired companies. We will for the purpose of this thesis, look upon {{corporate governance}} as a means for the investors/owners to exercise influence over, and supervise the acquired company, and thereby affecting the return on investment. If corporate governance is practised, an active ownership is a prerequisite. The objective of this study has been to explore and analyse how investing companies look upon the concept of active ownership, how this is exercised in practice, and how this could benefit both one's own and the acquired company. In order to answer these questions we conducted an explorative and descriptive study, namely a study of a number of selected companies' annual reports, in combination with two personal interviews. The study indicates that it is hard to find a distinct definition of what active ownership consists of, though it seems to demand actions concerning the management of the acquired company. This is mainly accomplished through board participation. The investing companies, active on the <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> <b>market,</b> consider the most important aim for active ownership to be profit maximisation. The same companies consider the access to their network of knowledge to be the main contribution to the acquired company...|$|E
40|$|We analyze annuity {{demand in}} a {{realistic}} life-cycle {{model in which}} we optimize over consumption and asset allocation. We incorporate background risk and incomplete annuity menus as possible drivers of devia-tions from full annuitization. Retirees face longevity <b>risk,</b> <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> risk, inflation risk, and background risk. We model annuitization as a one-time decision at retirement. Contrary to what is often suggested in the literature, we find that in these settings full annuitization remains close to optimal, irrespective of whether real or only nominal annuities are available. Under all circumstances we find optimal annuitization levels above 95 % of initial wealth. On the one hand annuitization is attractive due to the additional wealth created by the mortality credit, {{on the other hand}} annuities are irreversible and the annuity menu is incomplete. We show that the additional wealth effect dominates, optimally individuals annuitize almost their entire wealth at retirement to capture the mortality credit. Whenever liquidity or equity exposure is desired, individuals save sizeable amounts out of their annuity income to smooth shocks due to background or inflation risk and/or to get equity exposure. We can identify this result, because we do not assume a priori that consump-tion equals annuity income in retirement and solve a dynamic programming problem for consumption and savings. Similarly, adding variable annuities to the menu does not increase welfare significantly, since indi...|$|E

There are commercial sales {{as well as a}} number of on-going and potential DOD projects. An extensive accounting model of the contractor is included. Corporate financial management involves the issuing the retiring of short- and long-term debt and equity in addition to the choice with respect to dividends and retained earnings. The inputs of the contractor include plant and equipment (both contractor and government supplied in T and E), engineering support labor (both contractor and government supplied in T and E). administrative labor, manufacturing labor, weapon system operators (both contractor and government supplied in T and E), material, purchased parts, subcontracted items, and government furnished items.

40|$|In {{the paper}} we analyze {{determinants}} {{of the capital}} market beta risk in Poland in the monthly period 1996 - 2002. The beta risk is measured as a time-varying parameter estimated in a regression of the Warsaw stock indexes (WIG and WIG 20 separately) on major foreign stock market indexes (DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX and FTSE). The individual monthly beta parameters time series are computed as structural regression parameters estimated for daily data in monthly sub-periods in regressions for WIG and WIG 20 indexes on individual foreign stock market indexes. The beta risk is an average of monthly individual beta parameters. We put forward a hypothesis that the estimated beta risk depends on monetary and real variables expressing the economic performance of the Polish economy. Hence, we build monetary and real factors models. As explanatory variables of risk, we examine: income, productivity, trade balance, budget deficit, interest rate and the zloty exchange rate. The risk factors are expressed as differentials relative to the world economy for which stands the U. S. economy. According to Fair and Shiller (1990), we test for relative one-period-ahead predictive performance of monetary and real factors models of capital market risk in Poland in the period 1999 - 2002.

This dissertation develops and examines the properties of a model of asset demand in an inflationary environment. The model is based on an extension of the mean-variance framework of portfolio selection. The extension to the model incorporates random inflation as an additional source of investment risk. The principal implication of the model is that investment demand consists of an ordinary (speculative) component and an inflation hedging component. A comparative statics analysis performed on the system of asset demand equations reveals that optimal investor response to changes in inflation risk involves investor attitudes toward risk and portfolio balance considerations. An important distinction based on the concept of inflation-risk aversion was drawn between aggressive and conservative inflation hedging behavior. The concept of inflation-risk aversion is defined as the Arrow-Pratt relative risk aversion measure less unity. The above distinction reveals the possibility that an individual investor could be averse to the risk associated with real productive opportunities {{and at the same time}} prefer to take on inflation <b>risk.</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>market</b> implications are drawn by aggregating individual asset demands. The capital asset pricing model under inflation uncertainty (CAPMUI) derived by other researchers is obtained in this study. Equilibrium expected rates of return on individual securities are seen to depend on three risk premiums based on asset systematic risk, inflation risk, and estimation risk. Estimation risk is due to the presence of noise in estimating the real rates of return. Inflation risk is due to the variability of the inflation rate in a model in which investors act on the basis of real returns...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Venture capital {{as a source of}} financing high technology, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is well established in the developed economies. Now, this activity is becoming a focus of attention in emerging markets. India has registered a significant growth in terms of the amount and number of venture capital funds. But there is no academic research to date, devoted to understanding how this new investor class behave through the investment cycle. This research is the first-ever investigation of how venture capitalists in India conduct the Valuation, Structuring and Monitoring of their investments. After introduction, the thesis presents an overview of the Indian economy, followed by its financial landscape. The third chapter covers a survey of the economic contribution that SMEs make and the funding problems they face, together with a review of the Indian venture capital sector. An extensive literature review on venture capital research follows. After finding the research gaps, a theoretical framework, based on the adverse selection, moral hazard, corporate governance, and the asymmetric information that characterises the <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> is used. Eight hypotheses are developed to test how venture capitalists address the adverse selection through (a) a variety of information sources used in preparing the valuation memorandum, and (b) applying various quantitative and qualitative methods to determine the realistic value. How do they address moral hazard by (a) using covenants in their deal structures, and (b) what financial products are used to minimise the risk? Finally, how frequently and extensively do they monitor their investee companies to overcome the information asymmetry and corporate governance problems? Data from 40 of the most active 42 venture capitalists operating in India were gathered. Then, the data were analysed using Chi Square, Cluster Analysis, ANOVA and Logistical Regression. The results present a descriptive profile of the Indian venture capital sector, including the characteristics of the fund management teams, the sectors and stages of investments and the tests of the hypotheses. This is followed by methodical statistical analysis by splitting the sample based on seven demographic characteristics. The final chapter includes the conclusion, recommendations and the implications of this research for the venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and regulators. Finally, future research areas are suggested that may further improve the understanding of the venture capital market in India...|$|E

It is shown that price volatility gives rise to high returns to flexibility which suggests that commodity exporting countries should regard price volatility as an opportunity to benefit by being flexible as well as a source of welfare costs. The empirical estimates show that many developing countries have had an inflexible response to changes in world prices over the period 1958 - 90. Flexibility may improve with the abolition of producer price stabilisation in many countries in the 1980 s, a policy reform that is predicted to yield large benefits.

40|$|The {{globalisation}} {{of relations}} between stock markets, issuers of shares and investors, has led to frequent reviews of national rules and regulations, by routes {{that are consistent with}} the culture, traditions and market conditions of each country. In fact, generally accepted principles of effectiveness of corporate governance have taken hold in the context of different models of governance, whose implementation is also linked to the share structure of the companies and the dynamics of <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> <b>markets.</b> In listed companies, a <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> orientation is conditioned by the dominance of an insider or outsider system, by the parties that appoint the governance organs (only the owners in Anglo-Saxon countries and most industrialised countries; the owners and employees in Germany and generally in the so-called ‘Rhenish’ model) and by the stakeholder that are represented in the administrative and supervisory organs. The expansion {{of relations between}} stock markets, the growth of parallel trading platforms and the spread of ICT certainly emphasises the relief of correct development of the administrative and supervisory activities typical of corporate governance, but it also underlines the importance of effective external controls (auditing carried out by the stock markets and by specific institutions), and consistent, transparent behaviour, associated with clear, verifiable and truthful communications...|$|R

In a closed economy the long-run behaviour of wealth is independent of the initial income distribution when there is aggregate uncertainty, although further restrictions are necessary {{when there is no}} aggregate uncertainty. There can be credit rationing at the long-run equilibrium. In poor economies aggregate <b>risk</b> in the <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> slows growth, whereas in richer economies a risky <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> is good for income growth...|$|R
