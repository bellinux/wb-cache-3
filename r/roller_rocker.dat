2500|$|In late 1999, several {{noteworthy}} {{changes for}} the P11 came as a refresh in the 2000 model year, when the 145 crank horsepower <b>roller</b> <b>rocker</b> variant of the SR20DE engine was implemented, newer automatic and manual transmission variations were introduced, anti-theft immobilizer circuitry was added, anti-glare side mirrors became standard, and a remote trunk release {{was added to the}} keyless entry fob. In 2001, the G20t was dropped and a Sport model was introduced. In addition to the prior G20t's limited slip differential and decklid spoiler, this model featured two-tone leather/suede sport seats, 16" [...] wheels, and a variety of minor cosmetic modifications.

2500|$|A [...] {{supercharged}} {{version of}} the smaller engine {{was added to the}} line-up in February 1987, using the world's first needle <b>roller</b> <b>rocker</b> arm assembly. This generation was badge engineered and was introduced to the Asian luxury car market as the Hyundai Grandeur, giving Hyundai a luxury sedan to shuttle foreign dignitaries during the 1988 Seoul Olympics. As Mitsubishi and Chrysler had a business relationship where automotive technology was being shared and used in both Chrysler and Mitsubishi products, this generation Debonair does have some superficial similarities with the Chrysler New Yorker of the same time period. The Debonair's platform, however, shares nothing with the Chrysler [...] "E", [...] "Y", or [...] "K" [...] platforms. The suspension was upgraded to MacPherson struts for the front suspension, and the rear suspension used a three-link torsion axle. The only transmission available was a four-speed automatic unit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>rockers</b> {{can also}} be used in {{overhead}} cam engines. However, OHC <b>roller</b> <b>rockers</b> generally have the roller {{at the point where the}} cam lobe contacts the rocker rather than at the point where the rocker contacts the valve stem. This helps to reduce cam lobe friction and wear in the same way as roller lifters on pushrod engines.|$|R

50|$|The Honda K series {{engine is}} a four-cylinder {{four-stroke}} engine introduced in 2001. The K series engines {{are equipped with}} DOHC valvetrains and use <b>roller</b> <b>rockers</b> to reduce friction. The engines use a coil-on-plug, distributorless ignition system with a coil for each spark plug. This system forgoes {{the use of a}} conventional distributor-based ignition timing system in favor of a computer-controlled system that allows the ECU to control ignition timings based on various sensor inputs. The cylinders have cast iron sleeves similar to the B-series & F-series engines, as opposed to the FRM cylinders found in the H-series and newer F series engines found only in the Honda S2000.|$|R

50|$|The all-new 1NR-VE engine {{features}} dual variable-valve timing with intelligence (VVT-i) on both {{intake and exhaust}} valves. Additionally, the 1NR-VE features longer ports in its intake system for improved low- and mid-range torque, and a low-friction <b>roller</b> <b>rocker</b> arm-based valvetrain for improved fuel efficiency.|$|E

5000|$|Ford's 5.9 L V12 {{version of}} its Duratec engine {{is used in the}} present Aston Martin lineup. [...] It is best thought of as two 3.0 L Duratec V6s mated end to end, albeit with {{slightly}} larger main journals. The regular Aston Martin V12 uses <b>roller</b> <b>rockers</b> (RFF), and was designed by Ford and Cosworth. [...] Cosworth assembled the V12 engines for a year before Aston Martin took over production. [...] However, Cosworth still casts the heads and blocks. [...] The variant used in the Aston Martin One-77 uses (DLC coated) DAMB cam followers like the later Duratec engines, and is built by Cosworth.|$|R
50|$|The K-Series engines {{have two}} {{different}} types of i-VTEC systems implemented for K20A2/K20Z3 engines and K20A3/K24A4 engines. The first is for the K20A2/K20Z3 performance engines like in the 2002-2006 RSX Type S or the 2006-2010 Civic Si and the other is for the K24A4 economy engines found in the CR-V or Accord. The performance i-VTEC system is basically the same as the DOHC VTEC system of the B16A's; both intake and exhaust have 3 cam lobes per cylinder. However, the valvetrain has the added benefit of <b>roller</b> <b>rockers</b> and continuously variable intake cam timing. Performance i-VTEC is a combination of conventional DOHC VTEC with VTC (which operates for intake valves only). The VTC is available in the economy and performance i-VTEC engines.|$|R
50|$|The engine, {{although}} {{rated at}} five litres and , was specially made to withstand racing conditions. The block was specially cast and crankcase was fitted with four bolt main bearing caps. The heads were revised with high-flow intake ports and <b>roller</b> <b>rockers.</b> Special connecting rods, crankshafts, and pistons were fitted {{as well as}} a custom exhaust. The key feature though was the fabled Walkinshaw twin throttle body inlet manifold, which had been specially developed for the Group A and featured sequential setup with a smaller and larger throttle body. This was fitted with a restrictor plate on the larger, secondary throttle body, which actually let less air through than the smaller throttle body. Some reports have indicated that as much as 50-60 horsepower can be gained from the removal of the restrictor plates.|$|R
5000|$|The DOHC ECC 2.0 {{produces}} [...] SAE at 6500 rpm with [...] {{of torque}} at 4800 rpm. It has a cast iron engine block and aluminum DOHC cylinder head. It uses SFI (sequential fuel injection), has 4 valves per cylinder with <b>roller</b> <b>rocker</b> arms and features fracture-split forged powder metal connecting rods, a one-piece cast camshaft, and an aluminum intake manifold.|$|E
50|$|The {{cast-iron}} {{heads were}} designed with hemispherical combustion chambers {{and a single}} overhead camshaft over each head, operating shaft-mounted <b>roller</b> <b>rocker</b> arms. The valvetrain consisted of valves larger than those on Ford wedge head engines, made out of stainless steel and with sodium-filled exhaust valves to prevent the valve heads from burning, and dual valve springs. This design allowed for high volumetric efficiency at high engine speed.|$|E
5000|$|The fuel {{consumption}} figure of [...] has {{been attributed to}} the low number of moving parts in the engine: The oil pump is driven by the balance shaft, while the camshaft also drives the water pump. [...] The design also resulted in water hoses that are 30% shorter. [...] The pistons are resin-coated and lightweight aluminum material is used for the friction-reducing <b>roller</b> <b>rocker</b> arm.|$|E
50|$|The AR series uses a {{die-cast}} aluminium engine block and aluminium DOHC cylinder head. The engine series shares {{many of the}} technologies in the AZ engine, while incorporating new features such as variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust camshafts or dual VVT-i, low friction technologies including an offset crankshaft, <b>roller</b> <b>rockers</b> for the valvetrain, a three-stage variable oil pump, reduced-tension piston rings and auxiliary belt drive. An Acoustic Control Induction System switches {{the length of the}} intake tract in two stages, based on rpm and throttle angle, thereby ensuring strong torque across a broad engine speed range. New tumble control valves enhances combustion while the engine is cold, and helps to bring the catalytic converters up to working temperature quickly. The Tumble control valves, along with new 12-hole high atomizing long-nozzle fuel injectors, reduce the amount of fuel adhering to the intake ports and therefore maximize fuel economy and reduce harmful emissions.|$|R

Some versions have {{variable valve timing}} (VVT). The camshafts are toothed belt-driven. The 1750 TBi gasoline and 16V Multijet diesel engines feature hydraulic tappets with <b>roller</b> <b>rocker</b> arms.|$|E
50|$|Valves {{are driven}} by roller-follower rocker arms with low {{friction}} roller bearings, and a unique, concave cam lobe design to increase valve lift over the traditional shimless lifter type system of the 1GR-FE. This increases overall cylinder head height to accommodate the slightly taller <b>roller</b> <b>rocker</b> system. Moreover, the cylinder head is segmented into 3 parts: valve cover, camshaft sub-assembly housing, and cylinder head sub-assembly. As such, this valvetrain is used across all other GR engines with Dual VVT-i. Its service weight is 163 kg.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Today, we {{are seeing}} change in the {{manufacturing}} process of mechanis-ms as a multi-purpose device with the dra-matic growth of technology. It both helps in saving space {{and the cost of}} the product decreases considerably. Today, due to the cost of providing places for jobs, smaller and more compact multifunctional devices are designed. The proposed device is a du-al-use Laboratory Mixer. This device is designed for mixing liquid with determined viscosity, which has various options to enh-ance the quality and comfort of the operator. Materials & Methods: The device uses a combination of two methods while the process of mixing is separate in other devic-es, i. e. the mixer device is either radial or oscillating. One of the importing points {{in the design of the}} device is that both systems are combined in one device and it is equi-pped with control and timing speed system. So far, the <b>roller</b> or <b>Rocker</b> device have not been made and designed in Iran and they are built for the first time. Their main use is for professional mixing experiments in the laboratory of Immunology and medical diagnostics. Findings: The results of the electrical and mechanical performance of the device are acceptable according to the inventions used in various parts and it is economical. Discussion & Conclusion: We could sig-nifycantly reduce blood clots while it is mixing up by designing the angle of the device. This problem is the result of blood into the vial with the vial cap that causes the so-called "lysis". Another achievement of this device is the combining of both the <b>roller</b> and <b>Rocker</b> devices which provides new mixing meth-ods in the lab for operator...|$|R
