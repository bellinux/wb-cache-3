40|$|High tunnels are {{a form of}} {{protected}} agriculture that aids in season extension by creating a favorable microclimate using trapped solar heat. Tunnel structure {{is similar to a}} simple greenhouse, usually comprised of stretched plastic over a large <b>ribbed</b> <b>frame.</b> High tunnels are used extensively around the world for the production of high value crops. In 2010, the USDA-NRCS initiated a high tunnel funding program that aided in the erection of 4, 500 new high tunnels across the U. S. in 2010 and 2011. As high tunnel use continues to rise, basic research is needed in this production system to investigate its effectiveness and begin developing specialized IPM solutions to pest-related problems. This study involved production of three crops: tomato, broccoli, and cucumber in three high tunnels as well as three comparison field plots over the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Season extension, yield, and fruit quality (size and marketability) were compared among traditional field plots and three different production systems within the tunnels: traditional black plastic mulch, containerized soilless production, and rockwool; however, the rockwool system was quickly abandoned after several failed attempts to maintain plant quality. Season extension was the most dramatic for tomatoes—fruit was harvested in the high tunnels more than two months before the field. Tomato size was also larger in the tunnels and there was a greater percentage of marketable fruit compared to the field. Conversely yield was not significantly different between production systems in the tunnel and the field for tomatoes. There {{was no significant difference in}} the broccoli or cucumber size between the high tunnel and the field; however, high tunnel yield was significantly greater for cucumbers and broccoli. There was no significant difference in the cucumber marketability, but broccoli marketability was significantly higher in the field. The containerized soilless production within the tunnel showed no significant advantages [...] decreased yields, smaller fruit, and lower fruit marketability. Pest density was also compared between the high tunnel and the field. Greenhouse pests were more prevalent in the high tunnels throughout the season. Common field pests such as hornworms and cucumber beetles were not significantly different between the high tunnel and the field; however the crucifer caterpillar complex including imported cabbageworms, diamond back moths, and cabbage loopers was significantly denser within the high tunnels. Multiple insecticide treatments were made in the high tunnels for various pests throughout the season. These results show that pest density is not significantly different in high tunnels compared to the field—implementing integrated pest management techniques is necessary in high tunnels just as it is in the field; however components may need optimized for this specialized form of production. Further research should aid in developing IPM decision making protocols for high tunnel producers. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for automated generation of fully connected finite-element meshes for all internal structural components and skins of a given wing-body geometry model, controlled by a few conceptual-level structural layout parameters. Internal structural components include spars, <b>ribs,</b> <b>frames,</b> and bulkheads. Structural layout parameters include spar/rib locations in wing chordwise/spanwise direction and frame/bulkhead locations in longitudinal direction. A simple shell thickness optimization problem with two load conditions is used to verify versatility and robustness of the automated meshing process. The automation process is implemented in ModelCenter starting from an OpenVSP geometry and ending with a NASTRAN 200 solution. One subsonic configuration and one supersonic configuration are used for numerical verification. Two different structural layouts are constructed for each configuration and five finite-element meshes of different sizes are generated for each layout.

Plank framed barns developed in the American Mid-West, such as the patente in 1876 (#185,690) by William Morris and Joseph Slanser of La Rue, Ohio shows (several other patents followed). Sometimes they were also called a joist <b>frame,</b> <b>rib</b> <b>frame</b> and trussed frame barns.

The reduction in availability of timber for barn building and experience with scantling framing resulted {{in the development of}} this lightweight barn framing using planks (“joists”) rather than timbers. Some stated advantages: cheaper, faster, no interior posts needed, use any length lumber, less skill, less lumber (either purchased or self-produced), “stronger”, lighter, all lumber can be purchased from a lumber yard, less labor, heavy timber getting scarce. Also, they were often similar to the Jennings barn design of 1879 (patent #218,031) with no tie beam so there were no beams to interfere with a hay fork (horse fork) on a track system (hay carrier) for pitching hay which became popular c. 1877. The gambrel roof shape lends itself to plank truss construction and became the most popular roof type. Plank frame barns were available by mail-order by 1910 from Chicago.

40|$|Abstract: The Institute of Vehicle Concepts is {{developing}} a safe, modularisable vehicle concept in <b>rib</b> and space <b>frame</b> design for tomorrow’s vehicles with alternative power trains. The vehicle can be powered either by a fuel cell system, a free-piston linear generator developed at the DLR, or a traction battery. Taking into account the given boundary conditions, {{the challenge is to}} design a body structure that is light and performs well {{in the event of an}} accident. The <b>rib</b> and space <b>frame</b> concept for the vehicle body has a crash compartment in the floor to hold alternative power train components. Crash elements made from carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) are inserted between the crash compartment, formed by two continuous side members, and the outer rocker panels. The body consists of three annular ribs made of fibre-reinforced plastic, which are joined by means of simple geometric profiles or cast nodes. In a second design, support structures are integrated into the vehicle that significantly increase weight-specific energy absorption by means of systematic elongation. The crash compartment serves to ensure that there is no danger by the alternative power trains, in this case particularly the energy storage systems, during an accident. In the event of a side impact, the annular ribs protect the passengers by keeping the survival space intact. Furthermore, the use of composite structures reduces the weight of the vehicle body considerably compared to a reference structure with the same level of safety. In the case of extreme local strain arising from a pole collision, hybrid support structures consisting of a foam core and a metal profile reduce intrusion into the passenger compartment. Suitable materials are particularly metals with a high degree of weight-specific strength and elasticity such as stainless steel or the newly developed manganese steel, but also aluminium alloys with high elasticity. The B-rib, which takes the most strain, is available as a structure tested for side impact as defined by Euro NCAP, and will shortly be subjected to the American IIHS test. Hybrid support structures for different combinations of materials were also tested at component level. The space frame is being constructed as a digital prototype on which different subsystems can be examined virtually in terms of energy absorption and their effect on the vehicle mass. The lecture will discuss the simulation results and prototype tests for the B-rib and the hybrid support structures, as well as the current status of <b>rib</b> and space <b>frame</b> construction. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{some ways}} the birlinn paralleled the more robust ocean-going craft of Norse design. Viking ships were double-ended, with a keel scarfed to stems fore and aft. A shell of thin {{planking}} (strake) was constructed {{on the basis of}} the keel, the planks being edge-joined and clenched with iron nails. Symmetrical <b>ribs</b> or <b>frames</b> were then lashed to the strakes or secured with trenails. Over most of the ribs was laid a slender crossbeam and a thwart. The mast was stepped amidships or nearly so, and oars, including a steering oar, were also used. The stem and stern post sometimes had carefully carved notches for plank ends, with knees securing the thwarts to the strakes and beams joining the heads of the frames. The hull bore a general resemblance to the Norse pattern, but stem and stern may have been more steeply pitched (though allowance must be paid for distortion in representation).

Rolls containing ISP exhibited significantly higher cooked yield than rolls without ISP. Rolls containing ISP and 10 or 20 % MDM exhibited higher cooked yield than rolls with ISP and 0 % MDM. As level of MDM increased from 0 to 20 % the rolls became darker, redder, and more yellow, as determined by objective color measurements. Color attributes of saturation and hue signifi-cantly decreased as MDM level increased, and total color difference values increased as level of MDM increased. Sensory data (untrained sight panel) confirmed that rolls became significantly darker as MDM level increased. The objective and sensory textural attributes of hardness, cohesive-ness, and chewiness decreased as level of MDM increased. Positive significant correlation coefficients between objective and sensory data for hardness and chewiness indicate agreement between the Instron and panel...|$|R

Nails and trenails have not been used in this ship to secure frames to keel. The keel is made of beech, but the rest of the ship is made of oak, although no reason for this has yet been suggested. One possible explanation is a simple shortage of oak compared with beech at the time of construction. Almost all woodworking on the ship has been done using axes and adzes, with saw marks found on only a few timbers.|$|R
