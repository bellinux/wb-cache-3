40|$|A {{model for}} the spark gap in spark {{machining}} with relaxation generators is proposed. The model employs a thyristor and a voltage source. This {{is used to calculate}} the minimum charging resistance of the <b>relaxation</b> <b>generator</b> for various supply voltages. Experimental values agree with the theoretical predictions...|$|E
40|$|The near {{threshold}} "soft breakdown" {{measurements of}} PVC films conductivity are investigated. In {{a wide range}} of external electric field strength for various rather thick (> 20 mkm) PVC films the resistance shows strong nonlinearity and seems to enter high conductive state close to the breakdown threshold. For our "thick" films boundary conditions electrode surface specifics should not be so important as in thin polymer films experiments. Both fast, instant mechanisms of nonlinearity, and effects of accumulation and delay responce were observed. The phenomena corresponding to reversible transitions in a state with rather high conductivity, seems to be similar to ones registered earlier in thin layers of some broad-bandgap polymers. In a range of relatively low field intensity, far from a threshold breakdown, as a result of reversible switches between normal and high resistivity states a polymer film in a standard measuring cell formed a <b>relaxation</b> <b>generator</b> giving a loud enough sound signal with frequency increasing with the increase of external field.

40|$|Micro-Electrical Discharge Machining (- EDM) {{means the}} {{modification}} of process technologies and machine tools for the manufacturing of micro and miniature parts and structures [1 - 3]. Compared to conventional die sinking EDM the relative wear can rise {{up to more}} than 30 %, especially when <b>relaxation</b> <b>generators</b> are used. To achieve shape accuracies in the range of a few microns, it is common to use several tool electrodes for roughing and finishing. In order to reduce the wear and therewith the number of tool electrodes and to enhance the machining results, coated electrodes can be applied. The paper presents results of investigations on wear behaviour of various coatings on tool electrode materials...|$|R

40|$|Many {{problems}} in computer vision {{can be turned}} into a large-scale boolean optimization problem, which is in general NP-hard. In this paper, we further develop {{one of the most successful}} approaches, namely roof duality, for approximately solving such problems for higher-order models. Two new methods that can be applied independently or in combination are investigated. The first one is based on constructing <b>relaxations</b> using <b>generators</b> of the submodular function cone. In the second method, it is shown that the roof dual bound can be applied in an iterated way in order to obtain a tighter relaxation. We also provide experimental results that demonstrate better performance with respect to the state-of-the-art, both in terms of improved bounds and the number of optimally assigned variables...|$|R
