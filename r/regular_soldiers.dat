5|$|The French {{response}} to the impending British invasion was to mobilise the island's 10,000 strong militia. Despite their large numbers, this force was untrained, poorly armed and poorly motivated. Decaen himself recognised {{that they would be}} unreliable in the face of attack by British <b>regular</b> <b>soldiers.</b> He also bolstered his forces by attempting to recruit volunteers from among the hundreds of prisoners of war held in the island's prisons (a principal cause of the food shortages on Isle de France). Over 500 volunteers agreed to join his army, the majority of them Irishmen promised French assistance in obtaining Irish independence from Britain. Altogether, Decaen could muster 1,300 <b>regular</b> <b>soldiers</b> to defend the capital, which he placed under the command of General Edmé-Martin Vandermaesen.|$|E
5|$|The {{departure}} of regular units under Ramorino and Łubieński depleted {{the forces of}} the defenders, further weakening the crew manning the first line of defence.

5|$|Although {{the main}} focus of Australia's {{military}} during World War I was overseas in Europe and the Middle East, there was still a necessity to maintain troops in Australia on home service to carry out a number of essential tasks.

5|$|By mid-December 1963, Indonesian {{had sent}} a {{commando}} unit consisting of 128 volunteers and 35 <b>regular</b> <b>soldiers</b> to Sebatik. Their aim was to take Kalabakan, then invade Tawau and Sandakan. On 29 December 1963, the Indonesian unit attacked the 3rd Royal Malay Regiment unit. The Indonesians managed to throw several grenades into the totally unprepared Malay Regiment's sleeping quarters. The attack resulted in eight Malay soldiers being killed and nineteen wounded. Malaysian armed police eventually drove the attackers north after a two-hour battle.|$|E

5|$|In March 1939, Robertson was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 7th Military District, which encompassed the Northern Territory. It was his first command since the First World War. He was promoted to the temporary rank of colonel in August 1939, and this became substantive in November. The job involved cooperation with the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force, and the administration of a company of <b>regular</b> <b>soldiers</b> known as the Darwin Mobile Force. After the Second World War began in September 1939, Robertson became responsible for supplying the 7th Military District's quota of volunteers for the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF). A strike on the waterfront saw Robertson committing troops to help unload cargo.|$|E
5|$|Local {{defense in}} I Corps was {{provided}} by 50 battalions and five companies of Regional and Popular Forces, and six companies of military police. Support for ground forces in the area {{came in the form}} of the 1st Air Force Division (commanded by Brigadier-General Nguyen Van Khanh), with two naval squadrons operating on the coast and another two along the rivers. Overall, I Corps fielded about 134,000 soldiers; 84,000 were <b>regular</b> <b>soldiers</b> and 50,000 belonged to the Regional and Popular Forces. Those forces were equipped with 449 tanks and armored vehicles, 418 artillery pieces, 64 M-42 Duster light air-defense weapons, 373 aircraft of different types, and 165 naval vessels of different sizes.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{landed at}} Lyme Regis on 11 June 1685.

With a force of about 400 regulars and 900 militiamen, the Americans crossed the Wisconsin River on July 27 and resumed the pursuit of the British Band. The British Band was moving slow, {{encumbered}} with wounded warriors and people dying of starvation. The Americans followed the trail of dead bodies, cast off equipment, and the remains of horses the hungry Natives had eaten.|$|E
5|$|In August 1704, an Anglo-Dutch {{invasion}} force sailed {{into the}} Bay of Gibraltar and rapidly overcame the poorly manned garrison. Don Diego de Salinas, the last Spanish governor of Gibraltar, had repeatedly {{called for the}} garrison and fortifications to be strengthened, but to no avail. When Admiral George Rooke's fleet carried out the capture of Gibraltar, his 350 guns were opposed by only 80 iron and 32 brass cannon of various calibres in Gibraltar. Most of the Spanish guns were not even manned. De Salinas only had about 150 <b>regular</b> <b>soldiers,</b> very few of whom were gunners, and about 250 armed civilians. Gibraltar fell after only four days of fighting. A Franco-Spanish army laid siege shortly afterwards {{and was able to}} inflict substantial damage on the old Spanish fortifications, which crumbled under the constant pounding. However, the Anglo-Dutch garrison was able to repair the worst of the damage and repelled Franco-Spanish attacks while being resupplied and reinforced by sea. After eight months the French and Spanish abandoned the twelfth siege of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to external pressure, domestic policies {{implemented by the}} Vietnamese Government since 1975 had proven to be largely ineffective in stimulating the country’s economic growth. By building on the Soviet model of central economic planning, Vietnam placed most emphasis {{on the development of}} heavy industries, while production in agriculture and light manufacturing sectors stagnated. Furthermore, attempts to nationalise the economy of southern Vietnam after reunification only resulted in chaos, as economic output were driven down by dislocation of the general population. In {{addition to}} those failed economic policies, Vietnam maintained the fifth largest armed forces in the world, with 1.26 million <b>regular</b> <b>soldiers</b> under arms, 180,000 of whom were stationed in Cambodia in 1984. Consequently, the Vietnamese Government had to spend one-third of its budget on the military and the campaign in Kampuchea, despite receiving $1.2 billion in military aid annually from the Soviet Union, thus further hampering Vietnam’s economic rebuilding efforts.|$|E

5|$|The Cape Colony was {{administered}} from two towns, the larger Cape Town {{on the wide}} Table Bay facing west and smaller Simon's Town on False Bay facing south. Neither bay was sheltered from Atlantic storms and both were notoriously dangerous, with winds, currents and rocks posing considerable threats to shipping. Beyond its importance as a resupply port for East Indies shipping the colony had little economic value in the 1790s, and was defended by a garrison of approximately 1,000 Dutch <b>regular</b> <b>soldiers</b> supplemented by Boer militia and local Khoikhoi units, commanded by General Abraham Josias Sluysken and Colonel Robert Jacob Gordon, in total around 3,600 troops. This garrison was centered on the Castle of Good Hope and operated {{from a series of}} coastal fortifications which protected Table Bay. False Bay was more weakly defended, covered by only two lightly armed batteries.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdists in the trenches, {{equipped}} with outdated rifles and makeshift ammunition, designed {{to wait until}} Hunter's forces were well within range to open fire. The entrenched Mahdists weathered the continual barrage of the advancing forces until the distance shrunk to one hundred yards. Together, the Mahdist line erupted in rifle fire, hammering the advancing battalions and, in particular, the stationary 10th Sudanese. Two British officers, Brevet-Major Henry Sidney and Lieutenant Edward Fitzclarence, three Egyptian officers, and a dozen <b>regular</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{were killed in the}} volleys. Over fifty were wounded across the brigade. Following this exchange, the battalions abandoned their orderly approach and charged the trenches with their bayonets. A furious melee ensued, wherein soldiers of MacDonald's brigade poured into the trenches and through the town, engaging in vicious hand-to-hand combat with Mahdists wherever they were {{to be found in the}} winding alleyways and narrow houses of Abu Hamed. In several places artillery was used to dislodge particularly stalwart defenders, while the Mahdist cavalry, looking on as Hunter's battalions swept through the town, turned to flee south towards Berber.|$|E
5|$|With the {{surrender}} of Fort Desaix, British forces solidified their occupation of the island of Martinique. The remaining shipping and military supplies were seized and the <b>regular</b> <b>soldiers</b> of the garrison taken as prisoners of war. The militia were disbanded and Martinique became a British colony, remaining under British command until {{the restoration of the}} French monarchy in 1814, when it was returned to French control. British losses in the campaign were heavy, with 97 killed, 365 wounded and 18 missing. French total losses are uncertain but the garrison suffered at least 900 casualties, principally in the fighting in the central highlands on 1 and 2 February and during the siege of Fort Desaix. Upon his return to France, Villaret's conduct was condemned by an inquiry council; he requested in vain a Court-martial to clear his name, and lived in disgrace for two years.|$|E
