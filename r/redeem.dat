5|$|In 1825, {{following}} the disruption the group were experiencing, Shapira travelled to Europe once again. He hoped {{to secure the}} necessary firman, which would place the courtyard firmly in the Perushim's possession, and also to raise funds {{to cover the costs}} incurred trying to <b>redeem</b> the courtyard. His mission, however, was unsuccessful, as was a later mission attempted in 1829 by Zoref.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} {{concerned}} United States Notes (commonly called greenbacks), {{a form of}} fiat currency first issued during the Civil War. The government accepted these notes as valid for payment of taxes and tariffs, but unlike ordinary dollars, they were not redeemable in gold. The Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 required the treasury to <b>redeem</b> any outstanding greenbacks in gold, thus retiring them from circulation and restoring a single, gold-backed currency. Sherman agreed with Hayes's favorable opinion of the Act, and stockpiled gold {{in preparation for the}} exchange of greenbacks for gold. Once the public was confident that they could <b>redeem</b> greenbacks for specie (gold), however, few did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were actually redeemed. Together with the Bland–Allison Act, the successful specie resumption effected a workable compromise between inflationists and hard money men and, as the world economy began to improve, agitation for more greenbacks and silver coinage quieted down for the rest of Hayes's term in office.|$|E

50|$|A digital ticket {{always has}} certain value {{that could be}} <b>redeemed</b> at service provider. Normally after <b>redeeming,</b> the ticket is cleaned. Some tickets work for a period, and will only be deleted after this period. In the special case when the ticket isn't given away after <b>redeeming,</b> it is called a pass.|$|R
50|$|Points can be <b>redeemed</b> {{for free}} {{groceries}} or other rewards. Points may be <b>redeemed</b> once a customer has 20,000 points or more banked (1,000 points = 1). Customers {{must also have}} a second form of payment once points are <b>redeemed</b> (as customers can only use points in multiples of 10,000, depending on the total or amount of points the customer has banked). Points may not be <b>redeemed</b> for items such as alcohol, tobacco, lottery tickets, prescription medication and milk in Quebec.|$|R
5|$|The three-cent nickel {{piece was}} very popular when it entered {{circulation}} in mid-1865. More convenient than the larger two-cent bronze piece, it largely replaced that coin, starting the two-cent {{on its way}} to decreased popularity and abolition in 1873. The hard alloy, though, caused high levels of die breakage. Between 1865 and 1876, some 17 million three-cent pieces were used by the government to <b>redeem</b> the three-cent fractional currency notes.|$|E
5|$|Vistara uses Club Vistara as its frequent-flyer program; it {{operates}} as a value based program and awards points {{on the basis of}} money spent on tickets rather that miles travelled by passengers. On 29 January 2015, Vistara announced a partnership agreement with Singapore Airlines (SIA) which would allow Club Vistara members to earn and <b>redeem</b> miles with the KrisFlyer program on SIA and Silk Air flights and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|After some time, Kate speaks at an AA meeting, celebrating {{one year}} of sobriety, while Charlie gets in trouble for riding a bicycle while drunk. Kate visits Charlie and they play croquet. Charlie asks if she would move back in with him if he begins going to AA meetings. Kate says he must get sober for himself, not for her. Charlie then asks Kate to play another round, {{to give him a}} chance to <b>redeem</b> himself. The film ends before Kate gives her answer.|$|E
5000|$|The redbacks {{and change}} notes were <b>redeemed</b> and cut-cancelled. The notes were cut-cancelled {{to keep them}} from going out the back door and coming back in the front door to be <b>redeemed</b> again. These notes are highly sought after by collectors. A few notes were never <b>redeemed</b> or cut-cancelled; those notes are valued more highly.|$|R
50|$|The NTIA said 4,287,379 coupons {{had been}} {{requested}} but not <b>redeemed.</b> As of August 12, $310,796,690 was available, {{and if all}} requested coupons were <b>redeemed,</b> $139,300,174 would be left.|$|R
5000|$|In some countries, {{the prizes}} and chances, {{and hence the}} average {{interest}} rate, is a fixed property of the bond from issue until it is <b>redeemed,</b> making them more predictable as investments. When the prizes and chances of each bond are fixed, <b>redeemed</b> bonds stay in the lottery, but the issuer gets to keep prizes drawn to <b>redeemed</b> or unsold bonds.|$|R
5|$|After the Camp returned, Smith drew {{heavily from}} its {{participants}} to establish five governing {{bodies in the}} church, all originally of equal authority to check one another. Among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles. Smith gave a revelation saying that to <b>redeem</b> Zion, his followers would have to receive an endowment in the Kirtland Temple, and in March 1836, at the temple's dedication, many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels, spoke in tongues, and prophesied.|$|E
5|$|Both Internazionale and Celtic {{had been}} {{performing}} well domestically throughout the season. Only {{a few days}} before the final Internazionale had been on the verge of winning a historic treble but losses in their last two games knocked them out of the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia and cost them the Scudetto. The European Cup was the last chance for them to <b>redeem</b> what had initially been such a promising season. Celtic came into the final having already won the First Division, the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup as well as the Glasgow Cup earlier in the season.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} at a general meeting on 22 March 1895 that the club could finally {{afford to buy}} Goodison Park. Mahon revealed that Everton were buying Goodison Park for £650 less than the price of Anfield three years earlier, with Goodison Park having more land and a 25% larger capacity. The motion to purchase Goodison Park was passed unanimously. Dr. Baxter also lent the club £5,000 to <b>redeem</b> the mortgage early {{at a rate of}} 3½%. By this time the redrawing of political boundaries put Walton, and hence Goodison Park, inside the City of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Numerous anime and manga {{publications}} have {{commented on}} Gaara's character. Multiple series called Naruto's fight against Gaara {{the high point}} of the entire series due to their similarities and Gaara's role in the aftermath as he attempts to <b>redeem</b> himself.

5000|$|Mimouna celebrates {{belief in}} both the past Jewish {{redemption}} from the Egyptians and the future Messianic redemption: [...] "In Nisan (the month in which Passover falls), the Jews were <b>redeemed</b> and in Nisan they will be <b>redeemed</b> in the future. When Passover ends and the Jews are still not <b>redeemed,</b> the Moroccan Jews do not lose their faith; as the Sages said: 'Even if he tarries, I will expect him every day.'" ...|$|R

50|$|Under {{commodity}} standards currency {{itself has}} no intrinsic value, but is accepted by traders {{because it can}} be <b>redeemed</b> any time for the equivalent specie. A US silver certificate, for example, could be <b>redeemed</b> for an actual piece of silver.|$|R
5|$|Plymouth Argyle {{came close}} to making their opponents pay for their profligacy in front of goal with Evans lifting a volley over the crossbar. Darlington's captain Andy Crosby was {{proving to be a}} {{formidable}} figure at the heart of his team's defence, but Argyle fashioned another chance to open the scoring just before half-time. A flick on by Evans presented Adrian Littlejohn with the opportunity to <b>redeem</b> his earlier miss, but he dragged his shot wide.|$|E
5|$|The Diet of 1468 {{authorized}} Matthias to levy {{an extraordinary}} tax {{to finance the}} new war, but only after 8 prelates and 13 secular lords pledged on the King's behalf {{that he would not}} demand such charges in the future. Matthias also exercised royal prerogatives to increase his revenues. For instance, he ordered a Palatine's eyre in a county, the cost of which were to be covered by the local inhabitants but soon authorized the county to <b>redeem</b> the cancellation of this irksome duty.|$|E
5|$|The Steam store also enables {{users to}} <b>redeem</b> store product keys to add {{software}} from their library. The keys are sold by third-party providers such as Humble Bundle (in which {{a portion of}} the sale is given back to the publisher or distributor), distributed as part of a physical release to <b>redeem</b> the game, or given to a user as part of promotions, often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowd funding rewards. A grey market exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these keys to users or other third-party sites at a higher price, generating profit for themselves. This caused some of these third-party sites, like G2A, to be embroiled in this grey market. It is possible for publishers to have Valve to track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user's libraries, leaving the user to seek any recourse with the third-party they purchased from. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, have set a minimum price that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases that would enter the grey market.|$|E

5|$|The {{continued}} imprisonment of French soldiers was a {{major theme}} in the Vichy propaganda. Prisoners of war featured in the programme of moral rejuvenation promised {{as part of the}} Révolution nationale (National Revolution). A recurring idea was the idea of prisoners of war as martyrs or penitents, suffering in order to <b>redeem</b> France from its pre-war excesses. The period of detainment was therefore depicted as a form of purification which would overcome internal divides within France and atone for the defeat of 1940.|$|E
5|$|The crisis {{point for}} the UERL was the need to <b>redeem</b> the five-year {{profit-sharing}} secured notes on 30 June 1908. The UERL {{did not have the}} money. Speyer unsuccessfully tried to persuade the London County Council (LCC) to inject £5million into the UERL and used some of his own bank's money to pay-off disgruntled shareholders threatening bankruptcy proceedings. Eventually, Speyer and Gibb managed to obtain agreement from the shareholders to convert the notes into long-term debt to be repaid in 1933 and 1948.|$|E
