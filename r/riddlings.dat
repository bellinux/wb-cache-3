Alden Mason’s 1914 – 15 {{field trip}} to Puerto Rico {{resulted}} in a vast collection of songs, riddles, and folktales, published regularly over the next fourteen years in the Journal of American Folklore. The rich harvest of tales included some seventy Juan Bobo stories. “Juan Bobo and the <b>Riddling</b> Princess,” like many other Puerto Rican märchen, is a composite. Translating the story presented interesting challenges. I had to try for a storyteller’s voice in English that would match the inspired silliness of the narrative voice in Spanish. The key word in the story, adivinar, defied translation. Puerto Rican idioms and the riddles themselves presented further challenges...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{systems have}} {{typically}} {{more than one}} attractor, either periodic or chaotic, and their basin structure ultimately determines the final-state predictability. When certain symmetries exist in the phase space, their basins of attraction may be riddled, {{which means that they}} are so densely intertwined that it may be virtually impossible to determine the final state, given a finite uncertainty in the determination of the initial conditions. <b>Riddling</b> occurs in a variety of complex systems of physical and biological interest. We review the mathematical conditions for riddling to occur, and present two illustrative examples of this phenomenon: coupled Lorenz-like piecewise-linear maps and a deterministic model for competitive indeterminacy in populations of flour beetles...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the parametric evolution of riddled basins related to synchronization of chaos in two coupled piecewise-linear Lorenz maps. <b>Riddling</b> {{means that the}} basin of the synchronized attractor is shown to be riddled with holes belonging to another basin in an arbitrarily fine scale, which has serious consequences on the predictability of the final state for such a coupled system. We found that there are wide parameter intervals for which two piecewise-linear Lorenz maps exhibit riddled basins (globally or locally), which indicates that there are riddled basins in coupled Lorenz equations, as previously suggested by numerical experiments. The use of piecewise-linear maps {{makes it possible to}} prove rigorously the mathematical requirements for the existence of riddled basins. Comment: 22 pages (preprint format), 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{definition}} for riddling of subset V of R m with nonzero Lebesgue measure {{and show that}} is appropriate for large class of dynamical systems. We introduce {{the concept of a}} weak attractor, a weaker notion than a Milnor attractor and use this to reexamine and classify riddled basins of attractors. We find that basins of attraction can be partially riddled but {{if this is the case}} then any partial riddling must appear locally to the attractor. We use these concepts to aid classification of bifurcations of attractors from invariant subspaces. In particular, our weak attractor is a generalization of the absorbing area investigated by other authors and we suggest that a transition of a basin to riddling is usually associated with loss of stability of a weak attractor.

40|$|Abstract: A riddle is an {{important}} genre of oral literature. <b>Riddling</b> as a game requires mastery and manipulation of language. The game is played through obscuring the subject in order to challenge the answerer. In this study, we examined the morphology, syntax and functions of Kilba folk riddles. The theory of systemic Linguistics was adopted for the study. The syntagmatic and Paradigmatic relations were examined. In addition, the analytic and synthetic approaches were used to investigate the structures of the words. The outcome of the analysis revealed that almost all {{the different types of}} sentence are prevalent in the structure of Kilba folk riddles. It was also observed that clauses and groups form vital structures of Kilba folk riddles. The study has also revealed that there are possible choices of language based on the context of riddling. However, the study concluded that such possibility may lead to ambiguity and disputes over the correct answer. Above all, the study has established a fact that riddling as a game is played for different purposes such as entertainment, teaching and testing ingenuity and ability for linguistic creativity...|$|R
5000|$|Jones {{has worked}} for the Fighting Fantasy game books {{originated}} by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone in the 1980s, in particular providing the original cover for the first title in the series in 1982. It is often stated on the internet that the book's publishers were distressed at Jones' illustration for the cover of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain as he designed it with space for the title in the centre of the front cover, eschewing the publishing tradition of placing titles {{at the top of the}} page,; however, it was something he did after being called-in to rescue the book's launch being told by the publisher [...] "we've no idea how to do this, we don't understand this new type of book" [...] and was asked to 'go away, and come back with something revolutionary'. Inspired by the layouts of many American romance titles at the time, given to him by a Dutch editor in Rotterdam while en route to the Frankfurt Book Fair, he decided to break tradition in the UK market and use a similar layout. He provided several further pieces for the Puffin FF series, including covers for Starship Traveller, Talisman of Death, and The <b>Riddling</b> Reaver, as well as over twenty cover illustrations for Joe Dever's Lone Wolf game books and a number of covers for Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson's Falcon series.|$|R

6000|$|The Camp of Muhlberg, called more {{properly}} the Camp of Radewitz, towards which Friedrich Wilhelm, with English Hotham and many dignitaries are now gone, {{was one of}} the sublimest scenic military exhibitions {{in the history of the}} world; leaving all manner of imitation tournaments, modern [...] "tin-tournaments," [...] out of sight; and perhaps equalling the Field of the Cloth of Gold, or Barbarossa's Mainz Tournament in ancient times. It lasted for a month, regardless of expense,--June month of the year 1730;--and from far and wide the idle of mankind ran, by the thousand, to see it.

40|$|We may {{be given}} to {{understand}} that the story of the three caskets in The Merchant of Venice has a remarkable affinity with a folk tale of marriage proposal involving difficult questions in which a beautiful princess puts riddles to a suitor who will lose his life on the spot in case he turns out to be incapable of solving them. While in the Shakespearean canon the initial portion of Pericles most exactly fits in with this motif, our story seems to be a disguised and yet impressive variation upon it. Considering that they are deprived of the opportunity of begetting legitimate heirs thereafter, the lifelong celibacy to which Portia subjects unsuccessful suitors corresponds, in a symbolic way, to the deadly disaster that awaits the losers of the game in the folk tale {{as well as in the}} Shakespearean romance. The supposedly puzzling inscriptions attached to the caskets manifest themselves as difficult questions in the tale of marriage proposal in question. Each suitor actually addresses himself to deciphering them one by one. What is crucial with this schematized picture is that riddling is latent in the controversial episode of a song about "fancy" being sung. As is notorious, only Bassanio, the hero of this story, with whom Portia has fallen in love at first sight, is blessed with this vitally important musical design. By appropriately taking the cue offered in the shape of a sort of a riddle, he succeeds in choosing the correct casket. Portia proves inventive enough to solve her own dilemma where her desire to break the rule of the game and her absolute obligation to follow it clash with each other. Since she did not directly inform Bassanio of the correct casket, she is no way to blame. <b>Riddling</b> functioned as a clever stratagem to circumvent the strange will of the late lord of Belmont. At any rate, Bassanio wins, growing aware of the entrapping danger of deceptive. ornament, which ironically enough, he assumes himself, masquerading as something of a prince, while he is in actuality financially nothing, even less than nothing, as he has avowed to Portia. This nothing will organically relate to the nothing to which Antonio, his benefactor is to be financially brought, causing the pound of flesh court to be held...|$|R
