40|$|In forming {{of glasses}} frame, bending and inverse bending of rim wires with 4 rolls are usually employed. Only an inverse <b>bending</b> <b>roll,</b> the 4 th roll, {{can change the}} {{position}} to control the curvature of the rim wire. A deriving method of inverse <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> position is proposed in this study. The proposed method requires not the computational simulations but only some simple steady inverse bending experiments to obtain a relationship between inverse <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> position and bent curvature which depends on machine condition and bent wire.

50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{compensating}} for roll deformation include continual varying crown (CVC), pair cross rolling, and work <b>roll</b> <b>bending.</b> CVC {{was developed by}} SMS-Siemag AG and involves grinding a third order polynomial curve into the work rolls and then shifting the work rolls laterally, equally, and opposite to each other. The effect is that the rolls will have a gap between them that is parabolic in shape, and will vary with lateral shift, thus allowing {{for control of the}} crown of the rolls dynamically. Pair cross rolling involves using either flat or parabolically crowned rolls, but shifting the ends at an angle so that the gap between the edges of the rolls will increase or decrease, thus allowing for dynamic crown control. Work <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> involves using hydraulic cylinders at the ends of the rolls to counteract roll deflection.|$|E

50|$|Roll forming, <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> or {{plate rolling}} is a {{continuous}} bending operation {{in which a}} long strip of metal (typically coiled steel) is passed through consecutive sets of rolls, or stands, each performing only an incremental part of the bend, until the desired cross-section profile is obtained. Roll forming is ideal for producing parts with long lengths or in large quantities.There are 3 main processes: 4 rollers, 3 rollers and 2 rollers, {{each of which has}} as different advantages according to the desired specifications of the output plate.|$|E
50|$|During the <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> {{process the}} pipe, extrusion, or solid is {{passed through a}} series of rollers (typically 3) that apply {{pressure}} to the pipe gradually changing the bend radius in the pipe. The pyramid style roll benders have one moving roll, usually the top roll. Double pinch type roll benders have two adjustable rolls, usually the bottom rolls, and a fixed top roll. This method of bending causes very little deformation in the cross section of the pipe. This process is suited to producing coils of pipe as well as long gentle bends like those used in truss systems.|$|E

The intermediate plate was coiled in a coilbox, which effectively overcame the problem of temperature drop by reducing surface area exposed to radiant heat loss during the waiting period.

40|$|AbstractWe {{measure the}} three {{dimensional}} movement of cracked solar cell parts in standard sized PV-modules during a four line bending test. We develop a model which explains this movement {{assuming that the}} centers of mass of the solar cells or cell parts are fixed to the module glass. The widening of all cell gap widths {{is proportional to the}} <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> displacement until a cell cracks in parallel to the <b>bending</b> <b>rolls</b> due to the tensile stress in the cells. At this point, the crack opens abruptly while the two parallel cell gaps next to the cracked cell close simultaneously by the same distance in sum. From here on, the cell gaps and the cell crack increases proportionally to the <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> displacement. Since the distance between the centers of mass of both cracked cell parts is independent of the crack position, the crack width is also independent of the crack position for single cracks. Multiple parallel cracks in solar cells have smaller crack widths according to this model. Laminates without a backsheet show about 30 % larger crack widths...|$|R
50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>bending</b> may {{be done to}} both {{sheet metal}} and bars of metal. If a bar is used, it is assumed to have a uniform cross-section, but not {{necessarily}} rectangular, {{as long as there}} are no overhanging contours, i.e. positive draft. Such bars are often formed by extrusion. The material to be shaped is suspended between the rollers. The end rollers support the bottomside of the bar and have a matching contour (inverse shape) to it in order to maintain the cross-sectional shape. Likewise, the middle roller is forced against the topside of the bar and has a matching contour to it.|$|E

40|$|Sequence-dependent bending of the helical axes in 112 {{oligonucleotide}} duplex {{crystal structures}} resident in the Nucleic Acid Database have been analyzed and {{compared with the}} use of bending dials, a computer graphics tool.

Analysis of the 66 B-form structures in the Nucleic Acid Database indicates that uniform trends within all pyrimidine-purine and purine-pyrimidine steps are not necessarily observed but are found particularly at CG and GC steps of dodecamers.

40|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>bending</b> {{and roll}} {{twisting}} are processes for forming beams of constant cross section into desired shapes by bending and/or twisting the workpiece {{while it is}} rolled through the machine. The objective of the shaping process for beams is to impart a desired angle of twist and a desired curvature at each point along the beam. A closed-loop shape control system was developed by analyzing the mechanics of bending and twisting unsymmetrical beams, such as angles and channels. The shaping process is separated into an unsymmetrical <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> operation and a roll twisting operation. The unsymmetrical <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> operation bends the workpiece about a specified neutral axis to some desired unloaded curvature while the workpiece is in the loaded state. The control of the unsymmetrical <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> operation is decoupled into two simultaneous, but separate, symmetrical <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> controllers about each principal axis of inertia.

40|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>bending</b> is an {{efficient}} metal forming technique, where plates are bent {{to a desired}} curvature using forming rolls. This type of sheet forming process {{is one of the}} most widely used techniques for manufacturing axisymmetric hollow shapes. Moreover, this process is beginning to be taken into serious consideration by industries for producing large, thick parts such as the conically shaped crown of a Francis turbine runner or of a wind turbine tower. Because of the numerous processing parameters, reducing the bending force and improving the accuracy of the final shape are significant challenges in the <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> process. Therefore, the primary aim of this research is to find the strategies for reducing forming forces and improving final part quality by employing numerical and experimental methods. In this thesis, a 3 D dynamic Finite Element (FE) model of an asymmetrical <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> process is developed using the Ansys/LS-Dyna software. The simulation results are then compared with experiments performed with instrumented parts and <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> machine. The parameters that affect the accuracy of the final shape, the bending forces and the residual strain left in the formed plate have been investigated. Applying this 3 D dynamic FE model in an industrial context may predict the forming forces or the accuracy of the final shape’s radius and thus will decrease the setup time before manufacturing. The forming forces can be reduced by heating the plate. In this research, the relationships between the heating plate temperature and the output parameters of <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> process such as applied forces and final shape quality have been studied by performing FE simulation and analytical computations. These results yield to a better understanding of the mechanism of the process and provide an opportunity for the design of {{an efficient}} heating system to control the heat energy to be input in the plate during the <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> process. This research also proposes a new, simple approach for reducing flat areas and forming forces. This approach includes moving the bottom roll slightly along the feeding direction and adjusting the bottom roll location. The FE results indicate that this new approach effectively minimizes the flat area extents and reduces also the forming forces...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} initiates a {{study of}} the mechanics of four <b>roll</b> plate <b>bending</b> and provides a methodology to investigate the process experimentally. To carry out the research a suitable model bender was designed and constructed. The model bender was comprehensively instrumented with ten load cells, three torquemeters and a tachometer. A rudimentary analysis of the four roll pre-bending mode considered the three critical bending operations. The analysis also gave an assessment of the model bender capacity for the design stage. The analysis indicated that an increase in the coefficient of friction in the contact region of the pinch rolls and the plate would reduce the pinch resultant force required to end a plate to a particular bend radius. The mechanisms involved in the four <b>roll</b> plate <b>bending</b> process were investigated and a mathematical model evolved to determine the mechanics of four <b>roll</b> thin plate <b>bending.</b> A theoretical and experimental investigation was conducted for the bending of HP 30 aluminium plates in both single and multipass bending modes. The study indicated that the multipass plate bending mechanics of the process varied according to the number of bending passes executed and the step decrement of the anticipated finished bend radius in any two successive passes (i. e. the bending route). Experimental results for single pass bending indicated that the rollers normally exert a higher bending load for the steady-continous bending with the pre-inactive side roll oper?tive. For the pre-bending mode and the steady-continous bending mode with the pre-active side roll operative, the former exerted the higher loads. The single pass results also indicated that the force on the side roll, the torque and power steadily increased as the anticipated bend radius decreased. Theoretical predictions for the plate internal resistance to accomplish finished bend radii of between 2500 mm and 500 mm for multipass bending HP 30 aluminium plates, suggested that there was a certain bending route which would effectively optimise the bender capacity...|$|R
