In this paper, risk {{acceptability}} evaluation and <b>risk</b> <b>weight</b> and improved <b>risk</b> level were added in original risk matrix method {{according to its}} shortcomings and practicality and need of evaluation of investment risk in international engineering project. A model based on improved risk matrix method was put forward to evaluate investment risk in international engineering project. Firstly, investment risk evaluation index system of international engineering project was established. Secondly, level of risk factors were decided by risk impact level and risk probability scope, borda ordinal value was calculated to form judgment matrix, analytic hierarchy process was introduced to calculate <b>risk</b> <b>weight.</b> Synthetic <b>risk</b> level was determined by product of quantized value of risk level and corresponding <b>risk</b> <b>weight.</b> <b>Risk</b> acceptability evaluation was decided by risk impact level and risk probability scope. Finally, a case study was presented to verify the feasibility of the model which would provide a reliable basis for the investment decision...|$|R
40|$|In September 2009, G 20 representatives {{called for}} {{introducing}} a minimum leverage ratio {{as an instrument}} of financial regulation. It is supposed to assure a certain degree of core capital for banks, independent of the controversial procedures used to assess risk. This paper discusses the interaction and tensions between the leverage ratio and risk-based capital requirements, using financial data of the Swiss systemically important bank UBS. It can be shown that the leverage ratio potentially undermines <b>risk</b> <b>weighting</b> such that banks feel encouraged to take greater risks. The paper proposes an alternative instrument that is conceived as a base <b>risk</b> <b>weight</b> and functions as a backstop. It ensures a minimum core capital ratio, based on unweighted total exposure by ensuring a minimum ratio of risk-weighted to total assets for all banks. The proposed measure is easy to compute like the leverage ratio, and also like the latter, it is independent of <b>risk</b> <b>weighting.</b> Yet, its primary advantage {{is that it does not}} supersede risk-based capital adequacy targets, but rather supplements them...|$|R
50|$|Banks can {{determine}} their own estimation for some components of risk measure: {{the probability of}} default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and effective maturity (M). For public companies, default probabilities are commonly estimated using either the structural model of credit risk proposed by Robert Merton (1974) or reduced form models like the Jarrow-Turnbull model. For retail and unlisted company exposures, default probabilities are estimated using credit scoring or logistic regression, {{both of which are}} closely linked to the reduced form approach. The goal is to define <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> by determining the cut-off points between and within areas of the expected loss (EL) and the unexpected loss (UL), where the regulatory capital should be held, in the probability of default. Then, the <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> for individual exposures are calculated based on the function provided by Basel II.|$|E
5000|$|NOTE: For some [...] "unrated" [...] <b>risk</b> <b>weights,</b> {{banks are}} {{encouraged}} {{to use their own}} internal-ratings system based on Foundation IRB and Advanced IRB in Internal-Ratings Based approach with a set of formulae provided by the Basel-II accord. There exist several alternative weights for some of the following claim categories published in the original Framework text.|$|E
5000|$|Basel I, that is, the 1988 Basel Accord, is {{primarily}} focused on credit risk and appropriate risk-weighting of assets. Assets of banks were classified and grouped in five categories according to credit risk, carrying <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> of 0% (for example cash, bullion, home country debt like Treasuries), 20% (securitisations such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) {{with the highest}} AAA rating), 50% (municipal revenue bonds, residential mortgages), 100% (for example, most corporate debt), and some assets given No rating. Banks with an international presence are required to hold capital equal to 8% of their risk-weighted assets (RWA).|$|E
25|$|Loans made {{to banks}} or {{securities}} firms subject to regulatory capital requirements come under this category. Certain domestic PSEs or MDBs {{that do not}} meet the criteria for a 0% <b>risk</b> <b>weight</b> under the standardized approach also fall in this category.|$|R
50|$|For a <b>risk</b> <b>weight</b> {{derived from}} the IRB {{framework}} to {{be transformed into a}} risk weighted asset, it needs to be attached to an exposure amount. Any error in EAD calculation will directly affect the risk weighted asset and thereby affect the capital requirement.|$|R
25|$|This {{generally}} {{refers to}} a loan made to a particular country. Under the Basel II guidelines, this class also includes the central banks of various countries, certain public sector enterprises (PSEs) and the multilateral development banks (MDBs) that meet the criteria for a 0% <b>risk</b> <b>weight</b> under the standardized approach.|$|R
5000|$|The Tier 1 {{capital ratio}} is {{the ratio of}} a bank's core equity capital to its total risk-{{weighted}} assets (RWA). Risk-weighted assets are the total of all assets held by the bank weighted by credit risk according to a formula determined by the Regulator (usually the country's central bank). Most central banks follow the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) guidelines in setting formulae for asset <b>risk</b> <b>weights.</b> Assets like cash and currency usually have zero risk weight, while certain loans have a risk weight at 100% of their face value. The BCBS {{is a part of}} the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). Under BCBS guidelines total RWA is not limited to Credit Risk. It contains components for Market Risk (typically based on value at risk (VAR) [...] ) and Operational Risk. The BCBS rules for calculation of the components of total RWA have seen a number of changes following the Financial crisis of 2007-08.|$|E
40|$|Banks use {{internal}} models to optimize <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> and better {{account for the}} specific risk of each asset class. As {{the choice of a}} set of <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> affects the regulatory capital ratio, economic theory suggests that banks should optimize their <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> accounting for the cost and benefit of holding equity capital. Banks with a higher cost of equity, and banks with better growth opportunities, should be more aggressive in reducing <b>risk</b> <b>weights.</b> We consider a large panel of international banks and find that, after controlling for a number of bank and country characteristics, a higher cost of equity and better growth opportunities have a negative relation with the ratio between risk-weighted assets and total assets and with the share of credit risk evaluated though {{internal models}}. The results are obtained in the context of endogeneity-robust econometric procedures and across several specifications. We also find that banks that are more aggressive in terms of such optimization have a subsequent lower return on equity {{and are more likely to}} have raised capital during the credit crisis...|$|E

As a result, the internal model approach does not necessarily provide capital savings relative to the standardized method that encourages the financial institutions to develop internal models. Whether the internal model approaches can provide capital savings depends on the characteristics of the portfolios of the financial institutions. The capital savings will occur only in the case of low-risk financial institutions. The high-risk financial institutions will choose the standardized method as their calculation tool of capital requirements. To solve the moral hazard problem of “supervisory discrimination”, we propose the “VaR-based <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> ” which can ensure capital savings of adoption of the internal model and thereby encourage the financial institutions to develop internal models...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the VaRs for marketable assets {{in order to}} examine the propriety of the <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> set by the Basel Accord and compare the capital charges between the standardized and the internal model approaches using the actual positions of institutions.

We present a Bayesian approach to disease surveillance when auxiliary risk information is available which will usually allow for substantial improvements over simple random sampling.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to measure the cyclicality of <b>risk</b> <b>weights,</b> calculated according to Basel II IRB approach, for SME corporate portfolio of one Nordic bank. Our main focus is to examine effects of both the loan allocation within the portfolio and the bank's rating system in calculating <b>risk</b> <b>weights,</b> and to estimate which of these effects predominates. In this paper an econometric model, a first-order autoregressive model, is designed to measure business cycle sensitivity of a rating system. The model measures sensitivity by estimating elasticities of default probabilities with respect to realised default rates. The analysis of default rates, based on the correlation of default rates and GDP is also carried out in order to measuse the rating system's sensitivity to the business cycle. In this paper we also simulate a fully sensitive to the business cycle system and a fairly neutral to the business cycle system in order to examine the effect of loan allocation and the effect of rating systems' sensitivity on <b>risk</b> <b>weights.</b> The main conclusion in this paper is that the countercyclical effect of loan reallocation within one particular bank's portfolio for corporates predominates the procyclical effect of changes in the borrowers' creditworthiness over the business cycle. Calculated <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> for this portfolio move in a countercyclical manner as a result of the bank's credit policy and the low business cycle sensitivity of the bank's rating system. The results show that the effect of loan allocation has a great impact even in the case with the simulated fully sensitive to the business cycle system. Another finding of this paper is that changes in the bank's credit policy are first and foremost applied on new borrowers, i. e. the bank sets higher thresholds for granting loans in economic downturns...|$|E

40|$|The tight {{linkage between}} {{sovereign}} and bank balance sheets magni ed {{the depth of}} the European sovereign debt crisis. As a response to this, reform efforts are therefore focused on severing this vicious tie. Some progress has been made. The Banking Union framework addresses the transfer of banking sector risk to the sovereign. Policy makers are now discussing how to address the treatment of sovereign debt on bank balance sheets. Currently, it is treated as risk free. Zero <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> are applied, meaning banks do not need to set aside capital to protect themselves from potential losses in these securities. Nor do banks have any limits on their exposure to a particular sovereign. This discussion paper analyses the two widely discussed basic options to address this regulatory gap: applying non-zero <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> to sovereign expo- sures, and putting limits on exposures to sovereigns, akin to those in place for other exposures. Although this paper analyses each option in isolation, the two complement one another as they target different facets of risk. Positive <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> address counterparty credit risk, whereas large exposure limits address concentration risk. Both policy options would, according to our analysis, lead to improved bank risk management and render banks more resilient. They would equip them to better absorb losses: positive <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> would require higher capital buffers and exposure limits would lead to greater diversi cation. Positive <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> would also improve risk transparency and correct distorted incentives for investing in sovereign bonds. At the systemic level, leverage would decrease and losses in the event of default would be more spread out. On the downside, both regula- tory proposals would lower bank pro tability in the short run. In the longer run, positive risk-weights could permanently reduce bank pro ts by increasing their funding costs, while exposure limits would lead to a more diversi ed portfolio and lower funding costs. The bene ts in terms of increased resilience in the banking sector would come at a cost for some sovereigns. Sovereign bond holdings would become more costly in terms of capital if positive <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> were applied or the exposures were capped by a hard limit. In both cases, banks would try to deal with excess sovereign bonds on their balance sheets by injecting fresh capital or reducing their portfolio of sovereign bonds. An increased supply of sovereign paper, or a lack of demand for new issues, would raise funding costs for the sovereign and consequently for the whole economy. Furthermore, both policy options would lower liquidity in the sovereign debt markets, as they add to the cost and hinder the ability of banks to provide market-making services. Exposure limits in partic- ular would have signi cant repercussions on markets in the short run, as banks traditionally have large exposures to domestic sovereigns {{that they would have to}} shed. Other market participants would need to absorb this additional supply. Sovereigns would need to re-arrange their nancing sources, which could prove challenging. Additionally, the two options could aggravate long-run macro-level cyclical developments for stressed sovereigns. During an economic downturn, an increased riskiness of a sovereign would translate into higher <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> and a higher capital charge for the bank holding its debt. This would further worsen nancing conditions for sovereigns precisely at the time when scal space is most needed. Similarly, exposure limits could lead to cliff effects in a downturn, if sovereigns fail to extend their investor base. We expect that introducing positive <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> would have the largest effect on stressed sovereigns, while imposing exposure limits would impact sovereigns with large outstanding debt volumes the most. The trade-off between strengthening the resilience of the banking sector to sovereign risk and maintaining the investor base for European sovereigns makes the issue of adjusting regulation particularly complex. Any policy decision needs to take into account the effects it would have on sovereign funding conditions. In addition, as banks traditionally hold large amounts of sovereign debt, any regulatory change could have a large initial impact with potentially destabilising consequences. Hence, a gradual and transparent transition would be crucial for a successful implementation of any combination of the two alternatives...|$|E

Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle characteristics and acculturation measures, was used to estimate the odds of cardiovascular-related health (high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, 'at least one cardiometabolic condition') outcomes across all eight Asian sub-groups. Compared to South Asians (OR =  1. 00), Filipinos had higher odds of having 'at least one cardiometabolic condition' (OR =  1. 29, 95 % CI: 1. 04 - 1. 62), whereas Chinese (0. 63, 0. 474 - 0. 9) and Arab-Canadians had lower odds (0. 38, 0. 28 - 0. 51).
