25|$|Intumescent firestops {{are often}} used, {{in the event}} plastic pipes are used for toilet drains, so that the melting plastic pipe is choked off {{in the event of}} an {{accidental}} fire. It is, however, customary to fill the metallic drain pipe annulus with <b>rockwool</b> packing. Even with the best of intentions, it would be difficult for the firestopper to install a sealant, because the installer is not allowed to remove the flange, which is partially used to support the drain pipe below during the installation process.|$|E
2500|$|Green roofs can be {{categorized}} as intensive, semi-intensive, or extensive, depending on the depth of planting medium {{and the amount of}} maintenance they need. Extensive green roofs traditionally support 10-25 pounds of vegetation per square foot (50–120kg/m2) while intensive roofs support 80-150 pounds of vegetation per square foot (390–730kg/m2). Traditional roof gardens, which require a reasonable depth of soil to grow large plants or conventional lawns, are considered intensive because they are labour-intensive, requiring irrigation, feeding, and other maintenance. [...] Intensive roofs are more park-like with easy access and may include anything from kitchen herbs to shrubs and small trees. [...] Extensive green roofs, by contrast, are designed to be virtually self-sustaining and should require only a minimum of maintenance, perhaps a once-yearly weeding or an application of slow-release fertiliser to boost growth. [...] Extensive roofs are usually only accessed for maintenance. [...] They can be established on a very thin layer of soil (most use specially formulated composts): even a thin layer of <b>rockwool</b> laid directly onto a watertight roof can support a planting of Sedum species and mosses. [...] Some green roof designs incorporate both intensive and extensive elements. To protect the roof, a waterproofing membrane is often used, which is manufactured to remain watertight in extreme conditions including constant dampness, ponding water, high and low alkaline conditions and exposure to plant roots, fungi and bacterial organisms.|$|E
