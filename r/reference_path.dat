40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{sufficient}} family of time-optimal paths for both Dubins' as well as Reeds-Shepp's car models consist of the concatenation of circular arcs with maximum curvature and straight line segments, all tangentially connected. These time-optimal solutions suffer from some drawbacks. Their discontinuous curvature profile, together with the wear and impairment on the control equipment that the bang-bang solutions induce, calls for "smoother" and more supple <b>reference</b> <b>paths</b> to follow.

40|$|A {{method for}} the control of {{autonomously}} and slowly moving agricultural machinery is presented. Special emphasis is on offline reference trajectory generation tailored for high-precision closed-loop tracking within agricultural fields using linear time-varying model predictive control. When optimisation is carried out, high-level logistical processing can result in edgy <b>reference</b> <b>paths</b> for field coverage. Subsequent trajectory smoothing can consider specific actuator rate constraints and field geometry. The latter step {{is the subject of}} this paper. Focussing on forward motion only, the role of non-convexly shaped field geometry, repressed area minimisation and spraying gap avoidance is analysed. Three design methods for generating smooth reference trajectories are discussed: circle-segments, generalised elementary paths, and bi-elementary paths...|$|R
50|$|The first {{implementation}} of a/LCI used a Michelson interferometer, {{the same model}} used in the famous Michelson-Morley experiment. The Michelson interferometer splits one beam of light into two paths, one <b>reference</b> <b>path</b> and one sampling path, and recombines them again to produce a waveform resulting from interference. The difference between the reference beam and the sampling beam thus reveal {{the properties of the}} sample in the way it scatters light.|$|E

A second polarization controller is similarly used to control the polarization of the light passing through the <b>reference</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E

There are already developed autonomous agricultural vehicles that can track a path, and perform the specified processes on the plantation fields. These autonomous agricultural robotic machines need an upper level of control, which is mostly performed manually, for the design of the <b>reference</b> <b>paths.</b> Detection of the agricultural obstacles is necessary to accomplish these manual tasks in an automatic manner. In this study, statistical methods are employed to determine which of the five well-known edge-detection methods is best, for the high-level path planning in an agricultural automation of autonomous agricultural vehicles depending on field and image properties...|$|R

A low level Linear Quadratic controller is used for stabilization of the internal angles while a pure pursuit path tracking controller is used on a higher level to handle the path tracking. Piecewise linearity is the only requirement on the control reference which makes the design of <b>reference</b> <b>paths</b> very general.

At the beam splitter the source light is split into a <b>reference</b> <b>path</b> (reflected) and a sampling path (transmitted onto the sample). On the comparison face there is a mirrored circle in the middle. The two paths recombine to form an interference image. By changing the z position of the sample, interference images are acquired at a sequence of path (phase) differences: 0, λ/4, λ/2, and 3λ/4. These interference maps are functions of background intensity, fringe modulation, and phase. Three such images provide enough information to solve for the topographic image of a sample.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Path {{following}} controller, designed {{according to}} the principle of following a virtual robot, for a gyroscopically stabilized single-wheeled robot (gyrobot) is presented in this paper. Linear and angular velocities of the virtual robot are pre-computed such that it follows the desired path. These velocities also constitute the feed-forward component of the reference velocities for the gyrobot. The feedback components of the reference velocities are computed based on the error between the pose of virtual robot and that of the gyrobot. Besides the reference velocity generator, a controller is designed to make the single-wheeled robot follow the reference velocities. Conditions for stability of the single-wheeled robot are taken into consideration while designing the reference velocities. Effectiveness of the design is verified using different types of <b>reference</b> <b>paths.</b> Index Terms—Gyroscopic precession, Single-wheeled robot, Path following controller, Virtual robo...|$|R
