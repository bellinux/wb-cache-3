5|$|To keep enemy {{action to}} a minimum during the assault, a {{creeping}} barrage was planned. This required gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres {{in advance of the}} assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the battles of Neuve Chapelle and the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the barrage falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous No. 106 Fuze had been adapted from a French design for high-explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the barrage.|$|E
25|$|Rodents have {{upper and}} lower hypselodont incisors that can {{continuously}} grow enamel throughout its life without having properly formed roots. These teeth are also known as aradicular teeth, and unlike humans whose ameloblasts die after tooth development, rodents continually produce enamel, they must wear down their teeth by gnawing on various materials. Enamel and dentin are produced by the enamel organ, and growth {{is dependent on the}} presence of stem cells, cellular amplification, and cellular maturation structures in the odontogenic region. Rodent incisors are used for cutting wood, biting through the skin of fruit, or for defense. This allows for the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> and tooth growth to be at equilibrium. The microstructure of rodent incisor enamel has shown to be useful in studying the phylogeny and systematics of rodents because of its independent evolution from the other dental traits. The enamel on rodent incisors are composed of two layers: the inner portio interna (PI) with Hunter-Schreger bands (HSB) and an outer portio externa (PE) with radial enamel (RE).|$|E
2500|$|Grinding {{wheels are}} consumables, {{although}} {{the life span}} can vary widely depending on the use case, from {{less than a day}} to many years. As the wheel cuts, it periodically releases individual grains of abrasive, typically because they grow dull and the increased drag pulls them out of the bond. Fresh grains are exposed in this wear process, which begin the next cycle. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> in this process is usually very predictable for a given application, and is necessary for good performance.|$|E

40|$|Occlusal {{surfaces}} of teeth and restorations wear by repeated antagonistic contact. Two-body wear {{is the result}} of direct contact between occlusal surfaces. In cases <b>of</b> three-body <b>wear,</b> food is found between antagonistic teeth. Contact wear is expressed predominantly by abrasion and material fatigue. Erosion is a type <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> which does not involve direct antagonistic contact. Qualitative methods exist for registering occlusal tooth <b>wear.</b> <b>Wear</b> <b>of</b> restorations can be measured using casts. An obvious method for comparing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> restorative materials is laboratory research. This method has demonstrated that the <b>wear</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> composite and enamel are similar. Cast metals and in particular ceramic wear less than enamel.

2500|$|The Technical Member (and {{the only}} engineer) on the Decimal Currency Board was Hugh Conway, {{at that time}} President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and Managing Director of Bristol Siddeley Engines, Bristol. He had found in a {{mathematical}} textbook a formula for a non-circular shape of constant breadth and asked the design office at Patchway, near Bristol, which normally worked on the engines for aircraft such as Concorde, Vulcan and Harrier to draw out the shape. However, {{this turned out to}} be a wavy-edged form with re-entrant sides which would not roll and which could not be measured easily. A designer, Colin Lewis, suggested a much simpler shape which in its basic form is an equilateral triangle with a small circle centred on each apex and with a larger circular arc centred on each apex but tangential to each of the two opposite small circles. Wherever it was measured, the breadth of this shape was one small radius plus one large radius. (The small radius was not strictly necessary to the geometry, but made the shape more practical by removing inconvenient sharp points and reducing the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear,</b> and therefore change of size, in handling). The number of corners could be any odd number greater than one. A drawing was made to illustrate the proposal which was accepted by Hugh Conway. He chose seven sides as a compromise between too radical a shape, which might not be acceptable to the public, and having too many sides, which would make a shape visually difficult to differentiate from a circle. The shape was drawn out by Dave Brown and samples made from stainless steel by the Model Shop, together with a section of perspex channel with a bend to demonstrate that the [...] "coin" [...] would roll around corners and drop through gauging slots. The legend [...] "50" [...] was photo-etched (from a master drawn by Ray Gooding) on the faces of the samples since it had already been decided that the new coin would be the first coin of the new Decimal series.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{electrical}} commutators use {{slip rings}} for coupling. Slip rings however inject commutator noise into the connection. This is because as the contact points slide {{over the surface}} of the slip-rings they make microscopic bumps.

To reduce the electrical noise the contact points need to be pressed against the slip rings with greater force. This leads to great resistance and a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear.</b>|$|E

50|$|Gauge blocks {{are usually}} made either from {{hardened}} alloy tool steels or from cemented carbides (such as tungsten carbide or tantalum carbide). Often the carbide has a hardness of 1500 Vickers hardness. Long series blocks {{are made from}} high-quality steel having cross section (35 Ã— 9 mm) with holes for clamping two slips together. These are also available in carbon steel material. Steel blocks are hardened and tempered. The hardness {{is important because it}} slows down the gauge's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> during use (this is why other kinds of gauges, such as pins, thread plugs, and rings, are also hardened.) The cutting of the blocks to size is accomplished with grinding followed by lapping. Usually no plating or other coating is involved.

50|$|Grinding wheel wear is an {{important}} measured factor of grinding in the manufacturing process of engineered parts and tools. Grinding involves the removal process of material and modifying {{the surface of a}} workpiece to some desired finish which might otherwise be unachievable through conventional machining processes. The grinding process itself has been compared to machining operations which employ multipoint cutting tools. The abrasive grains which make up the entire geometry of wheel act as independent small cutting tools. The quality, characteristics, and rate of grinding wheel wear can be affected by contributions of the characteristics of the material of the workpiece, the temperature increase of the workpiece, and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> of the grinding wheel itself. Moderate wear rate allows for more consistent material size. Maintaining stable grinding forces is preferred rather than high wheel wear rate which can decrease the effectiveness of material removal from the workpiece.|$|E
