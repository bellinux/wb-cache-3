5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach <b>REM</b> sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down {{for an hour or}} two every few days to meet their minimum <b>REM</b> sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into <b>REM</b> sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|Early American {{alternative}} bands such as Dream Syndicate, <b>R.E.M.,</b> The Feelies and Violent Femmes combined punk influences with {{folk music}} and mainstream music influences. <b>R.E.M.</b> {{was the most}} immediately successful; its debut album, Murmur (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of jangle pop followers. One of the many jangle pop scenes of the early 1980s, Los Angeles' Paisley Underground revived {{the sounds of the}} 1960s, incorporating psychedelia, rich vocal harmonies and the guitar interplay of folk rock as well as punk and underground influences such as The Velvet Underground.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: <b>REM</b> sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: <b>REM,</b> light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during <b>REM</b> sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E

50|$|The Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt-Aalen railway, {{also known}} as the <b>Rems</b> Railway (German: Remsbahn) or the <b>Rems</b> Valley Railway (German: Remstalbahn), was {{historically}} the main line route from Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt via Aalen to Nördlingen. Today the designation <b>Rems</b> Railway only refers to the section from Stuttgart to Aalen, the Aalen-Nördlingen line becoming part of the Ries Railway (Riesbahn). Between Waiblingen and Essingen the <b>Rems</b> line runs parallel to the River <b>Rems</b> from which it gets its name.

5|$|With {{help from}} its l'Cie {{soldiers}} and Class Zero, Rubrum destroys {{the forces of}} Concordia and Milites, uniting Orience under its flag. This triggers the arrival of Tempus Finis, with the Rursus Army emerging from the magical fortress Pandaemonium to wipe out Orience's population. Cid and Class Zero each travel to Pandaemonium: Cid attempts to become Agito and is transformed into the Rursus Arbiter by Gala, while Class Zero resolve to halt Tempus Finis. As Class Zero face the trials of the Arbiter, the Vermillion Bird Crystals offers them the chance to become l'Cie. Class Zero refuse the Crystal's offer and <b>Rem</b> is made a l'Cie in their place. Machina and <b>Rem</b> end up fighting each other in Pandaemonium: <b>Rem</b> is mortally wounded, and she and Machina turn to crystal. Severely weakened by the trials and demoralized at seeing Machina and Rem's condition, Class Zero are initially unable to defeat the Arbiter. Machina and Rem's spirits give them the strength they need to defeat the Arbiter and halt Tempus Finis. Fatally injured, Class Zero spend their final minutes imagining their possible post-war lives. They are found by Machina and <b>Rem,</b> who have returned to human form and, {{along with the rest}} of Orience, are allowed to remember the dead. In a post-credits sequence, it is said that the Crystal States fall into turmoil as the Crystals lose their powers. Machina and <b>Rem</b> unite Orience and rebuild the world, and Machina records Class Zero's history before dying with <b>Rem</b> at his side. A second playthrough reveals that Orience is trapped in a stable timeloop created by Arecia and Gala, the respective servants of the deities Pulse and Lindzei, as part of an experiment to find the gateway to the Unseen Realm. Competing with each other to open the gateway using a different method, both failed and reset the world for another attempt. By the events of Type-0, the experiment had been performed over six hundred million times.|$|E
5|$|A {{final element}} in {{creating}} and sustaining the Athens musical culture was the University of Georgia Lamar Dodd School of Art. The {{great majority of}} Athens' musicians and their fan base {{were associated with the}} University's liberal arts curriculum, and the School of Art, rather than the music department, was the area where the creative and musical alliances that later defined the scene began forming in the 1970s. Michael Stipe of <b>R.E.M.</b> was an art major (although he did not graduate), and the Art School incubated other major figures such as Curtis Crowe, founding member and drummer for Pylon. The cinematographer for the documentary film Athens GA: Inside/Out was Jim Herbert, an art school professor. Herbert went on to direct music videos for a number of Athens bands, including 14 for <b>R.E.M.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1996, <b>R.E.M.</b> re-signed with Warner Bros. for a {{reported}} US$80million, {{at the time}} the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. <b>R.E.M.</b> disbanded amicably in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.|$|E

50|$|The line’s chainage is {{measured}} from Stuttgart Bad Cannstatt station. A {{short distance from}} the station the four tracks of the <b>Rems</b> line separate from the Fils Valley Railway at a flying junction. At about the same point the tracks of the <b>Rems</b> line are rearranged to be paired by direction of operation, with S-Bahn trains running on the outer tracks and regional and long distance trains running on the inner tracks. The line climbs about 80 metres {{on its way to}} Fellbach. At Waiblingen station the Murr Railway branches off. From Waiblingen the <b>Rems</b> Railway continues as a double-track line through the <b>Rems</b> valley and it crosses the Haldenbach river outside Endersbach station on a round-arched viaduct. The line crosses the <b>Rems</b> before Urbach and follows the course of the <b>Rems</b> until Essingen. While the <b>Rems</b> flows from the south of the main valley in Essingen, the <b>Rems</b> line follows the main valley to the east. The course of this valley allowed the line to be built in relatively straight lines without major engineering structures. After the railway junction at Aalen station, the <b>Rems</b> line follows the historical course along the Kocher to Goldshöfe station. This station was originally built to serve the junction where the lines separate to the north towards Crailsheim (Upper Jagst Railway) and to the east towards Nördlingen (Ries Railway), not to serve the local population.|$|R

5|$|<b>R.E.M.</b> re-signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 for a {{reported}} $80million (a figure the band constantly asserted originated with the media), {{rumored to be}} the largest recording contract in history at that point. The group's 1996 album New Adventures in Hi-Fi debuted at number two in the US and number one in the UK. The five million copies of the album sold were a reversal of the group's commercial fortunes of the previous five years. Time writer Christopher John Farley argued that the lesser sales of the album were due to the declining commercial power of alternative rock as a whole. That same year, <b>R.E.M.</b> parted ways with manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to sexual harassment charges levied against him {{by a member of the}} band's home office in Athens. The group's lawyer Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties.|$|E
5|$|The {{band members}} {{eventually}} {{dropped out of}} school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an <b>R.E.M.</b> performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, <b>R.E.M.</b> toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of $2 each per day.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{decades of}} research, the {{question}} of whether the rapid eye movements (<b>REMs)</b> of paradoxical sleep (PS) are equivalent to waking saccades and whether their direction is congruent with visual spatial events in the dream scene is still very controversial. We gained an insight into these questions through the study of a right brain damaged patient suffering attentional neglect for the left side of space and drop of the optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) with alternating rightward slow/leftward fast phases evoked by rightward optic flow. During PS the patient had frequent Nystagmoid <b>REMs</b> with alternating leftward slow/rightward fast phases and reported dreams with visual events evoking corresponding OKN such as a train running leftward. By contrast, just as in waking OKN, Nystagmoid <b>REMs</b> with alternating rightward slow/leftward fast phases were virtually absent. <b>REMs</b> followed by staring eye position or by consecutive <b>REMs</b> were also observed: these showed no asymmetry comparable to that of Nystagmoid ones. The selective disappearance of Nystagmoid <b>REMs</b> in one horizontal direction proves, for the first time, that in humans different types of <b>REMs</b> exists and that these are driven by different premotor mechanisms. Concomitant drop of OKN and Nystagmoid <b>REMs</b> toward the same horizontal direction demonstrates that phylogenetically ancient oculomotor mechanisms, such as the OKN, are shared by waking and PS. On this evidence and converging findings from animal, neuropsychological and brain imaging studies, a new evolutionary account of dream bizarreness is proposed.

30|$|<b>REMs</b> [4] in this {{framework}} (Figure 1) refer to real-time spatial {{maps of the}} spectrum. These maps display vital information on spectral utilization across the whole network. As such, they facilitate environment monitoring by presenting relevant parameters that will be elaborated in Section 2.5. <b>REMs</b> {{can also be used}} by authorities to monitor spectrum for either finding violations of regulations or finding the so-called white spaces of the spectrum. For instance, apart from the real-life implementation of <b>REMs</b> in [6], the IEEE 802.22 standard [17] recommends the authorities to prepare database services (similar to <b>REMs)</b> to provide public access to query for available TV channels. Indoor <b>REMs</b> give unprecedented insight on spectrum utilization in buildings with highly dense exploitation of wireless terminals.|$|R
