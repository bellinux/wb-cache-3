5|$|Macdonald was a {{classical}} liberal in the 19th-century tradition of John Stuart Mill. He believed in individual freedom and responsibility and {{feared that the}} growth of government bureaucracy would threaten liberty. For him, the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> was to provide basic services. He supported public ownership of utilities like the Nova Scotia Power Commission, but rejected calls for more interventionist policies such as government ownership of key industries or big loans to private companies.|$|E
5|$|Resources {{and funds}} {{were needed to}} {{construct}} most memorials, particular larger monuments or building projects; sometimes professional services could be acquired for nothing, but normally designers, workmen and suppliers had to be paid. Different countries approached this problem in various ways, depending on local culture and the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> Despite the special nature of the memorials, contractual arguments and issues over costs, timings and specifications were common, from smaller works in villages through to major works, such as the Vimy Memorial. The sheer volume of work encouraged industrial innovation: carving the inscriptions into the many thousands of British memorial stones had to originally be undertaken by hand, for example, until a Lancashire company invented an automated engraving process.|$|E

25|$|Although a {{majority}} of forests continue to be owned formally by government, the effectiveness of forest governance is increasingly independent of formal ownership.

Under neo-liberal regimes in the developing countries, the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> has diminished and the market forces have increasingly taken over the dominant socio-economic role.|$|E
25|$|Hayek {{was one of}} {{the leading}} {{academic}} critics of collectivism in the 20th century. Hayek argued that all forms of collectivism (even those theoretically based on voluntary co-operation) could only be maintained by a central authority of some kind. In Hayek's view, the central <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> should be to maintain the rule of law, with as little arbitrary intervention as possible. In his popular book, The Road to Serfdom (1944) and in subsequent academic works, Hayek argued that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn leads towards totalitarianism.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, King became Pataki's budget director. In 1999, after {{a nearly}} year-long search, Pataki {{advanced}} King {{as a candidate}} to fill the shoes of John W.

King had little experience in higher education and had authorized a SUNY budget freeze only two months prior. Additionally, Pataki had a longstanding desire to reduce the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> in the University's funding which already led to one Chancellor's departure.

25|$|With new {{national}} Bundestag (West Germany's parliament) elections coming up, the Social Democratic Party was coming into power, first in 1966 {{as part of}} a broad coalition, and by 1969, with a parliamentary majority. With the Social Democrats holding the power, they were finally {{in a position to make}} key appointments in the Ministry of Justice and start implementing reform. In addition, demographic anxieties such as fear of declining birth rate no longer controlled the 1960s and homosexual men were no longer seen as a threat for not being able to reproduce. The <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> was seen as protecting society from harm, and should only intervene in cases that involved force or the abuse of minors.|$|E
25|$|Thatcher {{formed a}} {{government}} on 4 May 1979, with {{a mandate to}} reverse the UK's economic decline and to reduce the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> in the economy. Thatcher was incensed by one contemporary view within the Civil Service that its job was to manage the UK's decline {{from the days of}} Empire, and wanted the country to punch above its weight in international affairs. She was a philosophic soulmate with Ronald Reagan, elected in 1980 in the United States, and to a lesser extent, Brian Mulroney, who was elected in 1984 in Canada. It seemed for a time that conservatism might be the dominant political philosophy in the major English-speaking nations for the era.|$|E
25|$|The 1895 state {{constitution}} overturned this, reducing {{the role of}} counties and strengthening the relative <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> legislature; essentially the counties were agents {{of the state and}} ruled by the General Assembly through the legislative delegation for each county. They are geographically comprehensive; all areas of the state are included in counties. As each county had one state senator, that position was particularly powerful. This status continued until 1973, when the {{state constitution}} was amended to provide for home rule for the counties. During this time the state had changed, with increasing urbanization, but rural counties retained proportionally more power as the legislature was based in representatives elected from counties rather than population districts.|$|E
25|$|The {{challenge}} to the Court in its analysis and decision was devising a proper course of action that was both coordinate and consonant between the sovereign authorities (the Congress over itself and its members, the people and <b>the</b> <b>states</b> over <b>the</b> Congress) each in their own sphere, over <b>the</b> choosing <b>of</b> members to <b>the</b> Congress. The Court looked at <b>the</b> historical precedent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House, <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> its candidate members, and <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> and their voters in choosing their representatives. The Court concluded that the US Constitution (the word and will <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people), <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> history (<b>the</b> record <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> people have used their constitution), and <b>the</b> federal structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government (<b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> in organizing and managing elections within their borders) required the Court to decide that <b>the</b> sovereign will <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people, as expressed in the democratic process, and <b>the</b> coordinate <b>role</b> <b>of</b> their <b>states</b> must be made consonant and held supreme, in the responsibility to create candidate members for the Congress.|$|R

25|$|In the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> personified, {{the monarch}} has worn {{clothing}} {{symbolic of the}} country and his or her distinct role in it. For instance, the gown worn by Queen Elizabeth II at both her coronation in London and the opening of the Canadian parliament in 1957 was decorated with the floral emblems of her realms, including maple leaves for Canada. During the same 1957 visit to Ottawa, the Queen also wore to a banquet held at Rideau Hall the Maple-Leaf-of-Canada dress; it was a pale green satin gown, edged with a garland consisting of deep green velvet maple leaves appliquéd with crysals and emeralds. Afterwards, the dress was donated to the Crown Collection and is now held at the Canadian Museum of History. Similarly, for a dinner held in July 2010 in Toronto, Elizabeth wore a white gown with silver maple leaves appliquéd on the right sleeve and shoulder.|$|E
25|$|In February 1992, {{and with}} {{amendments}} in January 1995, the Riigikogu renewed Estonia's 1938 citizenship law, which also provides equal civil protection to resident aliens. Elected on an ambitious programme of reform, Mart Laar's cabinet took several decisive measures (Shock therapy). Fast privatization was pursued and the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{in the economy}} {{as well as in}} the social affairs was reduced dramatically. After an initial steep decline in GDP, the Estonian economy started to grow again in 1995. Changes came with a social price: the average life expectancy in Estonia in 1994 was lower than in Belarus, Ukraine and even Moldova. Among the vulnerable sectors of society, the radical reforms sparked an outrage. In January 1993, a pensioners' demonstration took place in Tallinn, as pensioners felt it was impossible to live with a pension as low as the one in effect at the time (260 EEK (around 20 EUR) a month). The meeting was aggressive and demonstrators attacked the minister of social affairs Marju Lauristin.|$|E
25|$|The New Zealand Labour Party {{was formed}} in 1916 by various socialist parties and trade unions. It is thus the country's oldest {{political}} party still in existence. There have been six periods of Labour government. The party was first in power from 1935 to 1949, when it established New Zealand's welfare state. It governed from 1957 to 1960, and again from 1972 to 1975, but only stayed in for one term each. In government from 1984 to 1990, Labour privatised state assets and reduced the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> in the economy. It also formed a government from 1999 to 2008, with Helen Clark as party leader and Prime Minister. Since the 2008 general election, Labour has comprised the second-largest caucus represented in the New Zealand Parliament. On 1 August 2017, Jacinda Ardern was confirmed as the new Labour leader. At the 2017 general election, Labour gained 36.9 percent of the party vote and 46 seats. On 19 October 2017, Labour formed a coalition government with New Zealand First, supported by the Green Party.|$|E
