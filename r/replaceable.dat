5|$|A {{controversy}} has erupted {{since the late}} 20thcentury over the four lower Snake River dams, with the primary argument being that removing the dams would allow anadromous fish to reach the lower Snake River tributaries—the Clearwater River, the Tucannon River and the Grande Ronde River—and spawn in much higher numbers. However, removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest. Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams, removing the four dams would create {{a hole in the}} energy grid that would not be immediately <b>replaceable.</b> Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer, as submerged riffles, rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams. Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River. However, aside from restoring salmon runs, dam removal proponents argue that the power is <b>replaceable,</b> that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads, and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water. Irrigators in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow less water into the Snake River during low flow {{in order to create a}} current in the four lower reservoirs, and recreation and tourism would likely benefit.|$|E
5|$|The F-16 was {{designed}} to be relatively inexpensive to build and simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters. The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded aluminum honeycomb structures and graphite epoxy lamination coatings. The number of lubrication points, fuel line connections, and <b>replaceable</b> modules is significantly lower than predecessors; 80% of access panels can be accessed without stands. The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|Although sceptical, Harry sends Lucas to Kachimov {{to learn}} which cable the {{submarine}} will attack so Malcolm can launch a counterattack. Lucas {{is able to}} turn Kachimov by forging evidence {{that he is an}} MI5 mole. They both go to the Russian embassy and find the submarine's location, after which Malcolm launches the counterattack with seconds to spare. Kachimov is later arrested. Lucas visits Elizabeta at her home, which was also their married home and he asks her to become an asset to MI5 to save her from arrest because of her association with Kachimov. In the end, Kachimov is with Harry and Ros in a field. Kachimov states his admiration for Adam's sacrifice, but then callously says he was a <b>replaceable</b> resource. In the final moments, Ros hands Harry a gun and Harry kills Kachimov with a shot to the chest.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the Luftwaffe had {{subjected}} the UK {{to a major}} {{air campaign}} and caused {{an enormous amount of}} destruction and displacement of civilians. However, it failed to bring the UK to peace talks, nor had any obvious effect on economic output. At the end of May the Germans called off The Blitz, and from then on the UK would be subject to dramatically lower rates of bombing. How much of this was due to the effects of the night fighter force has been a matter of considerable debate among historians. The Germans were turning their attention eastward, and most of the Luftwaffe was sent to support these efforts. Even in May, the losses represent only 2.4% of the attacking force, a tiny number that was easily <b>replaceable</b> by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had <b>replaceable</b> soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|The stone tool {{technology}} in {{use during the}} Middle Stone Age shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning approximately 300 kya, the large cutting tools of the Achuelian are gradually displaced by Levallois prepared core technologies, also widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progresses, highly varied technocomplexes become common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, retouched flakes, end and side scrapers, grinding stones, and even bone tools. However, the use of blades (associated mainly with the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Africa, blades {{may have been used}} during the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age onwards. Finally, during the later part of the Middle Stone Age, microlithic technologies aimed at producing <b>replaceable</b> components of composite hafted tools are seen from at least 70 ka at sites such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as <b>replaceable</b> instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E
5|$|The second {{generation}} Mac Pro has a redesigned configuration of ports. It has a HDMI 1.4 port, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, six Thunderbolt 2 ports, four USB 3 ports, and combined digital Mini-TOSlink optical / analog 3.5mm stereo mini jack for audio output. It {{also has a}} headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly selectable within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no dedicated port for inputting audio. The system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to thirty-six Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can concurrently support up to three 4K displays. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six Thunderbolt). The I/O panel illuminates itself when the unit senses it has been moved {{to make it easier}} for the user to see the ports. Unlike the previous model, it has no FireWire 800 ports, dedicated digital audio in/out ports, a SuperDrive, DVI port, 3.5-inch drive bays for <b>replaceable</b> storage drives, or changeable internal PCIe slots. Instead, there are six Thunderbolt 2 ports to connect high-speed external peripherals, including enclosures for internal PCIe cards.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Shearwater Research {{introduced}} the Predator {{as the first}} color OLED diving computer available with a user <b>replaceable</b> battery.|$|E
25|$|Renewable fuses have <b>replaceable</b> fuse elements, {{allowing}} the fuse body and terminals {{to be reused}} if not damaged after a fuse operation.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{carving knife}} and whittling knives: Knives used to shape {{wood in the}} arts of wood carving and whittling, often with short, thin <b>replaceable</b> blades for better control.|$|E
25|$|DJs {{generally}} use {{higher quality}} headphones than those designed for music consumers. DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate {{the sounds of}} the headphones from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and pivot joints to allow DJs to listen {{to one side of the}} headphones, while turning the other headphone away (so he/she can monitor the mix in the club), and <b>replaceable</b> cables. <b>Replaceable</b> cables enables DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.|$|E
25|$|IBM {{introduced}} the IBM Wheelwriter in 1984 {{as a replacement}} for the Selectric. The Wheelwriter featured a <b>replaceable</b> daisy wheel cartridge, had electronic memory, and offered many word processing features.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} {{surface is}} normally of vinyl or hardwood, engineered wood or laminate. For dance the surface may be <b>replaceable,</b> {{so that a}} theatre can adapt easily to either ballet or tap dance.|$|E
25|$|An {{open source}} project was {{proposed}} by former Siemens director Henrik Stiesdal in 2015 {{to be assessed}} by DNV GL. It suggests using tension leg platforms with <b>replaceable</b> pressurized tanks anchored to sheet walls.|$|E
25|$|The 90two is a 9mm/.40 {{variant of}} the 92-series with a redesigned, thicker slide and frame with an {{accessory}} rail, captive recoil spring, internal recoil buffer, <b>replaceable</b> sights, user changeable monogrips and 17-round magazines.|$|E
25|$|The <b>replaceable</b> {{models of}} implantable heart valve {{prostheses}} are typically supplied with a sewing or suturing ring surrounding the valve body or stent {{that is to}} be sutured by the surgeon to the valvar rim.|$|E
25|$|An {{advance on}} the basic design was the iron ploughshare, a <b>replaceable</b> {{horizontal}} cutting surface mounted {{on the tip of}} the share. The earliest ploughs with a detachable and <b>replaceable</b> share date from around 1000 BC in the Ancient Near East, and the earliest iron ploughshares from ca. 500 BC in China. Early mouldboards were basically wedges that sat inside the cut formed by the coulter, turning over the soil to the side. The ploughshare spread the cut horizontally below the surface, so when the mouldboard lifted it, a wider area of soil was turned over. Mouldboards are known in Britain from the late 6th century on.|$|E
25|$|Some snips have <b>replaceable</b> blades {{for when}} the blade becomes worn out. An added {{advantage}} to this {{is the ability to}} make the rest of the snips from a light weight material, usually aluminum. This helps to reduce fatigue.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009, Barnes and Noble {{launched}} the Barnes & Noble Nook, running an Android operating system. It differs from other e-readers {{in having a}} <b>replaceable</b> battery, and a separate touch-screen color LCD below the main electronic paper reading screen.|$|E
25|$|Beamish was {{the first}} {{regional}} open-air museum in England, and pioneered {{the concept of a}} living museum. By displaying duplicates or <b>replaceable</b> items, it was also an early example of the now commonplace practice of museums allowing visitors to touch objects.|$|E
25|$|A {{respirator}} is {{a device}} {{designed to protect}} the wearer from inhaling particulate matter, including airborne microorganisms, fumes, vapours, i.e. gases. Respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks to more robust reusable models with <b>replaceable</b> cartridges and are used by the military, private industry and the public.|$|E
25|$|Single-seat fighter (F.2s {{upgraded}} to near F.6 standard); featuring Avon 211R engines, retained ADEN cannon and Firestreak (<b>replaceable</b> Firestreak pack swappable with ADEN Cannon Pack {{for a total}} of four ADEN Cannon), arrestor hook and enlarged Ventral Tank for two hours flight endurance. A total of 31 converted from F.2.|$|E
25|$|The Glock 17T {{training}} pistol fires {{paint or}} rubber bullets. The two versions are easily recognizable from their bright blue frames: the Glock 17T 9mm FX, which fires Simunition FX cartridges and the Glock 17T 7.8×21 AC, which fires cartridges with paint and rubber bullets powered by <b>replaceable</b> pressurized air cartridges.|$|E
25|$|Commonly, {{toothbrushes}} {{are made}} of plastic. Such brushes constitute a source of pollution. In {{order to reduce the}} environmental impact, some manufacturers have switched to using biodegradable materials and/or use <b>replaceable</b> heads. In order to avoid plastic altogether alternative toothbrushes on offer consist of wooden handles (often bamboo) and bristles of bamboo viscose or pig bristles.|$|E
25|$|A {{respirator}} is a {{piece of}} protective respiratory equipment designed to protect the wearer from inhaling harmful particulate matter (as in dusts, including airborne microorganisms), fumes, vapors, or gases. They range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable masks to more robust reusable models with <b>replaceable</b> cartridges, and are used by the military, private industry and the public.|$|E
25|$|If {{the items}} in {{question}} are repaired, replaced or removed from the vehicle, {{the right of the}} owner to appeal becomes null and void. Failure because of items easily <b>replaceable,</b> such as tyres or windscreen wiper blades, may not be appealed against, as it cannot be adequately determined if they were the ones fitted at the time of inspection.|$|E
25|$|Like invertebrates, plants neither {{generate}} antibody or T-cell responses nor possess mobile {{cells that}} detect and attack pathogens. In addition, {{in case of}} infection, parts of some plants are treated as disposable and <b>replaceable,</b> in ways that very few animals are able to do. Walling off or discarding {{a part of a}} plant helps stop spread of an infection.|$|E
25|$|Whipped cream {{may also}} be made in a {{whipping}} siphon, typically using nitrous oxide as the gas, as carbon dioxide tends to give a sour taste. The siphon may have <b>replaceable</b> cartridges or be sold as a pre-pressurized retail package. The gas dissolves in the butterfat under pressure, and when the pressure is released, produces bubbles and thus whipped cream.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} {{surface is}} normally of vinyl or hardwood, engineered wood or laminate. For dance the surface may be <b>replaceable</b> so for instance a theatre can adapt easily to either ballet or tap dance, these are normally made of vinyl sheeting. Hardwood is however preferred for tap dance. Some sports have extra requirements like spike resistance or a standard ball bounce.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{aforementioned}} upgrades, DRDO has also assisted Hindustan Aeronautics with its programmes. These include the HAL Dhruv helicopter and the HAL HJT-36. Over a hundred LRU (Line <b>Replaceable</b> Unit)'s in the HJT-36 have come {{directly from the}} LCA programme. Other duties have included assisting the Indian Air Force with indigenisation of spares and equipment. These include both mandatory {{as well as other}} items.|$|E
25|$|Britain, Australia, {{and some}} other Commonwealth countries, as well as Japan and Sweden, also made {{extensive}} use of 7-inch sealed beams, though they were not mandated {{as they were in}} the United States. This headlamp format was not widely accepted in continental Europe, which found <b>replaceable</b> bulbs and variations in the size and shape of headlamps useful in car design. This led to different front-end designs for each side of the Atlantic for decades.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical filter {{respirators}} retain {{particulate matter}} such as dust created during woodworking or metal processing, when contaminated air is {{passed through the}} filter material. Wool is still used today as a filter, along with plastic, glass, cellulose, and combinations {{of two or more}} of these materials. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and <b>replaceable</b> cartridge models exist.|$|E
25|$|A {{confined}} space prop was located {{next to the}} main parking lot which was a large pipe with access ways buried under dirt. Trench rescue simulations were also held near this prop. One of the more recent additions to the academy is the flashover chamber. A peaked roof prop sits {{in the middle of}} the academy which utilizes <b>replaceable</b> 4x8 plywood sheets for firefighters to practice cutting roofs. There was at one time a flat roof prop as well.|$|E
25|$|Jaw crushers {{are heavy}} duty {{machines}} and hence {{need to be}} robustly constructed. The outer frame is generally made of cast iron or steel. The jaws themselves are usually constructed from cast steel. They are fitted with <b>replaceable</b> liners which are made of manganese steel, or Ni-hard (a Ni-Cr alloyed cast iron). Jaw crushers are usually constructed in sections to ease the process transportation {{if they are to}} be taken underground for carrying out the operations.|$|E
25|$|Eliminating the {{moisture}} source {{is the first}} step at fungal remediation. Removal of affected materials may also be necessary for remediation, if materials are easily <b>replaceable</b> and not part of the load-bearing structure. Professional drying of concealed wall cavities and enclosed spaces such as cabinet toekick spaces may be required. Post-remediation verification of moisture content and fungal growth is required for successful remediation. Many contractors perform post-remediation verification themselves, but property owners may benefit from independent verification.|$|E
