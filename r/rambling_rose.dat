5000|$|... "Rambler Roses", {{although}} technically {{a separate}} class, are often included in Climbing Roses. They also exhibit long, flexible canes, but are usually distinguished from true climbers in two ways: a larger overall size (20-30 feet tall is common) {{and of a}} once-blooming habit. Climbing and <b>Rambling</b> <b>Roses</b> are not true vines such as ivy, clematis, and wisteria because they lack the ability to cling to supports {{on their own and}} must be manually trained and tied over structures, such as arbors and pergolas. Examples include 'American Pillar' (once-blooming rambler), and 'Blaze' (repeat-blooming climber).|$|R
25|$|The Herbaceous Grounds (Order Beds) were devised in {{the late}} 1860s by Sir Joseph Hooker, then {{director}} of the Royal Botanic Gardens, so that botany students could learn to recognise plants and experience at first hand {{the diversity of the}} plant kingdom.

5000|$|The {{collaboration}} between King Louis Philippe I and Jacques, both great lovers of plants, {{led to a}} number of new plant varieties, in particular several new <b>rambling</b> <b>roses.</b> These stemmed in part from Rosa sempervirens, introduced from 1826 onwards and its varieties still popular today because of an ability to climb over arches, trellises and walls, producing a profusion of nodding flowers. Two of Jacques’ roses have received The Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit. Other varieties which remained popular were the 1828 ‘Félicité-Perpétue’ - Perpetua and Felicity were two Christian women martyred for their faith in Carthage in AD203. Jacques was one of the founding members of the [...] "Horticultural Society of Paris", created 11 June 1827 which became, in 1885, the National Horticultural Society of France. The sempervirens hybrids were named mainly for members of the King's family - [...] "Adélaide d’Orléans" [...] (after his sister), [...] "Princesse Louise" [...] (after his eldest daughter, the later Queen of Belgium), [...] "Princesse Marie", (his second daughter). The laboratory of Micromolecular Biology and Phytochemistry of the Université Claude Bernard in Lyon, has studied the genetic provenance {{of some of the most}} celebrated of Antoine Jacques’ roses, in an attempt to reveal their parentage.|$|R
5000|$|Prostrate plant forms {{may arise}} from {{deliberate}} breeding and hybridisation, such as the groundcover grevilleas, including Grevillea [...] "Poorinda Royal Mantle", and G. [...] "Bronze Rambler", or by selection of forms of plants growing in exposed areas. The windswept coastal heathlands and cliffs of far southeastern New South Wales have yielded Banksia 'Roller Coaster' and Banksia 'Pygmy Possum'. These are flattened varieties of less than 0.5 m in height of the species Banksia integrifolia and Banksia serrata, respectively, both of which grow to sizeable trees of 10 m (30 ft) or more in height. The origin of others is unclear; Cootamundra Wattle (Acacia baileyana) is a popular and widely used garden plant in Australia, a prostrate form of which is also in cultivation. Its origin is unknown, possibly a chance seedling in cultivation. It itself is a popular garden plant, its cascading horizontal branches good for rockeries. Many species of roses grow as long canes that can spread prostrate on the ground, {{and some of these}} have been hybridized to form climbing and <b>rambling</b> <b>roses</b> that can be allowed to grow on the ground without support, as well as varieties known as [...] "carpet roses" [...] that are intended to be grown as ground covers. Prostrate juniper, Juniperus communis subsp. alpina is a naturally occurring form of a popular evergreen. Many species of Cotoneaster, such as C. apiculatus, are prostrate ornamentals, as are the closely related Pyracanthas, and the humilis variant of sweetbox, Sarcococca hookeriana var. humilis. Heaths (Erica carnea and related species) and heathers (Calluna vulgaris) are prostrate shrubs often featured prominently in rock gardens. Wintergreens such as Gaultheria humifusa and Gaultheria procumbens are also prostrate growers. Although, strictly speaking, herbaceous, the North American bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), a member of the dogwood genus, can appear as a prostrate shrub when growing in the garden. Many daphnes, particularly those derived from Daphne odora, are prostrate growers, including forms that are highly fragrant and have variegated leaves, although they are short-lived. Some forms of the culinary herb rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) form prostrate shrubs when grown in Mediterranean climates, although they die back to the ground when grown where winters are colder.|$|R
