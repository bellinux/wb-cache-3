50|$|The No. 78 {{team was}} issued a P3 penalty for {{issues with the}} <b>roof</b> <b>flap</b> in pre-race inspection. As a result, crew chief Cole Pearn was issued a one-race {{suspension}} and a 50-thousand dollar fine. Martin Truex Jr. was also docked 15-points.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>roof</b> <b>flap</b> is an {{aerodynamic}} {{feature on}} race cars, mainly stock cars, which functions {{as an emergency}} spoiler to prevent the vehicle from lifting off the ground. The flaps are stowed during normal vehicle operation; however, in certain situations, e.g., if the vehicle goes into a spin, particularly if it is facing backwards, the flaps deploy to disrupt the air flow over the roof and reduce the lift force on the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Nelson was {{inducted}} into the West Coast Stock Car Racing Hall of Fame and is credited with many innovations still in use today in racing. <b>Roof</b> <b>flaps,</b> power steering, generation 5 NASCAR chassis, cowl flaps, are a few.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, NASCAR {{introduced}} <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> to the car, {{which is}} designed to keep cars from getting airborne and possibly flipping down the track. Following Rusty Wallace's crashes at Daytona and Talladega, Penske Racing designed the original <b>roof</b> <b>flaps.</b> NASCAR team owner Jack Roush helped improve on the design of the <b>roof</b> <b>flaps,</b> in conjunction with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona, Florida, USA. During spins, as a result of accidents or loss of handling, as the car rotates it eventually reaches an angle where the oncoming air reacts with the profile of the vehicle {{in the same manner as}} a wing. If the speed is high enough air flowing over the car's overall airfoil shape will create sufficient lift to force the car to become airborne. To prevent this, NASCAR developed a set of flaps that are recessed into pockets on the roof of the car. As a car is turned around and reaches an angle where significant lift occurs, the low pressure above the flaps causes them to deploy. The first flap oriented 140 degrees from the centerline of the car typically deploys first. After flap deployment, higher pressure air is forced through an air tube which connects to a second flap, deploying it. This second flap ensures that, should the car continue to spin, no further lift will be created as the vehicle's angle changes. The deployment of these flaps eliminates most of the lift on the vehicle. The <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> generally keep the cars on the ground as they spin, alt.|$|R
5000|$|NASCAR {{tested a}} {{restrictor}} plate at Charlotte that September but driver lobbying led to {{development of the}} <b>roof</b> <b>flaps.</b> [...] "We developed them so NASCAR would not slow the cars down more," [...] said the devices' primary engineer, Jack Roush.|$|R
50|$|Some modern {{race cars}} employ a passive {{situational}} spoiler called a <b>roof</b> <b>flap.</b> The {{body of the}} car is designed to generate downforce while driving forward. These roof flaps deploy when {{the body of the}} car is rotated so it is traveling in reverse, a condition where the body instead generates lift. The roof flaps deploy because they are recessed into a pocket in the roof. The low pressure above this pocket will cause the flaps to deploy, and counteract some of the lift generated by the car, making it more resistant to coming out of contact with the ground. These devices were introduced in 1994 in NASCAR following Rusty Wallace's crash at Talladega.|$|E
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} college, Pearn worked for Toyota, and later moved to North Carolina. He joined Richard Childress Racing in 2007, working with Kevin Harvick's No. 29 crew as an engineer. In 2010, he joined Furniture Row Racing {{as a team}} engineer, though he left for JTG Daugherty Racing in 2011. Pearn {{returned}} to FRR during the 2012 season, becoming the team's lead race engineer. On December 3, 2014, Pearn was promoted to crew chief of the No. 78, replacing Todd Berrier, who had departed the team to join Joe Gibbs Racing, and Pearn became the first regular Canadian crew chief in Cup Series history. In 2015, Pearn and driver Martin Truex, Jr. won the Axalta [...] "We Paint Winners" [...] 400 at Pocono Raceway, and Pearn became the first Canadian crew chief to win a Cup race. In 2016, Pearn was suspended for the Kobalt 400 after failing technical inspection at the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500; the team had also been penalized at the Daytona 500 the week before for <b>roof</b> <b>flap</b> problems.|$|E
50|$|On the roof, {{the pair}} chat {{and watch the}} cricket game before Eddie hears the bell and goes downstairs to serve a {{customer}}. Richie sets a trap for Eddie by sabotaging his deckchair, then he realizes that the <b>roof</b> <b>flap</b> cannot be opened from the outside and panics before Eddie opens the flap, hitting Richie in the face. Eddie then helps Richie to the booby-trapped chair and Richie injures himself further. When Eddie goes down to serve another customer Richie sets another trap with Eddie's favourite sandwich, pickled onion, where the trap door will smash Eddie's head. The plan backfires again and the hatch shuts, trapping both {{of them on the}} roof. People start looting the shop and Eddie climbs down the drainpipe to stop them. Unfortunately, Richie has removed the string that holds the pipe to the roof, so the pipe collapses to the ground with Eddie on it. Eddie does manage to stop the looting and returns to the roof. As soon as Eddie gets back up, the door slams shut and it begins to rain. The episode ends with Richie punching Eddie off the roof.|$|E
25|$|Key {{among the}} {{changes for the}} car {{included}} a carbon fibre hood and decklid, shaving 160 pounds from Sprint Cup cars, and new improved safety bars added to the roll cage. The <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> were increased in size to prevent the airborne accidents that marked the CoT's early life.|$|R
50|$|The Generation 6 car added {{additions}} of forward {{roof bar}} and center roof support bar to the roll cage to reinforce integrity {{and increase the}} crush structure of the <b>roof.</b> Larger <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> help to keep {{the car on the}} ground to prevent it from flipping whilst going backward at high speeds.|$|R
50|$|Dale Earnhardt {{was leading}} the race with two laps to go, but was passed by Mark Martin in the tri-oval coming to the white flag and spun around by Morgan Shepherd exiting turn 2 on the last lap. The car lifted over a foot but <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> {{prevented}} the car getting airborne. Earnhardt managed to save {{the car and drove}} it to a 21st-place finish.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} marked by two major accidents: Stanley Smith {{suffered}} near-fatal head injuries in a Lap 69 accident while Jimmy Horton flew over the wall and landed on an access road outside the track in the same crash. Later in the race, on Lap 132, Neil Bonnett flew into the catch fence similar to the Bobby Allison crash in 1987. That resulted in the introduction of <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> in 1994.|$|R
50|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held on July 4, 2013, {{in preparation for}} the race. The first session lasted for 80 minutes, while second session was 85 minutes long. Prior to the first practice session, NASCAR officials discovered illegal <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> in 16 cars. Every Joe Gibbs Racing, Roush Fenway Racing, Michael Waltrip Racing and Penske Racing cars were involved, along with Jamie McMurray, Marcos Ambrose, Casey Mears, Aric Almirola and Trevor Bayne.|$|R
25|$|At the 2010 Kobalt Tools 500 at Atlanta– {{the second}} to last race to use the rear wing– Carl Edwards made {{deliberate}} contact with Brad Keselowski (in retaliation for several events including the Talladega race the prior season), causing Keselowski to turn backwards and once more flip over despite the <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> being deployed. Keselowski flipped over once and crashed on his side door. Edwards was parked {{for the rest of}} the race and put on three-race probation.|$|R
50|$|Safety in NASCAR {{has evolved}} {{into one of the}} biggest {{concerns}} in stock car racing's largest sanctioning body. Mainly after the death of Dale Earnhardt, a seven time Winston Cup Series champion, NASCAR has decided to change all of their safety policies, {{such as the use of}} the HANS device. Since 2001, NASCAR has also changed the cars for the Sprint Cup Series and the Xfinity Series. NASCAR's safety policy includes the racing fire suit, carbon fiber seating, and <b>roof</b> <b>flaps.</b>|$|R

5000|$|NASCAR {{mandates}} that {{cars in the}} Sprint Cup and Nationwide series have two <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> positioned near {{the rear of the}} vehicle, with the left flap oriented perpendicular to the length of the car and the right flap angled 45° counter-clockwise (when looking downward) from the left flap. [...] Trucks in the Camping World Truck Series only have the angled flap, due to the smaller roof area of the pickup truck type greenhouse and lower overall lift potential of the body shape.|$|R
50|$|The {{restrictions}} {{are in the}} interest of driver and fan safety because higher speeds are closer to out-of-control than the 190 MPH range used for Daytona and Talladega; the severity of crashes at higher speeds is also much greater, shown by telemetry readings of wrecks such as Jerry Nadeau at Richmond and Michael McDowell at Texas that were far higher than registered on restrictor plate tracks. Drivers such as Rusty Wallace have also cited data showing that the sport's <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> cannot keep cars on the ground above 204 MPH.|$|R
25|$|On lap 323, Edwards, who was 150 laps {{down at the}} time, was angered {{enough with}} the {{previous}} contact with Keselowski to desire revenge. Edwards got retaliation for his incident with Keselowski a lap later by spinning him out on the front stretch. Keselowski turned airborne, barrel-rolled once (despite both <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> on his car deploying), and crashed on the driver's side door on the catch-fence. The crash was instantly described by NASCAR on Fox commentators Mike Joy and Darrell Waltrip as being eerily similar to the finish of the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega the year before, when Keselowski turned Edwards into the catch fencing in the tri-oval on the last lap to win the race, causing Edwards to get airborne.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, Parrott was {{reunited with}} Wallace at Penske Racing, winning 18 races together. Three years later, he joined Diamond Ridge Motorsports {{to work with}} Steve Grissom. However, Parrott left the team citing {{business}} disagreements with owner Gary Bechtel. In 1997, he joined Jeff Burton's crew, and helped him win the inaugural race at Texas Motor Speedway. Later that season, Parrott was fined $20,000 by NASCAR for improperly mounted <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> prior to the Winston 500 at Talladega. In 1998, he became the team manager for Mark Martin's Roush Racing team. At California Speedway that year, Parrott tripped over cords in the pit box, fracturing his ribs, but still celebrated Martin's victory in the 1998 California 500. He remained with the team {{until his retirement in}} 2001 after 34 years of service.|$|R
5000|$|The multi-car crash {{happened}} on lap 69 when Smith clipped Horton's car. Horton then hit three other cars before launching over the wall, ending up completely outside the track. In that crash, Smith {{hit the wall}} almost head-on and required medical attention. As {{a result of this}} and possibly other wrecks, Talladega installed [...] "catch fencing" [...] along the entire track, not just where spectator stands were present. Another effect of the crash is <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> on NASCAR cars. While Smith would never race in the Winston Cup Series again, he would return to competition in the regional Gatorade All Pro Series in 2001, and at the age of 54, win a series event at Kentucky in September 2004. Smith also drove in the Busch Grand National Series, making four starts between 1991 and 1992.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Keselowski {{replaced}} David Stremme in the No. 12 Dodge Charger in the Cup Series and ran {{the full}} Nationwide Series schedule {{as well in the}} No. 22 Discount Tire. In Atlanta, on lap 41, Keselowski unintentionally tapped Carl Edwards on a restart and Edwards went up to the wall to collect Joey Logano. Later, Keselowski appeared to be headed toward a top-5 finish at Atlanta with three laps to go when Edwards, apparently in retaliation for this accident, intentionally spun Keselowski. Keselowski's car caught air and despite the <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> working his car overturned, hitting the front-stretch wall roof-first in an accident that resembled the Talladega finish of the previous year. His new teammate Kurt Busch ended up winning the race. Edwards was parked by NASCAR and Keselowski was physically okay, but shaken up from the heavy impact.|$|R
50|$|Before {{competing}} in the Busch Series, Foster was an avid competitor at Florida tracks, winning more than 200 races {{by the age of}} 15. He then competed in the NASCAR Goody's Dash Series in 1996, winning once and clinching the series' Rookie of the Year award while finishing 7th in series points. His season got off to a wild start at Daytona though; while running 2nd, a tire blew on his car, sending him spinning before his car went airborne on the tri-oval for several feet before landing back on the track. He walked away okay, but the accident marked the last straw by Goody's Dash officials regarding airborne crashes as they mandated the <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> on all the cars, just like in NASCAR's top tier series, starting the next year in 1997, however airborne crashes and flips were still very common {{throughout the rest of the}} series' existence.|$|R
5000|$|... 1993: Dale Earnhardt edged Ernie Irvan by 0.005 seconds, {{the second}} closest finish in Talladega's history since the {{introduction}} of electronic scoring loops. The race was marred by two frightening crashes: On lap 69, Stanley Smith and Jimmy Horton got together in turn one, collecting six other cars. Horton's car took the worst hit, as it went up the track and over the outside wall, tumbled out of the racetrack down the embankment, and {{came to rest on}} a dirt access road. Though Horton was not seriously injured, Smith suffered a near-fatal basilar skull fracture; he would eventually recover. The incident led track officials to install catch fencing along the entire perimeter of the superspeedways (Daytona and Talladega), rather than just in spectator areas. On Lap 132, Neil Bonnett flew into the catch fence similar to the Bobby Allison crash in 1987. That resulted in {{the introduction of}} <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> in 1994.|$|R
40|$|The {{shape of}} a poultry {{building}} {{and the distribution of}} its elements (roof, windows distribution, and window opening) influence the velocity and temperature distribution inside the building and therefore the thermal comfort of the broilers. Considering these components, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to analyze the environmental conditions of 3 poultry buildings: tunnel (T), semi-tunnel (ST) and improved semi-tunnel (IST). These three buildings had the same dimensions but differed in the relative position of fans and windows. This study modelled the effect of different configurations of roof (flat or gable roof) and window design (with or without flap plate) on the distribution of temperature, air velocity and Index of Temperature and Velocity (ITV) at animal level (0. 20 m above the ground). Simulations were conducted for summer and winter conditions. In summer conditions, configuration IST with gable <b>roof</b> without <b>flap</b> plate had lowest air velocity 0. 72 ± 0. 27 m/s and average temperature (22. 9 ± 0. 9 ºC) whereas tunnel configuration with gable <b>roof</b> and <b>flap</b> plate had lowest ITV (22. 94 ± 1. 30 ºC on average). In winter conditions, IST configuration with flat roof had lowest average air velocity (0. 24 m/s), whereas the highest temperature corresponded to semi-tunnel with gable <b>roof</b> without <b>flap</b> plate of the slot opening (19. 35 ± 2. 67 ºC). Finally, the lowest ITV corresponded to tunnel without flap plate and gable roof configuration (19. 14 ± 3. 57 ºC). According to the CFD simulations, in three configurations the variables analyzed were within the comfort ranges reported for animals inside buildings...|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} foul with tobacco {{smoke and the}} reek of kerosene, for the big lamp smoked when the <b>roof</b> canvas <b>flapped</b> now and then. Sewell sat in a deer-hide chair with a pipe in his hand, and {{a man with a}} grim, bronzed face and a splendid corded arm showing through the torn sleeve of his shirt was speaking. He spoke quietly and like a man of education.|$|R
25|$|On {{the final}} lap of the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega, leader Carl Edwards swerved {{into the path}} of Brad Keselowski in order to prevent Keselowski from passing; Keselowski turned Edwards into the air and Edwards's car bounced off of the hood of Ryan Newman's car and flipped into the catch fence, then came to a rest {{in the middle of the}} track further down. Edwards was uninjured, but the crash was {{compared}} to an accident at Talladega in 1987 where Bobby Allison went airborne and hit the catch fence in a similar location. Allison's crash (coming at speeds 20 MPH faster than Edwards' crash) ripped out a 100-foot section of the catch fence, while Edwards' crash only bent the support poles. Seven spectators were injured in Edwards' accident from debris. The aftermath of the accident spawned questions about the aerodynamic features of the CoT, the nature of pack racing with restrictor plates, and the safety features of Talladega Superspeedway. Video replay showed that despite deploying, the car's <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> did nothing to stop the car from flipping– a common failing of the devices dating to their very first month in use– and the second hit from Newman flipped the car higher.|$|R
5000|$|... 2009: The {{race was}} set up in a green-white-checkered finish after Ryan Newman spun and blew over, landing on top of Kevin Harvick with five laps to go, in the same place and in an eerily similar matter to Sadler's 2003 blowover.. Newmans flip was the direct result of the rear wing on the Car of Tomorrow lifting the car off the ground and {{rendering}} the <b>roof</b> <b>flaps</b> useless; this crash, along with Carl Edwards' crash at the spring race and Brad Keselowski's crash at Atlanta the next year, was one of the factors in NASCARs decision to replace the wing with a more traditional spoiler in 2010. Before the cars got underway some ran out of fuel. Jamie McMurray led the restart alongside Brian Vickers; Vickers beat McMurray to the line, but was not penalized but McMurray squeezed ahead. When the field came off turn 4, Brad Keselowski spun Kurt Busch causing a chain reaction; Mark Martin tumbled on his roof and came back on his wheels as McMurray took the win. It was his 3rd career win and last for Roush as he went on to Earnhardt Ganassi Racing in 2010. The race was criticized because during the prerace drivers meeting Mike Helton told the drivers [...] "we will have a problem" [...] with tandem drafting in the corners. The drivers spent three periods of 15-20 laps riding single file, but the lead changed 58 times among 25 drivers, both season highs.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of vent type (side, roof or both) and of an anti-aphid insect screen on airflow and temperature distribution of a mono span greenhouse round arch roof with vertical side walls. The greenhouse was equipped with two side roll-up vents and a <b>flap</b> <b>roof</b> vent. A tomato crop planted in double rows was cultivated inside the greenhouse.

Furthermore, with the screen in the openings, the spatial heterogeneity of microclimate variables was reduced. As far as the vent opening is concerned, it was found that in the case of side openings only, the air velocity inside the greenhouse was characterized by a strong air current near the greenhouse ground and low air velocity near the roof while the combination of roof and side openings increased air velocity and decreased air temperature inside the greenhouse but increased also the spatial heterogeneity of the greenhouse microclimate.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimen-tally investigate the influence of vent type and of insect proof screens on ventilation rate of a round arch plastic covered greenhouse. The greenhouse was equipped with side roll-up win-dows and a <b>flap</b> <b>roof</b> window and {{is located at the}} University of Thessaly near Volos in the coastal area of Eastern Greece. Microclimate variables as well as the greenhouse ventilation rate (G) were measured. Two measuring meth-ods were used for the determination of G: (a) the decay rate tracer gas method, using N 2 O as tracer gas, and (b) the greenhouse energy bal-ance method. In order to study the effect of vent type on G, in a greenhouse with an insect proof screen in the vent openings, the G was deter-mined during periods were the ventilation was performed by (i) roof, (ii) side and (iii) both roof and side vents. Furthermore, in order to study the effect of insect proof screens on G, measurements were carried out also during pe-riods were the ventilation was performed by side vents without a screen in the openings. The two measuring methods gave similar results, but the tracer gas method provided a better fit to the experimental data. Concerning the ventilation performance, the results showed that the most effective vent configuration was the combina-tion of roof and side vents, followed by side vents only. As far as the effect of screens on ventilation rate is concerned, it was found that their use in the vent openings caused a green-house ventilation rate reduction of about 33 %...|$|R

The alt-azimuth telescope is fiber-coupled to a conventional echelle spectrograph with two resolutions (R= 30, 000 and 70, 000). We control this instrument with four computers running linux and communicating over ethernet through the UDP protocol. A computer physically {{located on the}} telescope handles the acquisition and tracking of stars.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of vent type (side, roof, or both) and of anti-aphid insect screens on airflow, air temperature, and air vapor pressure deficit distribution in a round arch, mono-span greenhouse with vertical side walls. The greenhouse was equipped with two side roll-up vents and a <b>flap</b> <b>roof</b> vent. A tomato crop planted in double rows was cultivated inside the greenhouse. The three components of air velocity were measured by a 3 -D sonic anemometer, and the air temperature and relative humidity were, simultaneously recorded at several positions inside the greenhouse.

The combined use of roof and side openings increased air velocity and decreased air temperature inside the greenhouse but also increased the spatial heterogeneity of the greenhouse microclimate compared to the cases with side or roof vents only. The most homogeneous climate conditions were achieved with the use of roof openings only.
