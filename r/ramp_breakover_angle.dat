50|$|Off-road {{geometry}} {{figures for}} approach, departure and <b>ramp</b> <b>breakover</b> <b>angles</b> are 22°, 21° and 18° respectively. Minimum running (lowest point) ground clearance is 8.7 in. Underbody (overall) ground clearance is 9.1 inches (230 mm).|$|R
50|$|Mobility {{parameters}} {{include a}} climatic operational range of -32 °C (-46 with kits) to +52 °C. The MTVR has a maximum speed of 105 km/h and on-road cruising range of 483 km. It can climb a 60% gradient and traverse a 40% side slope with its maximum cross-country load. It can ford 1.52m {{of water and}} surmount a 610 mm vertical step. Turning radius and approach, departure, and <b>ramp</b> <b>breakover</b> <b>angles</b> vary by variant.|$|R
5000|$|Assuming no tire deflection, and {{assuming}} an ideal <b>breakover</b> <b>angle</b> scenario (two flat surfaces {{coming to a}} point, a vehicle with the lowest point of the chassis located at its midsection, etc.), an approximation for the <b>breakover</b> <b>angle</b> of a vehicle can be calculated as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Breakover</b> <b>angle</b> is {{the maximum}} {{possible}} supplementary angle (usually expressed in degrees) that a vehicle, {{with at least}} one forward wheel and one rear wheel, can drive over without the apex of that angle touching any point of the vehicle other than the wheels. This definition is contingent upon the wheels being in continuous contact with the supporting surface(s). <b>Breakover</b> <b>angle</b> may also be referred to as [...] "break-over angle" [...] or [...] "break over angle." [...] <b>Breakover</b> <b>angle</b> is different from ground clearance in that ground clearance is the shortest distance between the ground and lowest point on the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Breakover</b> <b>angle</b> is a {{relevant}} performance metric in many common vehicle scenarios, including: ...|$|R
50|$|If {{a vehicle}} drives over a <b>breakover</b> <b>angle</b> larger {{than what it}} is capable of clearing, the vehicle will contact the apex of the angle, which will quite likely prevent the vehicle from {{continuing}} any further in its direction of travel, possibly even completely immobilizing the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|A {{suspension}} lift is a modification, often done by Jeep, truck, SUV and offroad enthusiasts {{to raise}} the ride height of their vehicle. Suspension lifts (also referred to as lift kits or leveling kits) enable steeper approach, departure, and <b>breakover</b> <b>angles,</b> higher ground clearance, and helps accommodate larger wheels and tires. Due to the raised center of gravity, maximum safe operating angles are reduced and roadholding is often significantly impaired with a lift kit.|$|R

50|$|A {{four-wheel drive}} (4MATIC) is {{optional}} on models with 4-cylinder diesel engines. In normal operation the system transfers driving {{power in a}} 35:65 split between {{the front and rear}} axles. The 4MATIC system does not have mechanical differential locks, but an electronic traction system (4ETS). If one or more wheels loses traction on a slippery surface, the system applies brief pulses of brake pressure to the spinning wheels thus increasing torque to wheels with good grip. Vehicles with four-wheel drive have a higher ride height, which increases approach, departure and <b>breakover</b> <b>angles</b> (20°/28°/19° respectively, versus 14°/22°/14° in conventional rear-wheel-drive models). The all-wheel drive adds 80 kg to the total weight of the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|The 2007 {{model year}} brought a {{complete}} redesign of the Jeep Wrangler, {{and also a}} four-door model. The TJ chassis was replaced by an all new JK platform. This next-generation Wrangler was noticeably wider than the previous model, with a 3.4 in wider track; and though the two-door model has a 2 in longer wheelbase, it is actually 2.5 in shorter in overall length than the TJ, allowing for a 44.3° approach angle and a 40.4° departure angle. With a larger factory available tire size of 32 inches, the <b>breakover</b> <b>angle</b> on the Rubicon is increased from 22.6° to 25.4°.The four-door Unlimited model has an over 20 in longer wheelbase at 116 in (2,950 mm) to offer much improved rear seating room, but is nevertheless only 2.4 in longer than the 2006 TJ Unlimited.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{generation}} Ridgeline has a 5 ft cargo bed {{which can be}} extended to 6.6 ft with the tailgate down. [...] The bed's width between the wheel-wells is 4.1 ft and 4.6 ft at its widest points. [...] The Ridgeline's drivetrain, frame, and suspension design allowed engineers to build the [...] "industry's first" [...] lockable, watertight, and drainable 8.5 cuft L In-Bed Trunk {{at the rear of}} the bed. [...] The cabin can accommodate five full-size adults with 2.6 cuft L of under-seat storage in the second row or [...] when the rear 60/40 split bench seat's bottom cushions are folded up. [...] It has 8.2 in of ground clearance with approach, departure and <b>breakover</b> <b>angles</b> of 24.5º, 22º, and 21º respectively while maintaining a comfortable entry/exit height for passengers.|$|R
50|$|The H3 {{featured}} a two-speed, electronically controlled {{full-time four-wheel drive}} system that made it for both on-road and off-road driving. Electronic locking front and rear differentials were optional. Like the Hummer H2, the H3 can ford 27 in of water (tested in depths up to 34 in) at a speed of 5 mph and 20 in of water at a speed of 20 mph. Standard ground clearance with the 31 inch tires measured at 9.7 in while the approach, departure, and <b>breakover</b> <b>angles</b> are measured at 37.4°, 34.7°, and 22.1° respectively, allowing the H3 to scale a 16 in vertical wall and negotiate grades of 60% and side slopes of 40%. Front and rear recovery hooks were standard, with an optional trailer hitch and wiring harness. The optional Adventure or Off Road package included 33 inch tires which increased its capabilities.|$|R
25|$|Useful {{features}} of the smaller Jeeps are their short wheelbases, narrow frames, and ample approach, <b>breakover,</b> and departure <b>angles,</b> allowing them to fit into places where full-size four-wheel drives have difficulty.|$|R
