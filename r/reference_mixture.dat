40|$|Individuals {{are exposed}} to {{chemical}} mixtures while carrying out everyday tasks, with unknown risk associated with exposure. Given the number of resulting mixtures it is not economically feasible to identify or characterize all possible mixtures. When complete dose-response data are not available on a (candidate) mixture of concern, EPA guidelines define a similar mixture based on chemical composition, component proportions and expert biological judgment (EPA, 1986, 2000). Current work in this literature is by Feder et al. (2009), evaluating sufficient similarity in exposure to disinfection by-products of water purification using multivariate statistical techniques and traditional hypothesis testing. The work of Stork et al. (2008) introduced the idea of sufficient similarity in dose-response (making a connection between exposure and effect). They developed methods to evaluate sufficient similarity of a fully characterized <b>reference</b> <b>mixture,</b> with dose-response data available, and a candidate mixture with only mixing proportions available. A limitation of the approach {{is that the two}} mixtures must contain the same components. It is of interest to determine whether a fully characterized <b>reference</b> <b>mixture</b> (representative of the random process) is sufficiently similar in dose-response to a candidate mixture resulting from a random process. Four similarity measures based on Euclidean distance are developed to aid in the evaluation of sufficient similarity in dose-response, allowing for mixtures to be subsets of each other. If a reference and candidate mixture are concluded to be sufficiently similar in dose-response, inference about the candidate mixture can be based on the <b>reference</b> <b>mixture.</b> An example is presented demonstrating that the benchmark dose (BMD) of the <b>reference</b> <b>mixture</b> {{can be used as a}} surrogate measure of BMD for the candidate mixture when the two mixtures are determined to be sufficiently similar in dose-response. Guidelines are developed that enable the researcher to evaluate the performance of the proposed similarity measures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Near-infrared (NIR) {{reflectance}} spectra for {{mixtures of}} ordered kaolinite and ordered ickite {{have been found}} to simulate the spectral response of disordered kaolinite. The amount of octahedral vacancy disorder in nine disordered kaolinite samples was estimated by comparing the sample spectra to the spectra of <b>reference</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The resulting estimates are consistent with previously published estimates of vacancy disorder for similar kaolin minerals that were modeled from calculated X-ray diffraction patterns. The ordered kaolinite and dickite samples used in the <b>reference</b> <b>mixtures</b> were carefully selected to avoid undesirable particle size effects that could bias the spectral results. NIR spectra were also recorded for laboratory mixtures of ordered kaolinite and halloysite to assess whether the spectra could be potentially useful for determining mineral proportions in natural physical mixtures of these two clays. Although the kaolinite-halloysite proportions could only be roughly estimated from the mixture spectra, the halloysite component was evident even when halloysite was present in only minor amounts. A similar approach using NIR spectra for laboratory mixtures may have applications in other studies of natural clay mixtures...|$|R

The bond-stress-versus-slip behavior of UWC is remarkably different from the one obtained using <b>reference</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Initially, the linear response is less stiffdue to a coupled effect related to lower strength and increase in the relative coarse aggregate concentration.

30|$|Compared to the {{requirement}} of porosity lower than 12  % according to DVGW W 300 (DVGW Arbeitsblatt W 2005), the porosity values of mixtures M 1 –M 3 are acceptable, while the Indonesian <b>reference</b> <b>mixture</b> Ref 2 had a higher porosity of 16.3  % due to its higher water/cement-ratio. Surprisingly, the industrial <b>reference</b> <b>mixture</b> Ref 1 showed the highest porosity of 17.3  % and in addition the highest share of capillary pores (see Fig.  11). The determination of the water absorption under atmospheric pressure and under a pressure of 150  bar produced similar tendencies. Mixture Ref 2 showed higher porosities than the optimised mixtures M 1 –M 3. However, mixture Ref 1 had a lower porosity in this case, which must be attributed to its unknown mixture composition. It could be possible that further chemical agents are admixed to enhance the sealing behaviour.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{equation}} of state previously developed for binary mixtures of hard spheres and hard diatomic molecules is extended to athermal binary mixtures of diatomic and linear triatomic molecules. The theory obtains the excess compressibility factor of the mixture by scaling the excess compressibility factor of a <b>reference</b> <b>mixture</b> of hard spheres. Spheres of species i in the <b>reference</b> <b>mixture</b> must have a molecular volume equal to the effective molecular volume of species i in the true mixture. This effective molecular volume is introduced {{to account for the}} fact that the excluded volume of a nonconvex molecule is greater than its real volume. The theory requires two parameters, namely the effective molecular volume of the mixture and the scaling parameter. Both can be derived from the geometry of the molecules which form the mixture.

These mixtures contained volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as acetone, isoprene, carbon disulphide, propan- 2 -ol, formamide, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, acetic acid, dimethyl ether, dimethyl sulphide, acrolein, furan, propanol and pyridine, recognized as the components of exhaled air. The model <b>reference</b> <b>mixtures</b> were prepared at three concentration levels— 10 ppb, 25 ppb, 50 ppb v/v—of each component, except for the COPD markers. Concentration of the COPD markers in the mixtures was from 0 ppb to 100 ppb v/v. Interpretation of the obtained data employed principal component analysis (PCA).

40|$|The {{measurement}} of {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) concentration changes, {{in the range of}} 10 ppt- 1 ppb, is essential in several applications. The World Meteorological Organization has identified a set of VOCs that are critical because of their long-term instability. The {{measurement of}} such changes demands generation of <b>reference</b> <b>mixtures</b> at a high accuracy and stability level. The dynamic preparation of gas mixtures based on diffusion is a suitable way of generating accurate <b>reference</b> <b>mixtures,</b> particularly of unstable VOCs. Diffusion rate and dilution gas flow rate uncertainties are the main contributors to the overall VOC concentration uncertainty. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the uncertainty of the diffusion rate. Stress is laid on the advantages offered by a modified measurand equation. The validity of this analysis and the modified equation has been confirmed experimentally. Temperature variability and mass difference uncertainty make the main contributions to the uncertainty: a 0. 01 ◦C variability results in a 0. 2 % uncertainty. The new measurand equation provides both a better indication of the systematic effects at a narrow temperature variability and a more realistic calculation of the uncertainty. The modified equation enhances calculation of uncertainty at the low diffusion rates needed to generate very low VOC concentration mixture...|$|R

In the present study, a thermoanalytical approach previously developed for quantifying trace levels of polymorphic impurity (form II metastable nuclei) in commercial salmeterol xinafoate powders has been successfully applied with slight modifications to ribavirin, an antiviral drug exhibiting roughly similar polymorph-dependent crystallization kinetics in melts to that of salmeterol xinafoate. Essentially, the approach involved modeling of the crystallization kinetics of both tested and reference drug materials in melts using the Avrami-Erofe'ev (AE) rate expression, derivation of a mathematical equation for relating the AE kinetic constant to the composition of <b>reference</b> polymorph <b>mixtures,</b> and the use of this derived equation (in the form of a calibration curve) to calculate the impurity contents of the tested samples from their computed AE constants.
