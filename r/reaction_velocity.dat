A spectrum of cytosol enzyme activities are {{defined in terms}} of <b>reaction</b> <b>velocities,</b> K 0. 5 s, and nucleotide partition after incubation with ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides. AMP and dAMP were dephosphorylated, but only AMP was deaminated in vitro. Although nucleotidase activity is much stronger in lymphocytes, AMP deaminase was the dominant degradative reaction in all erythrocyte and lymphocyte lysates under the conditions specified. For most cytosolic enzymes, ribonucleotides were preferred cofactors, implying that dADP and dATP often may be bystanders at metabolic events. The adenylate kinase-mediated partition of approximately equimolar ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide substrates yielded a very large preponderance of AMP in the monophosphate compartment, the monophosphates alone being directly vulnerable to degradative loss.

40|$|We {{experimented with}} a {{mathematical}} model for 1 -carbon metabolism and glutathione (GSH) synthesis to investigate the effects of vitamin B- 6 deficiency on the <b>reaction</b> <b>velocities</b> and metabolite concentrations in this metabolic network. The mathematical model enabled us to independently alter the activities {{of each of the}} 5 vitamin B- 6 –dependent enzymes and thus determine which inhibitions were responsible for the experimentally observed consequences of a vitamin B- 6 deficiency. The effect of vitamin B- 6 deficiency on serine and glycine concentrations in tissues and plasma was almost entirely due to its effects on the activity of glycine decarboxylase. The effect of vitamin B- 6 restriction on GSH concentrations appeared to be indirect, arising from the fact that vitamin B- 6 restriction increases oxidative stress, which, in turn, affects several enzymes in 1 -carbon metabolism as well as the GSH transporter. Vitamin B- 6 restriction causes an abnormally high and prolonged homocysteine response to a methionine load test. This effect appeared to be mediated solely by its effects on cystathionine β-synthase. Reduction of the enzymatic activity of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) had negligible effects on most metabolite concentrations and <b>reaction</b> <b>velocities.</b> Reduction or total elimination of cytoplasmic SHMT had a surprisingly moderate effect on metabolite concentrations and <b>reaction</b> <b>velocities.</b> This corresponds to the experimental findings that a reduction in the enzymatic activity of SHMT has little effect on 1 -carbon metabolism.

The rate of product formation is dependent on both how well the enzyme binds substrate and how fast the enzyme converts substrate into product once substrate is bound.

The importance of foam for carrying out a particular gas-liquid reaction is characterised by a criterion in terms of the fractional rate of reaction in the foam section. Trends of variations in the concentrations of dissolved free A, solute B, and gas-phase A with time of operation of the reactor are presented.

To identify the limiting step, we defined the relations among oxygen consumption, creatine kinase <b>reaction</b> <b>velocity</b> and cardiac performance in myocardium reperfused following mild, moderate, and severe ischemia. Isolated isovolumic ferret hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 37 degrees C. After 30 minutes of control, hearts were made ischemic for 20, 40, or 60 minutes and reperfused for 40 minutes. During preischemia, cardiac performance (estimated as the rate-pressure product), was 14. 8 x 10 (3) mm Hg/min, oxygen consumption was 16. 7 mumol/min/g dry weight, and creatine kinase <b>reaction</b> <b>velocity</b> measured by 31 P-nuclear magnetic resonance saturation transfer was 12. 7 mM/sec. For hearts reperfused after 20, 40, or 60 minutes of ischemia, rate-pressure product was 11. 5, 6. 5, and 1. 1 x 10 (3) mm Hg/min; oxygen consumption was 13. 5, 14. 2, and 6. 9 mumol/min/g dry weight; and creatine kinase <b>reaction</b> <b>velocity</b> was 9. 6, 5. 0, and 2. 0 mM/sec, respectively. Thus, with increasing severity of insult, creatine kinase <b>reaction</b> <b>velocity</b> decreased monotonically with performance (r = 0. 99). Changes in creatine kinase <b>reaction</b> <b>velocity</b> were predicted from the creatine kinase rate equation (r = 0. 99; predicted vs. measured velocity) and can therefore be explained by changes in substrate concentration.
