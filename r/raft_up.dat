6000|$|We talked it all over. It wouldn't do {{to take to}} the shore; we couldn't {{take the}} <b>raft</b> <b>up</b> the stream, of course. There warn't no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when {{we went back to the}} raft about dark the canoe was gone! ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{few minutes}} later and the raft struck on the shore. And well was it for the party that the weather chanced to be so fine, for {{if there had been}} {{anything}} like a breeze, their frail contrivance would inevitably have been dashed to pieces. Even a slight swell from the westward would have raised such a surf on that rugged shore {{that it would have been}} impossible for the best of swimmers to have landed without broken limbs, if not loss of life. As it was, they got ashore not only without difficulty, but even succeeded in hauling the <b>raft</b> <b>up</b> on the beach without much damage to its parts--though, of course, the unfortunate fowls in the hen-coops had all perished! ...|$|E

6000|$|... “We {{are getting}} near the rapids now,” Hurka said, “and this bank {{is the least}} {{dangerous}} of the two. Hitherto we have had nothing but {{the force of the}} stream to contend with, but now we shall have rocks. It is for this that we constructed the <b>raft.</b> <b>Up</b> to now we should have done far better to have come down in the canoe alone, but, once among the rocks, a touch would break her up, while the raft can scrape against them without injury. You will see that the aspect of things will change altogether; the banks where the rapids are, are high and steep, and the inundations will cease for a time. Once beyond the falls we shall again be in a flat country, and the inundations will extend almost all the way down until we reach the Amazon.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to build a bear trap, too," [...] said Giant. [...] "An old hunter from the West was telling me of the kind some Indians make. You take some logs and build a sort of raft of them and place it on the ground where the bear is likely to come. You raise one corner of the <b>raft</b> <b>up</b> and fix a couple of sticks under it, each {{fastened}} to another stick with a strong cord. On the cord you fasten the bait, and then {{on the top of the}} raft you pile some heavy stones. When the bear comes he tries to get at the bait, but the only way he can get under the logs and stones is by dropping down on his side. He works his way in, pulls on the bait, and down come the logs and stones on top of him holding him fast and most likely killing him." ...|$|E

50|$|The Chinchas {{were most}} famous for {{maritime}} commerce. Pedro Pizarro said that Atahualpa {{claimed that the}} ruler of Chincha controlled 100,000 sea-going rafts, undoubtedly an exaggeration, but illustrating the importance of Chincha and trade. Voyages via balsa <b>raft</b> <b>up</b> and down the Pacific coast from southern Colombia to northern Chile, possibly as far as Mexico, were a long-standing practice, the trade largely being in luxury items such as worked gold and silver and ritually-important Spondylus and Strombus seashells. Some authorities have asserted that the Chincha gained influence and control over much of this maritime trade only late in the fifteenth century. The Incas captured and dismantled {{the economy of the}} Chimu in northern Peru about 1470 and gave control of the trade to the Chincha, whose location near the Inca homeland in the highlands made Chincha a convenient entrepot. The source of both the balsa logs for rafts and the Spondylus and Strombus seashells was in Ecuador, 1400 km to the north, thus strengthening the view that the Chincha had an extensive reach to their trading activities.|$|E

One pumice raft {{was found in the}} Indian Ocean, near Calcutta on 1 and 3 October 1815. Clouds of thick ash still covered the summit on 23 April. Explosions ceased on 15 July, although smoke emissions were still observed as late as 23 August. Flames and rumbling aftershocks were reported in August 1819, four years after the event.|$|R
2500|$|Northwestern {{worked with}} the sternwheeler Cascades for these excursions. [...] On August 16, 1936, the two steamers carried a total of 500 people from the Portland sea wall on the 110 mile round trip to Bonneville. [...] That day, Cascades and Northwestern were <b>rafted</b> <b>up</b> {{together}} as passengers boarded, presenting a scene that had not occurred in Portland in many years. [...] Although the excursions themselves were popular, overall Northwestern was only seldom employed in the late 1930s, and had had little financial success.|$|R
5000|$|While naval Viking battles are not {{as common}} as battles on land, they did occur. Viking ships would often try and ram ships in the open sea. They would propel the boats by rowing fast {{directly}} at defending ships that were vulnerable and isolated from their fleet. To combat this, defending fleets would <b>raft</b> <b>up</b> with the bows of their boats facing the attacking Vikings. Depending {{on the size of}} the defending fleet, The Viking ships allowed them to maneuver their boats by rowing around such ships to flank them. When they got close enough, Vikings would throw spears and use their longbows. Archers would be positioned in the back of the ships protected by a shield wall formation constructed in the front of the ship. [...] If the Vikings were attacked while in the water they would wait until they were in fighting distance then group together to create one long line of boats, this made it easier to move between boats and made their formation more compactVikings attacked ships, not with the intent to destroy them, but rather to board them and take control. This is because Vikings originally based their battles around economic gains rather than political or territorial gains. Most of these battles took place with other Viking fleets, as they had little to fear from European countries invading the inhospitable regions of Scandinavia. Rather, many naval battles were fought amongst Vikings, [...] "Dane against Norwegian, Swede against Norwegian, Swede against Dane."If during a seafaring battle a Viking happened to get thrown overboard they were told to put their shield over their head to protect themselves from arrows or other shrapnel that could kill them.|$|E

Truck freight and other transportation companies built in the watershed. The city created the St. Johns Landfill on wetlands and small channels off the lower slough and built a new Portland Airport on land along the middle slough. Activists and civic leaders, concerned about pollution on the Willamette River, led cleanup campaigns, but voters declined to pay for sewage treatment. Pollution eventually grew so bad on the slough that mill workers refused to handle logs that had been stored in its water.|$|R
5000|$|Business {{fell for}} the {{traditional}} passenger only boats as interurban train routes and then automobiles came to dominate transportation. In 1917, the small steamer Swan and, reportedly [...] Urania were transferred to Puget Sound, where they continued to be operated by Anderson Steamboat Company in passenger service to Port Orchard. [...] This is doubtful as to Urania as she burned for a total loss off Houghton on February 12, 1912. [...] In 1926, the steamers Bremerton (ex-Kitsap) and Reliance, belonging to the Kitsap County Transportation Company, were <b>rafted</b> <b>up</b> together with the Anderson tug Dart. A fire started and all three vessels were destroyed.|$|R

50|$|Later, Francis H. Leggett {{was one of}} the {{pioneering}} ships behind the technique of ocean rafting (also called Benson rafting), whereby large rafts of logs were chained together and towed.
