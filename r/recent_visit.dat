The Venezuelan revolutionary General Francisco de Miranda had been feted in London society during his <b>recent</b> <b>visit,</b> and may have met MacGregor. Noting the treatment London's highest circles gave to Miranda, MacGregor formed the idea that exotic adventures in the New World might earn him similar celebrity on his homecoming. He sold the small Scottish estate he had inherited from {{his father and grandfather}} and sailed for South America in early 1812. On the way he stopped in Jamaica, where according to Rafter he was tempted to settle among the planters and traders, but [...] "having no introductory letters to that place, he was not received into society".

500|$|Rose is {{featured}} in the first twelve Doctor Who New Series Adventures novels, which expand on her characterisation. The first three of these novels—The Clockwise Man, The Monsters Inside and Winner Takes All—were published in May 2005 and feature solely the Ninth Doctor and Rose. The Monsters Inside depicts Rose's first visit to an alien planet, her travels previously having been confined to earth and orbiting space stations. Rose mentions this visit to the planet Justicia in the first series television episode [...] "Boom Town" [...] which aired 4 June 2005. The second batch of Ninth Doctor novels—comprising The Deviant Strain, Only Human and The Stealers of Dreams—were released in September 2005 and expand on the Doctor and Rose's travels with Jack Harkness. The novel Only Human mentions that Rose was engaged to a previous love interest before becoming involved with Mickey. The events of [...] "Boom Town" [...] are addressed in The Stealers of Dreams in which Jackie complains that Rose did not alert her to her <b>recent</b> <b>visit</b> to modern day Cardiff. The first three novels to feature Rose and the Tenth Doctor—The Stone Rose, The Feast of the Drowned and The Resurrection Casket—were released in April 2006 {{to coincide with the}} broadcast of the second television series.
