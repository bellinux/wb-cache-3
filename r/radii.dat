5|$|Atomic <b>radii</b> vary in a {{predictable}} and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the <b>radii</b> generally decrease along each {{period of the}} table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group. The radius increases sharply between the noble gas {{at the end of}} each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic <b>radii</b> (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|From {{the core}} {{out to about}} 0.7 solar <b>radii,</b> thermal {{radiation}} is the primary means of energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar <b>radii</b> to the 0.7 <b>radii,</b> the top of the radiative zone.|$|E
30|$|Ball <b>radius</b> The {{quality of}} the reconstructed surface depends heavily on the ball <b>radius.</b> Increasing the ball <b>radius</b> causes loss of details and {{creation}} of holes in the reconstructed surface (Figs.  25, 26). Computation time also increase with increase in ball <b>radius</b> value, {{up to a certain}} threshold <b>radius.</b> After the thresholding ball <b>radius,</b> increase in the <b>radius</b> causes the computation time to decrease exponentially, although the reconstruction quality goes down drastically as we go beyond the thresholding ball <b>radius</b> (Figs.  27, 28). A slightly larger ball <b>radius</b> is generally preferred in case of noisy and low density point clouds.|$|R

This region {{begins at}} {{a height of}} 60km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth <b>radii,</b> and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth. There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10million electron volts (MeV)). The inner belt is 1–2Earth <b>radii</b> out while the outer belt is at 4–7Earth <b>radii.</b> The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter trojans have orbits with <b>radii</b> between 5.05 and 5.35AU (the mean {{semi-major axis}} is 5.2±0.15AU), and are {{distributed}} throughout elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points; each swarm stretches for about 26° along {{the orbit of}} Jupiter, amounting to a total distance of about 2.5AU. The width of the swarms approximately equals two Hill's <b>radii,</b> which {{in the case of}} Jupiter amounts to about 0.6AU.

5|$|The ionic <b>radii</b> of the {{alkali metals}} are {{much smaller than}} their atomic <b>radii.</b> This is because the {{outermost}} electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the effective nuclear charge has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.|$|E
5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is {{sometimes}} referred to as an accretion disk, because while the young T Tauri-like protostar is still contracting, gaseous material may still be falling onto it, accreting on its surface from the disk's inner edge.

50|$|A perfect code may be {{interpreted}} as {{one in which the}} balls of Hamming <b>radius</b> t centered on codewords exactly fill out the space (t is the covering <b>radius</b> = packing <b>radius).</b> A quasi-perfect code is one in which the balls of Hamming <b>radius</b> t centered on codewords are disjoint and the balls of <b>radius</b> t+1 cover the space, possibly with some overlaps.

50|$|The atomic <b>radius</b> of a {{chemical}} element {{is a measure of}} the size of its atoms, usually the mean or typical distance from the center of the nucleus to the boundary of the surrounding cloud of electrons.

5|$|The {{solar wind}} exerts a pressure, {{and if it}} could reach Earth's {{atmosphere}} it would erode it. However, it is kept away by {{the pressure of the}} Earth's magnetic field. The magnetopause, the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere.
