40|$|An {{approach}} to the steady-state simulation of heat pumps and <b>refrigerating</b> <b>equipment</b> is presented. Novel features of the proposed model are the strategy and formalism adopted in the programme development. Individual mathematical models for component design are linked to enable the simulation of a basic vapour compression cycle. This paper introduces some of the component modules, {{which can be used}} for pure as well as mixed refrigerants. Because numerous models can be used for a specific piece of equipment making up the whole refrigerating/heating unit, the Modular Modelling approach leads to a flexible and evolutive structure. A machine can actually be built-up from component libraries that include several types of heat exchangers, compressors and expansion devices and the effects of operating conditions or component geometrical parameters on cycle performance can be examined. Because actual test data are used to "calibrate " the component modules, very accurate results are obtained. The proposed model is validated with experimental results from an air-to-air split unit using R 22 and a water chiller using R 22 and R 407 C. Discrepancies smaller than 5 % are obtained on the cooling duty and COP of the split unit and the chiller components...|$|E

To carry out the experiment a test bench was built, consisting of two cylindrical adsorbers filled with activated carbon, condenser, evaporator, oil heater and two oil coolers. Thermal oil circulation was responsible for providing and receiving heat from adsorbers.

40|$|The concept “Controlling the atmosphere” Cold stores {{alter the}} {{temperature}} inside an enclosed chamber {{through the use}} of refrigeration. To save operating costs of the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>equipment,</b> insulation as a thermal barrier is used during construction to minimise external heat ingress. Depending on the product types stored, the cooling is distributed inside the chambers using fans which circulate cool air – in case of frozen temperature goods, the cold air need only shield the cargo, to isolate it from exterior peripheral walls and other heat ingress. In the case of living fresh produce, the cold air must additionally envelope each individual piece and penetrate interstitial space in storage to evacuate other gases & heat produced due to respiration. This is ordinary storage and does not involve any change to the base atmospheric composition. Controlled atmospheres are essentially those which deviate from the normal air composition of 21 % oxygen, 78 % nitrogen and 380 ppm of carbon dioxide. Other gases are also present but normally in too small a concentration to have a prime effect on stored produce.

First, the paper provides an overview of the safety classification described in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 34 - 2007, Designation and Safety Classification of Refrigerants (ASHRAE 2007) and its international equivalent ISO Standard 817 - 2006, Refrigerants [...] Designation and Safety Classification (ISO 2006). The refrigerant blends examined were A 1, as formulated, and A 2, at the "worst-case fractionated formulation," as defined by ASHRAE Standard 34 - 2007. The blend is prepared in a cylinder and is then slowly leaked inside a test chamber of 1 m 3 (35. 31 ft 3). At the beginning of the leak, the gas phase occupies 10 % of the cylinder volume, corresponding to one of the leak scenarios featured in ISO Standard 817 - 2006. The concentrations inside the test chamber are measured by gas chromatography. In addition, this paper provides the algorithm of calculation of a computer code named Room_leak, which simulates leaks of any refrigerant blends in realistic scenarios. © 2009, American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc...|$|E

40|$|Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) {{widely used}} in {{neutrino}} detectors are critical to reconstructing {{the direction of the}} neutrino accurately. Large photocathode coverage, compact design and good time properties for single-photoelectron light are essential performances to meet the requirements for the next generation detectors. Therefore, a novel digital optical module housing 31 3 -inch. diameter PMTs is developed. In order to maximize the effective photocathode area and improve the time performance, a modified PMT with a larger photocathode area and 10 dynodes is optimized with the aid of the CST Particle Studio in this paper. Based on the Monte Carlo method and finite integration theory, the main characteristics of the modified PMT, such as uniformity, collection efficiency, gain and transit-time spread, are investigated. As the earlier stages of the PMT contribute the greatest weight to the total transit time spread, the transit time spread of single-photoelectron from photocathode to the first dynode (TTSCD 1) is discussed mainly in this paper. The influences of the dynodes position on collection efficiency and TTSCD 1 are analyzed. The voltage ratio scheme is also optimized slightly to obtain better collection efficiency and minimum TTSCD 1. By tracing the trajectories of secondary electrons from the first to the second dynode stage, dynodes are optimized for improving timing performance and secondary electrons collection efficiency. Direct collection efficiency of secondary electrons from the first dynode to the second is improved from 56. 38 % to 61. 01 %. The effective photocathode diameter of the modified PMT is increased from traditional 72 mm to 77. 5 mm and the effective area of photocathode is increased by 30. 87 % compared with the traditional one. What is more, the length of the new PMT is reduced to 103 mm so that the available space of the multi-PMT digital optical module is increased by 63. 09 % compared with the traditional one containing the high-voltage power supplies, front-end and readout electronics, <b>refrigerating</b> <b>equipment,</b> etc. The simulation results show that the mean collection efficiency of the modified PMT is similar to 96. 40 % with the supply voltage of 1000 V and it changes little by changing the supply voltage from 900 V to 1300 V. The mean transit time spread from photocathode to the first dynode is similar to 1 ns which is better than the transit time spread of the traditional model. And the gain can reach above 10 6 with a supply voltage of above 1100 V. </p...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Douglas Reindl and Sanford Klein; 156 pp. Refrigerated warehouses play an important link in the storage of food products throughout the year under conditions specially suited to prevent their decay. In doing so, refrigerated warehouses serve as an indispensable link in maintaining the availability of otherwise seasonal food products all year round. A proper humidity and temperature level has to be maintained in the warehouse at all times to make this possible. The operation of the warehouse is an energy intensive process; however, under many electricity pricing tariffs, there are no cost benefits of adopting operating strategies that shift electrical usage to lower price (off-peak) periods, i. e., a demand-shifting strategy. But, with the deregulation of utility rate structures, {{there has been a}} gradual shift towards Real- Time Pricing (RTP), whereby the electricity price varies every hour. The RTP rate is a typical example of the demand-supply interaction. The RTP structure offers consumers the incentive of reducing their electricity bill if they can shift their loads from high price to low price periods. The benefit to the end-user is reduced utility operating costs (even with equal or slightly higher energy usage). The utilities benefit by being able to reduce their cost of electricity generation by stimulating stability in their aggregate demand of electricity through pricing signals. It is with these thoughts in mind that this study investigates possible operating cost gains for high-temperature refrigerated warehouses by adopting operating strategies that shifts refrigeration system operation to lower price periods. By utilizing the thermal mass of the stored product, the warehouse refrigeration equipment can be operated {{in a way that would}} minimize the energy bill of the warehouse. Demand-shifting involves pre-cooling products stored in the warehouse to lower temperatures during low electricity price periods, and shutting off or operating the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>equipment</b> at reduced capacity during periods of high electricity prices. This strategy offers the possibility of shifting electrical usage from higher price to lower price periods resulting in the potential for realizing operating cost savings. A constraint in this process is the thermal risk to stored products. In all operating scenarios, stored product quality or food safety must not be compromised. The warehouse being investigated in the current study is a high-temperature warehouse, or a "cooler", which means that the storage temperature in the warehouse is above the freezing point. Also, it is a distribution warehouse, which means that the stored products arrive "at-temperature", dwell in the warehouse for a short time and then ship to the market "at-temperature". A computer simulation model for a warehouse located in Madison, WI was developed in TRNSYS. The simulation model includes the construction details of the warehouse as well as models for the refrigeration equipment needed to maintain desired storage temperatures. The infiltration exchange between the warehouse zones, and also between the warehouse and the ambient was modeled. The warehouse set-point temperature controller was developed to operate the refrigeration equipment depending on the time of the day and the maximum allowable product temperature. Two different models were developed for the stored products. The first assumed the product to behave as thermally lumped using a lumped capacitance model. The second discretized the product using a three-dimensional finite difference approach. An economic analysis is performed for three different utility rate structures and the results indicate that following the demand-shifting strategy can lead to savings, without adversely affecting the quality of the stored product. The actual value of savings and the percentage savings depend on the utility rate structure in force...|$|E
