50|$|The mid- {{to lower}} {{slopes of the}} Gran Sasso are grazed in spring, summer and autumn by large flocks of sheep guarded by Maremmano-Abruzzese sheepdogs as well as herds of cattle and semi-wild horses. The {{pastures}} are covered with field grasses and meadowland wildflowers. The park is also the habitat for diverse wildlife from rare species such as the Apennine wolf, the Marsican bear, wildcat and the Abruzzo chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata), a variety of chamois at {{the very edge of}} extinction but now making a comeback in the park through a joint effort by WWF Italia and the park administration. Other species of wildlife include wild boar, foxes, grass snakes such as Orsini's viper, and a wide variety of bird life including golden eagles, peregrine falcons, goshawks, ortolan <b>buntings,</b> <b>rock</b> sparrows, crested larks, red-backed shrikes and downy pipits.|$|R

50|$|The female <b>rock</b> <b>bunting</b> is a washed-out {{version of}} the male, with paler underparts, a grey-brown back and a less contrasted head. The {{juvenile}} {{is similar to the}} female, but with a streaked head.|$|E

Some {{endangered}} birds like the bearded vulture and Himalayan griffon {{can also be}} seen here.|$|E
50|$|Birds of prey {{such as the}} Bonelli's eagles and {{peregrine}} falcons {{roam the}} desert's skies. Lesser hunters include kestrels and eagle owls. Species such as the blue rock thrush, rock sparrow, <b>rock</b> <b>bunting</b> inhabit the rocky areas of the desert whereas warblers, goldfinches, golden orioles and serins prefer the rambalas near the dry river beds.|$|E

Smaller birds also occur, including the western yellow wagtail, meadow pipit, common chaffinch and brambling. Much less common species have on occasion also been observed in the area, such as little egret, black stork, Steller's eider, short-toed snake eagle, Blyth's reed warbler, great reed warbler, eastern olivaceous warbler, barred warbler, brown warbler and <b>rock</b> <b>bunting.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{terraces}} are, {{in addition}} to their agricultural engineering significance, examples of great cultural historical value, their organisation and often masterful architecture witnessing {{as far back as the}} Middle Ages. The small scale structure of the plots forms protective barriers against plant disease and provides habitats for a variety of warmth-loving flora and fauna. The Apollo butterfly, the green lizard, the wallflower and <b>rock</b> <b>bunting</b> are only the best known representatives of the ecosystem of the Terraced Moselle that have been recorded in the case studies of small animals and plants of the region.|$|E
50|$|The very {{attractive}} and unreachable Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius) lives at high altitudes. Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) breeds in this area. Griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) are common. Chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar) {{has a high}} population and nests between stone and shrubs. Red-fronted serin (Serinus pusillus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), snow finch (Montifringilla nivalis), rock sparrow (Petronia petronia), <b>rock</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza cia) and horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) are native; in winter {{they come to the}} lower hill sides. In each spring wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), rock thrush (Monticola saxatilis), and nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) come from Africa for breeding. Grey-necked bunting (Emberiza buchanani), black-headed bunting (Emberiza melanocephala) and common rosefinch (Carpodacus erythrinus) come from India.|$|E
40|$|High {{mountain}} rangelands host important {{populations of}} threatened bird species, {{but can be}} affected by extensive changes in land use. I studied the breeding bird community of two shrubland plots at 1, 850 – 2, 100 m a. s. l. in the Pyrenees. Breeding territories were mapped for four years, {{before and after the}} prescribed burning, the aim of which was to increase the grazing value of the study area. The most abundant species (reaching ≥ 3 breeding pairs/ 10 ha in at least one plot and one year) were Dunnock Prunella modularis, Dartford Warbler Sylvia undata, Stonechat Saxicola torquatus, <b>Rock</b> <b>Bunting</b> Emberiza cia and Ortolan Bunting E. hortulana. The open-shrubland plot contained a similar number of breeding species (10 vs. 9), but a lower overall density (23 vs. 28 breeding pairs/ 10 ha) than the dense-shrubland plot. Most breeding species alsooccurred in winter. After fire, the number of bird species, overall density and conservation value (an index that takes into account all species’ densities and their categories of conservation concern in Europe) decreased, but tended to recover afterwards. These results may help understand the composition and dynamics of bird assemblages in managed mountain area...|$|E
