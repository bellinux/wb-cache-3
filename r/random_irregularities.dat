In the latter half of this paper, an approximate calculation method for wire-grids with slight <b>random</b> <b>irregularity</b> in their spacings between wires is proposed by treating the irregularity as a small perturbation to the theory for regular grids. A comparison with preliminary measurements for actual wire-grids in millimeter- and submillimeter-wave regions demonstrated that this method is effectively applicable to wire-grids whose irregularity is not too much.

And {{the influence of}} slab length on dynamic characteristics of the system under different track conditions and train speeds are theoretically studied. The calculated results show: (1) In general, the acceleration of each component of the coupled system decreases {{with the increase of}} slab length under the perfectly smooth track condition; (2) Slab length has different influence laws on acceleration of each component of subway train-steel spring floating slab track-tunnel coupled system under <b>random</b> <b>irregularity</b> of track condition.

40|$|In {{the past}} three decades the thermal noise {{spectroscopy}} was recognized as a fruitful tool of space plasma diagnostics. Some examples of application of this diagnostic method can be found, for example, in [1]. It is well known that <b>random</b> <b>irregularities</b> of electron density always present in real plasma. Irregularities substantially change properties of the me-dium with relation to electromagnetic radiation and they may also influence quasi-thermal noise spectrum detected by antenna. What is the physical mechanism of this influence? It is known, that fluctuations in plasma are closely con-nected with plasma dissipative properties. From the viewpoint of statistical mechanics, <b>random</b> <b>irregularities</b> in plasma may be thought as non-thermal large-scale (in comparison with characteristic time and scale of particle motion) fluctua-tions. These may considerably change collisional term in kinetic equation and, consequently, velocity distribution func-tion. The change in distribution function will lead to change in the noise spectrum. From the viewpoint of electrody-namics, <b>random</b> <b>irregularities</b> change averaged dielectric properties of the medium. It means that in the media with ran-dom irregularities the roots of dispersion equation are shifted with relation to undisturbed values and even new roots may appear (see, for example, [2]). The imaginary part of these roots may also be considerably changed due to addi-tional non-collisional attenuation caused by scattering of waves in random medium.

40|$|Based on vehicle-track coupled dynamic theory, a {{three-dimensional}} asymmetric vehicle-track coupling vibration model is developed {{to investigate the}} effect of voided elastic two-block sleepers on vehicle and track system dynamic responses. For the vehicle system, one car body, two frames, and four wheel sets {{are assumed to be}} rigid, with 35 degrees of freedom (DOF). For the track system, the rails and the concrete two-block sleepers are the main vibration components. The rails are modelled as Timoshenko beams, and the concrete two-block sleepers are assumed to be rigid mass with vertical and lateral movement. The pads under the rails and the rubber boots under the sleepers provide greater vertical and lateral elasticity for the track. The Hertz nonlinear elastic contact theory is used to calculate the normal wheel/rail force. The wheel/rail tangent creep force is first calculated using Kalker’s linear creep theory and then modified by the Shen-Hedrick-Elkins theory. The results show that the asymmetric voided elastic two-block sleepers have greater effects on the dynamic responses for fasteners and sleepers than on the car body and the wheel/rail forces under measured geometric <b>irregularity</b> and <b>random</b> <b>irregularity.</b> Two or more voided sleepers will greatly affect the vehicle running safety...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new random vibration-based {{assessment}} method for coupled vehicle-track systems with uncertain parameters when subjected to <b>random</b> track <b>irregularity.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The uncertain parameters of vehicle are described as bounded random variables. The track is regarded as an infinite periodic structure, and the dynamic equations of the coupled vehicle-track system, under mixed physical coordinates and symplectic dual coordinates, are established through wheel-rail coupling relationships. The <b>random</b> track <b>irregularities</b> at the wheel-rail contact points are converted to a series of deterministic harmonic excitations with phase lag by using the pseudo excitation method. Based on the polynomial chaos expansion of the pseudo response, a chaos expanded pseudo equation is derived, leading to the combined hybrid pseudo excitation method-polynomial chaos expansion method. Findings – The impact of uncertainty propagation on the random vibration analysis is assessed efficiently. According to GB 5599 - 85, the reliability analysis for the stability index is implemented, which can grade the comfort level by the probability. Comparing to the deterministic analysis, it turns out that neglect of the parameter uncertainty will lead to potentially risky analysis results. Originality/value – The proposed method is compared with Monte Carlo simulations, achieving good agreement. It is an effective means for random vibration analysis of uncertain coupled vehicle-track systems and has good engineering practicality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: By {{means of}} {{establishing}} the continuous elastic three layer beam model for track structures with <b>random</b> <b>irregularity</b> {{of the track}} vertical profile, a methodology of analysing track vibration by Fourier transform technique is presented. First, the vibration equations of the track structure are transformed by Fourier transform. The vibration displacements in Fourier transform domain are solved with this transformed equation. Then, the vibration responses of the track structure are obtained by performing inverse Fast Fourier Transform. As an application example, vibration analysis of the track for railways with mixed passenger and freight traffic is car-ried out. Influences of different speeds of passenger and freight trains and different line grades of the track irregularity on track vibration are investigated. The {{studies show that the}} worst situation for railways with mixed passenger and freight traffic is from freight trains. The track displacement and the track acceleration as well as the track dynamic forces on the ground resulting from freight traffic are larger by 54 – 57, 39 – 47, and 52 – 56 per cent, respectively than those from the passenger trains when both passenger and freight trains are running at the same speed. Also, the irregu-larity of the track vertical profile has great impact on track vibration.
