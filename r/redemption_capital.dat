40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to identify the major areas needing reform in the co-operative regulatory framework of the small state of Malta and to evaluate possible alternatives. Objectives were achieved by {{the analysis of the}} legal framework and the conduct of semistructured interviews. Findings indicate a general yearning for co-operative regulation to be less paternalistic and to allow greater financial and operational autonomy to co-operatives and their institutions. However, results highlight the importance of upholding the distinct co-operative identity encompassed by the co-operative values and principles. The article concludes that it is the areas of co-operative financing, the distribution of returns and the role of co-operative institutions needing most addressing. Recommendations include amending the provisions relating to the <b>redemption</b> of <b>capital</b> upon member exit, removing the asset lock on ploughed-back surpluses, and updating regulations regarding representative co-operative organisations and the Maltese co-operative funding entity, the Central Co-operative Fund. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|M. B. A. A {{share buyback}} scheme is a {{situation}} where a company buys back its shares from shareholders and then cancels them or creates treasury shares. The Companies Act, 1973 (Act 61 of 1973), previously limited the {{reduction in the number of}} shares to preference shares which could only be redeemed by a transfer of the equal amount to the <b>capital</b> <b>redemption</b> reserve fund, a non-distributable reserve in order to maintain the capital levels. Section 85 of the Companies Act now allows a company to buy back its ordinary shares and cancel them without replacing them with a <b>capital</b> <b>redemption</b> reserve fund. The only requirement is that the company must prove that they will be liquid and solvent after undertaking such a share buyback. This has far-reaching consequences for the creditors who rely on the capital maintenance rule as the only protection afforded to them should the company go bankrupt. The reduction in the number of shares after the share buyback also creates problems. Firstly, the company's operating capabilities can be reduced, damaging the remaining and future shareholders and secondly, the company's earnings per share (EPS) can improve without any improvement in the actual performance. This tends to make the Annual Financial Statements (AFS) unreliable as the users still rely on the EPS for an indication of whether the company is growing or not. Companies use a share buyback for various other reasons, the most important of which being that they want to distribute excess cash back to shareholders. Some of these companies, however, go back to the lending houses to borrow money to finance their current operations immediately after the share buyback. It is imperative to investigate the real reason why companies undertake a share buyback and what effect this has on the profitability and the earnings per share of listed companies in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{textbook}} arbitrageurs who instantaneously trade {{when prices}} deviate from fundamental values, real world arbitrageurs must overcome various frictions. For example, they often invest other people’s money, {{resulting in a}} principal/agent problem that is exacerbated in market downturns. Rather than increasing investment levels when prices dip below fundamental values, arbitrageurs may, {{in the face of}} capital constraints, sell cheap securities causing prices to decline further. As a result, mispricings can be large and can extend for long periods of time. We first study the convertible bond market in 2005 when convertible hedge funds faced large <b>redemptions</b> of <b>capital</b> from investors. These redemptions led to binding capital constraints for many funds, resulting in massive bond sales and, in many cases, fund liquidations. These sales reduced prices of convertibles relative to fundamental values, especially around redemption dates. While the group of multistrategy hedge funds that were not capital constrained increased their overall position, about half of these hedge funds actually acted as net sellers, consistent with the view that information barriers within a firm (not just relative to outside investors) can lead to capital constraints for trading desks with mark-to-market losses. We document similar patterns in the convertible bond market around the collapse of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998. When LTCM incurred large losses on macroeconomic bets, the firm was forced to liquidate large convertible bond positions. These sales led to depressed valuations of convertible bonds...|$|R
6000|$|The {{experiment}} {{which has}} attracted most {{attention in the}} past has [...] been that of the Messrs. Briggs, at their collieries in Yorkshire, [...] England.(330) The relations between the owners and the laborers [...] were as bad as they could well be. “All coal-masters is devils, [...] and Briggs is the prince of devils,” ran the talk of the miners, [...] when they did not choose to send letters threatening to shoot the [...] owners. In 1865 Messrs. Briggs tried the plan of an industrial [...] partnership with their men, purely from business considerations. [...] Seventy per cent of the cost of raising coal consisted of wages, [...] and fully fifteen per cent of materials which were habitually [...] wasted. The whole property was valued, and divided into shares of [...] $50 each, of which the owners retained two thirds, together with [...] the control of the business. The remaining one third of the shares [...] was offered to the employés. If any subscriber was too poor to pay [...] $50 for a share, the subsequent dividends and payments were to be [...] applied to purchasing the share. After reserving a fair allowance [...] for expenses, like the <b>redemption</b> of <b>capital,</b> whenever the [...] remaining profits exceeded ten per cent on the capital, that [...] excess was to be divided into two equal parts, one of which was to [...] be distributed among all persons employed by the company in [...] proportion to their wages, and the other was to be retained by the [...] capital. In previous years but once had they made ten per cent [...] profit on their capital, and twice only five per cent. In the [...] first year after the new system came into operation, the total [...] profits were fourteen per cent, and the four per cent of excess [...] was divided, two to the laborers’ bonus, and two to the capital, [...] so that capital received twelve per cent. In the second year the [...] profits were sixteen per cent, in the third year seventeen per [...] cent; the first year the work-people received in addition to their [...] wages $9,000, in the second $13,500, in the third $15,750. The [...] moral effect was striking. Work was done regularly, forbearance [...] was exercised, habits improved, and the faces of the men were set [...] toward improvement in life.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Providing {{basic access}} to water and {{sanitation}} is critical for poverty alleviation and stimulating economic growth, {{but at the same}} time it is putting a huge strain on South Africa’s existing economic infrastructure. Local governments allow their existing wastewater infrastructure to deteriorate to the extent that it no longer functions according to its design, and then apply for capital funding for refurbishment. Capital investment alone will not provide a sustainable solution to meet the increased demand on the ageing wastewater infrastructure, since local governments do not have the financial means and technical capacity to adequately maintain and operate their infrastructure. A paradigm shift is required to develop alternative and innovative business models to ensure a sustainable solution providing continued and consistent capacity as a basis for further expansion. Public-private partnerships (PPP) could provide a feasible solution towards building a sustainable technical capacity at local governments. Engaging the private sector must however not be aimed towards access to private sector finance, but rather the improvement in operational efficiency and increased level in service. Obtaining private sector finances will be the wrong focus for engaging in PPP undertakings in South Africa. Private operation must be combined with public financing. The design-build-operate (DBO) model with public financing would be highly viable. Such an arrangement will hold no financial risk to the private sector entity with revenue collection strictly remaining a local government function. The DBO method of delivery (with public funding) will be an effective way to realize cost savings, achieve efficiencies in construction and operation, utilize expertise, and most importantly, for skills transfers and capacity building at local government level. Ultimate sustainability will only be achieved once local government is able to raise the majority of its own funds for operation and maintenance through tariffs and other instruments, including some towards <b>capital</b> <b>redemption.</b> Grant funding must make provision for maintenance and operation of all capital funded projects. All shareholders must join forces in lobbying this concept at the highest political echelons because in terms of Section 154 of the Bill of Rights, national and provincial governments have a duty towards local governments to support and strengthen their capacity, to effectively perform their functions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Some investors {{may not be}} able to use {{leverage}} at all or {{they face}} different margin requirements. Investing in securities with high-embedded leverage enables those investors to obtain desired level of market exposure without violating their margin constraints. Investors in hedge funds can gain access to this high-embedded leverage by investing in hedge fund share classes that have leverage multipliers higher than one. Hedge funds characteristically exploit different arbitrage and speculative investment strategies. These strategies typically entail illiquid assets, and to obtain the flexibility hedge funds often restrict investors’ ability for <b>capital</b> <b>redemptions.</b> This is done by applying different share restrictions. Illiquid investments can also yield to serially correlated returns. This study employs extensive hedge fund database, which is constructed by merging five individual databases. The use of this database contributes to previous academic studies, since such thorough database has not been employed in studies concerning hedge funds. Furthermore, this study contributes to the recent academic studies by investigating the return differences between unleveraged and leveraged hedge fund share classes. Additionally, this study considers, whether the return spread is larger for hedge funds that invest in illiquid assets. Finally, this study investigates whether some predefined macroeconomic and risk factors are able to explain those returns differences. This study finds two specific implications that contribute to the previous academic literature. First, there exists a return difference between unleveraged and leveraged share classes, and that difference is statistically and economically significant. Second, return difference can be partly explained by some macroeconomic and risk variables. Aggregate hedge fund flow has a positive relationship with the return difference and it acts as a key variable in explaining those return differences. Additionally, this study finds that overall movements in financial markets affect the returns of leveraged hedge fund share classes. Increases in different risk variables cause leveraged share classes to reduce their exposures and their leverage is not constantly at the promised level. This makes them to resemble more their unleveraged pairs and induces return difference to decrease. As a conclusion, returns of leveraged share classes, scaled with their respective leverage, are lower than the returns of unleveraged share classes. This finding brings important implications for hedge fund investors. Ability of some macro and risk variables to explain the return difference helps investors to understand the factors affecting the return spread and help them to time leveraged hedge fund investments properly...|$|R
