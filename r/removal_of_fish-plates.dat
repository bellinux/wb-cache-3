40|$|General EcologyThe {{invasive}} cattail Typha x glauca (referred to hereafter as Typha) decimates {{species diversity}} and abundance of native flora after its introduction to Great Lakes marshes. In some areas the conservation and restoration of marshes is of high priority, however, the optimum management option for controlling Typha growth and reproduction {{has yet to}} be determined. This study, conducted in a marsh in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan, examines the impacts of different types <b>of</b> management (<b>removal</b> <b>of</b> above ground Typha biomass, and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> above and below ground Typha biomass) on the changes in species diversity in the marsh and on the biomass and height of Typha populations following management. We found that Typha biomass decreased significantly with <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> above and below ground biomass, and decreased insignificantly with <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> above ground biomass. <b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> above ground biomass significantly decreased Typha height, but <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> above and below ground biomass did not have a significant impact. Species diversity increased more with <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> above and below ground biomass than <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> only above ground biomass. Our conclusions are that <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> both above and below ground biomass is optimum to achieve higher species diversity and increase the abundance and number of native species in the marsh, but that <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> only above ground biomass due to limitations on labor or available funding for removal would still result in benefits to the native plant community while reducing Typha success. However, we caution that <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> only above ground biomass may have to be repeated over time as the Typha community regenerates from the rhizomes left behind...|$|R
