40|$|The new {{accounting}} standards IFRS and IAS was implemented in January 2005, {{the purpose was}} to harmonize {{accounting standards}} world wide. As a result of these new rules the real estate companies are allowed to appraise real estates assets at market value. It has long been debated whether this appraisal fulfils the requirements for relevance, reliability and comparability. The paper attends to how banks control the information given by the real estate companies in the process of credit granting. As an introduction we describe the purpose of accounting and the problematic´s about appraisals with market values. Further on there is a discussion on which factors are taken into consideration when banks grant credits. The study is built on interviews at three different commercial banks. At each bank one bank advisor was interviewed, the respondent were given specific questions {{and at the same time}} were free to speak openly about the subject. In conclusion all banks focus on the real estates companies ability to repay the bank credits with revenues from the investment. With the focus on <b>reimbursement</b> <b>banks</b> will minimize the risk of credit losses and thereby decrease the risk of history repeating itself with new bank crisis. Besides the ability to repay credits banks also consider the fact’s, who is leading the company and how this owner has conduct prior businesses. In comparison whit theory and empirics all banks, in there credit granting process, fulfil the requirements for relevance, reliability and comparability. In summary the banks do not consider real estates valued at market prices as a problem in there assessments...|$|R

40|$|Other written product {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO commented on the U. S. Trade Deficit Review Commission's authority to compensate an executive level IV Export-Import Bank employee that it would like detailed to it to serve as its executive director. The Commission's statute provides authority to appoint staff without regard to civil service laws and regulations, but it limits the compensation the Commission may pay to executive schedule level. To detail the employee under the Economy Act with full <b>reimbursement</b> to the <b>Bank</b> would violate the pay limitation. However, the Commission's statute also provides authority for any federal employee to be detailed to the Commission without reimbursement and without loss of civil service status or privilege. To avoid violating the compensation limitation, the Commission proposes to reimburse the Bank for the employee's compensation at the level V rate, with the Bank providing the amount over level V. Since this arrangement appears to satisfy the language and intent of the pay limitation and the detail provisions, GAO has no objection. ...|$|R
40|$|The US deposit {{insurance}} system (managed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – FDIC) {{has been established}} in 1933 {{to ensure the safety of}} deposited money and the overall stability of the banking sector. Although over decades the system proved to be successful in accomplishing those goals, there were some discussions and efforts in the 2000 s to reform it further. And indeed, it was reformed twice – in 2005 - 2007 and 2008 - 2009. But there was a fundamental difference between those reforms: the former had been carried out at a time of very good economic and financial conditions (strong economic growth, wealthy banking system, etc.) while the latter was prompted by a serious crisis situation (similarly like the reforms following the 1920 - 30 s and 1980 - 90 s crises). The paper is mostly related to the United States. It first outlines the main features of the US {{deposit insurance}} system prior to the recent reforms. Then, the paper presents the reasons and results of the 2005 - 2007 reform of the deposit insurance system in the United States. The results are relating to merging the former insurance funds into a new one, providing the FDIC with greater flexibility in managing the fund and in setting risk-based premiums, maintaining the standard coverage limit at $ 100, 000 but increasing the coverage limit for retirement accounts to $ 250, 000, and indexing both to inflation, etc. Next, the paper presents the 2008 - 2009 reform that was prompted by the aggravation of the current financial crisis (which had been started by the US subprime mortgage crisis in 2007). It discusses two main elements of this reform, i. e. temporary increasing the standard coverage limit to $ 250, 000 and the restoration plan in order to restore the fund’s reserve ratio to the required level. Moreover, the paper discusses some potential changes to the US deposit insurance system that could be implemented in the future – suggesting that, even after the recent reforms, there is still some room for further reforming the system. Finally, there is also a chapter relating to the European Union. In 2005 - 2006, the EU conducted the review of the directive on deposit guarantee schemes (adopted in 1994), but it concluded that there was no need to amend it. The financial turmoil, which started in the US and had serious impact in Europe in 2007 and 2008, caused much more urgency to reforming the EU deposit guarantee schemes. Thus, the paper presents the recent amendments to the directive (proposed in October 2008 and finally adopted in March 2009) that had been prompted by the aggravation of the current global financial crisis (in September 2008), as well as some potential changes to be discussed in the near future. It discusses the following issues: increasing coverage levels to € 50, 000 and € 100, 000, abandoning co-insurance, speeding up payouts, risk-based premiums, funding mechanisms, a pan-EU deposit guarantee scheme, potential roles of deposit insurers in early intervention and bank resolution, depositor awareness and literacy, etc. The paper includes some recommendations for the EU (e. g. € 100, 000, € 200, 000, and € 500, 000 as fixed harmonized levels for standard deposits, retirement accounts, and temporary high balances respectively) based on the recent reforms of the US deposit insurance system (as well as some solutions adopted or proposed recently in the UK).
