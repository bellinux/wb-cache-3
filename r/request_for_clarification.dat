5|$|Two minor controversies marked Beshear's {{tenure as}} {{attorney}} general. The {{first came in}} the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the 1980 case of Stone v. Graham. The ruling struck down the state law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in all of the state's classrooms on grounds that it violated the Establishment Clause of the federal constitution. State Superintendent Raymond Barber asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether its ruling meant that all of the copies of the Commandments already posted had to be taken down or whether it simply invalidated the Kentucky requirement for them to be posted; the Court refused the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification.</b> Beshear then issued an advisory opinion that displaying the Commandments in classrooms under any circumstances was banned by the Court's ruling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined This study {{examined}} the relationship between speech recognition, working memory and conversational skills in a group of 13 children/adolescents with cochlear implants (CIs) between 11 and 19 years of age. Conversational skills were assessed in a referential communication task where the participants interacted with a hearing peer of the same age and gender. The measures were the number of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> produced, time used to solve the task and the proportion of the different types of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> made by the participants with CIs. The results revealed that speech recognition correlated significantly with the general measures of conversational skills (time to solve the task and the total number of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> used). General working memory was associated with certain types of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification.</b> The participants with better working memory capacity used more <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> confirmation of new information (i. e. made more suggestions of their own) and fewer <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> confirmation of already given information compared to the participants with poorer working memory. It thus seems as if both speech recognition and working memory contribute to conversational skills but in different ways. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables. ...|$|R
40|$|In beginner's Japanese classes, <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> are {{frequently}} observed. As these requests {{are used to}} native speakers outside of a class, they {{can be considered as}} a communication strategy. However, the requests in a class can be defferent from those outside of a class, because a teacher can infer what a student intends, to say in a class. This article examines characteristics of the <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> in beginner's Japanese classes from the viewpoint of its form and intention of expression. <b>Requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> have many forms ending in a verb and a plain-noun (without desu), and the intention include many <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> confirmation and explanation. From these observations, it is necessary to teach the forms ending in a polite-noun (with desu) to request confirmation. This form would become more accurate and polite when expressing both the Wh-question and the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> enhancement explanation...|$|R
2500|$|After the Guardian {{published}} the story, the Chicago Police provided a statement saying, without specifics, {{that there is}} nothing improper taking place at what it called the “sensitive” location, home to undercover units. The statement said “CPD [...] abides by all laws, rules and guidelines pertaining to any interviews of suspects or witnesses, at Homan Square or any other CPD facility. If lawyers have a client detained at Homan Square, just like any other facility, they are allowed to speak to and visit them.” The Guardian said several attorneys and one Homan Square arrestee have denied this. The CPD statement continued by saying [...] "There are always records of anyone who is arrested by CPD, and this is not any different at Homan Square." [...] The Guardian said the Chicago Police statement did not address how long into an arrest or detention those records are generated or their availability to the public, and that a department spokesperson did not respond to a detailed <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Under the Laws, it {{is illegal}} to play an {{opponent}} without the ball, except in a scrum, ruck or maul; referees usually interpret this as authorising the common practice of [...] "clearing out the ruck", that is, physically removing an opponent who is taking part in the ruck, and rarely penalise the practice if it happens within close proximity to the ruck. The Laws also prohibit dangerous tackles, though they make no specific mention of the [...] "spear tackle". In the light of such video footage as was available to him at the time, the laws, and referee reports, the citing commissioner concluded that there was no case for Mealamu and Umaga to answer: [...] he did not, of course, have available to him the full footage (which only emerged later), or the benefit of the IRB's subsequent ruling on proper interpretation of the laws. In September 2005, in response to a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> from O'Driscoll's home union, the Irish Rugby Football Union, the IRB's Laws Committee ruled that the act of lifting a player off his feet in a tackle and dropping him {{in such a way that}} his head or upper torso hits the ground first is a dangerous tackle; they further ruled that such an act constitutes dangerous play no matter where it occurs in the game.|$|E
2500|$|Michael W. McConnell {{has written}} that the U.S Supreme Court's {{decision}} on December 12 [...] "may have reached the right result for the wrong reason." [...] McConnell points to the Florida Supreme Court's December 11 opinion, which characterized December 12 as an [...] "outside deadline". Here is the pertinent excerpt from the December 11 opinion of the Florida Supreme Court:However, according to Nelson Lund, {{one might argue that}} the Florida Supreme Court was discussing the [...] "protest provisions of the Florida Election Code, whereas the issues in Bush v. Gore arose under the contest provisions." [...] Likewise, Peter Berkowitz {{has written that}}, [...] "Perhaps it would have been more generous for the Court to have asked the Florida court on remand whether 'outside deadline' referred to contest-period as well as protest-period recounts." [...] Abner Greene has pointed to evidence that [...] "the Florida Supreme Court thought all manual recounts – whether protest or contest – must be completed no later than December 12." [...] Nevertheless, Greene concluded that, [...] "lack of clarity about the Florida Supreme Court’s views on the safe-harbor provision should have resulted in a remand to that court for clarification," [...] in addition to the remand of December 4. The Court in Bush v. Gore did remand the case instead of dismissing it, but the remand did not include another <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification.</b> Louise Weinberg argues that, even giving the Court {{the benefit of the doubt}} that it acted appropriately in intervening in Florida state law, its actions should be deemed unconstitutional because its intervention was not coupled with any kind of remedy aimed at determining the actual outcome of the election.|$|E

40|$|Background: This study investigates {{responses}} to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> in conversations between children/adolescents with cochlear implant (CI) and normally hearing peers. Earlier studies have interpreted a more {{frequent use of}} requests of confirmation (yes/no interrogatives) in the CI group as a conversational strategy used to prevent communication breakdowns and control {{the development of the}} conversation. This study provides a continuation of this line of research, now focusing on {{responses to}} <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification.</b> Aims: The aim was to examine the type and distribution of responses to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> in a referential communication task. In addition, we analysed the compliance between the type of response and the type of request as a measure of mutual adaptation. Methods & Procedures: Twenty-six conversational pairs aged 10 - 19 years participated: 13 pairs consisting of a child/adolescent with CI (CI) and a conversational partner (CIP); and 13 pairs consisting of a normally hearing control (NH) and a conversational partner (NHP). The pairs performed a referential communication task requiring the description of faces. All occurrences of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> and their responses in the dialogues were identified and categorized. We also analysed how the different types of requests and responses were combined and the type-conformity of the responses to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> confirmation. Outcomes & Results: The results showed no significant group differences regarding type, distribution or type-conformity of responses. In all four groups (CI, CIP, NH and NHP), a discrepancy between the request and the response was found, indicating that the response provided information that was not explicitly <b>requested.</b> <b>Requests</b> <b>for</b> confirmation constituted 78 - 90 % of the requests, whereas only 54 - 61 % of responses were confirmations. Conversely, the proportion of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> elaboration was 6 - 15 %, whereas the proportion of elaborated responses was 34 - 40 %. Conclusions & Implications: The children/adolescents with CI contribute equally to the conversation regarding type and distribution of responses to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification.</b> The frequent use of elaborated responses indicates common ground for the conversational partners and a shared understanding of the objective of the task. The context creates facilitative conditions, with positive interactional consequences. The results have implications for the design of intervention, where tasks such as this {{can be used to make}} children with CI more aware of the role of questioning strategies in interaction...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study investigates gaze {{behaviour}} {{in child}} dialogues. In earlier studies {{the authors have}} investigated the use of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> and responses in order to study the co-creation of understanding in a referential communication task. By adding eye tracking, this line of research is now expanded to include non-verbal contributions in conversation. Aims: To investigate the timing of gazes in face-to-face interaction and to relate the gaze behaviour {{to the use of}} <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification.</b> Methods & Procedures: Eight conversational pairs of typically developing 10 - 15 year olds participated. The pairs (director and executor) performed a referential communication task requiring the description of faces. During the dialogues both participants wore head-mounted eye trackers. All gazes were recorded and categorized according to the area fixated (Task, Face, Off). The verbal context for all instances of gaze at the partner's face was identified and categorized using time-course analysis. Outcomes & Results: The results showed that the executor spends almost 90 % of the time fixating the gaze on the task, 10 % on the director's face and less than 0. 5 % elsewhere. Turn shift, primarily <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification,</b> and back channelling significantly predicted the executors' gaze to the face of the task director. The distribution of types of requests showed that <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> previously unmentioned information {{were significantly more likely to}} be associated with gaze at the director. Conclusions & Implications: The study shows that the executors' gaze at the director accompanies important dynamic shifts in the dialogue. The association with <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> indicates that gaze at the director can be used to monitor the response with two modalities. Furthermore, the significantly higher association with <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> previously unmentioned information indicates that gaze may be used to emphasize the verbal content. The results will be used as a reference for studies of gaze behaviour in clinical populations with hearing and language impairments...|$|R
