40|$|In the eighties, the {{relatively}} low ratio of U. S. national saving has been increasingly criticized. Many observers were concerned about its continued decline and the widening gap between the U. S. savings ratio and that of many other industrial countries. The savings rate decreased {{from an average of}} 7. 9 p. c. in the period from 1973 to 1980 to an average of 3. 2 p. c. between 1981 and 1987 (Table 1). In particular, {{the relatively}} low and declining U. S. propensity to save has at least partly been made responsible for the United States becoming a net importer of capital since 1982, and for their running a large current account deficit at the same time. This is viewed as violating the general rule that a <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> <b>country</b> should export capital rather than compete with developing countries for internationally mobile capital and thereby driving up borrowing costs for those countries. The behavior of countries like West Germany - having a relatively high propensity to save, exporting more capital than importing, and thus running large current account surpluses - is therefore considered more appropriate. ...|$|E
40|$|Last year I {{traveled}} to Bangkok, Thailand, {{for the second}} Asia Pacific Adaptation Forum, which was called off {{at the last minute}} due to the city's worst flooding in the past 50 years. Bangkok, an urban center of great wealth in a <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> <b>country,</b> showed itself to be quite vulnerable to climate impacts. The flooding caused 815 deaths, massive displacements of population, and $ 45 billion in economic damage, including lasting damage to its automobile and electronics supply chains. Similarly, the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005 caused 1, 836 deaths and $ 81 billion in damage. Thus, while it is certainly true that development can ameliorate some aspects of climate change vulnerability, we surely should not be fooled into thinking that development, sustainable or not, comprises the entire solution to the climate change adaptation challenge. At the very least, developing countries can find, and are finding, new development pathways that avoid some of the maladaptation that has already occurred in the developed world. Additionally, developing and developed countries alike can benefit from improving ecosystem management {{as an integral part of}} policies to help reduce vulnerability and increase resilience in the face of climate change...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] The {{possibly}} {{most important}} economic challenge in Europe is low {{economic growth in}} the medium run. Italy is no exception; its labour market is among the least performing in Europe. This is should not come as a surprise. Economic growth has been lagging in Italy for some 15 years. According to IMF data, only 3 countries out of more than 180 have had lower economic growth than Italy. It is also certainly the case that Italy still remains a <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> <b>country,</b> with a ratio between private net wealth and income {{that is one of the}} highest in the world. This wealth, however, is concentrated in the top 10 per cent of wealthiest households and, in particular, is held by relatively older generations. The disappointing performance of the Italian economy is also aggravated by population ageing and sharp fiscal consolidation induced by the debt crisis. In such economic context, it is very difficult to offer young generations’ relevant opportunities. In fact, in addition to this disappointing growth performance, it is important to notice that the Italian social system, its labour market and educational system are poorly designed to address the needs of younger generations. All these factors combined are causing a rising inter-generational conflict, a conflict that the current recession is aggravating even further. This paper provides two main contributions. First, it documents how this economic environment affects the level of employment and unemployment and the various related features in the Italian labour market. Second, it discusses some of the major institutional changes that took place in the Italian labour market, how they fostered a dual labour market where young generations are heavily burdened and what challenges for policy still remain ahead...|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} paper, I {{take a small}} step toward {{reconciling}} two conflicting views about land market liberalization: one is a “win‐win” view, typically encouraged by the World Bank and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and the other “win‐lose” (win for rich and lose for poor) view, usually supported by numerous non‐profit organizations such as La Via Campesina, the Oakland Institute, GRAIN, Food First, and many others (See for example Nierenberg and Pollack ([13])). To this end, I analyze a general equilibrium model within which I can investigate the effects of land market liberalization on the dynamics of capital accumulation and on the well‐being of a nation. The world economy consists of identical countries that differ in their levels of agricultural sector productivity and the initial capital stock. The model is set up {{in such a way}} that, in the absence of land market liberalization, a country with a relatively more productive agricultural sector converges monotonically to a unique steady state and achieves higher capital stock, higher wage income, higher consumption, and higher welfare in general.d This result can be tempting to conclude that poor countries will benefit from the land market liberalization if such liberalization comes with the transfer of more efficient agricultural technology. In this paper I demonstrate that, as a result of land market liberalization, the unique steady state can lose its stability property and two asymptotically stable steady states come in existence. The unique steady state can become unstable because, with the integrated land markets, the land price in different countries must move together. This creates a disadvantage for relatively poor countries because of low income elasticity of agricultural demand. The land market will crowd out domestic investment in capital and will create a negative spillover for next generations. That is to say, a low aggregate investment in capital lowers the income of the next generations of the same country, creating a downward spiral of low‐income/low‐investment in capital. The opposite force will operate in a <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> <b>country</b> which because of land market liberalization will face relatively low land prices. This will create an upward spiral of high‐income/high‐investment in capital. As a result, a “win‐win” outcome is not necessarily guaranteed through the land market liberalization even if such liberalization comes with the improvement of agricultural sector productivity in the relatively poor country.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} that an international permit trading system may hurt relatively poor countries by making associated economic activities unaffordable. A model is constructed {{in which the}} free market solution is Pareto inefficient {{as a result of}} pollution. The introduction of tradable permits allows pollution to be internalised, and brings about an increase in the total social surplus. But when incomes vary, this may not lead to a Pareto improvement; those in poor countries stop the polluting activity because they cannot afford to do otherwise. Only those in <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> are made better off. This may explain why poor countries are reluctant to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, itself advocating a permit trading scheme. The politico-economic implications of permit trading are also examined.

We assemble and analyse three separate types of evidence. First, we find that countries that were initially relatively poor prior to planning benefited more, as measured by long-run GDP per capita levels, from infrastructure and human capital than they suffered from weak market incentives. For initially <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> the opposite is true. Second, using various measures of physical stocks of infrastructure and human capital we show that at the end of planning, formerly planned countries had substantially different endowments from their contemporaneous market economy counterparts. However, these differences were much more important for poor than for <b>rich</b> <b>countries.</b> Finally, we use firm-level data to measure the cost of a wide range of constraints on firm performance, and we show that after more than a decade of transition in 2002 – 05, poor ex-planned economies differ much more from their market counterparts, in respect to both good and bad aspects of the planning legacy, than do <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> ones.

Using panel data across countries, econometric models are estimated to predict the effects of openness on organic water pollutant (BOD) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. Results indicate that freer trade significantly increases emissions of both pollutants, thus reducing environmental quality. Moreover, the panel nature of the data allows heterogeneity across countries to be controlled, so that comparisons can be made of how different national characteristics influence the environmental impact of freer trade. By testing the effects of democratic versus autocratic governance, it is found that while greater democracy can induce significant reductions in BOD emissions as openness increases, it may also lead to increased CO 2 levels. Meanwhile, by testing for and failing to reject the pollution haven hypothesis, it is suggested that environmental gains from openness in <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> may be coming at the expense of environmental degradation in poorer countries.

40|$|The {{growth of}} virtual reality {{and the decline of}} {{intellectual}} dialog in the community of social scientists For about two decades now, leading Swedish economists have been arguing that the expansion of Sweden's welfare state since 1970 has caused its economic growth to lag behind that of other comparable countries. As main evidence for this causal interpretation, they have pointed to the fact that since the early 1970 s Sweden's percentage growth of GDP per capita has been below the OECD-average. In these terms, however, Sweden's growth lagged behind the OECD-average by the same amount already in the 1950 s and 60 s, the effect thus preceding its assumed cause by two decades. Furthermore, also other <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> such as Switzerland and the United States, have had percentage growth rates below the OECD-average. This reflects the so called catch-up effect, which tends to give the originally less <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> a higher percentage growth rates than the originally <b>rich</b> <b>countries,</b> among them Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.

Trade policy is captured by measures of tariffs, import and export taxes. Typically, the average effects of changes in such policy variables have been investigated. However, from a policy perspective, the differential effects on highor low-income countries may be of more interest. Our preferred specification for growth thus includes as an explanatory variable an interaction term between trade barriers and initial income levels to capture the non-linearity in the relationship. This specification reveals a significant interaction effect under which the marginal impact of tariffs on growth is declining in initial income. In particular, for low-income countries tariffs appear {{to be associated with}} higher growth, whereas only for middleincome and <b>richer</b> <b>countries</b> is there a negative impact of tariffs on growth. The impact of a marginal change in protection on growth changes from positive to negative as income increases beyond a threshold level of GDP per capita (below which, in rough terms, a country would be classed as low-income).

Third, international migration can have big effects on internal income distribution, both in the source country and in the country of origin; and this leads to strong pressure for immigration restrictions. This last, pessimistic, conclusion ignores the possibility, however, that domestic and foreign institutions could help governments maintain relatively open migration policies. history; migration...|$|R

Secondly, we find that environmental quality could be considered as a luxury good by richer people because people’s attitudes depend not only on their income but also on the economic performance. Finally, richer people are aware of the availability of resources and of the quality of the institutions, hence their behavior changes depending on the characteristics of the country: in relatively poorer countries (where there are fewer resources), they tend to participate more than richer people that live in <b>relatively</b> <b>richer</b> <b>countries.</b> environmental economics, environmental quality, income, human development, cross-country research...|$|R

40|$|Whether {{cross-border}} {{financial market}} integration has raised global insurance, {{is still a}} controversial issue in the literature. If this is so, what should we observe in the data? The insurance literature emphasizes that efficient risk-sharing requires financial markets to channel resources to countries {{that have been made}} temporarily poorer by some negative conjuncture, net of physical capital accumulation. This standard condition, which provides the basis for virtually every test of international insurance, is however derived focusing on only one of the two channels of cross-border insurance, the financial flows channel, implicitly assuming no interaction between this and the other channel, international relative price fluctuations. This paper shows that testable conditions can only be derived theoretically placing the interaction between prices and financial flows centerstage in the analysis. Using a two-country general equilibrium model with endogenous portfolio diversification, I show that financial flows and relative prices can be either complements or substitutes in providing insurance. In the case of complementarity, financial inflows raise the international price of a country's output. This implies the standard condition. In the case of substitutability prices and flows transfer purchasing power in opposite directions. This implies a different condition: efficient financial markets are required to channel resources "upstream", from relatively poorer to <b>relatively</b> <b>richer</b> <b>countries.</b> The conditions for substitutability appear to be quantitatively and empirically plausible.

Recent empirical work has documented that the measured factor content of trade is too small compared to the theoretical prediction and named this special pattern of the data "missing trade". This paper constructs a general equilibrium trade model with nonhomothetic preferences and analyzes how nonhomotheticity in consumption can reduce the predicted factor content of trade. It shows first in a simple model with two factors, two goods and two countries that the HOV theorem over-predicts the factor content of trade under certain conditions. Income elasticity of consumption of factor services is defined by examining the link between factor intensity of goods production and income elasticity of goods consumption in a generalized model with arbitrary numbers of goods, factors, and countries. The examination of the relationship between per capita income, income elasticity of factor consumption, and the factor content of consumption reveals that <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> must on average consume services of income elastic factors more than proportionately while consuming services of income inelastic factors less than proportionately. An indicator is devised to directly compare the volume of factor content of trade predicted by nonhomothetic preferences with that predicted by HOV. Direct comparison of this indicator for the respective assumptions suggests that the missing trade can in part be attributed to the excessive trade prediction of the HOV theorem with homothetic preferences.

Some analysts focus on the observation that many relatively poor countries have known a higher GDP growth (in %) than many <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> <b>countries.</b> As a consequence, relative income di¤erences are diminishing and relative inequality decreasing. Others are less optimistic and start from the observation that absolute income di¤erences (in $) are still increasing and, hence, absolute inequality is increasing. Both answers represent a very particular view on the notion of inequality: a relative view to inequality starts from the premise that if all countries grow at the same rate, the inequality stays the same. It has been documented in the literature that a relative view on global inequality leads to a picture of decreasing inequality. 1 The absolute view, on the contrary, takes the starting point that if all countries grow with the same amount, inequality stays the same. An absolute view to global inequality has been rarely studied in the literature (Exceptions are by Ravallion (2003) and Atkinson and Brandolini (2004)). There seems to be no a-priori reasons to prefer one view above the other. Moreover, in between these two views there are many intermediate views on inequal-ity, which can be argued to be a-priori as attractive.

40|$|The {{present study}} casts some {{doubt on the}} growth-promoting effect of foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI), which is widely supported by the proponents of financial globalization. The panel data analysis of 51 less developed countries shows a rising relationship between growth and FDI (relative to gross capital formation) only for the group of 11 <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> and open-economy <b>countries.</b> The time-series analysis observes meaningful positive relationships between FDI and growth only for 3 countries belonging to this group and some other countries. But by and large no long-term positive relationship exists between the two irrespective of income levels, openness and FDI-dependence. ...|$|R
40|$|Entrepreneurship {{has been}} viewed and cited by {{researchers}} as an important and key contributor to a nation's industrial development {{as well as a}} significant driving force in the nation's economic development (Steward and Boyd, 1988). Economists in the study of factors of production (Exhibit 1) identify entrepreneurship and knowledge as the two most critical of the five factors. In the same trend of argument, a management expert and business consultant, Peter Drucker (1999) declares knowledge as the most important factor giving examples of how the young workers on the high-tech industries of Silicon Valley area of California are often referred to as knowledge workers. It will be argued in this paper that entrepreneurial skills/characteristics include knowledge and the ability to recognize analyze and seize opportunities. Additionally, an analysis (Nickels etal, 2004) of the <b>rich</b> and poor <b>countries</b> to determine what causes the difference in the levels of wealth show that entrepreneurship and knowledge are the most dominant cause of wealth. The analysis indicates that most poor countries have abundance of land, labor, and natural resources (China and Russia as command economies) but lack knowledge and entrepreneurship. In contrast, Japan and Hong Kong for example, are <b>relatively</b> <b>rich</b> <b>countries</b> but are poor in land and Natural resources. It will be argued in this paper that capital could not be the missing ingredient since capital (tools, machinery, etc) could be made available by International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and other funding agencies including the national gorvernments. This paper examines the relationships among the factors of production(land, labor, capital, knowledge and entrepreneurship) and the potential of a country to develop and sustain its economy. The paper argues that entrepreneurship is the most critical and necessary factor for effective economic development. The current globalization process appear to be forcing industrialized nations to find ways to revive entrepreneurial activities in their efforts to reactivate and sustain the economic growth and to compete effectively in the global society...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{adoption}} in follower countries {{can be accomplished}} by local R&D activities, {{but it can also be}} achieved without formal R&D, for example, by foreign direct investment. Empirical evidence suggests that current R&D activities often expand local knowledge for future R&D, while adoption without R&D does not seem to have this effect. We formalize this idea in a quality-ladder growth model and find that this biased externality results in multiple steady states: In the long run, countries with sufficient initial knowledge and human capital converge to a state in which R&D is locally undertaken and thus become <b>relatively</b> <b>rich,</b> while other <b>countries</b> fully rely on technology adoption without R&D and stay poor. Switching regression using cross-country data supports the presence of multiple steady states in R&D expenditures. ...|$|R
