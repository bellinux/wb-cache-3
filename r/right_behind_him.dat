5|$|Giampaolo Caruso led {{the group}} into Ans and towards the {{climb to the}} finish. At {{the foot of the}} climb, Daniel Moreno, Caruso's teammate, {{attacked}} and built a small gap ahead of the group. The group did not initially chase him, as all the other riders looked for Valverde to do the work. Eventually Valverde did start to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend. He opened his sprint from a long way out, with Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha) <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> Rodríguez slowed as they approached the line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place.|$|E
5|$|On the Taaienberg, Tiesj Benoot (Lotto–Soudal) led the peloton, with Boonen <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> A ten-rider group {{broke away}} from the peloton over the climb, with Benoot and Boonen joined by Roelandts, Cancellara, Boom, Vanmarcke, Daniel Oss (BMC) and three other Etixx–Quick-Step riders (Terpstra, Štybar and Trentin). On the next climb, the Boigneberg, Cancellara's rear {{derailleur}} failed and it took more than a minute for his team to bring him a replacement bike, putting him a long way behind the other favourites. Shortly afterwards, the breakaway was caught by the chasing group; the combined group was then caught by another group that contained Sagan and Kwiatkowski to create a 20-man lead group, although Štybar soon suffered a puncture and fell out of the group. Cancellara, meanwhile, was in a group led by his teammates Yaroslav Popovych and Markel Irizar around two minutes behind.|$|E
5|$|The top ten drivers {{competed for}} pole {{position}} in Q3 {{and it was}} a battle between the two Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton set his fastest time first with Rosberg <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> A much better time in the third sector of the track allowed Rosberg to take his sixth consecutive pole position almost four-tenths ahead of his teammate. Sergio Pérez held third spot for much of the session but was beaten to it by Kimi Räikkönen during the second turn of runs. The two were followed by Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas on the third row of the grid. Following a gearbox change after qualifying, Romain Grosjean was demoted five places on the grid. Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens also received five place penalties: Stevens for a change of the Control Electronics unit, Merhi for changes made to his suspension. Both would start the race from the back row of the grid.|$|E
50|$|At the restart Häkkinen {{led away}} again with Schumacher <b>right</b> up <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> Schumacher {{attempted}} to pass Häkkinen but ran wide, allowing Fisichella in the Benetton through and almost Rubens Barrichello in the Stewart.|$|R
60|$|The stage sailor {{places his}} <b>right</b> hand <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> and his left in front, leaps {{up into the}} air, kicks out his leg behind in a gay and bird-like way, {{and the thing is}} done.|$|R
60|$|He {{had crossed}} {{a couple of}} {{ploughed}} fields and an intervening ditch, when in the distance to his <b>right</b> and <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> {{he heard the sound}} of horses at a brisk trot, going in the direction of Lyons.|$|R
25|$|Tomlin (#3) {{started to}} his left, {{but had to}} pitch the ball immediately. Just before being hit hard by Millsaps {{defensive}} lineman Casey Younger (#90), he made an underhanded toss to Tigers offensive lineman Stephen Arnold (#68), who was <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike some of Pisanello's other {{portrait}} medals, such {{as those}} of Leonello d'Este, the reverse of the medal of John presents no iconographic or allegorical mysteries. It shows the emperor on horseback, in profile to the <b>right.</b> <b>Behind</b> <b>him,</b> mounted on another horse, is a page or squire viewed from the rear and foreshortened. The emperor wears his distinctive hat and carries a bow on his left side and a quiver of arrows above his right leg. The double reigns of the emperor’s horse are visible and both horses possess elaborate straps over their hindquarters. The illustration conveys the arrest of a hunting expedition occasioned by John’s encounter with a pedestalled wayside cross. The gesture of the emperor’s raised right hand indicates his acknowledgement, in an act of piety, of the cross before him. The event takes place in a rocky landscape and is framed in the bottom portion by a Greek inscription: Ἕργον του Πισἀνου Ζωγρἀφου (‘The work of Pisano the painter’). This inscription is repeated in Latin within the top of the scene: OPVS • PISANI • PICTORIS.|$|E
25|$|On lap 35, Schumacher went wide at the East Terrace {{corner and}} brushed the wall. He lost time {{but at the}} time, {{it was unclear whether}} his car was damaged or not. Hill was {{suddenly}} <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> and saw his chance to pass, taking the inside line into the next corner. As Hill's Williams drew alongside the Benetton, Schumacher appeared to turn in aggressively and there was contact between the two rival cars. The Benetton was then momentarily flung into the air and was damaged badly enough to mean immediate retirement for the German. Hill's car initially appeared to be undamaged but it was soon apparent the Briton's front left wishbone was broken. Hill toured back slowly to the pits and after some time trying to repair the damage, retired. Whether this accident had been deliberately caused by Schumacher – in the knowledge he had damaged his car in running wide at the East Terrace Corner – remains a matter of some debate, however it handed Michael Schumacher the first of his FIA Formula One World Championships.|$|E

500|$|One {{day after}} the race, both Matteo Tosatto (...) and Eros Capecchi (...) accused Démare of having used the tow of his teamcar to rejoin the pack after his crash before the Cipressa climb. Démare rebuffed these allegations, saying that the race commissioners were <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> and would have disqualified him, had he done {{something}} illegal. On 8 May 2016, it became public that the Italian Cycling Federation was making inquiries into the accusations about Démare, with Tosatto {{saying that he had}} given written testimony to officials about the incident.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is torn between his {{commitments}} to {{his pregnant wife}} Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) and his desire to party. He asks NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to assist with any of Angie's needs, however, it becomes too much for Kenneth to deal with and he tells Tracy {{that he needs to}} be with her instead. Tracy realizes he needs to be with Angie, but changes his mind and goes to a strip club. After returning home and in order to stay there, Tracy decides to wear his dog's shock collar on himself. Tracy then sends Kenneth to take his place at Liz's party. Unbeknownst to Kenneth, Tracy's dog has followed him to the bachelorette party. Kenneth bursts in Liz's home with Tracy's dog <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> resulting in the staff hiding from the dog after it attacks them. They all turn to Liz {{to get rid of the}} dog, which she at first refuses. [...] She eventually agrees to help them, after they tell her she is a mother figure to them and that nobody wants to go drinking with their mom. [...] Liz finds comfort in this, so she distracts the dog, and the staff exits her apartment unharmed.|$|E

The hapless person surrenders his official papers. / The policeman opens them, reads, and nods to his partner: [...] "Write him a citation for slandering the Soviet Militsiya, Vasya".

60|$|The voices {{came from}} {{a point in the}} jungle a little to his <b>right</b> and <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and without waiting for the column to return, or even to {{ascertain}} if they had heard the cries, Sing ran rapidly {{in the direction of the}} alarm. For a time he saw nothing, but was guided by the snapping of twigs and the rustling of bushes ahead, where the authors of the commotion were evidently moving swiftly through the jungle.|$|R
2500|$|On September 14, 1862, General William T. H. Brooks ordered Hooker (who was a {{lieutenant}} at the time) to take four companies {{to take out}} a Confederate artillery position. When riding ahead of his men, Hooker stumbled across the Confederate 16th Virginia Infantry, who had become disoriented and were mostly out of ammunition. Instead of being shot, captured, or surrendering himself, Hooker boldly told the Confederate commanding officer, Major Francis D. Holladay, that a large mass of Union troops was <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and suggested they surrender to him. Holladay complied, handing over his sword and company colors along with 116 Confederate men. [...] For this action Hooker was awarded the Medal of Honor on September 17, 1891.|$|E

60|$|All the {{passengers}} except Hale started. The {{man next to}} him moved his <b>right</b> hand suddenly <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> but as quickly stopped. One of the motionless trees had apparently closed upon the vehicle, and what had {{seemed to be a}} bough projecting from it at right angles changed slowly into the faintly shining double-barrels of a gun at the window.|$|R
6000|$|Sammy Jay kept {{right on}} screaming. He made such a noise that Reddy didn't hear {{footsteps}} coming nearer and nearer. Suddenly {{there was a great}} roar <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "Bow, wow, wow! Bow, wow, wow, wow!"-- just like that.|$|E

50|$|Leyritz {{was known}} for using an unusual stance which {{involved}} keeping his front leg (left leg) straight and stiff while his back leg (<b>right</b> leg) <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> considerably bent at the knee. He did this while circling his bat around behind his head, waiting for the pitch. After each pitch that Leyritz did not put into play or strike out on, he would grab the bat by its center and twirl it at his hip like a baton. He has said that former Yankee Mickey Rivers {{taught him how to}} twirl the bat at his hip.|$|R
50|$|Thinking Horton's {{behavior}} is a problem, Jane sends the Wickersham Brothers {{to take the}} clover with the speck from him. They give the clover to the black-bottomed eagle Whizzer McWoff, who flies away with it. Horton pursues McWoff across the mountains below, but the eagle drops the clover into a large field of clovers and leaves Horton to find it. Horton searches frantically through the field, eventually finding his clover, and learns from Dr. Hoovey that Whoville was badly damaged when the clover was dropped. The other Whos, seeing the destruction as proof that Dr. Hoovey was <b>right,</b> rally <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R

60|$|He sprang {{upon that}} money, and we passed him by, and ran forth into the open.
