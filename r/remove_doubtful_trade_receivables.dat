40|$|This paper {{studies the}} <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> policy of distressed firms as the {{trade-off}} between the firm's willingness to gain sales and the firm's need for cash. We find that firms increase <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> {{when they have}} profitability problems, but reduce <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> when they have cash flow problems. We also find that a firm that significantly cuts its <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> when in financial distress will experience an additional drop of at least 13 % in sales and stock returns over the previously documented 20 % average drop for financially troubled firms. Moreover, the performance decline of a firm in financial distress is significantly higher if the firm cuts <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> than if it does not.

40|$|Abstract: A <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> {{securitization}} is {{away for}} a seller to raise capital by selling certain <b>trade</b> <b>receivable</b> assets into a special purpose vehicle (SPV), on a revolving basis. This permits the SPV to raise capital by issuing notes or taking out a loan, using the <b>trade</b> <b>receivable</b> assets as collateral. The proceeds from the loan or note then flow back to the seller as purchase proceeds for the <b>trade</b> <b>receivable</b> assets. Such a transaction can typically garner a rating higher than seller’s own corporate credit, thereby giving the seller access to greater liquidity {{at a lower cost}} of funds. Other advantages may include trade credit insurance and off-balance treatment. Structures, operations, and overhead can vary considerably, and there is room for optimization, customization, and fine-tuning; so, it is important for a seller to choose its securitization partners and arrangements carefully...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores a {{financial}} role of Japanese general trading companies (GTCs), which {{act as a}} central point in a distribution network among group firms. I examine Meltzer’s conjecture, which holds that financially strong companies like GTCs increase <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> and reduce <b>trade</b> payables to shield their trading partners from a monetary squeeze. First, I investigate the trade credit granted to each other by GTCs and all its trade partners. The panel estimation demonstrates that both <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> and <b>trade</b> payables decrease during periods of monetary tightness and increase during those of monetary ease. In response {{to a change in}} a bank-lending indicator, there is little difference between <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> and payables. Thus GTCs become neither net-credit providers nor net-credit takers from this behavior. In other words, interfirm financing passing through a GTC’s balance sheet positively correlates with banking financing. Therefore, the Meltzer hypothesis does not hold for transactions between GTCs and all their trade partners. Instead, gross trade credit functions as a complement to macroeconomic bank lending. Second, I examine trade credit by dividing GTCs’ trading partners into related companies (i. e., subsidiaries and associate firms) and non-related companies. In terms of the reactions of trade credit to market financial indicators, I did not find statistically significant evidence that the Meltzer hypothesis works in either case. No matter with whom a GTC trades, interfirm financing passing through the GTC’s balance sheet moves positively in concert with banking financing. A major difference between related and non-related companies lies {{in the way in which}} <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> react to a GTC’s individual financial situation (that is, a firm’s individual interest expense rate minus a market’s interest rate). An increase in the interest gap induces a GTC to incur extra expenses over the market rate. In this situation, a GTC reduces <b>trade</b> <b>receivables</b> to non-related firms, but not those to related firms. This behavior eventually works as a shield, protecting their related companies from sharing the parent company’s interest costs. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, using {{microdata}} in Japan, {{we investigate}} whether credit contagion decreases trade credit supply for small businesses. In 1997 - 98 the Japanese economy experienced a large recession, {{and the number}} of dishonored bills {{and the number of}} bankruptcy filings caused by the domino effect increased. During a period of credit contagion, if firms possess higher financial claims than other firms, the possibility of default becomes higher. Therefore, if the problem of credit contagion is serious during such a period, suppliers withdraw trade credit from customers with higher <b>trade</b> <b>receivables.</b> They might also withdraw more trade credit from customers even though the credit risk of the customers is low. We find that during a recession, suppliers reduce trade credit more for small businesses with higher <b>trade</b> <b>receivables.</b> Additionally, in the manufacturing trade, credit is reduced for both risky and non-risky small firms. This effect in other industries, however, is weak. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{balance of}} the balance sheet {{reflects}} the conventions of double-entry bookkeeping, by which business transactions are recorded. In double-entry bookkeeping, every transaction is recorded by paired entries, and typically a transaction will result in two or more pairs of entries. The sale of product, for example, would record both a receipt of cash (or {{the creation of a}} <b>trade</b> <b>receivable</b> {{in the case of an}} extension of credit to the buyer) and a reduction in the inventory of goods for sale; the receipt of cash or a <b>trade</b> <b>receivable</b> is an addition to revenue, and the reduction in goods inventory is an addition to expense (an [...] "expense" [...] is the [...] "expending" [...] of an asset, in this case, the inventory). Thus, there are two pairs of entries: an addition to revenue balanced by an addition to cash; a subtraction from inventory balanced by an addition to expense. The cash and inventory accounts are asset accounts; the revenue and expense accounts will close at the end of the accounting period to affect equity.|$|R

40|$|Driven by the {{increasingly}} {{important role of}} supply chains in global production, this paper studies empirical association between global credit-market shocks and firm behavior towards liquidity needs across countries and industries. Focusing on the adjustment of working-capital financing, we find two pieces of supporting evidence from international firm-level panel data covering the period 2002 :I - 2012 :IV. First, for industries where specific investment in the input supplier-customer relationship is large, firms are more exposed to credit-market shocks. We find that measures of global credit-market shocks are negatively associated with <b>trade</b> <b>receivables,</b> <b>trade</b> payables, and inventories, conditional {{on the level of}} contract intensity in the industries where firms operate. Second, firms in emerging markets are more vulnerable to credit-market shocks than are firms in developed countries.
