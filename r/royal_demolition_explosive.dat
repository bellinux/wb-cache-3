40|$|XplA is a {{cytochrome}} P 450 {{of unique}} structural organization, {{consisting of a}} heme- domain that is C-terminally fused to its native flavodoxin redox partner. XplA, along with flavodoxin reductase XplB, {{has been shown to}} catalyze the breakdown of the nitramine explosive and pollutant hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (<b>royal</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>explosive)</b> by reductive denitration. The structure of the heme domain of XplA (XplA-heme) has been solved in two crystal forms: as a dimer in space group P 21 to a resolution of 1. 9 Å and as a monomer in space group P 21212 to a resolution of 1. 5 Å, with the ligand imidazole bound at the heme iron. Although it shares the overall fold of cytochromes P 450 of known structure, XplA-heme is unusual in that the kinked I-helix that traverses the distal face of the heme is broken by Met- 394 and Ala- 395 in place of the well conserved Asp/Glu plus Thr/Ser, important in oxidative P 450 s for the scission of the dioxygen bond prior to substrate oxygenation. The heme environment of XplA-heme is hydrophobic, featuring a cluster of three methionines above the heme, including Met- 394. Imidazole was observed bound to the heme iron and is in close proximity to the side chain of Gln- 438, which is situated over the distal face of the heme. Imidazole is also hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule that sits in place of the threonine side-chain hydroxyl exemplified by Thr- 252 in Cyt-P 450 cam.

40|$|Chlorinated {{solvents}} {{and high}} explosives are two common classes of environmental contaminants at defense-related facili-ties. At least five {{current and former}} defense-related sites in the United States, including the former Nebraska Ordnance Plant (NOP) in Mead, Nebraska (USEPA 1997), have groundwater contaminated with mixtures of these contaminants.

40|$|Unexploded {{explosives}} {{that include}} <b>royal</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>explosive</b> (RDX) and trinitrotoluene (TNT) cause environmental concerns for surrounding ecosystems. Baccharis halimifolia is a plant {{species in the}} sunflower family that grows naturally near munitions sites on contaminated soils, indicating {{that it might have}} tolerance to explosives. B. halimifolia plants were grown on 100, 300, and 750 mg kg− 1 of soil amended with composition B (Comp B) explosive, a mixture of <b>royal</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>explosive</b> and trinitrotoluene. These concentrations are environmentally relevant to such munitions sites. The purpose of the experiment was to mimic contaminated sites to assess the plant’s physiological response and uptake of explosives and to identify upregulated genes in response to explosives in order to better understand how this species copes with explosives. Stomatal conductance was not significantly reduced in any treatments. However, net photosynthesis, absorbed photons, and chlorophyll were significantly reduced in all treatments relative to the control plants. The dark-adapted parameter of photosynthesis was reduced only in the 750 mg kg− 1 Comp B treatment. Thus, we observed partial physiological tolerance to Comp B in B. halimifolia plants. We identified and cloned 11 B. halimifolia gene candidates that were orthologous to explosive-responsive genes previously identified in Arabidopsis and poplar. Nine of those genes showed more than 90 % similarity to Conyza canadensis (horseweed), which is the closest relative with significant available genomics resources. The expression patterns of these genes were studied using quantitative real-time PCR. Three genes were transcriptionally upregulated in Comp B treatments, and the Cytb 6 f gene was found to be highly active in all the tested concentrations of Comp B. These three newly identified candidate genes of this explosives-tolerant plant species can be potentially exploited for uses in phytoremediation by overexpressing these genes in transgenic plants and, similarly, by using promoters or variants of promoters from these genes fused to reporter genes in transgenic plants for making phytosensors to report the localized presence of explosives in contaminated soils...|$|E

40|$|Perchlorate is an {{oxidizer}} {{that has}} been routinely used in solid rocket motors by the Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. <b>Royal</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Explosive</b> (RDX) is {{a major component of}} military high explosives and is used {{in a wide variety of}} munitions. Perchlorate bearing wastewater typically results from production of solid rocket motors, while RDX is transferred to Army industrial wastewaters during load, assemble and pack operations for new munitions, and hot water or steam washout for disposal and deactivation of old munitions (commonly referred to as demilitarization, or simply demil). Biological degradation in Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactors (AFBR), has been shown to be an effective method for the removal of both perchlorate and RDX in contaminated wastewater. The focus of this study was to determine the effectiveness of removal of perchlorate and RDX, individually and when co-mingled, using ethanol as an electron donor under steady state conditions. Three AFBRs were used to assess the effectiveness of this process in treating the wastewater. The performance of the bioreactors was monitored relative to perchlorate, RDX, and chemical oxygen demand removal effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrated that the biodegradation of perchlorate and RDX was more effective in bioreactors receiving the single contaminant than in the bioreactor where both contaminants were fed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{demonstrated}} that reductive degradation of 2, 4, 6 -Trinitrotoluene (TNT) and hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (<b>Royal</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Explosive,</b> RDX) {{can be enhanced}} by bio-reduced iron-bearing soil minerals (IBSMs) using Shewanella putrefaciens CN 32 (CN 32). The degradation kinetic rate constant of TNT by bio-reduced magnetite was the highest (0. 0039 h- 1), followed by green rust (0. 0022 h- 1), goethite (0. 0017 h- 1), lepidocrocite (0. 0016 h- 1), and hematite (0. 0006 h- 1). The highest rate constant was obtained by bio-reduced lepidocrocite (0. 1811 h- 1) during RDX degradation, followed by magnetite (0. 1700 h- 1), green rust (0. 0757 h- 1), hematite (0. 0495 h- 1), and goethite (0. 0394 h- 1). Significant increase of Fe(II) was observed during the reductive degradation of TNT and RDX by bio-reduced IBSMs. X-ray diffraction and electron microscope analyses were conducted for identification of degradation mechanism of TNT and RDX in this study. 4 -amino-dinitrotoluene were detected as products during TNT degradation, while Hexahydro- 1 -nitroso- 3, 5 -dinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine, Hexahydro- 1, 3 -dinitroso- 5 -nitro- 1, 3, 5 triazine, and Hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitroso- 1, 3, 5 -triazine were observed during RDX degradation...|$|E

40|$|A 15 -week {{treatability}} {{study was}} conducted in a greenhouse to evaluate the potential effects of molasses on the bioremediation and phytoremediation potential of Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) for treating energetic contaminated soil from the open burn/open detonation area of the Makua Military Reservation, Oahu, HI (USA). The energetics in the soil were <b>royal</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>explosive</b> (RDX) and high-melting explosive (HMX). Among the 6 treatments employed in this study, enhanced removal of RDX was observed from treatments that received molasses and went to completion. The RDX degradation rates in treatments with molasses diluted 1 : 20 and 1 : 40 were comparable suggesting that the lower dose worked as well as the higher dose. Treatments without molasses degraded RDX slowly and residuals remained after 15 weeks. The bacterial densities in molasses-treated units were much greater than those without molasses. Phytoremediation alone seems to have little effect on RDX disappearance. For HMX, neither bioremediation nor phytoremediation was found to be useful in reducing the concentration within the experimental period. The concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous in the soil did not change significantly during the experiment, however, a slight increase in soil pH was observed in all treatments. The study showed that irrigating with diluted molasses is effective at enhancing RDX degradation mainly in the root zone and just below it. The long term sustainability of active training ranges can be enhanced by bioremediation using molasses treatments to prevent RDX deposited by on-going operations from migrating through the soil to groundwater and off-site...|$|E

40|$|Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL- 20), a new {{polycyclic}} polynitramine, has {{the same}} functional nitramine groups (N-NO 2) as the widely used energetic chemicals hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazacyclohexane (<b>royal</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>explosive</b> [RDX]) and octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazocine (high-melting explosive [HMX]). Potential impacts of CL- 20 as an emerging contaminant must be assessed before its use. The effects of CL- 20, RDX, or HMX on adult survival and juvenile production by potworms Enchytraeus albidus and Enchytraeus crypticus were studied in three soil types, including Sassafras sandy loam (1. 2 % organic matter [OM], 11 % clay, pH 5. 5), an agricultural soil (42 % OM, 1 % clay, pH 8. 2), and a composite agricultural-forest soil (23 % OM, 2 % clay, pH 7. 9) by using ISO method 16387 (International Standard Organization, Geneva, Switzerland). Results showed that CL- 20 was toxic to E. crypticus with median lethal concentration values for adult survival ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 7 mg/kg dry mass (DM) when using the three tested soils. In addition, CL- 20 adversely affected juvenile production by both species in all soils tested, with median effective concentration (EC 50) values ranging from 0. 08 to 0. 62 mg/kg DM. Enchytraeus crypticus and E. albidus were similarly sensitive to CL- 20 exposure in the composite agricultural-forest soil, which supported reproduction by both species and enabled comparisons. Correlation analysis showed weak or no relationship overall among the soil properties and reproduction toxicity endpoints. Neither RDX nor HMX affected (p > 0. 05) adult survival of either species below 658 and 918 mg/kg DM, respectively, indicating that CL- 20 is more toxic to enchytraeids than RDX or HMX. Examination of data shows that CL- 20 {{should be considered as}} a potential reproductive toxicant to soil invertebrates, and that safeguards should be considered to minimize the potential for release of CL- 20 into the environment.

40|$|The manufacture, use {{and storage}} of {{explosives}} over decades have seriously contaminated the environment. Hexa-hydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (<b>Royal</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Explosive</b> - RDX) {{is one of}} the most widely used explosives. RDX is a man-made compound, recalcitrant to degradation and proven to be toxic to organisms. Bacteria capable of utilising RDX as a sole nitrogen source for growth have been isolated from RDX polluted sites including Rhodococcus rhodochrous 11 Y. The RDX degrading genes, xplA and xplB encoding a novel flavodoxin fused cytochrome P 450 and its reductase partner respectively, were first identified in R. rhodochrous 11 Y. This unusual P 450 system has now been found in almost all of the RDX degrading bacteria isolated so far. To date, XplA/B remains the only characterised RDX degrading P 450 system and is encoded on an operon in strain 11 Y, which also contains a putative permease (transporter) and transcriptional regulator. This gene cluster is highly conserved amongst other RDX degrading bacteria from geographically distinct regions including the United Kingdom, Belgium, Australia and North America, suggesting the xplA/B gene cluster may have been rapidly distributed across the globe by horizontal gene transfer. The first aim of this study was to characterise Rhodococcus erythropolis HS 4, a bacterium that degrades RDX slowly but did not contain xplA and xplB. A number of approaches have been employed to characterise this strain, which includes whole cell assays, western analysis, cell free extract activity assays, PCR amplification and affinity purification of protein in R. erythropolis HS 4. While whole cells of HS 4 showed low RDX degrading activity, no RDX activity was observed in HS 4 cell free extracts. Attempts to purify an RDX degrading enzyme from R. erythropolis HS 4 were unsuccessful. The second aim of this project was to characterise the RDX degrading gene cluster in R. rhodochrous 11 Y. Four genes encoding xplB, xplA, a putative permease and a MarR type regulator, were individually deleted using an unmarked gene deletion system (pK 18 mobsacB). The xplB knockout strain metabolised RDX more slowly than the wild-type suggesting XplA was able to obtain reducing equivalents from another source in the xplB knockout strain. The xplA knockout strain did not show RDX activity in whole cell and growth experiments. Neither xplA nor its gene product XplA was detected in the xplA knockout strain. The findings suggested no alternative RDX degrading system is present in strain 11 Y. The permease knockout did not show significant difference in the RDX removal rate compared to wild-type. Another attempt to characterise the permease in 11 Y was to express it in E. coli. No significant difference of RDX uptake between the permease-expressing clone and the control (non-expressing clone) in the uptake assays. The regulator knockout strain had a lower RDX degradation rate than wild-type in the presence of nitrate/nitrite. Also, when the regulator knockout and wild-type strains were previously exposed to nitrate/nitrite, the knockout showed lower RDX degrading activity. Further investigation of xplA regulation in strain 11 Y showed that XplA activity was induced by nitrogen-limiting conditions and further induced by RDX. This was the first observation on the XplA activity could be induced by low nitrogen availability in medium. These results suggested that the regulator is indirectly involved in controlling the expression of XplA in 11 Y, which is linked to central nitrogen metabolism.
