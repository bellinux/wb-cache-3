Water tunnel tests including flow visualization and yaw moment measurements were conducted on several different models of the F- 16 fighter. Wind tunnel force and moment tests investigated the effects of several nose-boom strake configurations on an isolated 1 / 8 th-scale X- 29 A forebody model. The primary variables of interest were strake size, configuration and <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> <b>orientation</b> on the nose-boom. Both experiments showed clearly that small nose-boom strakes can be very effective in controlling the forebody vortex flowfield.

Adhesion was highly sensitive to the pitch angle between the substrate and the seta's stalk.

The <b>roll</b> <b>orientation</b> <b>angle</b> only needed to be roughly correct with the spatular tuft of the seta oriented grossly towards the substrate for high adhesion. Also, detailed measurements were made to control for the effect of normal preload forces.

The sequence dependent effects in the mini double helices of tRNA {{are very similar to}} those observed in the crystal structures of oligonucleotides in the A-form, the purine-pyrimidine and purine-purine steps have small <b>roll</b> <b>angles</b> when compared to the fiber models of A-DNA as well as A-RNA, while the pyrimidine-purine doublet steps have large <b>roll</b> <b>angles.</b> The <b>orientation</b> of the basepairs in the D-stem is unusual and invariant i. e. they are different from the other three stems but are very similar in all the five tRNA(Phe) crystal structures, presumably due to tertiary interaction of the Watson-Crick basepairs with other bases, with all bases being highly conserved. The origin {{of the differences between the}} tertiary structures of tRNA(Phe) and tRNA(Asp) from yeast has also been investigated. It is found that even though the angle between the acceptor arm and the D-stem is very similar in the two structures, the angle subtended by the acceptor arm and the anticodon arm is smaller in the tRNA(Phe) structure (by more than 10 degrees). This is due to differences in the orientation of the two mini helices constituting the anticodon arm, which are inclined to each other by approximately 25 degrees in tRNA(Phe) and 16 degrees in tRNA(Asp). In addition, the acceptor arm, the D-stem and the anticodon stem are nearly coplanar in tRNA(Phe), while in tRNA(Asp) the anticodon stem projects out of the plane defined by the acceptor arm and the anticodon stem. These two features together lead to a larger separation between the acceptor and anticodon ends in tRNA(Asp) and indicate that the junction between the D-stem and the anticodon stem is quite variable, with features characteristic of a ball-and-socket type joint and determined for each tRNA molecule by the base sequence at the junction...|$|R

Processing the video information obtained from these devices {{opens the door to}} a number of strategic opportunities. By recognizing patterns in visual sources, we address one problem in particular: how to achieve corresponding runways using a map and an individual frame of video. An approach to runway detection using two tools is presented in this thesis. The first tool is a geographical information program, which is used to set the runway map we want to detect. The second tool is a video frame of the same runway, recorded in a camera mounted on a UAV. The needed equations and related algorithms are developed and tested on a simulation that reconstructs the three-dimensional view of the aircraft camera employing the map and navigational data. Next, the algorithms are implemented using actual video frames.

40|$|The {{swim bladder}} {{provides}} {{a mechanism for}} buoyancy regulation in teleosts. However, in certain species, its location can result in an unstable body position, with associated energetic costs assumed for maintaining posture {{in addition to the}} energetic demands from swim bladder volume regulation. Direct observations show that some body-compressed, cave-refuging teleosts that nominally operate near neutral buoyancy may adopt unusual body attitudes within crevices. We hypothesize that these fishes may relax their buoyancy and posture control mechanisms during periods of rest. A prediction derived from this is that resting fish may adopt a wide range of <b>roll</b> <b>angles</b> (i. e., rotation about their longitudinal axis) inside caves. To quantify this behavior and for testing this hypothesis, triaxial accelerometers were deployed on free-living, cave-refuging Argentine sea bass Acanthistius patachonicus, and the relationship between <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> and a proxy for activity (defined as the vectorial dynamic body acceleration, VeDBA) was analyzed. The results were compared with data available for three other species of fishes with disparate body forms and lifestyles: the pelagic whale shark Rhincodon typus, the dorsoventrally compressed benthic great sculpin Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus, and the fusiform and demersal Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. Inactive Argentine sea bass adopted a wide variety of <b>roll</b> <b>angles,</b> including extreme ones exceeding 80 °, but had lower <b>roll</b> <b>angles</b> closer to an upright posture primarily associated with higher activity levels.

40|$|Abstract—Robust {{estimation}} of vehicle states (e. g., vehicle sideslip <b>angle</b> and <b>roll</b> <b>angle)</b> {{is essential for}} vehicle stability control applications such as yaw stability control and roll sta-bility control. This paper proposes novel methods for estimating sideslip <b>angle</b> and <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> using real-time lateral tire force measurements, obtained from the multi-sensing hub (MSHub) units, for practical applications to vehicle control systems of in-wheel-motor-driven electric vehicles. In vehicle sideslip estima-tion, a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm with a forgetting factor is utilized based on a linear vehicle model and sensor measurements. In <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> estimation, the Kalman filter is designed by integrating available sensor measurements and roll dynamics. The proposed estimation methods, RLS-based sideslip angle estimator and the Kalman filter are evaluated through field tests on an experimental electric vehicle. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed estimator can accurately estimate the vehicle sideslip <b>angle</b> and <b>roll</b> <b>angle.</b> It is experimentally confirmed that the estimation accuracy is improved by more than 50 % comparing to conventional method’s one (see RMS error shown in Fig. 4).

To investigate the potential of improving auto-guidance performance using feed-forward control with expected vehicle <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> acquired from a slope path profile, a PID navigation controller was simulated along with tractor and tire models. There were four main steps to the simulation process: (1) The development of the gains for a <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> feed-forward controller, (2) Evaluation of the controller as it responded to both step and sinusoidal slope profiles, (3) Investigation {{of the effects of}} different vehicle velocities and changes in cornering stiffness compared to nominal values, and (4) Determination if looking-ahead into the slope increases <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> performance. Use of a <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> feed-forward controller reduced the maximum off-tracking distance by up to 87 percent.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study examines the flow characteristics over a square cross-section body with sharp edges, a rectangular one with rounded edges, {{and a high}} wing-body configuration, in a low subsonic free stream. Pressure, velocity, force measurements and flow visualization provide {{a picture of the}} flow behaviour, locally and globally. Flow visualization and velocity measurements clearly depict the presence of two axial counter-rotating vortices in the leeside of the first two bodies, being mainly responsible for the asymmetric loading at nonzero <b>roll</b> <b>angles,</b> maximizing the side-force at a <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> of about 25 degrees. For all body orientations there is always a recirculation region at the nose-afterbody junction leeside area, the extent of which depends mainly on the <b>roll</b> <b>angle.</b> Pressure gradients take high values at the corners of the after body cross-section, even when these are rounded. No asymmetries were practically detected for a zero <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> and pitch angles up to 20 degrees for the examined three models. The wing-body configuration exhibits a higher lift slope and a more negative zero lift angle, compared to the wing-alone case, and the side-force increases monotonically with the <b>roll</b> <b>angle,</b> without showing any maximum in contrast to the other two models.

When vortex breakdown was present over the wing at zero <b>roll</b> <b>angle,</b> its variation was little affected at static or dynamic <b>roll</b> <b>angles.</b> However, there were relatively large variations of maximum vorticity and in the size of the vortical flow region in a cross-flow plane.
