The free arm is used to pull line from the reel or to retrieve line from the water.

2500|$|Once hooked, a small trout can {{be easily}} {{retrieved}} [...] "on the reel" [...] or by simply pulling in the fly line with the reel hand while pinching {{the line between the}} <b>rod</b> <b>handle</b> and the index finger of the rod hand. It is important to keep the rod tip high, allowing the bend of the rod to absorb the force of the fish's struggles against the line. Larger trout will often take line in powerful runs before they can be landed. Unlike spin fishing where the line is already on the reel, playing a large fish with fly line and a fly reel can present a special challenge. Usually, when a fish is hooked, there will be extra fly line coiled between the reel and the index finger of the rod hand. The challenge is to reel up the loose fly line onto the reel without breaking off a large fish (or getting the line wrapped up around the <b>rod</b> <b>handle,</b> one's foot, a stick or anything else in the way). With experience, really large trout can be put on the reel simply by applying light pressure on the outgoing line using the fisher's fingers. Once the extra line is on the reel, an angler can use the reel's drag system to tire the fish. It is important to use heavier tippet material if it won't spook the fish. The reason why this is important is an exhausted fish can easily die if released too soon. Heavier tippet material enables the angler to land the fish while not over exhausting it.|$|E

5000|$|The M1 rifle is fed by an [...] "en bloc" [...] clip {{which holds}} eight rounds of [...]30-06 Springfield ammunition. When the last {{cartridge}} is fired, the rifle ejects the clip and locks the bolt open. The M1 is {{now ready to}} reload. Once the clip is inserted, the bolt snaps forward on its own as soon as thumb pressure is released from the top round of the clip, chambering a round and leaving it ready to fire. Although it is not absolutely necessary, the preferred method is to place {{the back of the}} right hand against the operating <b>rod</b> <b>handle</b> and press the clip home with the right thumb; this releases the bolt, but the hand restrains the bolt from slamming closed on the operator's thumb (resulting in [...] "M1 thumb"); the hand is then quickly withdrawn, the operating rod moves forward and the bolt closes with sufficient force to go fully to battery. Thus, after the clip has been pressed into position in the magazine, the operating <b>rod</b> <b>handle</b> should be released, allowing the bolt to snap forward under pressure from the operating rod spring. The operating <b>rod</b> <b>handle</b> may be smacked with the palm to ensure the bolt is closed.|$|E

50|$|Another variant {{that never}} saw duty was the T20E2. It was {{experimental}} gas-operated, selective fire rifle {{with a slightly}} longer receiver than M1 and modified to accept 20-round Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) magazines. The rifle was machined and tapped on left side of receiver for scope mount, and included the same hardware for mounting a grenade launcher as the M1. The bolt had a hold open device on the rear receiver bridge, {{as well as a}} fire selector similar to the M14. Full automatic fire was achieved by a connector assembly which was actuated by the operating <b>rod</b> <b>handle.</b> This, in turn, actuated a sear release or trip which, with the trigger held to the rear, disengaged the sear from the hammer lugs immediately after the bolt was locked. In automatic firing, the cyclic rate of fire was 700 rpm. When the connector assembly was disengaged, the rifle could only be fired semi-automatically and functioned {{in a manner similar to}} the M1 rifle. The T20 had an overall length of 48 1/4", a barrel length of 24", and weighed 9.61 lbs. without accessories and 12.5 lbs. with bipod and empty magazine. Designated as limited procurement in May, 1945. Due to cessation of hostilities with Japan, number for manufacture was reduced to 100. The project was terminated in March 1948.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "power value" [...] or [...] "rod weight". Rods may be {{classified}} as ultra-light, light, medium-light, medium, medium-heavy, heavy, ultra-heavy, or other similar combinations. Power is often an indicator of what types of fishing, species of fish, or size of fish a particular pole may be best used for. Ultra-light rods are suitable for catching small bait fish and also panfish, or situations where rod responsiveness is critical. Ultra-Heavy rods are used in deep sea fishing, surf fishing, or for heavy fish by weight. While manufacturers use various designations for a rod's power, there is no fixed standard, hence application of a particular power tag by a manufacturer is somewhat subjective. Any fish can theoretically be caught with any rod, of course, but catching panfish on a heavy rod offers no sport whatsoever, and successfully landing a large fish on an ultralight rod requires supreme <b>rod</b> <b>handling</b> skills at best, and more frequently ends in broken tackle and a lost fish. Rods are best suited {{to the type of}} fishing they are intended for.|$|R

40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{deployment of}} remote fabrication and refabrication processes {{will be a}} requirement {{for the implementation of}} transmutation (Meyer, 2001). Fabrication processes for different fuel types differ in terms of equipment types, throughput, and cost. A comprehensive assessment of the issue is presented in NEA, 2000. Many aspects of manufacturing will be common to both powder-based and metallic fuels manufacturing. These comprise: fuel pin assembly, welding of the cladding tubes, and dimensional inspection of slugs, pellets, and completed fuel pins. The paper describes the design of robot arms, control strategies and end effectors for material handling in a hot cell, such as pellet insertion into fuel rods and fuel <b>rod</b> <b>handling.</b> The dynamics of the robots and the objects handled by them are analyzed in detail using state of the art software tools. In addition to the evaluation and testing of normal assembly operations, the simulation provides for a comprehensive analysis of forces and loads, including those occurring during atypical events such as collisions.

50|$|Dark Adaptation Threshold (DAT) is {{a vision}} test that {{measures}} the adjustment {{of the eye}} occurring under low levels of illumination. When light enters the eye, it ultimately reaches the rods and cones, which {{are two types of}} cells in the retina. <b>Rods</b> <b>handle</b> vision in low light conditions and cones handle color vision and detail. The rods and cones each react differently during the DAT test, and are measured on a graph. The test determines the threshold, or minimum light intensity required to produce a visual sensation in the child's eye. In order to perform this test, the child is asked to sit in the dark for a half-hour. This allows the eyes to be most sensitive for the test. Once the eyes have fully adapted, the child stands in front of a black projection screen. Dim spots of light are projected onto the screen, one at a time, on either the right or the left side. The spots get dimmer as the test goes on. The child is asked to point to the spots until he or she can no longer distinguish them. In order to keep the child's attention on the screen, sometimes the doctor will wave a brighter light on the screen to hold the child's interest when the test becomes harder to see. When an infant is being tested, an observer with a night vision camera records the head and eye movements of the child as they look at the spots. Once the patient can no longer see the spots, the dark adapted threshold is determined. The DAT test lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes.|$|R
