50|$|The Marshalite {{was a form}} of <b>rotary</b> <b>traffic</b> {{signal that}} was {{designed}} in 1936 by an Australian Charles Marshall (1864 - Dunedin, New Zealand - 3 April 1953, Mornington, Victoria, Australia), founder of the Fitzroy firm of Charles Marshall Pty. Ltd.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{innovations}} credited to Eno are traffic regulations, the stop sign, the pedestrian crosswalk, the traffic circle, the one-way street, the taxi stand, and pedestrian safety islands. His <b>rotary</b> <b>traffic</b> plan {{was put into}} effect at Columbus Circle, New York City, in 1905, at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, 1907, Piccadilly Circus in 1926, and Rond Ponte on the Champs-Élysées in 1927.|$|E
50|$|The 553, 554, 556, and 558 each loop one-and-one-half times {{around the}} rotary {{in order to}} stop at both the south and north bus stops on each run in order to serve {{passengers}} who do not wish to cross the fast-moving <b>rotary</b> <b>traffic</b> on foot. Similarly, outbound 502 and 504 buses loop completely around the rotary before proceeding to Watertown. The 52 and 57, which make local stops {{on both sides of the}} rotary, do not make these extra loops.|$|E

50|$|One {{form of the}} {{roundabout}} interchange can be used {{to connect}} a highway with a non-highway. It uses a single roundabout, <b>rotary,</b> or <b>traffic</b> circle which spans the highway as an over/underpass. Such junctions can be improved by adding a flyover for straight-through traffic on the non-freeway, creating the Roundabout interchange.|$|R
50|$|At four-legged intersections within Europe, a {{roundabout}} or mini-roundabout {{is commonly}} used to assign a relative priority to each approach. (Roundabouts remain rare in North America, where early failures of <b>rotaries</b> and <b>traffic</b> circles caused such designs to lose favor until the gradual introduction of the modern roundabout in the late 20th century.) Alternatively, at smaller intersections, priority to the right is widely used in most countries with right-hand traffic.|$|R
50|$|Furnace Brook Parkway {{begins at}} {{the east end of}} Wampatuck Road, one of the Blue Hills Reservation Parkways, located at the gated northeastern {{entrance}} to the Blue Hills Reservation at Bunker Hill Road in West Quincy. The reservation gates at this intersection are open during the day and closed from 8 PM to 7 AM. From Bunker Hill Road the parkway travels east to northeast for 1300 ft before merging with Willard Street, formerly a northern segment of Massachusetts Route 37. The two roads enter the Furnace Brook Rotary as they meet amid single-lane directional roadways. <b>Rotary</b> <b>traffic</b> proceeds counterclockwise, with ramps entering and exiting the Southeast Expressway {{on either side of the}} limited access highway; Furnace Brook Parkway exits on the northeastern side of the rotary after passing under the expressway. Traffic traveling westbound on the parkway around the rotary is carried above the expressway on a bridge where it meets exiting southbound expressway traffic in a cross weave.|$|E
50|$|Lynn Shore Reservation is a {{protected}} coastal reservation {{in the city}} of Lynn, Massachusetts. It includes 22 acre of beaches and recreational areas. From north to south, King's Beach, Red Rock Park and Lynn Beach are located along Lynn Shore Drive and Nahant Bay, a small bay of the Atlantic. The reservation shares athletic fields with Nahant Beach Reservation in the area around Nahant <b>Rotary,</b> a <b>traffic</b> circle at its southern end.|$|R
25|$|A new Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge will be {{constructed}} beginning in 2011. The bridge will be shifted {{slightly to the}} south from its current location, possibly terminating in a new <b>traffic</b> <b>rotary</b> to be called Potomac Circle at South Capitol, R, and Potomac Streets.|$|R
50|$|Nahant Beach Reservation is a {{protected}} coastal reservation covering 67 acre of beach and recreational {{areas in the}} town of Nahant, Massachusetts. Nahant Road, called Nahant Beach Boulevard when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003, offers access to 7000 ft Long Beach on the Atlantic Ocean side to the east. The reservation includes a boat ramp with access to Lynn Harbor and shares athletic fields with Lynn Shore Reservation in the area around Nahant <b>Rotary,</b> a <b>traffic</b> circle at the reservation's northern end. The reservation is part of the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston.|$|R
5000|$|Sheikh Zayed Road {{has several}} {{interchanges}} to enable traffic {{to go on}} and off the highway. These interchanges commonly lead to roundabouts (<b>rotaries)</b> to enable <b>traffic</b> to exit or to go {{to the other side of}} the highway. There are many other exits although they are not as well equipped. As of 2007, the interchanges are: ...|$|R

50|$|New Jersey {{had been}} quite fond of traffic circles {{starting}} in 1927, when the Airport Circle in Pennsauken Township opened to traffic on July 1, 1927, as the first such <b>traffic</b> <b>rotary</b> in the United States. While the state had as many as 67 traffic circles at its peak, projects initiated by the NJDOT since the mid-1970s had reduced the count to 37 by 1999.|$|R
50|$|The <b>traffic</b> <b>rotary</b> on {{the western}} end of the Parkway, {{at the foot of the}} Art Museum's Rocky Steps, is named Eakins Oval after Philadelphia painter Thomas Eakins. The traffic lanes around Eakins Oval {{originally}} formed a regular oval; this pattern was modified in the early 1960s to its present elongated circular shape, with the truncated lanes serving as staging areas for various events.|$|R
5000|$|The Micmac (or Mic Mac) <b>Rotary</b> was a <b>traffic</b> circle {{located at}} the {{intersection}} of Hwy 111 with Route 318 (Braemar Drive) and Trunk 7 (Main Street/Prince Albert Road/Grahams Grove). It was named after nearby Lake Micmac, which was partially in-filled to accommodate it. The Micmac Rotary was notorious for rush hour congestion, even resulting in the recording of a song entitled [...] "Mic Mac Rotary Blues".|$|R
50|$|Built in 1925, the Airport Circle is New Jersey's first traffic circle. The circle {{opened to}} traffic on July 1, 1927, {{as the first}} such <b>traffic</b> <b>rotary</b> in the United States. It is named for the former Camden Central Airport, a small airport that {{operated}} in this vicinity between 1929 and 1957. The Airport Circle was later modified to include overhead ramps and traffic lights to move traffic through.|$|R
5000|$|In New England, traffic circles are {{generally}} called <b>rotaries</b> and the <b>traffic</b> {{that is already}} driving in the rotary always has {{the right of way}} (see roundabout). For examples of where this is specified, in Massachusetts [...] "Any operator of a vehicle entering a rotary intersection shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle already in the intersection.". [...] In Rhode Island entering vehicles [...] "Yield to vehicles in the roundabout." ...|$|R
5000|$|Officially {{designated}} Union Square, the Milford Oval {{is neither}} square nor oval in shape, but rather triangular. The [...] "square" [...] name in American parlance denotes a town common irrespective of geometry, and the [...] "oval" [...] name {{dates from the}} 19th century, when it was oval in shape. The Oval is the town center, with the Pillsbury Bandstand as its centerpiece and the Souhegan River as backdrop. The Oval is formed by a modified <b>traffic</b> <b>rotary</b> in which State Highways 13 and 101A intersect, with northbound 13 and eastbound 101A passing straight through and crossing each other at a right angle with a stop sign for traffic on Route 13. For many years, the Oval's traffic flow {{was treated as a}} series of three individual intersections of three one-way streets, resulting in the unusual arrangement whereby vehicles entering the Oval had right-of-way over vehicles turning left to continue through the Oval. This treatment was reversed in the 1980s to conform with <b>traffic</b> <b>rotary</b> norms whereby vehicles already in the Oval have right-of-way over vehicles entering the Oval.|$|R
25|$|New England {{has largely}} {{preserved}} its regional character, especially in its historic places. The region {{has become more}} ethnically diverse, having seen waves of immigration from Ireland, Quebec, Italy, Portugal, Poland, Asia, Latin America, Africa, {{other parts of the}} U.S., and elsewhere. The enduring European influence {{can be seen in the}} region in the use of <b>traffic</b> <b>rotaries,</b> the bilingual French and English towns of northern Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire, the region's heavy prevalence of English town- and county-names, and its unique, often non-rhotic coastal dialect reminiscent of southeastern England.|$|R
40|$|Modern roundabouts, first {{installed}} in England {{in the early}} 1960 s, are becoming popular substitutes for signalized intersections in India. These facilities were originally introduced in order {{to solve the problems}} of the existing <b>rotaries</b> and <b>traffic</b> circles. This thesis presents a formulation for evaluating the capacity, delay, and level of service of multilane signalized roundabouts. Based on the study of available literatures, the formulation uses the gap acceptance theory and evaluates entry lanes on a lane-by-lane basis. Besides circulating and exiting flows, number of lanes and lateral position of the vehicles, as they approach and cross the roundabout, showed significant influence on roundabout entry capacity. Substantial differences in capacity estimates were observed between various considered methods. It is quite essential to calibrate such methods to meet regional needs. This study describes a new model for capacity estimation and level of service analysis of signalized roundabouts derived under heavy demand conditions at large roundabouts. The capacity estimation models, FHWA, IRC & SIDRA shown that the selected roundabout are under saturation condition and the Level of Service (LOS) was found out to be satisfactory...|$|R
5000|$|This new {{permanent}} settlement {{focused on}} the Town Green area, an inlet in the marshes at {{a bend in the}} Annisquam River. This area is now the site of Grant Circle, a large <b>traffic</b> <b>rotary</b> at which Massachusetts Route 128 mingles with a major city street (Washington Street/Rt 127). Here the first permanent settlers built a meeting house and therefore focused the nexus of their settlement on the [...] "Island" [...] for nearly 100 years. Unlike other early coastal towns in New England, development in Gloucester was not focused around the harbor as it is today, rather it was inland that people settled first. This is evidenced by the placement of the Town Green nearly two miles from the harbor-front.|$|R
50|$|US 1 Bypass {{begins at}} US 1 (Lafayette Road) south of {{downtown}} Portsmouth. Formerly a half-interchange with limited access and a flyover ramp, the old interchange was {{converted to a}} standard three-way intersection with full access in 2013. US 1 Bypass heads northwest (with NH 33 passing over without an interchange) and continues {{to the west of}} the city. It has two at-grade intersections with Borthwick Avenue and Coakley Road/Cottage Street before it comes to a large <b>rotary,</b> the Portsmouth <b>Traffic</b> Circle, where it interchanges with Interstate 95 and the southern end of the Spaulding Turnpike/NH 16 (which is also the eastern terminus of U.S. Route 4). US 1 Bypass enters the circle from the southeast and leaves via the first exit, turning to the northeast towards Maine.|$|R
5000|$|During {{that same}} year, Eno {{proposed}} {{the first version}} of today's roundabouts or traffic circles, which he termed [...] "the <b>rotary</b> or gyratory <b>traffic</b> system". In his 1920 book, Eno recalled that [...] "in 1903, the New York Police Department asked that a plan be suggested for Columbus Circle, where accidents were occurring almost daily. It was advised that vehicles should keep to the right, going around the circle in one direction instead of two. In 1905, the plan was put in operation.... In 1907, the system was put in operation at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but whether due to the suggestion sent them from New York or not is not clear." [...] His 1909 book, Street Traffic Regulation, contains a diagram of the Columbus Circle rotary.|$|R
50|$|Route 2 {{continues}} east to Middlesex County {{and enters}} Boston's outer loop at the interchange with Interstate 495 in Littleton. It continues as an expressway into Acton, where the expressway {{ends at the}} traffic-light intersection with Piper Road and Taylor Road, and Route 2 becomes a regular divided highway at most points and just a four-lane highway at other points. At the Concord <b>Rotary,</b> a major <b>traffic</b> choke point, Route 2 intersects with Route 2A and the eastern terminus of Route 119 (which is concurrent with Route 2A). After the rotary the road loses its dividing wall as it passes by the State Police (who have an emergency-only traffic light) and over the Assabet River. Route 2A formerly broke away from Route 2 at the next traffic light to go left into Concord but is now overlaid with Route 2. At Crosby's Corner, the sixth intersection after the rotary, Route 2A exits under the highway while Route 2 veers right (but still heads east). While the highway is divided across Lincoln, {{there is a single}} traffic light intersection at Bedford Rd.|$|R
50|$|The mid-18th century (1740) Babson-Alling House {{is one of}} two early {{dwellings}} {{that remain}} at Gloucester’s original town center. Once known as the Green, the central position of this inland area was usurped in 1738 when the First Parish Meetinghouse was moved eastward to the Inner Harbor where it remains (see Central Gloucester Historic District, and Boundary Increase). The Green area gradually declined over the next two hundred years until the mid 20th century when the north-shore corridor of Washington Street was “improved” with the Grant Circle <b>Rotary</b> to accommodate <b>traffic</b> from the newly constructed dual-lane State Route 128 (east-west). At that time the 17th century White-Ellery House (NRHP: 3/9/1990) was moved from its original location, roughly centered on the rotary, to its present position immediately north of the Babson-Alling House. These two well preserved early dwellings, along with a barn, stone walls, and other landscape features provide a unique and multi-faceted glimpse into the city’s origins. The remnant of a ca. 1930 scallop-topped wooden fence remains on the Babson-Alling property to indicate the early position of Washington Street.|$|R
50|$|Historical archaeological remains {{described}} above {{have the potential}} to further document Gloucester’s original town center, once known as the Green, which currently survives at this and one other location. Controlled testing and excavation can document the 18th through 20th century landuse of the property, much of which is no longer extant above ground. Construction features and stratigraphic profiles can further document the phases of construction and remodeling for the house and provide physical evidence of the town center or Green which no longer survives. Detailed analysis of occupational related features can provide important social, cultural, and economic data on inhabitants of the house including several slaves living there in the 18th century. Landscape features can also contribute important information towards the significance of the house. These features are important in interpreting the long-term development of the complex, including its current situation on a busy <b>traffic</b> <b>rotary.</b> A great deal of recent scholarship has focused on archaeological landscapes from a holistic perspective, one that takes in account diachronic landscape change as a factor in the development of layered landscapes (cf. Darvill et al. 1993). Thus in addition to possessing the potential for significant archaeological resources from the eighteen century, the house and yard can address questions regarding the importance of nineteenth-century landscape and filling as conscious efforts at presentation {{on the part of the}} house’s occupants.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and {{throughout}} the 2000s several modern buildings were built and opened to the public. In 1999 a brand new bathing resort including four indoor swimming pools and a jacuzzi was opened {{as a part of}} the city's center for sports and recreation. In 2003 a renovated sports hall, originally built in the 1970s and belonging to the constructional high school, was also opened {{as a part of the}} center for sports and recreation and hosted several group matches of the 2003 World Women's Handball Championship. Beginning in the late 1990s and early 2000s several large shopping centers and automobile showrooms emerged in the city, mostly in its northwestern part. Čakovec was twice rewarded The Green Flower award for the tidiest continental city in Croatia, in 2008 and 2009. Čakovec is the first city of the former Yugoslavia to have installed completely electronic information spots, located at the Republic Square and the Franciscan Square in the Center and at the Square of Saint Anthony of Padua in the Jug district. Čakovec is known as the city of traffic circles, because, during the late 1990s and early 2000s, all of its traffic lights in the inner part of the city were removed and replaced with <b>traffic</b> circles or <b>rotaries,</b> virtually eliminating <b>traffic</b> jams. The only remaining traffic lights in the city are located on the southern bypass. Although Čakovec is a small city by global parameters, its large working force which comes from all over the county, its location and importance in the region caused many traffic jams on the crossroads. Čakovec is home for many famous Croatian punk bands, including Bakterije and Motorno Ulje.|$|R
