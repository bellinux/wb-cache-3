500|$|The initial {{concept for}} the Model 27 {{was for the}} fighter to be carried half-exposed under the B-29, B-35 or B-36. The USAAF {{rejected}} this proposal, citing increased drag, and hence reduced range for the composite bomber-fighter configuration. On 19March1945, McDonnell's design team led by Herman D. Barkey, submitted a revised proposal, the extensively redesigned Model 27D. The smaller aircraft had an egg-shaped fuselage, three fork-shaped vertical stabilizers, horizontal stabilizers with a significant dihedral, and 37° swept-back folding wings {{to allow it to}} fit in the confines of a bomb bay. The diminutive aircraft measured [...] long; the folding wings spanned [...] Only a limited fuel supply of [...] was deemed necessary for the specified 30-minute combat endurance.

50|$|The B43 was {{developed}} from 1956 by Los Alamos National Laboratory, entering production in 1959. It entered service in April 1961. Total production was 2,000 weapons, ending in 1965. Some variants were parachute-retarded and featured a <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{versions}} of the B57 were equipped with a parachute retarder (a 3.8 m/12.5 ft diameter nylon/kevlar <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute)</b> to slow the weapon's descent, allowing the aircraft to escape the blast (or to allow the weapon to survive impact with the ground in laydown mode) at altitudes as low as 15 m (50 ft). Various fuzing modes were available, including a hydrostatic fuze {{for use as a}} depth charge for anti-submarine use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ribbon</b> {{and ring}} <b>parachutes</b> have {{similarities}} to annular designs. They are frequently designed to deploy at supersonic speeds. A conventional parachute would instantly burst upon opening and be shredded at such speeds. <b>Ribbon</b> <b>parachutes</b> have a ring-shaped canopy, {{often with a}} large hole in the centre to release the pressure. Sometimes the ring is broken into ribbons connected by ropes to leak air even more. These large leaks lower the stress on the parachute so it does not burst or shred when it opens. <b>Ribbon</b> <b>parachutes</b> made of Kevlar are used on nuclear bombs, such as the B61 and B83.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the parachutes {{that have been}} drop tested {{in support of the}} Ares I first stage deceleration system development. The results of the tests show that the reefing ratios for these quarter spherical <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachutes</b> provide the same reefed drag area as historical conical <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachutes.</b> Two sources are investigated for properly normalizing the parachutes relative to their suspension line length, and one is found to be superior.

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} test has been {{conducted}} on one-eighth scale models of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster drogue parachute system. The test included an investigation of four candidate drogue deployment concepts and a parametric steady state drag study of 20 -degree conical <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachutes.</b> The results show {{that at least two}} of the four deployment concepts tested are viable candidates for the full scale deployment system. The interference free steady state drag results obtained show excellent agreement with available drop test results on large 20 -degree conical <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachutes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The wing was {{mid-mounted}} {{with some}} dihedral {{and also with}} forward sweep to improve the visibility from the tandem cockpit. The fuselage was PFP skinned over PFP frames, with a shaped balsa outer layer for smoothness. This proved to be too easily damaged and was replaced on the second aircraft with a glass-fibre shell. The HKS-1 had a fully retractable monowheel undercarriage, assisted by partially retractable nose-skid/nose-wheel combination. In the absence of airbrakes it used a tail <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute.</b> It had a 100° V-tail of similar construction to the wings.|$|E
5000|$|In 1934, Georg Madelung and Munich-based Paul Schmidt {{proposed}} to the German Air Ministry a [...] "flying bomb" [...] powered by Schmidt's pulsejet. Madelung co-invented the <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute,</b> a device used to stabilise the V-1 in its terminal dive. Schmidt's prototype bomb {{failed to meet}} German Air Ministry specifications, especially owing to poor accuracy, range and high cost. The original Schmidt design had the pulsejet placed in a fuselage like a modern jet fighter, unlike the eventual V-1 which had the engine placed above the warhead and fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Laydown {{delivery}} is {{a mode of}} attack using a freefall nuclear weapon: the bomb's descent to the target is slowed by <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute</b> so that it actually lands on the ground before detonating. Laydown delivery requires the weapon's case to be reinforced {{so that it can}} survive the force of impact and generally involves a time-delay fuze to trigger detonation e.g. 45 seconds after hitting the ground. Laydown mode can be used to increase the effect of the weapon's blast on built-up targets such as submarine pens or to transmit a shock wave through the ground to attack deeply-buried targets. An attack of this type produces large amounts of radioactive fallout.|$|E

40|$|A new {{three-phase}} {{approach to}} {{recovery of the}} large liquid rocket boosters being studied for the Space Shuttle is proposed. The concept consists of a cluster of larger <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachutes,</b> retrorockets, and spar mode flotation. The two inert liquid rocket boosters weighing 115, 000 lb to 183, 000 lb descend from high altitude in a side-on coning attitude to 16, 000 ft altitude where a cluster of large <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachutes</b> are deployed. The terminal velocity near water landing is 80 ft/sec. Retrorockets are used to decrease the velocity to about 40 ft/sec. The third phase is opening of {{the front end of}} the cylindrical rocket case to allow flooding to cushion impact and allow vertical flotation in the spar mode keeping the four expensive liquid rocket engines dry...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{performance characteristics}} have been determined for the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster drogue, main, and pilot parachutes. The performance evaluation on the 20 -degree conical <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachutes</b> is {{based primarily on}} air drop tests of full scale prototype parachutes. In addition, parametric wind tunnel tests were performed and used in parachute configuration development and preliminary performance assessments. The wind tunnel test data are compared to the drop test results and both sets of data are {{used to determine the}} predicted performance of the Solid Rocket Booster flight parachutes. Data from other drop tests of large <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachutes</b> are also compared with the Solid Rocket Booster parachute performance characteristics. Parameters assessed include full open terminal drag coefficients, reefed drag area, opening characteristics, clustering effects, and forebody interference...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} in a similar way, with 10 mm thick planking. It had a very smoothly streamlined and small cross-section shape, tapering to the tail. The pilot was in a fully reclining seat, allowing a long, detachable, single piece, blown plexiglass canopy which did not interrupt the fuselage profile. A retractable, fully enclosed monowheel, with a brake, was fitted. The empennage was conventional and simply wooden, with an all moving tailplane mounted on a broad, tall, straight edged fin just above the fuselage. The rudder, straight edged, forward swept and hinged well clear of the elevator, extended down to the keel {{where there was a}} small tail bumper. The elevator but not the rudder was balanced. As the Nixope had no wing mounted airbrakes, a 1.3 m diameter <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute</b> was mounted in the tail.|$|E
5000|$|The B83 {{replaced}} several earlier weapons, {{including the}} B28, B43, {{and to some}} extent the ultra-high-yield B53. It was the first U.S. nuclear weapon designed from the start to avoid accidental detonation, with the use of [...] "insensitive explosives" [...] in the trigger lens system. Its layout {{is similar to that of}} the smaller B61, with the warhead mounted in the forward part of the weapon to make the bomb nose-heavy. It was intended for high-speed carriage (up to Mach 2.0) and delivery at high or low altitude. For the latter role, it is equipped with a parachute retardation system, with a 46 ft Kevlar <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute</b> capable of rapid deceleration. It can be employed in free-fall, retarded, contact, and laydown modes, for air-burst or ground-burst detonation. Security features include next-generation permissive action link (PAL) and a command disablement system (CDS), rendering the weapon tactically useless without a nuclear yield.|$|E

To save weight, the fighter had no landing gear.

40|$|The {{air drop}} {{development}} test {{program for the}} Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Recovery System required {{the design of a}} large drop test vehicle that would meet all the stringent requirements placed on it by structural loads, safety considerations, flight recovery system interfaces, and sequence. The drop test vehicle had to have the capability to test the drogue and the three main parachutes both separately and in the total flight deployment sequence and still be low-cost to fit in a low-budget development program. The design to test large <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachutes</b> to loads of 300, 000 pounds required the detailed investigation and integration of several parameters such as carrier aircraft mechanical interface, drop test vehicle ground transportability, impact point ground penetration, salvageability, drop test vehicle intelligence, flight design hardware interfaces, and packaging fidelity...|$|R
50|$|The {{recovery}} sequence {{begins with}} {{the operation of the}} high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of 15704 ft, about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The 11.5 ft diameter conical <b>ribbon</b> pilot <b>parachute</b> provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve 105 ft suspension lines, the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy, and the 54 ft diameter conical <b>ribbon</b> drogue <b>parachute</b> inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue disreefs twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7 and 12-second reefing line cutters), and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment. The drogue parachute has a design load of approximately 315000 lb and weighs approximately 1200 lb.|$|R
40|$|The NASA X- 38 program {{required}} a larger, more robust drogue parachute. A multi-organizational team from NASA, Sandia National Laboratories, United Space Alliance, and Pioneer Aerospace Corporation has developed and tested a new 80 -ft. -dia., quarter-spherical, <b>ribbon</b> drogue <b>parachute.</b> The design requirements, design specifics, margin analyses, and results of testing are all discussed herein. Some {{of the weight}} advantages of switching from Kevlar to Zylon for radial, line and riser materials are presented...|$|R
50|$|The Natter had no landing gear, which saved weight, {{expense and}} {{construction}} time. Consequently, {{one of the}} most unusual features of the machine was the escape of the pilot and recovery of the machine. The proposed sequence of these events was as follows: After the attack, the Natter might dive to a lower altitude and flatten out into level flight. The pilot would then proceed with a well-practised escape sequence. He would open the cockpit canopy latch; the canopy flicking backwards on its hinge in the airstream; he would undo his seat belt and remove his feet from the rudder pedal stirrups. By squeezing a lever mounted on the control column, he would release a lock {{at the base of the}} column, which would allow him to tilt the column forwards where it could engage in and undo a safety latch for the nose release mechanism. He would then lean a little further forward and pull a lever hinged near the floor at the front of the cockpit. This action frees the nose section, which self-jettisoned as a result of the reduced aerodynamic pressure at the front of the fuselage. As the nose section separates, it was intended to briefly pull on two cables that release a small <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute</b> stored on the starboard side of the rear fuselage. The parachute subsequently opens and decelerates the Natter. The pilot would be ejected from the cockpit by his own inertia and as soon as he was clear of the fuselage, he would open his personal parachute and descend to the ground.|$|E
40|$|An {{empirical}} formula for the steady state drag coefficient of a 20 degree conical <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute</b> is developed. The derived expression {{takes into account}} the effect of suspension line length and geometric porosity within the limits of practical design. Also included are factors which provide drag reduction due to skirt reefing and the wake behind a primary body. The calculated values are in agreement with the available experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The {{unsteady}} aerodynamics of parachutes {{have been}} a challenge to study for years due to the coupling between the aerodynamic forces and system dynamics. This paper presents results from a Navier-Stokes flow solver simulating a steady inflow around a parachute model at a Reynolds number of 365, 000. The parachute model, rigid and hemispherical in shape, {{is similar to that}} of a <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute</b> with four ribbons or rings. Pressure results are compared to experimental data to judge accuracy of the simulations. Additional results include pressure and vorticity contours, as well as computational oil-flow visualizations and streamlines.

50|$|After the drogue chute has {{stabilized}} the SRB in a tail-first attitude, the frustum {{is separated}} from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low-altitude baroswitch at a nominal altitude of 5500 ft about 243 seconds after SRB separation. The frustum is then {{pulled away from the}} SRB by the drogue chute. The main chute suspension lines are pulled out from deployment bags that remain in the frustum. At full extension of the lines, which are 203 ft long, the three main chutes are pulled from their deployment bags and inflate to their first reefed condition. The frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splashdown. After specified time delays (using redundant 10 and 17-second reefing line cutters), the main chute reefing lines are cut and the chutes inflate to their second reefed and full open configurations. The main chute cluster decelerates the SRB to terminal conditions. Each of the 136 ft diameter, 20-degree conical <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachutes</b> have a design load of approximately 195000 lb and each weighs approximately 2180 lb. These parachutes are the largest that have ever been used — both in deployed size and load weight. The RSRM nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation.|$|R
40|$|Ejection {{seats are}} {{inherently}} unstable during {{high and low}} speed ejections unless positive stabilization devices are incorporated. Today’s expanded 103 to 245 pound aircrew size range further challenges seat stability. The USAF ACES II seat {{is by far the}} most stable ejection seat in the world under low speed conditions. The ACES II is stabilized at zero to low airspeed with the STAPAC rocket assembly, and is aerodynamically stabilized at high speed by the STAPAC and a 5. 0 ft. hemisflo <b>ribbon</b> drogue <b>parachute.</b> The USAF developed the Enhanced Drogue System, as part of the US/Japan Cooperative Modification Project, which improves high-speed seat stability and reduces the aircrew injury risk...|$|R

Factories that made silk <b>ribbons</b> now produced <b>parachutes,</b> automobile factories built tanks, typewriter companies converted to machine guns, undergarment manufacturers sewed mosquito netting, and {{a roller coaster}} manufacturer converted {{to the production of}} bomber repair platforms. The WPB ensured that each factory received the materials it needed to produce the most war goods in the shortest time.|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{wind tunnel}} test trials were {{conducted}} on a 30 degree conical <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute</b> with porosities of 30, 27, and 24 percent. Variables were Mach number, dynamic pressure, towline length, and coefficient of drag. A Rotofoil parachute having a porosity of approximately 24 percent was tested, but failed after about 30 seconds of operation at a Mach number of 1. 8 All of the parachutes had a nominal diameter and shroud line length of 10 inches.

40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{has been developed}} for determining the internal load distribution for ribbon parachutes subjected to known riser and aerodynamic forces. Finite elements with non-linear elastic properties represent the parachute structure. This method {{is an extension of}} the analysis previously developed by the authors and implemented in the digital computer program CANO. The present analysis accounts for the effect of vertical ribbons in the solution for canopy shape and stress distribution. Parametric results are presented which relate the canopy stress distribution to such factors as vertical ribbon strength, number of gores, and gore shape in a <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the steady state stresses in model <b>ribbon</b> <b>parachute</b> canopies is presented. The distribution of circumferential stress was measured in the horizontal ribbons of two parachutes using Omega sensors. Canopy pressure distributions and overall drag were also measured. Testing was conducted in the University of Minnesota Low-Speed Wind Tunnel at dynamic pressures ranging from 1. 0 to 1. 5 inches of water. The stresses in the parachute canopies were calculated using the parachute structural analysis code, CANO. It {{was found that the}} general shape of the measured and calculated stress distributions was fairly similar; however, the measured stresses were somewhat less than the calculated stresses...|$|E
40|$|A {{subscale}} {{wind tunnel}} test program for Orion's conical <b>ribbon</b> drogue <b>parachute</b> is under development. The desired goals of the program are to quantify aerodynamic performance of the parachute {{in the wake of}} the entry vehicle, including understanding of the coupling of the parachute and command module dynamics, and an improved understanding of the load distribution within the textile elements of the parachute. The test program is ten percent of full scale conducted in a 3 x 2. 1 m (10 x 7 ft) closed loop subsonic wind tunnel. The subscale test program is uniquely suited to probing the aerodynamic and structural environment in both a quantitative and qualitative manner. Non-intrusive diagnostics, including Particle Image Velocimetry for wake velocity surveys, high speed pressure transducers for canopy pressure distribution, and a high speed photogrammetric reconstruction, will be used to quantify the parachute's performance...|$|R

The lifting parachute model was attached to a forebody representing the payload. The forebody was designed and installed in the test section in a manner which allowed rotational freedom about the pitch and yaw axes.

40|$|A {{numerical}} flow {{model is}} developed to simulate two-dimensional fluid flow past immersed, elastically supported tube arrays. This work {{is motivated by}} the objective of predicting forces and motion associated with both deep-water drilling and production risers in the oil industry. This work has other engineering applications including simulation of flow past tubular heat exchangers or submarine-towed sensor arrays and the flow about <b>parachute</b> <b>ribbons.</b> In the present work, a vortex method is used for solving the unsteady flow field. This method demonstrates inherent advantages over more conventional grid-based computational fluid dynamics. The vortex method is non-iterative, does not require artificial viscosity for stability, displays minimal numerical diffusion, can easily treat moving boundaries, and allows a greatly reduced computational domain since vorticity occupies {{only a small fraction}} of the fluid volume. A gridless approach is used in the flow sufficiently distant from surfaces. A Lagrangian remap scheme is used near surfaces to calculate diffusion and convection of vorticity. A fast multipole technique is utilized for efficient calculation of velocity from the vorticity field. The ability of the method to correctly predict lift and drag forces on simple stationary geometries over a broad range of Reynolds numbers is presented...|$|R

40|$|Much {{has been}} written {{over the last several}} years about the {{increase}} in the number of students who come to our campuses with behavioral disorders and under medication. While honors students are certainly not immune to these conditions, the more frequent emotional trauma we see them suffer is their first encounter with failure. Luckily, we can address this trauma successfully if we are prepared to do so. As honors faculty, we encourage intellectual risk, knowing from our own experience that failure may very well result but confident in the fact that learning also happens despite other outcomes, good or bad. Armed with this knowledge, one of the most important lessons we can teach our students is how to fail. Our high-achieving students, as they emerge from their pre-baccalaureate education and childhood experience, typically reach us ill-equipped to fail. They have always had cheerleaders, <b>parachutes,</b> <b>ribbons,</b> and rewards to the extent that they consider even good performance inadequate. The first “B” grade can send such students into a tailspin, leading them to question their abilities and their very identities, which are often wrapped up in their definitions of success. Along with teaching our disciplines, then, we need to teach students a few lessons on how and why to fail...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} to measure surface pressure {{data on a}} series of three stainless steel simulated <b>parachute</b> <b>ribbons</b> was conducted. During {{the first phase of the}} test, unsteady pressure measurements were made on the windward and leeward sides of the ribbons to determine the statistical properties of the surface pressures. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were simultaneously made to establish the velocity field in the wake of the ribbons and its correlation with the pressure measurements. In the second phase of the test, steady-state pressure measurements were made to establish the pressure distributions. In the third phase, the stainless steel ribbons were replaced with nylon ribbons and PIV measurements were made in the wake. A detailed error analysis indicates that the accuracy of the pressure measurements was very good. However, an anomaly in the flow field caused the wake behind the stainless steel ribbons to establish itself in a stable manner on one side of the model. This same stability was not present for the nylon ribbon model although an average of the wake velocity data indicated an apparent 2 {degree} upwash in the wind tunnel flow field. Since flow angularity upstream of the model was not measured, the use of the data for code validation is not recommended without a second {{experiment to}} establish that upstream boundary condition...|$|R

In July 2009, {{the mission was}} flown, with great success, from the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. The MLAS flight test vehicle prototype consists of a boost skirt, coast skirt, and the MLAS fairing itself, which houses an Orion Command Module (CM) boilerplate. The objective of the MLAS flight test is to reorient the fairing with the CM, weighing approximately 29, 000 lbs and traveling 290 fps, 180 degrees to an orientation suitable {{for the release of}} the CM during a pad abort or low altitude abort. The boost and coast skirts provide the necessary thrust and stability to establish the flight test conditions and are released prior to the reorientation of the fairing. A secondary test objective after successful release of the CM from the fairing is to demonstrate the removal of the CM forward bay cover (FBC) with the CM drogue parachutes, and subsequent deployment of the CM main parachutes attached to the FBC. Although multiple parachute deployments are used in the MLAS flight test vehicle to complete its objective, there are only two parachute types employed in the flight test.
