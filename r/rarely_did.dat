5|$|Many envisioned {{starting}} a silk {{industry in the}} British colonies in America, starting in 1619, under the reign of King James I of England. The silk industry in the colonies never became very large. Likewise, silk was introduced to numerous other countries, including Mexico, where it was brought by Cortez in 1522. Only <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> these new silk industries grow to any significant size.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Borah {{became one}} of the {{progressive}} insurgents who challenged President William Howard Taft's policies, though Borah refused to support former president Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid against Taft in 1912. Borah reluctantly voted for war in 1917 and, once it concluded, he fought against the Versailles treaty, and the Senate did not ratify it. Remaining a maverick, Borah often fought with the Republican presidents in office between 1921 and 1933, though Coolidge offered to make Borah his running mate in 1924. Borah campaigned for Hoover in 1928, something he <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> for presidential candidates and never did again.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Archaeoastronomy's {{development}} as an interdisciplinary subject, {{research in the}} field is conducted by investigators trained {{in a wide range of}} disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> television work.|$|E
5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either inside or outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, but it could be called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> so unless the consuls were away and the tribunes almost never did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E
5|$|The {{maker of}} the work is unknown; it is not signed or marked, and goldsmiths of the period <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> this. There are a number of goldsmiths' names known from {{accounts}} and other records, but none of the few surviving works can be attached to a particular maker. Paris was the centre of production for the great numbers of joyaux, secular and religious, produced for the extended Valois royal family and other buyers. Berry and his brothers and nephews had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for what must have been a continuous flow of commissions, whose results are tersely catalogued in various inventories of the period, but of which there are now only a handful of survivals. Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary, but this was made after 1401, which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry. Another possibility is that the reliquary was made and given as a gift, as many such pieces were, in between inventories.|$|E

25|$|The Marianne North Gallery {{was built}} in the 1880s to house the {{paintings}} of Marianne North, an MP's daughter who travelled alone to North and South America, South Africa and many parts of Asia, at a time when women <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> so, to paint plants. The gallery has 832 of her paintings. The paintings were left to Kew by the artist and a condition of the bequest is that the layout of the paintings in the gallery may not be altered.|$|E
25|$|Dylan demoed some of {{the songs}} in the studio, {{something}} he <b>rarely</b> <b>did.</b> Members of Dylan's touring band were involved in these sessions. Dylan also used these loose, informal sessions to experiment with new ideas and arrangements. Dylan continued rewriting lyrics until January 1997, when the official album sessions began. It was the second collaboration between Dylan and Lanois, who had previously produced Dylan's 1989 release Oh Mercy and {{was known for his}} work with artists such as Emmylou Harris (on Wrecking Ball) and U2 (on The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby).|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{duration}} of the Cold War external intervention and mediation in civil conflicts took on a state-centric mechanism in which sovereignty was inviolable. <b>Rarely</b> <b>did</b> the international community intervene in internal conflicts involving a state's government and domestic belligerents that opposed it. Since the end of the Cold War, however, that has changed. Today, mediation by international actors in civil conflict rest on a standardised resolution mechanism that accords broadly equal standing to all factions within a conflict, and attempts to reach a settlement accepted by all.|$|E

25|$|The 18th {{century was}} also a great age for the {{topographical}} print, depicting more or less accurately a real view {{in a way that}} landscape painting <b>rarely</b> <b>did.</b> Initially these were mostly centred on a building, but {{over the course of the}} century, with the growth of the Romantic movement pure landscapes became more common. The topographical print, often intended to be framed and hung on a wall, remained a very popular medium into the 20th century, but was often classed as a lower form of art than an imagined landscape.|$|E
25|$|Ellington led the {{orchestra}} by conducting from the keyboard using piano cues and visual gestures; very <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> he conduct using a baton. By 1932 his orchestra consisted of six brass instruments, four reeds, and a four-man rhythm section. As a bandleader, Ellington {{was not a}} strict disciplinarian; he maintained control of his orchestra {{with a combination of}} charm, humor, flattery and astute psychology. A complex, private person, he revealed his feelings to only his closest intimates and effectively used his public persona to deflect attention away from himself.|$|E
25|$|A {{right arm}} bowler of slow to medium pace, Walter Mead always {{maintained}} an excellent length and could spin back to deadly effect whenever wickets {{were affected by}} rain. He could vary his stock off break with a ball that turned the other way, but he lacked the deceptive flight that enabled such bowlers as Blythe, Dennett or J.C. White to do well on firm pitches. He <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> much as a batsman, but when sent in as night-watchman against Leicestershire in 1902 he surprised the crowd so much by making 119 {{that there was a}} special collection for him as a reward.|$|E

25|$|Scandinavian {{shipbuilding}} technology {{failed to}} advance {{beyond that of}} the Viking days. The traditional Viking ships performed quite well in the relatively tranquil summer seas of the medieval warm period, but the stormier climates rendered these vessels particularly dangerous {{to the point of}} obsolescence. Viking technology spread earlier throughout Europe, and craftsmen along the Atlantic seaboard of western Europe began to develop ships capable of withstanding heavy seas and the gales that struck commonly even during mid-summer. <b>Rarely</b> <b>did</b> a medieval mariner without a death wish dare to venture beyond easy sight of port during the long winter season.|$|E
25|$|I {{was at the}} Sydney Cricket Ground in 1982 {{when this}} unknown Canberra teenage fullback was playing in what was {{regarded}} {{as something of a}} trial, a curtain raiser to a Test against a New Zealand Under 21 side, though <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> anyone from such a trial graduate immediately to much else. People were wandering into the ground and those who were there gave little attention to what was happening on the paddock. But on this day, and not for the first time, a remarkably gifted and fleet of foot Canberra teenager swept into the backline, received the ball {{at the end of a}} pass, chip-kicked, accelerated, gathered and scored.|$|E
25|$|Fiddian-Green first {{played in}} June 1920 against Cambridge University. He was {{by this time}} a student at Jesus College, having gone there {{at the age of}} 21 because of the First World War, but in this match he played for Warwickshire. He had a quiet game, scoring 1 and 23 not out, taking one catch and bowling a single over. He played another 14 times for the county that season, {{although}} only <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> he catch the eye: he made 53* (albeit out of 603/9 declared) against Worcestershire in early August, and in other games took two wickets: those of Lancashire's Robert Boddington and Middlesex's future Test all-rounder Nigel Haig.|$|E

25|$|Forced {{to accept}} the {{hopelessness}} of both {{the war and the}} situation at home, on 15 March 1917, Nicholas II abdicated in favour of his brother, Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich. The Grand Duke promptly refused {{to accept the}} throne without the support of the army and his people. A provisional Government was appointed and many members of the former Imperial family were arrested, including the former Tsar, the Empress and their children. No member of the Romanov family have lived in the Winter Palace since the abdication in 1917 and very <b>rarely</b> <b>did</b> after 1905. Nicholas II, his wife and children were all held in captivity until they were shot at Yekaterinburg in 1918. Other members of the former Imperial Family either met similar fates or escaped into exile.|$|E
25|$|Ivy City began a {{significant}} decline in 1953. American railroads, which until this time had used coal-fueled locomotives, began switching to diesel fuel or using overhead electrical wires for powering engines. By {{the end of}} the year, almost no coal-fed locomotives were using the Ivy City rail yard. Although coal-fueled engines required frequent refueling, a diesel train could go for as many as three days without needing more diesel fuel. Steam-powered locomotives required almost daily tune-up and repair, but diesel-fueled engines <b>rarely</b> <b>did.</b> Significant layoffs at the Ivy City Yard occurred, deeply affecting Ivy City itself were many of these workers lived. The eastern roundhouse and a number of tracks were demolished in early 1954, and by 1956 the coal wharf and ash pits were also gone. As the railroad laid off workers, Ivy City also declined as a neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|Lisa Salters {{also served}} as the lead {{sideline}} reporter for ABC's regular-season game coverage and the NBA Finals that season, filling in for Michele Tafoya while she was on maternity leave. Salters returned to her role as its secondary sideline reporter when Tafoya returned the following year. For the secondary broadcast team, ABC reunited Bill Walton and Steve Jones for game coverage. Walton and Jones worked the Christmas Day 2005 broadcast between the San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons for ABC, the first game they called together since Game 4 of the 2002 NBA Finals for NBC (NBC's last NBA telecast to date). The pair worked their first broadcast with Mike Breen, and worked {{the remainder of the}} season with Brent Musburger, Jim Durham and Mike Tirico. That team, along with the Breen-Brown duo, now often does ESPN's Wednesday or Friday game coverage, which the previous ABC announce teams <b>rarely</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
