There is no standard for <b>reporting</b> <b>head</b> impact data in sports to enable comparison between studies. Objective The {{aim was to}} outline methods for <b>reporting</b> <b>head</b> impact acceleration data in sport {{and the effect of}} the acceleration thresholds on the number of impacts reported. Methods A systematic review of accelerometer systems utilised to <b>report</b> <b>head</b> impact data in sport was conducted. The effect of using different thresholds on a set of impact data from 38 amateur senior rugby players in New Zealand over a competition season was calculated. Results Of the 52 studies identified, 42 % reported impacts using a[10 -g threshold, where g is the acceleration of gravity. Studies reported descriptive statistics as mean ± standard deviation, median, 25 th to 75 th interquartile range, and 95 th percentile. Application of the varied impact thresholds to the New Zealand data set resulted in 20, 687 impacts of [10 g, 11, 459 (45 % less) impacts of[15 g, and 4024 (81 % less) impacts of[30 g. Discussion Linear and angular raw data were most frequently reported. Metrics combining raw data may be more useful; however, validity of the metrics has not been adequately addressed for sport. Differing data collectionmethods and descriptive statistics for <b>reporting</b> <b>head</b> impacts in sports limit inter-study comparisons. Consensus on data analysis methods for sports impact assessment is needed, including thresholds. Based on the available data, the 10 -g threshold is the most commonly reported impact threshold and should be reported as the median with 25 th and 75 th interquartile ranges as the data are non-normally distributed. Validation studies are required to determine the best threshold and metrics for impact acceleration data collection in sport. Conclusion Until in-field validation studies are completed, it is recommended that head impact data should be reported as median and interquartile ranges using the 10 -g impact threshold...|$|R
