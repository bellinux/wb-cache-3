25|$|In {{addition}} to cyclin dependent kinases a new <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> {{is thought to}} be prevented through the downregulation of Cdt1. This is achieved via degradation of Cdt1 as well as through the inhibitory actions of a protein known as geminin.

Geminin first appears in S-phase and is degraded at the metaphase-anaphase transition, possibly through ubiquination by anaphase promoting complex (APC).|$|E
25|$|Various {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are present {{throughout}} the course of the cell cycle that determine whether a cell will progress through division entirely.

50|$|Polytene {{chromosomes}} are oversized chromosomes {{which have}} developed from standard chromosomes and are {{commonly found in}} the salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster. Specialized cells undergo repeated <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> DNA <b>replication</b> without cell division (endomitosis), to increase cell volume, forming a giant polytene chromosome.

500|$|The {{bacterial}} cell cycle {{is divided into}} three stages. [...] The B period occurs between the completion of cell division and the beginning of DNA replication. [...] The C period encompasses {{the time it takes to}} replicate the chromosomal DNA. [...] The D period refers to the stage between the conclusion of DNA replication and the end of cell division. [...] The doubling rate of E. coli is higher when more nutrients are available. [...] However, the length of the C and D periods do not change, even when the doubling time becomes less than the sum of the C and D periods. [...] At the fastest growth rates, replication begins before the previous <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> has completed, resulting in multiple replication forks along the DNA and overlapping cell cycles.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that in bacteria, {{the initiation of}} new episodes <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> <b>of</b> DNA, termed <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication,</b> has a regulatory role in DNA synthesis (Maaloe, 1961; Jacob et al., 1963). Recently, Goulian and Kornberg (1967) reported initiation of biologically active DNA synthesis in vitro when circular, single-stranded DNA {{was used as a}} template. One of us has demonstrated a covalent linkage between the origin and terminus of Bacillus subtilis chromosomes at the beginning <b>of</b> new <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> (u 1967). However, in vivo and in vitro, the mechanism and regulation of initiation remain unknown. Certain conditions result in abnormal initiation in bacteria. Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli replicated ichotomously in rich media (Yoshikawa et al., 1964; Oishi et al., 1964; Helmstetter and Cooper, 1968). Premature initiation in thymine-requiring E. coli and B. subtilis mutants resulted after thymine starvation or growth in 5 -bromo-deoxyuridine (5 -BUdR) (Pritchard and Lark, 1964...|$|R

50|$|Originally used by Manfred Eigen {{to model}} the {{evolution}} of the first macromolecules on earth, the quasispecies concept has been applied to populations of a virus within its host. The quasispecies model is deemed to be relevant to RNA viruses because they have high mutation rates in the order of one per <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication,</b> and viral populations, while not infinite, are extremely large. Thus the practical conditions for quasispecies formation are thought to exist.|$|E
50|$|LCR {{can be used}} to {{diagnose}} tuberculosis. The sequence containing protein antigen B is targeted by four oligonucleotide primers—two for the sense strand, and two for the antisense strand. The primers bind adjacent to one another, forming a segment of double stranded DNA that once separated, can serve as a target for future <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication.</b> In this instance, the product can be detected via the microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA).|$|R
40|$|In Escherichia coli BB 26 - 36, the {{inhibition}} of net phospholipid synthesis during glycerol starvation affected cell duplication {{in a manner}} that was similar in some respects to that observed during the {{inhibition of}} protein synthesis.

Unlike the inhibition of protein synthesis, however, the accumulation of initiation potential in dnaA and dnaC mutants at the nonpermissive temperature was not affected by the inhibition of phospholipid synthesis. Furthermore, proteins synthesized during the inhibition of phospholipid synthesis can be utilized later for division. The results are consistent with a dual requirement for protein and phospholipid synthesis for both the inauguration <b>of</b> new <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> chromosome <b>replication</b> and the initiation of septum formation.

All these control the binding of initiator proteins to the origin sequences.|$|R
50|$|Viral {{evolution}} is a subfield of evolutionary biology and virology that is specifically {{concerned with the}} evolution of viruses. Many viruses, in particular RNA viruses, have short generation times and relatively high mutation rates (on the order of one point mutation or more per genome per <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> for RNA viruses).

40|$|The {{development}} of the mitochondrial mass of the previtellogenic oocytes of Xenopus laevis has been analysed by a morphometric method {{and it has been}} correlated with the growth of the oocyte itself. The study which was performed with oocytes from females of very different ages shows that the relative size of the mitochondrial mass in the smallest oocytes decreases gradually with the age of the females. Cytophotometric analysis of the Feulgen-stained mito-chondrial mass enabled the mtDNA content of that structure to be quantified during its development. This development involves about 12 <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> out <b>of</b> the total 16 - 17 <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> during complete differentiation of large oocytes. It is possible to estimate the mean <b>replication</b> rate <b>of</b> the mtDNA {{during the course of the}} previtellogenic period. The calculated rate <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> is very high in the mitochondrial mass of all the growing oocytes of very young females (about 1 - 2 months old), then it decreases rapidly when the oocytes reach 120 fim in diameter. These results suggest that the mitochondrial masses found in small oocytes of old females do not correspond to sites of active mitochondrial biogenesis but rather they represent a physio-logically arrested collection of organelles. Thus the aggregation of mitochondria is the cyto-logical expression of rapid and strictly localized mitochondriogenesis only in very young females...|$|R

Additionally, the initiation <b>of</b> new <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> is inhibited and the cell cycle arrests until nutrient conditions improve. Translational GTPases involved in protein biosynthesis are also affected by ppGpp, with Initiation Factor 2 (IF2) being the main target.|$|R

Telomerase lengthens telomeres in DNA strands, thereby allowing senescent cells that would otherwise become postmitotic and undergo apoptosis to exceed the Hayflick limit and become potentially immortal, {{as is often the case}} with cancerous cells. To be specific, TERT is responsible for catalyzing the addition of nucleotides in a TTAGGG sequence to the ends of a chromosome’s telomeres.

5000|$|DNA {{damage is}} an {{abnormal}} alteration {{in the structure}} of DNA that cannot, itself, be replicated when DNA replicates. In contrast, a mutation is a change in the nucleic acid sequence that can be replicated; hence, a mutation can be inherited {{from one generation to the}} next. Damage can occur from chemical addition (adduct), or structural disruption to a base of DNA (creating an abnormal nucleotide or nucleotide fragment), or a break in one or both DNA strands. When DNA containing damage is replicated, an incorrect base may be inserted in the new complementary strand as it is being synthesized (see [...] ). The incorrect insertion in the new strand will occur opposite the damaged site in the template strand, and this incorrect insertion can become a mutation (i.e. a changed base pair) in the next <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication.</b> Furthermore, double-strand breaks in DNA may be repaired by an inaccurate repair process, non-homologous end joining, which produces mutations. Mutations can ordinarily be avoided if accurate DNA repair systems recognize DNA damage and repair it prior to completion of the next <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication.</b> At least 169 enzymes are either directly employed in DNA repair or influence DNA repair processes. Of these, 83 are directly employed in the 5 types of DNA repair processes indicated in the chart shown in the article DNA repair.|$|E
5000|$|DNA {{crosslinks}} generally cause loss {{of overlapping}} sequence {{information from the}} two strands of DNA. Therefore, accurate repair of the damage depends on retrieving the lost information from an undamaged homologous chromosome in the same cell. Retrieval can occur by pairing with a sister chromosome produced during a preceding <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication.</b> In a diploid cell retrieval may also occur by pairing with a non-sister homologous chromosome, as occurs especially during meiosis. [...] Once pairing has occurred, the crosslink can be removed and correct information introduced into the damaged chromosome {{by the process of}} homologous recombinational repair.|$|E
5000|$|Pulse-chase {{experiments}} {{have been used}} for determining the segregation patterns of chromosomes in addition to studying other time-dependent cellular processes. Briefly, pulse-chase assays allow researchers to track radioactively labelled molecules in the cell.

25|$|The hairpin {{ribozyme}} is an RNA motif that catalyzes RNA processing reactions {{essential for}} <b>replication</b> <b>of</b> the satellite RNA molecules {{in which it}} is embedded. These reactions are self-processing, i.e. a molecule rearranging its own structure. Both cleavage and end joining reactions are mediated by the ribozyme motif, leading to a mixture of interconvertible linear and circular satellite RNA molecules. These reactions are important for processing the large multimeric RNA molecules that are generated by rolling circle replication. At the end <b>of</b> the <b>replication</b> cycle, these large intermediates <b>of</b> satellite RNA <b>replication</b> are processed down to unit length molecules (circular or linear) before they can be packaged by viruses and carried to other cells for further <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} are {{produced}} continuously during normal metabolism and these damage DNA. DNA polymerase IV can catalyze translesion synthesis across {{a variety of}} DNA damages including 8-oxoguanine, a major oxidative damage with high mutagenic potential. [...] Upon chromosome duplication by replicative polymerases, unrepaired 8-oxoguanine tends to mispair with A, so that during the next <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> a G:C to TA transversion mutation is produced (8-oxoG:C → 8-oxoG:A → T:A). However, when DNA polymerase IV intervenes to bypass the damage, it preferentially incorporates the correct nucleotide CTP opposite 8-oxoguanine with high efficiency, thus avoiding potential mutations (8-oxoG:C → 8-oxoG:C → GC).|$|E
50|$|Endoreduplication (or endoreplication) {{occurs when}} {{chromosomes}} duplicate but the cell does not subsequently divide. This results in polyploid cells or, if the chromosomes duplicates repeatedly, polytene chromosomes. Endoreduplication {{is found in}} many species {{and appears to be}} a normal part of development. Endomitosis is a variant of endoreduplication in which cells replicate their chromosomes during S phase and enter, but prematurely terminate, mitosis. Instead of being divided into two new daughter nuclei, the replicated chromosomes are retained within the original nucleus. The cells then re-enter G1 and S phase and replicate their chromosomes again. This may occur multiple times, increasing the chromosome number with each <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> and endomitosis. Platelet-producing megakaryocytes go through endomitosis during cell differentiation.|$|E
5000|$|Entry into S-phase during endoreplication (and mitosis) is {{regulated}} through {{the formation of}} a prereplicative complex (pre-RC) at replication origins, followed by recruitment and activation of the DNA replication machinery. In the context of endoreplication these events are facilitated by an oscillation in cyclin E-Cdk2 activity. Cyclin E-Cdk2 activity drives the recruitment and activation of the replication machinery, but it also inhibits pre-RC formation, presumably to ensure that only one <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>replication</b> occurs per cycle. Failure to maintain control over pre-RC formation at replication origins results in a phenomenon known as “rereplication” which is common in cancer cells.
