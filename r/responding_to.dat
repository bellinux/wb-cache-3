5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> a local sugar gradient is <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} readers’ reception of story fact elements (character, plot, and setting) in Ayat-Ayat Cinta (AAC). The data sources were reception texts uploaded by readers and were downloaded through Google.

The findings show that readers <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the elements in the reception with positive and negative tones. In general, however, they <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the elements positively.

5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its {{denial of the}} right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. <b>Responding</b> <b>to</b> the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. <b>Responding</b> <b>to</b> this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E
