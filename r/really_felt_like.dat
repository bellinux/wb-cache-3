Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction.

500|$|Among {{these was}} Bette Davis, {{one of the}} studio's leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract. In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: [...] "No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. [...] The power. The glory. And he was in {{business}} to make money." [...] Davis revealed that, {{after the birth of}} her child, Warner's attitude toward her became warm and protective. [...] "We became father and child, no question about it." [...] she said. [...] "He told me I didn't have to come back to work until I <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him." [...] Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood, even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time. In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Warner tore up Flynn's contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.|$|E

Furthermore, both Tylo and Bell agreed that Taylor was at a [...] "brick wall", but Bell was [...] "afraid to go beyond that" [...] and have the character go [...] "off the deep end", in fear of destroying her integrity. However, Tylo believed that [...] "in reality that's what she needed – to be more human. But she just got boring instead".

After all those details were thoroughly [...] "over-analyzed", they were excised because they amounted to a [...] "much more complex story than <b>really</b> we <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we could fit in this 90-minute film."

5000|$|Overall, {{the style}} of the album was melancholy, dark and sad. George Michael complemented this {{departure}} making a dramatic change of his clothes, hair style and overall appearance. The long hair, beard and jeans that Michael was known for during the late eighties were replaced with a buzz cut and mostly leather clothes. Michael commented, on the The Oprah Winfrey Show about that new appearance:"The way my image changed in Europe was that I looked very different, I had very short hair—I had really a kind of gay look in a way. I think I was trying to tell people I was okay with it gay, I just really didn't want to share it with journalists. The album I made in the middle nineties called Older was a tribute to Anselmo, really; there was a dedication to him on the album and fairly obvious male references.

50|$|Speaking to Kerrang! in June 2009, Brian Molko remembered: We {{had a real}} swagger and bravado when we {{went into}} the studio for this one.

We were also really heavily medicated and beginning to get quite deep into drugs. That's probably why it took nine months to make an album. The drugs also contributed to a certain amount of arrogance. At least that's what I remember from the time. I think we had a desire to write about the world we saw around us. We thought it was cool that, though other people were a little afraid to get deep down and dirty, we could take it on ourselves to write about those things. I think that album was the start of us trying to mix genres. We had so much hatred for rap-rock bands like Limp Bizkit and all they represented - misogyny, homophobia and commercialism - that we wanted to do our own version of it.|$|R

It's to prove to myself that I can write songs. It's not easy to make a song that the whole world relates to, and to do it over and over again. When I got in the studio I realized this is really, really hard. It's easy to do whatever the hell you want to do but everybody can't connect to that. I was just trying to find a different way that I could do it with Glory. I don't know if it's successful but I did learn a lot about songwriting while I was doing it." [...] She clarified in another interview her desire to try to [...] "make more traditional-sounding records. ... I am a songwriter and I {{wanted to be able to}} try and write songs that were more traditional and structured," [...] as she felt it was challenging for her and harder than just to do whatever she <b>felt</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "I wanted to try and make an EP where I had other people sing hooks, because I can’t sing.
