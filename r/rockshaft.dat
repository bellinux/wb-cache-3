A non-circular {{planetary}} gears train beating-up mechanism was proposed, the ideal kinematic curve of beating-up <b>rockshaft</b> was constructed and the reverse {{model of the}} pitch curve of non-circular gears was established based on the ideal kinematic curve. When the first-level non-circular gears were set as elliptical gears, the maximum swinging angle of the sley {{and the influence of}} the elliptical gears ' eccentricity on the concavo-convex characteristic of the second-level non-circular gears were analyzed. Provided with a set of parameters, the pitch curves and tooth profiles of the second-level non-circular gears were determined by reverse method. The result has shown that non-circular {{planetary gears}} train beating-up mechanism can meet the requirements of beating-up process...|$|E
