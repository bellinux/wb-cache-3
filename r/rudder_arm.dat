Abstract: The {{influences}} of non-mentallic inclusions {{on the quality}} and properties of the steel are depended {{not only on the}} quantity of inclusions, but also on the type,shape,size,deformation behavior and distribution condition. The effects of lanthanide rare earth(RE) on the shape,size and distribution condition of inclusions in large <b>rudder</b> <b>arm</b> steel casting is investigated. It was proved that the shape and distribution of inclusions could be improved in the large <b>rudder</b> <b>arm</b> steel casting, and the plastic and toughness of the steel can be increased obviously by the rare earth modification. By means of ANSYS finite element analysis software, the stress field distribution around matrix was simulated, and the reaction mechanism of inclusions by modification was clarified...|$|E

In this paper, ANSYS fi nite element analysis software is used to simulate the stress fi eld of inclusions appearing in heavy <b>rudder</b> <b>arm</b> steel castings, the effects of inclusion type, shape, distribution, and various loading conditions were studied. The micromechanics of inclusions in such castings were also analyzed. Such research provides further clarifi cation on reaction mechanism of inclusions under complex loading conditions...|$|E

The legs were shrunken, grown together, and flattened into a horizontal <b>rudder.</b> The <b>arms</b> also were diminutive and fin-like, though they still retained the manipulative forefinger and thumb. The head had shrunk {{into the body}} and looked forward {{in the direction of}} swimming. Strong carnivorous teeth, emphatic gregariousness, and a new, almost human, cunning in the chase, combined to make these seal-men lords of the ocean".|$|R
