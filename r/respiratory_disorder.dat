50|$|The {{diagnosis}} for DMSA1 {{is usually}} masked by a diagnosis for a <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder.</b> In infants, DMSAI {{is usually the}} cause of acute respiratory insufficiency in the first 6 months of life. The respiratory distress should be confirmed as diaphragmatic palsy by fluoroscopy or by electromyography. Although the patient may {{have a variety of}} other symptoms the diaphragmatic palsy confirmed by fluoroscopy or other means is the main criteria for diagnosis. This is usually confirmed with genetic testing looking for mutations in the IGHMBP2 gene. The patient can be misdiagnosed if the respiratory distress is mistaken for a severe respiratory infection or DMSA1 can be mistaken for SMA1 because their symptoms are so similar but the genes which are affected are different. This is why genetic testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of DMSA.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} four months of his life, Mostel took on a nutritionally unsound diet (later {{described}} by his friends as a starvation diet) that reduced his weight from 304 to 215 pounds. During rehearsals for Arnold Wesker's new play The Merchant (in which Mostel played a re-imagined version of Shakespeare's Shylock) in Philadelphia, he collapsed in his dressing room and was taken to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. He was diagnosed with a <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder</b> and it was believed he was in no danger and would be released soon. However, on September 8, 1977, Mostel complained of dizziness and lost consciousness. The attending physicians were unable to revive him, and he was pronounced dead that evening. It is believed that he suffered an aortic aneurysm. Wesker wrote a book chronicling the out-of-town tribulations that beset the play and culminated in Zero's death called The Birth of Shylock and the Death of Zero Mostel.|$|E

50|$|In 1781, Fletcher {{returned}} from the Continent {{where he had been}} convalescing from a severe <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder.</b> Upon his return he picked up a correspondence with a woman he had met nearly thirty years previous, Mary Bosanquet, who in the early 1770s had become the first woman preacher authorized by John Wesley to preach. Mr. Fletcher and Miss Bosanquet carried on a correspondence during the summer of 1781, finding they had both at one time considered the other as a suitable spouse. They were married at Batley Church in Yorkshire on 12 November 1781. Fletcher exchanged pulpits with the evangelical vicar of Bradford, John Crosse, in order to settle his wife's affairs in Yorkshire. They returned to Madeley together on 2 January 1782. Their marriage was to be short-lived, for Fletcher died less than four years later, on 14 August 1785. After his death, Mary Fletcher was allowed to continue living in the vicarage by the new vicar, Henry Burton, a pluralist clergyman who was also the incumbent of Atcham parish near Shrewsbury. Though John Wesley attempted to persuade Mrs. Fletcher to leave Madeley for a ministry with the Methodists in London, she refused, believing she was called to carry on her late husband's work in the parish. This she did for the next thirty years. She died in the parish and was buried in the same grave as her husband in December 1815.|$|E

40|$|In {{traditional}} medicine, {{people use}} the association of ginger and honey to treat some <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the effects of the association of ginger and honey on <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder</b> in mice. Here we showed that ginger-honey can exert such functions in vivo, namely in a mouse model of Th 2 -mediated pulmonary inflammation. Intraperitoneal injections of Ginger-Honey aqueous extract (GHae) before airway challenge of ovalbumin (OVA) -sensitized mice resulted in a marked decrease in the recruitment of eosinophils to the lungs as attested by cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. Resolution of airway inflammation induced by GHae was accompanied by a suppression of the Th 2 cell-driven response to allergen in vivo. Thus, IL- 4 and eotaxin levels in the lungs were clearly diminished in ginger-honey-treated mice relative to their controls after allergen sensitization and challenge. Ginger-Honey can suppress Th 2 -mediated immune responses and might thus provide a possible therapeutic application in inflammation...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Respiratory viruses are a {{major cause}} of {{respiratory}} tract infections. The prevalence of a virus-positive respiratory sample and its significance in patients requiring mechanical ventilation remain unknown. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study in all consecutive adults ventilated for more than 48 hours admitted to a 22 -bed medical intensive care unit during a 12 -month period. Respiratory samples at the time of intubation were assessed by culture, by indirect immunofluorescence assay or by molecular methods in systematic tracheobronchial aspirates. Patients with a virus-negative respiratory sample at the time of intubation were considered unexposed and served as the control group. RESULTS: Forty-five viruses were isolated in 41 / 187 (22 %) patients. Rhinovirus was the most commonly isolated virus (42 %), followed by herpes simplex virus type 1 (22 %) and virus influenza A (16 %). In multivariate analysis controlling for the Acute Pathophysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, patients with <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder</b> at admission (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 8 - 5. 1; P = 0. 12), with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma patients (adjusted odds ratio, 3. 0; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 - 6. 7; P = 0. 01) and with admission between 21 November and 21 March (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 - 5. 9; P = 0. 008) were independently associated with a virus-positive sample. Among the 122 patients admitted with <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder,</b> a tracheobronchial aspirate positive for respiratory viruses at the time of intubation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0. 273; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 096 - 0. 777; P < 0. 006) was independently associated with better survival, controlling for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and admission for cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. Among the remaining 65 patients, a virus-positive sample on intubation did not predict survival. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the pathogenic role of respiratory viruses in the intensive care unit, particularly rhinovirus. We suggest, however, that the prognostic value of virus-associated <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder</b> is better than that of other causes of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractObesity {{and asthma}} are common chronic {{diseases}} in the industrialised world. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate a possible relationship between asthma and obesity among persons on sick leave due to <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder.</b> The diagnosis of asthma (n= 237) was made in a three-stage model (questionnaire, telephone interview and clinical examination) in persons on sick leave due to any <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder.</b> Persons on sick leave due to non-specific spinal pain, (n= 1231) and a general population sample (n= 5092) were used as references. Obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m 2) was found in 20. 7 % of the asthmatic patients on sick leave compared with 13. 7 % in the non-specific pain patients on sick leave and in 6. 5 % of the controls (P< 0. 001). It is not clear whether the increased prevalence of obesity among asthmatics reflects a true increase in asthma in obese persons or whether asthma-like symptoms occur because of obesity. Weight reduction schemes and weight maintenance programmes should be important components in treatment and rehabilitation plans for persons with asthma...|$|E

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> among workers in slaughterhouses. MethodsThis study was conducted on 81 workers in slaughterhouses and 81 healthy office workers as a reference group. The American Thoracic Society standard respiratory symptoms questionnaire was used to determine the prevalence of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders.</b> Besides, lung function tests were conducted using a calibrated spirometer at the beginning (preshift) and at the end (postshift) of the 1 st working day. Single-stage Anderson sampler was used to measure the concentration of bioaerosols in different parts of slaughterhouses. ResultsThe prevalence of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders,</b> such as cough, productive cough, breathlessness, phlegm, and wheezing, was 3. 17, 4. 02, 3. 07, 4. 66, and 3. 94 times, respectively, higher among workers in slaughterhouses compared with the reference group. ConclusionThe prevalence of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> was significantly higher among workers in slaughterhouses.
