40|$|The use {{of fossil}} fuels for {{transportation}} purposes has increased significantly over the last 60 years, and the environmental effects of the use {{of fossil fuels}} have become a matter of concern in recent years.

There are a number of views on the advantages and disadvantages of these fuels, such as dispute as to the life-cycle emissions and the impact on performance. It is the aim of this paper to present independent findings into the performance and emissions pros and cons for some alternative fuels, Regular Unleaded (91 octane), Premium Unleaded (95 octane) and Premium Unleaded, Ultimate (98 octane). In a full scale laboratory testing undertaken at Central Queensland University, it is found that Premium Unleaded and the Ultimate offer better power and torque efficiency with a grater [sic] percentage of specific fuel consumption compared to <b>regular</b> unleaded <b>petrol.</b> Moreover, the Ultimate appeared to have less exhaust emissions with lower concentration of all pollutants compared to <b>regular</b> unleaded <b>petrol...</b>|$|R

The nation's abundant oil reserves have enabled the government to keep prices low (Iran is the second-largest exporter in OPEC). However, low prices have encouraged wasteful consumption and the smuggling of petrol into neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The REV Project of the University of Western Australia has converted three <b>regular</b> <b>petrol</b> driven cars to electric vehicles. This thesis focusses on the user interface for one of those vehicles, taking into account the special requirements of electric cars. The thesis begins by analysing existing solutions and evaluating the important features of those systems (Chapters 2 and 3). In addition, special requirements for test driving a prototype car are defined. These features are essential for the REV Project to evaluate the performance of the cars. It then describes the general ideas behind the development of the program and details their implementation (Chapters 4 and 5). This includes communication with the battery management system, processing of GPS data, calculation of statistics, generation of a map and control of the multimedia functionality. Lastly, the thesis explains the resulting program (Chapter 6), discusses experiences in using it and presents data collected during test drives (Chapter 7). ...|$|E
40|$|Globally, our road {{transport}} sector is powered almost exclusively by internal combustion engines (ICE) {{and more than}} 90 % of these engines are powered by fuels derived from crude oil. Both the current cost and projected future costs of crude oil have risen sharply in the last years. Doubts about of security of imported crude oil supplies remain, and prices are expected to remain volatile but {{higher than in the}} past. Road transport is also a major source of greenhouse gases (GHG) and air pollutants such as NOx, PM 10 and volatile organic compounds. In the European Union (EU), it is responsible for 18 % of GHG emissions. Changing the cars, fuels and related infrastructure we use today is a complicated and expensive transition. To reduce dependence on crude oil in transport, the use of electricity and hydrogen in cars has been advocated. However, hydrogen and battery powered cars were found to be uncompetitive by a large margin: even if the cost of fuel cells would come down to 120 €/kW or the cost of batteries to € 150 /kWh, advanced hybrid cars are found to have a lower cost of driving. Due to increased efficiency, series hybrid cars can reduce emissions of CO 2 by 34 %- 47 % compared to <b>regular</b> diesel and <b>petrol</b> cars. Plug-in hybrid cars and fully battery powered cars can further reduce GHG emissions, depending on the source of electricity used. Based on the generation capacity projected for the Netherlands in 2015, electricity for electric vehicle (EV) charging would be generated using natural gas, and this would mean a reduction of GHG emissions of 51 %- 78 % compared to current cars and fuels. If off-peak charging is successfully introduced, electric driving need not strain infrastructure even in case of a 100 % switch to electric vehicles. Reduction of oil dependence and, possibly, GHG emissions can also be achieved by using alternative fuels. Synthetic fuel may be competitive with oil-based diesel, and for gas-to-liquids (GTL), coal-to-liquids (CTL) and biomass-to-liquids (BTL) oil price should be above 33, 60 and 75 $/bbl, respectively. However, CTL is found to increase our transport-related GHG emissions per km driven by 25 %- 110 %. Diesel from synthetic crude oil (SCO) increases GHG emissions by 13 %- 60 % and GTL chains without CCS by 10 %. GTL with CCS is found to reduce GHG emissions by around 5 % compared to fossil diesel. The net emissions from BTL can be an order of magnitude smaller and can even be made negative by application of CCS. When necessary GHG reductions in {{road transport}}ation and electricity generation are considered together, lowest overall costs are achieved by using hybrid cars and both biomass and CCS to maximum potential, and by using the least-cost CO 2 emissions reduction options in road transportation, even if that reduces biomass and CO 2 storage capacity available for electricity generation. However, significant uncertainties remain in the cost of alternative fuels, as well as fuel cells and batteries. EU regulation on car emissions will presumably force a shift to hybrid vehicles by 2020 unless fuel cells or batteries become very cheap very soon, with additional GHG emissions reductions achieved through use of biofuels if sufficient supply of sustainable biomass feedstock can be secured. However, non-cost barriers, such as lack of familiarity and impact on car performance, to public adoption of alternative fuels remain. Simulations of the co-evolution of motorist demand and production capacity indicate that multiple barriers to adoption of alternative fuels reinforce each other. All else being equal, sustainable biofuels and hybrid cars may be adopted by motorists on grounds of GHG emissions reductions and economic arguments. Furthermore, these alternatives can also be implemented without dramatic changes in vehicle fleets and energy infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet’s management of initiatives to supply low aromatic fuel to Indigenous communities. Overall conclusion Through the Petrol Sniffing Strategy (PSS), the Australian Government has supported initiatives to reduce the incidence and impact of petrol sniffing in remote Indigenous communities since 2005. The key element of the PSS is to subsidise the production of low aromatic fuel (LAF) so that it replaces <b>regular</b> unleaded <b>petrol</b> (RULP) in areas at risk of petrol sniffing outbreaks, without the higher production costs acting as a barrier to its uptake. While there are many underlying causes of petrol sniffing, generally associated with young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and marginalised groups, research results have indicated that the introduction of LAF has been successful in contributing to reductions in the incidence of petrol sniffing. For this reason, additional funding has been made available by the Australian Government to expand the supply and distribution of LAF. From an initial 41 sites in June 2005, the PSS expanded and, as at January 2015, LAF was available in 138 sites associated with 78 Indigenous communities in Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory. Consistent with the policy objective of the PSS, these sites are located in regional and remote areas of Australia. While the number of sites has increased, the overall annual volume of LAF produced has largely remained stable since 2007 – 08 with approximately 21 megalitres being produced on average each year. No performance targets have been set in relation to the volume of LAF produced and distributed, although contracts with LAF producers allow for an annual production of up to 53 megalitres. In the most recent expansion of the PSS in 2010 – 11, the Australian Government provided additional funding to include 39 sites covering 11 communities in Northern Australia, with an associated increase in annual volume of production of LAF. As well as supporting extra production capacity, a significant element of the increased funding was to provide for additional storage facilities as the lack of bulk storage had been identified as the key barrier to expanding the PSS in northern Australia. Following a select tender, the department responsible for providing LAF, the then Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA), entered into contracts with two major fuel producers to supply LAF to different regions of Australia. The development of additional storage infrastructure was initially included by DoHA in the tender for fuel production, however, the department subsequently chose to enter into direct negotiations with the operators of terminal facilities in Darwin. These negotiations were anticipated to have been completed in time to allow for facilities to be operational by 1 July 2012 which, in turn, would enable the contracts for increased production to commence. Negotiations were lengthy and remained ongoing at the time the responsibility for petrol sniffing initiatives was transferred to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) in September 2013. An agreement for capital works was subsequently executed in December 2013, which enabled work to commence on developing the required storage infrastructure. The storage facility became operational in November 2014, more than two years later than expected. As a result of the delay, implementation of the expansion fell short of the Government’s initial expectations. The facility was also more expensive than first anticipated, with the contracted cost of establishing the bulk storage facility being up to $ 19. 2  million (including GST) —exceeding significantly the initial estimates of up to $ 12. 9  million. Following the establishment of storage facilities, additional production of LAF commenced in late November 2014 and PM&C anticipates that the annual volume of LAF produced in 2015 – 16 will double. The department’s processes for managing existing contractual arrangements and for monitoring the delivery of LAF are largely sound. Information collected under the production and distribution agreements enables PM&C to maintain appropriate visibility over the volume of LAF supplied and the locations of sites to which it is supplied. The main approach of the PSS is to reduce the availability of RULP in high risk communities by encouraging fuel outlets serving those communities and outlets in surrounding areas to only stock LAF and create a distance buffer zone around vulnerable communities. Accordingly, PM&C monitors supply information so that sites ceasing to supply LAF can be contacted and encouraged to continue to participate in the PSS. In addition, since 2005, a contracted research provider has assessed a sample of communities periodically for incidences of petrol sniffing and the role of LAF in reducing outbreaks. As a result of these data collection arrangements, PM&C has a reasonable evidence base to support the assessment of LAF in reducing the incidence of petrol sniffing. Between 2005 and 2009, the supply of LAF was identified as a program in the Health and Ageing Portfolio Budget Statements, and DoHA reported against the number of sites providing LAF as an indicator of performance for the PSS. Between 2009 and 2014 there was no formal reporting on the progress of the strategy. While the PSS has expanded, albeit more slowly than anticipated, there has been little information publicly reported on the effect that the supply of LAF has had on reducing the incidence of petrol sniffing in Indigenous communities. Research indicates that the supply of LAF is making a positive contribution to reducing petrol sniffing. The design of the PSS, however, also acknowledges that there are limitations to taking a single approach and that other actions need to be undertaken in conjunction with the supply of LAF to successfully address the issue of petrol sniffing. In 2014, the PSS was identified in the Prime Minister and Cabinet Portfolio Budget Statements as a specific initiative to be delivered under the Safety and Wellbeing Programme, with the key performance indicator being the number of sites providing LAF. Using this narrowly-focussed indicator alone, however, will provide for only a limited assessment of performance. In view of the PSS’s maturity, it is timely for PM&C to strengthen its PSS-related performance reporting by including a greater focus on assessing the impact of the PSS. The ANAO has made one recommendation to improve PM&C’s accountability and reporting for the PSS...|$|R
