25|$|The {{molecular}} {{geometry of}} both rotamers {{can be obtained}} experimentally by high resolution infrared spectroscopy augmented with in silico work. In accordance with the model described above, the carbon–carbon bond length is higher for the anti-rotamer (151.4 pm vs. 150). The steric repulsion between the fluorine atoms in the gauche <b>rotamer</b> causes increased CCF bond angles (by 3.2°) and increased FCCF dihedral angles (from the default 60° to 71°).|$|E
25|$|Fragments {{are short}} {{segments}} of the peptide backbone, typically from 5 to 15 residues long, and {{do not include the}} side chains. They may specify the location of just the C-alpha atoms if it is a reduced atom representation, or all the backbone heavy atoms (N, C-alpha, C carbonyl, O). Note that side chains are typically not modeled using the fragment library approach. To model discrete states of a side chain, one could use a <b>rotamer</b> library approach.|$|E
25|$|In stereochemistry, gauche {{interactions}} hinder bond rotation. For example, sighting {{along the}} C2–C3 bond in staggered butane, {{there are two}} possible relative potential energies. The two methyl groups can be in an anti-bonding relationship, or offset at sixty degree dihedral angles. In the latter configuration, the two methyls {{are said to be}} in a gauche relationship, and the relative potential energy of each methyl-methyl gauche interaction is 0.9 kilocalories per mole (4 kJ/mol). In general a gauche <b>rotamer</b> is less stable than an anti-rotamer.|$|E
500|$|With Jay Ponder in 1987, {{as part of}} an {{exploration}} of using internal packing of sidechains to enumerate the possible sequences compatible with a given protein backbone structure (a foreshadowing of protein engineering and design), Richards developed the first side-chain <b>rotamer</b> library.

Increasingly detailed <b>rotamer</b> libraries have been made since then by other research groups, with some used primarily for structure validation and others for homology modeling or protein design.|$|E
500|$|Frederic Middlebrook Richards (August 19, 1925 – January 11, 2009), {{commonly}} referred to as Fred Richards, was an American biochemist and biophysicist known for solving the pioneering crystal structure of the ribonuclease S enzyme in 1967 and for defining the concept of solvent-accessible surface. He contributed many key experimental and theoretical results and developed new methods, garnering over 20,000 journal citations in several quite distinct research areas. [...] In addition to the protein crystallography and biochemistry of ribonuclease S, these included solvent accessibility and internal packing of proteins, the first side-chain <b>rotamer</b> library, high-pressure crystallography, new types of chemical tags such as biotin/avidin, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift index, and structural and biophysical characterization of the effects of mutations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rotamer</b> {{libraries}} describe rotamers {{based on}} an analysis of many protein structures. Backbone-independent <b>rotamer</b> libraries describe all rotamers. Backbone-dependent <b>rotamer</b> libraries, in contrast, describe the rotamers as how {{likely they are to}} appear depending on the protein backbone arrangement around the side chain. The rotamers described by <b>rotamer</b> libraries are usually regions in space. Most protein design programs use one conformation (e.g., the modal value for <b>rotamer</b> dihedrals in space) or several points in the region described by the rotamer; the OSPREY protein design program, in contrast, models the entire continuous region.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rotamer</b> {{libraries}} can be backbone-independent, secondary-structure-dependent, or backbone-dependent. Backbone-independent <b>rotamer</b> libraries make {{no reference}} to backbone conformation, and are calculated from all available side chains of a certain type (for instance, the first example of a <b>rotamer</b> library, done by Ponder and Richards at Yale in 1987). Secondary-structure-dependent libraries present different dihedral angles and/or <b>rotamer</b> frequencies for -helix, -sheet, or coil secondary structures.
