The details of consumer protection would, of course, lie in the subordinated legislation that financial regulators would draft. As an example, whether or not loads and other conflicted <b>remuneration</b> <b>structures</b> should be banned {{is a question that}} would be addressed by the regulator. The proposed law will clearly pose this question to the regulator. The regulators would then utilise the powers provided to pursue the goals specified in the law, through subordinated legislation which would evolve over the years reflecting financial innovation, technological change, and the changing nature of the Indian economy. Alongside this rule-making mandate, there would be a supervisory function to ensure compliance with these rules.|$|E
40|$|The sharp {{deterioration}} in the subprime mortgage market in the United States in 2007 triggered a decline in confidence in global financial markets of unprecedented scale. The sizable losses that resulted in many financial institutions revealed significant weaknesses in basic market practices and principles-notably deteriorating lending and underwriting standards; excessive (undercapitalized) risk-taking; inadequate risk management processes; undue reliance on ratings of structured products; and an almost obsessive focus on actions driving short-term results with little consideration of long-term implications. In the aftermath, the attention of regulators has turned {{to the structure of}} remuneration in financial institutions, and in particular, the failure of these structures to adequately capture and adjust for the risk taken in order to earn returns. This chapter asserts that the efficacy of risk-adjusted <b>remuneration</b> <b>structures</b> relies on the resolution of three main factors: (1) risk appetite can be defined and translated into ex-ante risk measures; (2) agency problems that arise with the use of risk-adjusted performance measures can be resolved; and (3) managerial overconfidence in assessing risk can be taken into consideration in the design of <b>remuneration</b> <b>structures.</b> 18 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{teachers}} being hired but not teaching because of government action or inaction {{is a serious}} one in South Africa. This paper describes the problem and explores two aspects of it: non-enforcement of employment contracts with teachers and shortages of certain subject teachers caused by inflexibility in the <b>remuneration</b> <b>structure</b> of teachers. Non-enforcement has become a severe problem because a situation has developed in many schools, mainly black ones, where teachers {{are able to get}} away with doing very little work (shirking). The current <b>remuneration</b> <b>structure</b> has become a problem in that it has given rise to a situation where the only way to plug certain teaching gaps is by placing some teachers in positions for which they have insufficient training (inferior substitution). It is concluded that it is desirable that the government properly enforce its teacher contracts and that more flexibility should be introduced into the salary structure with respect to specific staffing scarcities. ...|$|R

40|$|Excessive {{risk-taking}} in {{the banking}} industry {{has led to the}} default of firms and to increased systemic risks as demonstrated during the previous financial cri-sis. The causes of this excessive risk taking are numerous and complex. However, it is now consensus that inappropriate <b>remuneration</b> <b>structures</b> can contribute to excessive risk taking. Substantial parts of the financial sector CEOs ’ variable compensations has a short-term focus and are not risk adjusted as empirical sur-veys have shown. Such <b>remuneration</b> <b>structures</b> persist {{in the aftermath of the}} crisis as part of the finance industry’s remuneration culture. This, however, is inef-ficient from a risk perspective and thus triggers the need for a remuneration regu-lation. With the entrenchment of the Directives for the European Union in De-cember 2010 and the implementation into national laws, e. g. Germany, UK and France, the remuneration focus substantially shifted to a more long-term perspec-tive. Our analysis shows the reform efforts to aim in the right direction. However, the methodology for and the measurement of “success ” should be revised. Due to different regulations in different European countries there is danger of regulatory arbitrage. Additionally, the new remuneration laws are given in the form of gen-eral principles leaving room for interpretation. Efficient regulation should ensure remuneration policies and structures to be aligned with an effective risk manage-ment. The financial authorities should therefore closely observe the market devel-opment in this perspective and take countermeasures if necessary. Furthermore, an elimination of existing regulatory flaws in national laws is needed. (K 33, G 30...|$|E

However, the strategic options adopted by the banks to get a competitive advantage over their competitors in agency banking segment and their real effects on performance still remain unclear. Thus, investigates the strategic options adopted by commercial banks in agency banking and their influence on performance among commercial banks in Mombasa County, Kenya.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the financial elements of remuneration and its motivational features; to describe specific delimitations for the remuneration system in the public sector, and, on the basis of this information, to create a model for a possible <b>remuneration</b> package <b>structure</b> and to predict its future effect on the motivational level of public sector employees. This study provides an analysis of the existing <b>remuneration</b> package <b>structure</b> for public servants in Latvia and, based on a theoretical background, it offers proposals for the improvement of a <b>remuneration</b> package <b>structure</b> that aims to ensure its functionality and to provide possibilities to motivate employees. As a result of this analysis, the general and motivating parts of a remuneration package were defined, the last being divided into fixed and variable parts. An examination of the appropriate legislation has lead to the conclusion that the present combination of financial elements of remuneration has neither a clearly fixed, nor a clearly variable nature. Two alternative <b>structures</b> for a <b>remuneration</b> package have been proposed, namely, a fixed <b>remuneration</b> package <b>structure</b> and a <b>remuneration</b> package with a significant proportion of variable part. In the case of implementation of a fixed <b>remuneration</b> package <b>structure</b> it is forecast that all transparency and fairness (equality) principles will be met, stability of the remuneration system will be ensured, and, as well, a positive image of the public sector within the labour market will be sustained. The implementation of a remuneration package with significant variable part should ensure a stronger link between the level of remuneration and job output of employee, as well as to provide more flexible possibilities to stimulate employees for immediate actions. For the practical implementation of both proposed alternatives and for a revision of current remuneration levels in nominal terms, the authors propose the utilisation of an employee job output and remuneration level correlation matrix, thus ensuring an optimal equilibrium of output and remuneration and a targeted usage of remuneration funds...|$|R

The weaknesses in the efficient market hypothesis, which underlie the MCC and are summarized in Part III, appear not to have undermined the theory’s credibility in the minds of public policy makers in Europe. Part IV explains the background of the financial crisis in Ireland, and Part V considers the effect of the MCC on management of Irish credit institutions in the runup to this crisis.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. Job Evaluation is {{the process}} of determining, as {{systematically}} and objectively as possible, the worth of one job relative to another without regard for personalities or existing structures. (Paterson, 1975) The purpose is to achieve and maintain an equitable distribution of basic wages and/or salaries according to level of position. The establishment of internal equity with a graded hierarchy of jobs within the organisation and of external equity with the external market rate for equivalent jobs (Paterson, 1975) is important and has lead to the overall analysis of the following problem statement: An Analysis of the Grading and <b>Remuneration</b> <b>Structures</b> of Architectural Practices in the Western Cape, Cape Town Metropole with specific reference to establishing what methods are used in arriving at cost to company packages. The nature of the architectural profession is unfortunately governed by economic "boom and bust" cycles and therefore workload fluctuates with the economy. Given this and that the architectural profession in Cape Town currently has no formal grading and <b>remuneration</b> <b>structures,</b> the research hopes to answer if {{there is a need to}} formulate a grading system. Understanding how and why the nature of the profession is changing, if the way a practice is organized / graded enhances or undermines its decision-making ability and if the informality of the grading and <b>remuneration</b> <b>structures</b> currently in practice are adequate, is studied. This research investigates how architectural practices in Cape Town establish their salary structures, which include benefits and incentives, thereby arriving at a total cost to company package. Specifically, the study will examine whether there is a direct relationship between those practices that have adopted a modern, scientific job grading system, i. e. Paterson, Peromnes or Task and accordingly pay market-related salaries and cost to company packages based on salary survey data or some other scientific calculation, as opposed to those practices which adopt an ad hoc approach. Many individuals choose architecture over other professions as they believe it can provide a work and family balance. The Royal Institute of Architects (RIBA) found that women's career paths generally slow after childbirth and with inflexible working arrangements, including long hours and a lack of transparency in relation to pay and promotion, are the main reasons why both women and men, generally with dependants are leaving the profession, (www. riba. org) A need to balance the personal and professional demands placed on architects has long been recognized by the majority of literature. The study evaluates whether firms are addressing these issues or if there is a need to implement changes to accommodate a better work / life balance and grading / remuneration imbalances. The survey found that there were discrepancies in the grading and remuneration packages offered between various firms; however not to the extent that RIBA had warned was occuring internationally. There are more noticeable differences in job grades and remuneration in the higher grades, but there were also signs of disparity in the architects 1 - 5 years of experience in terms of gender towards pay within similar job descriptions. When pay was directly compared to years of experience, members received similar pay, however when compared to levels of responsibility and pay, there were major differences. The current informal systems are not reflective or accurate in guiding employers on the correct levels of compensation for a particular level of responsibility and those architects practicing in the higher grades certainly need to evaluate their current levels of responsibility to their pay level and hours worked. The key question was, can architects- be they male or female - balance a working career with family responsibility. The days of a part-time architect have vanished, and those that do work part time are confined to helping on other member's schemes with less responsibility. The 'all-nighter' syndrome of the academic design studio is evident in some of the overtime hours recorded, but these marathon hours are few and far between and does not infringe on a regular home life for employees in the lower grades as the hours worked are in line with the normal 45 hour week. What is a concern is that in the upper grades, especially in senior member and owners, reported excessively long hours which are not condusive to normal work-family interaction. Other than some of the contraventions to the basic conditions of employment act, most firms are trying to address options for a balanced work / life relationship Salaries in particular are extremely low in relation to length of training when compared to similar professions. The research found that poor advancement prospects were a significant factor in members choosing to leave the profession. With lack of training opportunities leading to a lack of experience, lower levels of responsibility and poor career progression paths, combined with limited opportunities for creativity, were the main factors leading to architects expressing their dissatisfaction in the industry. From the salient points made in the study, a list of recommendations are outlined for consideration. These included developing more expertise in business management, addressing the image of the profession, training needs, salaries and working hours Architectural firms are seeing the demise of the old arena, dominated by tiered hierarchies, vertical career ladders, practices and processes that are confrontational and authoritarian. Workplaces are becoming more suited to negotiation, to collaborative management systems, horizontal career paths and a more democratic view of how individuals can develop within the company structure.

Secondly, the need to investigate on the human resource management issues leading to high attrition rate in the health sector. It was realized that there is lack of understanding and recognition that organization staff is the most treasured resource and significant asset in the health sector. This was seen to be significant in most mission hospitals in Zimbabwe, because a qualified and motivated employee create and deliver value out of the organization recourses hence this tend to benefit both the organization and the patients. In this dynamic and (VUCA) world, a-world characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, health sector organizations endeavour to attract and create right health workforce for the right jobs through constant upgrading of their knowledge and sustaining their motivation in the changing circumstance in Zimbabwe. All health workers value working conditions as indispensable requirements to their job satisfaction. Hence they need systematic investigations to regulate and increase on variables that are significant to improve employee job satisfaction. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the relationship between working conditions and job satisfaction in Zimbabwean mission hospitals. The study design, covering the purposive sampling of 63 was drawn from 210 employees in mission hospitals in Matabeleland provinces in Zimbabwe. A total of 63 questionnaires were distributed, out of which 46 were returned back after filling. The sampling method selected in this study was purposive sampling where medical doctors, administrators, managers, matrons, sisters in charge and heads of departments were picked on the bases that they were informative and also they possessed the required characteristics for the study. Data was collected using both primary and secondary sources. In this case primary data was collected through the use of questionnaires distributed to all respondents in form of hard copies. Data was analysed using Stata 11, the test applied was the regression correlation of the independent variables of working condition to the dependent variable of job satisfaction. The findings of the study indicates that there is a positive correlation between working conditions and job satisfaction in mission hospitals in Zimbabwe. The research can be beneficial to Zimbabwe Church related hospitals so that they can lobby for the improvement of benefits programs, polices, and <b>remuneration</b> <b>structures</b> to attract, recruit and retain more capable health professional employees for the good of the people of Zimbabwe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economic}} fundamentals for regulation {{in the oil}} industry, {{with a focus on}} the current regulatory proposal for the Brazilian oil industry. The observed exploration and production (E&P) contracts foresee much of the characteristics of the optimal contract, with a <b>remuneration</b> <b>structure</b> that combines upfront with future payments to mitigate uncertainty and incentivize exploratory efforts. In Brazil, despite slow market deconcentration since 1997 's liberalization, the current oil regulation is in general consistent with an optimal regulatory response. From an economic standpoint, the 2009 's new regulatory proposal prompted by the major oil discoveries offshore in Brazil reduces the power of incentive schemes with respect to exploratory and cost-reducing efforts while the changes in the net risk of the E&P offshore activities are not so clear.

It {{is the natural}} and positive outcome of unleashing market forces and allowing individual returns to reflect individual effort. However, the polarization of incomes, severe {{in parts of the}} region, is not easily explained by productivity differentials or individual characteristics. In other countries of the world high inequality has impeded growth, undermined poverty alleviation, and fueled social tensions. Should policymakers in ECA then be concerned about the observed rise in inequality? Should ECA Policymakers Worry about Inequality? There is mounting evidence that high inequality is bad for growth (Benabou 1997; Aghion, Caroli, and Garcia-Penalosa 1999). Recent empirical studies have documented an unambiguous negative correlation between the average rate of growth and measures of inequality across countries and periods. And recent theoretical work has shown that these empirical finding...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{distributed}} generation and demand-response (DR) programs {{is needed for}} improving business models, namely concerning the remuneration of these resources {{in the context of}} smart grids. In this paper, a methodology is proposed in which a virtual power player aggregates several small-sized resources, including consumers participating in DR programs. The global operation costs resulting from the resource scheduling are minimized. After scheduling the resources in several operation scenarios, clustering tools are applied in order to obtain distinct resources’ groups. The <b>remuneration</b> <b>structure</b> that better fits the aggregator goals is then determined. Two clustering algorithms are compared: 1) hierarchical; and 2) fuzzy c-means clustering. The remuneration of small resources and consumers that are aggregated is made considering the maximum tariff in each group. The implemented case study considers 2592 operation scenarios based on a real Portuguese distribution network with 548 distributed generators and 20 310 consumers...|$|R
