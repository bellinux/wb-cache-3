40|$|Increasingly, in <b>regional</b> <b>agreements,</b> large economies offer lower trade {{barriers}} {{in exchange for}} cooperation in environmental, intellectual property and other issues by small economies. What {{is the effect of}} such agreements on multilateral trade liberalization? We show that, {{even in the absence of}} trade creation or diversion, <b>regional</b> <b>agreements</b> increase the cost of multilateral tariff reductions. Such reductions decrease the threat large countries can use in <b>regional</b> <b>agreements</b> causing a loss in regional bargaining power. By explicitly modeling the interaction between regional and multilateral negotiations we show that this result is due to the WTO's most-favorite nation rules and analyze the welfare effects of strengthening and weakening them. Moreover, we show that "deepening" duty-free <b>regional</b> <b>agreements</b> requires increases in multilateral tariffs. ...|$|R

The evolution of six <b>regional</b> trade <b>agreements</b> in Latin America are analyzed in detail: LAIA, Mercosur, NAFTA, Andean Community, Caricom, and CACM.

With distance between countries, and through strategic interaction in tariff setting, <b>regional</b> trade <b>agreements</b> generate larger rent-shifting effects than non-regional agreements, which countries use to coordinate on a unique equilibrium.
