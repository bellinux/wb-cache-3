40|$|Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces sequence-specific posttranscriptional gene {{silencing}} in many organisms {{by a process}} known as RNA interference (RNAi). Using a Drosophila in vitro system, we demonstrate that 21 - and 22 -nt RNA fragments are the sequence-specific mediators of RNAi. The short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are generated by an RNase III–like processing reaction from long dsRNA. Chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes with overhanging 3 � ends mediate efficient target RNA cleavage in the lysate, and the cleavage site is located {{near the center of the}} region spanned by the guiding siRNA. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the direction of dsRNA processing determines whether sense or antisense target <b>RNA</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaved</b> by the siRNA–protein complex.

40|$|Cordycepin is an {{analogue}} of adenosine {{lacking the}} 3 '-OH. When {{incorporated into a}} growing RNA molecule, cordycepin prevents further elongation, thus producing a prematurely terminated RNA molecule. When HeLa cells are exposed to low concentrations of cordycepin, DNA and protein synthesis are unaffected during short exposure periods. The synthesis of completed ribosomal and ribosomal-precursor (45 S) RNA is significantly depressed. Partially completed 45 S ribosomal precursor molecules accumulate in the nucleolus. 18 S ribosomal <b>RNA</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaved</b> from these incomplete precursors, while 32 S ribosomal precursor cannot be produced from partially snythesized 45 S molecules.

40|$|The enzyme {{ribonuclease}} A catalyzes the cleavage of RNA, {{using the}} imidazole groups of histidine- 12 and histidine- 119 as its principal catalytic groups. Model {{studies show that}} <b>RNA</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaved</b> by imidazole buffer itself and that, as in the enzyme, a bell-shaped pH vs. rate profile is seen. This indicates that one imidazole functions as a base, while the other, as the imidazolium ion, functions as an acid. However, {{in contrast to the}} enzymatic case, the simple model uses the imidazoles in sequential, rather than simultaneous, bifunctional catalysis. Mechanistic studies on this reaction and on the reactions of simple dinucleotides catalyzed by imidazole and other buffers establish the details of the process. The results let us propose a mechanism for the enzymatic process different from the standard one; they also stimulated us to design an improved mimic of the enzyme that uses a mechanism like that proposed for the enzyme. Critical to the mechanistic studies is observation of the rearrangement of normal 3 ', 5 '' RNA nucleotides to the 2 ', 5 '' isomers. This led us to investigate the properties of DNA isomers in which a 2 ', 5 '' link also replaces the normal 3 ', 5 '' one. The results indicate that poor base stacking in a double helix with such links makes them less suitable as genetic units...|$|E
40|$|Using the {{endogenous}} histone H 4 mRNA of Xenopus oocytes as a target, we {{have previously}} shown that 20 mer oligos complementary to {{different parts of}} this sequence vary in their effectiveness at causing mRNA cleavage in vivo, {{and that some of}} the <b>RNA</b> <b>can</b> never <b>be</b> <b>cleaved.</b> In this paper we show that the resistant RNA is not localised within one part of the oocyte, and that the relative resistance in vivo of endogenous or synthetic H 4 mRNA to the different oligos is preserved in an in vitro assay system using deproteinised RNA. If an prior annealing step is included in vitro, all resistance is abolished. Chemical modification of one oligo by end substitution with methylphosphonate or phosphorothioate residues did not improve cleavage efficiency. Oligos with complete phosphorothioate substitution cause slower cleavage in vivo but persist for longer. Consequently phosphorothioate oligos are effective at lower doses than phosphodiester ones, provided that the incubation time is long enough (24 hours). Increasing oligo length from 20 nt to 30 nt increases phosphorothioate oligo efficiency over long reaction times in vivo, but decreases efficiency during short in vitro assays. Similar increases in length did not affect phosphodiester oligo performance in vivo, but caused a decrease in efficiency in vitro which was overcome by an annealing step...|$|R

The satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus (sTRSV) has been shown by others to have autocatalytic properties.

In this thesis, the catalytic core of the negative strand was characterized and the kinetic parameters were determined.

To access the final edited and published work see [URL] 10. 1021 /acs. analchem. 5 b 01362 Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal, and detection of Hg 2 + by biosensors has attracted extensive research interest in the past decade. In particular, a number of DNA-based sensing strategies have been developed. Well-known examples include thymine-Hg 2 + interactions and Hg 2 +-activated DNAzymes. However, these mechanisms are highly dependent on buffer conditions or require hybridization with another DNA strand. Herein, we report a new mechanism based on Hg 2 +-induced cleavage of phosphorothioate (PS) modified RNA. Among the various metal ions tested, Hg 2 + induced the most significant cleavage (∼ 16 %), while other metals cleaved less than 2 % of the same substrate. The uncleaved substrate undergoes desulfurization {{in the presence of}} Hg 2 +. This cleavage reaction yields a similar amount of product from pH 3. 5 to 7 and in the temperature range between 20 and 90 °C. Various PS <b>RNA</b> junctions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaved</b> with a similar efficiency, but PS DNA junctions cannot <b>be</b> <b>cleaved.</b> A molecular beacon containing three PS RNA modifications is designed, detecting Hg 2 + down to 1. 7 nM with excellent selectivity.

40|$|Okazaki {{fragments}} {{contain an}} initiator RNA/DNA primer {{that must be}} removed before the fragments are joined. In eukaryotes, the primer region is raised into a flap by the strand displacement activity of DNA polymerase {delta}. The Dna 2 helicase/nuclease and then flap endonuclease 1 (FEN 1) are proposed to act sequentially in flap removal. Dna 2 and FEN 1 both employ a tracking mechanism to enter the flap 5 ' end and move toward the base for cleavage. In the current model, Dna 2 must enter first, but FEN 1 makes the final cut at the flap base, raising {{the issue of how}} FEN 1 passes the Dna 2. To address this, nuclease-inactive Dna 2 was incubated with a DNA flap substrate and found to bind with high affinity. FEN 1 was then added, and surprisingly, there was little inhibition of FEN 1 cleavage activity. FEN 1 was later shown, by gel shift analysis, to remove the wild type Dna 2 from the flap. <b>RNA</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaved</b> by FEN 1 but not by Dna 2. Pre-bound wild type Dna 2 was shown to bind an RNA flap but not inhibit subsequent FEN 1 cleavage. These results indicate that there is a novel interaction between the two proteins in which FEN 1 disengages the Dna 2 tracking mechanism. This interaction is consistent with the idea that the two proteins have evolved a special ability to cooperate in Okazaki fragment processing...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian tRNA 3 ' {{processing}} endoribonuclease (3 ' tRNase) can {{be converted}} to an RNA cutter that recognizes four bases, with about a 65 -nt 3 '-truncated tRNA(Arg) or tRNA(Ala). The 3 '-truncated tRNA recognizes the target RNA via four base pairings between the 5 'terminal sequence and a sequence 1 -nt upstream of the cleavage site, resulting in a pre-tRNA-like complex (Nashimoto M, 1995, Nucleic Acids Res 23 : 3642 - 3647). Here I developed a general method for more specific RNA cleavage using 3 ' tRNase. In the presence of a 36 -nt 5 ' half tRNA(Arg) truncated after the anticodon, 3 ' tRNase cleaved the remaining 56 -nt 3 ' half tRNA(Arg) with a 19 -nt 3 ' trailer after the discriminator. This enzyme also cleaved its derivatives with a 5 ' extra sequence or nucleotide changes or deletions in the T stem-loop and extra loop regions, although the cleavage efficiency decreases as the degree of structural change increases. This suggests that any target <b>RNA</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaved</b> site-specifically by 3 'tRNase {{in the presence of a}} 5 ' half tRNA modified to form a pre-tRNA-like complex with the target. Using this method, two partial HIV- 1 RNA targets were cleaved site-specifically in vitro. These results also indicate that the sequence and structure of the T stem-loop domain are important, but not essential, for the recognition of pre-tRNAs by 3 ' tRNase...|$|E
40|$|HDV antigenomic RNA is {{processed}} in two distinct pathways; {{it can be}} cleaved at the polyA site and polyadenylated to become mRNA for the delta antigens, or the <b>RNA</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaved</b> by the antigenomic ribozyme to become full-length antigenomic RNA that is used for synthesis of genomic HDV RNA. The polyA site is located just 33 nucleotides upstream of the ribozyme cleavage site. If processing occurs primarily at the upstream polyA site, {{there may not be}} enough full-length antigenomic RNA to support replication. On the other hand, ribozyme cleavage downstream of the polyA site could inhibit polyadenylation by interfering with polyadenylation complex assembly. Thus, it appears that HDV may need a mechanism to control RNA processing so that both products can be generated in the proper amounts during the infection cycle. A model has been proposed in which the choice between ribozyme cleavage and polyadenylation is determined by alternative RNA secondary structures formed by the polyA sequence (Wadkins and Been 2002). One of the hypothetical structures, AltP 2, is a pairing between part of the upstream polyA sequence and the 3 ' end of the ribozyme sequence. For this model, the same upstream sequence that forms AltP 2 could also form a stem loop, P(- 1), within the leader, by pairing with sequences located farther upstream. A processing choice is possible because AltP 2 is predicted to inhibit ribozyme cleavage and favor polyadenylation resulting in mRNA production, whereas P(- 1) would inhibit polyadenylation and favor ribozyme cleavage resulting in full-length replication product. The P(- 1) vs. AltP 2 model was tested using an antigenomic HDV ribozyme construct with the 60 -nucleotide sequence upstream of the ribozyme cleavage site. This leader sequence contains the proposed polyA sequence elements. In vitro analysis of this construct revealed that the kinetic profile of ribozyme self-cleavage was altered in two ways. Relative to the ribozyme without upstream sequences, the fraction of precursor RNA that cleaved decreased to about 50 %, but the active ribozyme fraction cleaved faster. Native gel electrophoresis revealed that the active and inactive precursor RNAs adopted persistent alternative structures, and structure mapping with Ribonuclease T 1 and RNase H provided evidence for structures resembling P(- 1) and AltP 2. Sequence changes in the 5 ' leader designed to alter the relative stability of P(- 1) and AltP 2 increased or decreased the extent of ribozyme cleavage in a predictable way, but disrupting AltP 2 did not completely restore ribozyme activity. The analysis of deletion and base change variants supported a second alternative pairing, AltP 4, formed by the pyrimidine-rich sequence immediately 5 ' of the ribozyme cleavage site and a purine-rich sequence from the 5 ' side of P 4. A similar approach was used to test if the effect of disrupting both AltP 2 and AltP 4 might be additive, and the results suggested that ribozyme precursors with 5 ' leader sequences could fold into multiple inactive conformations, which can include, but may not be limited to, AltP 2, AltP 4, or a combination of both. Luciferase expression constructs with HDV polyA and ribozyme sequences were used to investigate the effects of RNA structure and ribozyme cleavage on polyadenylation in cells. One hypothesis was that P(- 1) could inhibit polyadenylation by making the polyA sequence elements less accessible to polyA factors, but sequence changes designed to alter the stability of the stem loop had no effect on polyadenylation. The model also predicts that the ribozyme sequence downstream of the polyA site could affect polyadenylation, possibly in two different ways. Ribozyme cleavage could interfere with polyadenylation by uncoupling transcription from processing, however, the ribozyme sequence might also influence polyadenylation in a manner independent of the ribozyme cleavage activity. As such, the AltP 2 structure could potentially {{have a positive effect on}} polyadenylation either by inhibiting ribozyme cleavage or by making the polyA signal sequences more accessible to the polyA factors. To distinguish between the effects of ribozyme cleavage and alternative RNA structures, luciferase expression levels from constructs with an HDV polyA sequence followed by the active wild-type ribozyme or the inactive C 76 u version of the ribozyme were compared. For the wild-type HDV polyA sequence, the active ribozyme reduced expression, whereas the inactive ribozyme control had no effect on expression. However, for the modified leader sequences, which were efficiently polyadenylated in the absence of ribozyme, there were changes in expression that appeared to be independent of ribozyme cleavage. Based on these findings, two alternative models are proposed. One model predicts that protein factors might affect antigenomic RNA processing, and the other model suggests that additional alternative structures, such as AltP 4, might influence the choice between ribozyme cleavage and polyadenylation.

40|$|Telomerase is a {{ribonucleoprotein}} that mediates {{extension of}} the dG-rich strand of telomeres in most eukaryotes. Like telomerase derived from ciliated protozoa, yeast telomerase is found to possess a tightly associated endonuclease activity that copurifies with the polymerization activity over different affinity-chromatographic steps. As {{is the case for}} ciliate telomerase, primers containing sequences that are not complementary to the <b>RNA</b> template <b>can</b> <b>be</b> efficiently <b>cleaved</b> by the yeast enzyme. More interestingly, we found that for the yeast enzyme, cleavage site selection is not stringent, since blocking cleavage at one site by the introduction of a nonhydrolyzable linkage can lead to the utilization of other sites. In addition, the reverse transcriptase activity of yeast telomerase can extend either the 5 ′- or 3 ′-end fragment following cleavage. Two general models that are consistent with the biochemical properties of the enzyme are presented: one model postulates two distinct active sites for the nuclease and reverse transcriptase, and the other invokes a multimeric enzyme with each protomer containing a single active site capable of mediating both cleavage and extension...|$|R
40|$|RNase P is a {{ribozyme}} originally {{identified for}} {{its role in}} maturation of tRNAs by cleavage of precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNAs) at the 5 '-end termini.

The site of cleavage of a pre-tRNA is identified by its tertiary structure; and any <b>RNA</b> molecule <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaved</b> by RNase P {{as long as the}} RNA forms a duplex that resembles the regional structure in the pre-tRNA. When the antisense sequence that forms the duplex with the strand that <b>is</b> subsequently <b>cleaved</b> by RNase P is in a separate molecule, it is called an external guide sequence (EGS). These fundamental observations are the basis for EGS technology, which consists of inhibiting gene expression by utilizing an EGS that elicits RNase P-mediated cleavage of a target mRNA molecule. EGS technology has been used to inhibit expression {{of a wide variety of}} genes, and may help development of novel treatments of diseases, including multidrug-resistant bacterial and viral infections.
