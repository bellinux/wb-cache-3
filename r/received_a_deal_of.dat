50|$|Tyler <b>received</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> notoriety {{during his}} career for his {{criticism}} of Abraham Lincoln, which he expressed on numerous occasions. The first of these came in 1917 when {{in response to an}} editorial in the New York Times suggesting that Southern slaveholders were akin to the German aristocrats then causing trouble in Europe, Tyler posited that it was Lincoln who more closely resembled the Prussian nobility with his flouting of the Constitution during the Civil War. Eleven years later the issue arose again when the Virginia House of Delegates chose to adjourn in honor of Lincoln's birthday; Tyler contended that Lincoln was no hero and did not merit the honor. When Time magazine fired back that Tyler's father, compared to the later president, was a dwarf both in stature and in accomplishments, Tyler retorted with a pamphlet claiming that it was Lincoln who was the dwarf. He would go on in retirement to continue the crusade against Lincoln, publishing many articles in his own journal, Tyler's Quarterly and Genealogical Magazine, that were highly critical of the sixteenth president.|$|E
40|$|IP based {{design is}} one of the most {{potential}} techniques to promote the SoC design promptly into market. To assist the process it is advantageous to have IP exchanged in different forms. Though, sharing IP blocks in today’s aggressive market poses significant security risks. Proving that a given IP is derived from a patented method or technique is in general a conscientiously time-consuming task, often requiring reverse-engineering and forensic investigation of IP. These techniques are so multifaceted that their uses to a huge collection of marketable products are almost always unaffordable. So protection of IPs in VLSI design has <b>received</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> interest in recent era. In this paper, we present an approach based on the embedding of the ownership proof as part of the IP design’s finite state machine (FSM) by means of visual information hiding...|$|E

Let G be a group, let n ∈ N with n ≥ 3 and let E be the biordered set of idempotents of the wreath product G ≀ Tn. We show, in a transparent way, that for e ∈ E lying in the minimal ideal of G ≀ Tn, the maximal subgroup of e in IG(E) is isomorphic to G. It is known that G≀Tn is the endomorphism monoid End Fn(G) of the rank n free G-act Fn(G). Our work is therefore analogous to that of Brittenham, Margolis and Meakin for rank 1 idempotents in full linear monoids. As a corollary we obtain the result of Gray and Ruškuc that any group can occur as a maximal subgroup of some free idempotent generated semigroup. Unlike their proof, ours involves a natural biordered set and very little machinery. Dedicated with gratitude and affection {{to the memory of}} John Howie 1...|$|E
