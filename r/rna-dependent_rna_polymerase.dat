40|$|AbstractAmino acid {{sequence}} stretches {{similar to}} the four most conserved segments of positive strand <b>RNA</b> viral <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> {{have been identified in}} proteins of four dsRNA viruses belonging to three families, i. e.

High statistical significance of the observed similarity was demonstrated, allowing identification of these proteins as likely candidates for <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases.</b> Based on these observations, and on the previously reported sequence similarity between the <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> of a yeast dsRNA virus and those of positive strand RNA viruses, a possible evolutionary relationship between the two virus classes is discussed...|$|R
5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E
5|$|Based on parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis, {{the most}} recent common {{ancestor}} of all eukaryotes most likely already possessed an early RNA interference pathway; {{the absence of the}} pathway in certain eukaryotes is thought to be a derived characteristic. This ancestral RNAi system probably contained at least one dicer-like protein, one argonaute, one PIWI protein, and an <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> that may also have played other cellular roles. A large-scale comparative genomics study likewise indicates that the eukaryotic crown group already possessed these components, which may then have had closer functional associations with generalized RNA degradation systems such as the exosome. This study also suggests that the RNA-binding argonaute protein family, which is shared among eukaryotes, most archaea, and at least some bacteria (such as Aquifex aeolicus), is homologous to and originally evolved from components of the translation initiation system.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{replication}} is the copying of one RNA to another. Many viruses replicate this way. The {{enzymes that}} copy RNA to new <b>RNA,</b> called <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> {{are also found}} in many eukaryotes where {{they are involved in}} RNA silencing.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{validity}} of classifications of RNA viruses, published alignments and phylogenies of <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> and DNA <b>polymerase</b> sequences were reevaluated by a Monte Carlo randomization procedure, bootstrap resampling, and phylogenetic signal analysis.

40|$|The Pol {{region of}} the Gag-Pol fusion protein of the L-A {{double-stranded}} (ds) RNA virus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has (i) a domain essential for packaging viral positive strands, (ii) consensus amino acid sequence patterns typical of <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> and (iii) two single-stranded RNA binding domains. We describe here a third single-stranded RNA binding domain (Pol residues 374 to 432), which is unique in being cryptic. Its activity is revealed only after deletion of an inhibitory region C terminal to the binding domain itself. This cryptic RNA binding domain is necessary for propagation of M 1 satellite dsRNA, {{but it is not}} necessary for viral particle assembly or for packaging of viral positive-strand single-stranded RNA.

The DENV RdRp is similar to other RdRps containing palm, finger, and thumb subdomains and a GDD motif for incorporating nucleotides.|$|E
25|$|The viruses bind to a cell through {{interactions}} between its hemagglutinin glycoprotein and sialic acid sugars on {{the surfaces of}} epithelial cells in the lung and throat (Stage 1 in infection figure). The cell imports the virus by endocytosis. In the acidic endosome, part of the haemagglutinin protein fuses the viral envelope with the vacuole's membrane, releasing the viral RNA (vRNA) molecules, accessory proteins and <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> into the cytoplasm (Stage 2). These proteins and vRNA form a complex that is transported into the cell nucleus, where the <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> begins transcribing complementary positive-sense cRNA (Steps 3a and b). The cRNA is either exported into the cytoplasm and translated (step 4), or remains in the nucleus. Newly synthesised viral proteins are either secreted through the Golgi apparatus onto the cell surface (in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, step 5b) or transported back into the nucleus to bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles (step 5a). Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell, including degrading cellular mRNA and using the released nucleotides for vRNA synthesis and also inhibiting translation of host-cell mRNAs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractViral RNA {{replication}} and transcription involves {{not only}} viral <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> but also cellular proteins, {{the majority of}} which are subverted from the RNA-processing or translation machineries of host cells. These factors interact with viral <b>RNA</b> or <b>polymerases</b> to form transcription or replication ribonucleoprotein complexes and may provide template specificity for <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> synthesis, suggesting a close parallel to the mechanism of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis.

40|$|Viral <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> exhibit great {{sequence}} diversity. Only six core {{amino acids}} are conserved across all <b>polymerases</b> of positive-strand <b>RNA</b> viruses of eukaryotes. While exploring {{the function of}} one of these completely conserved residues, asparagine 297 in the prototypic poliovirus polymerase 3 Dpol, we identified three viable mutants with noncanonical amino acids at this conserved position. Although asparagine 297 could be replaced by glycine or alanine in these mutants, the viruses exhibited Mn 2 +-dependent RNA replication and viral growth. All known <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> and replicative polymerases of bacterial, eukaryotic, and viral organisms are thought to be magnesium dependent in vivo, and therefore these mutant polioviruses may represent the first viruses with a requirement for an alternative polymerase cation. These results demonstrate the extreme functional flexibility of viral <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases.</b> Furthermore, the finding that strictly conserved residues in the nucleotide binding pocket of the polymerase can be altered in a manner that supports virus production suggests that drugs targeting this region of the enzyme will still be susceptible to the problem of drug-resistant escape mutants...|$|R
25|$|During their research, Eigen and Schuster also {{considered}} types of protein and nucleotide coupling other than hypercycles. One such alternative {{was a model}} with one replicase that performed polymerase functionality {{and that was a}} translational product of one of the RNA matrices existing among the quasispecies. This <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> catalysed the replication of sequences that had specific motifs recognized by this replicase. The other RNA matrices, or just one of their strands, provided translational products which had specific anticodons and were responsible for unique assignment and transportation of amino acids.|$|E

It has both icosahedral virus particles, viral <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> and protease and viral replication proteins. But they have distinguished properties at the same time. For example, secoviruses infect plants and it has specialized proteins. The effect of secoviruses is important on cultivated crops. It infected a wide range of plants from grapevine to rice. They have been classified into the family Secoviridae containing the subfamily Comovirinae (genera Comovirus, Fabavirus and Nepovirus), and genera Sequivirus, Waikavirus, Cheravirus, Sadwavirus, and Torradovirus (type species Tomato torrado virus)).|$|E
25|$|Gene {{sequence}} {{within the}} genome is conserved across the family {{due to a}} phenomenon known as transcriptional polarity (see Mononegavirales) in which genes closest to the 3’ end of the genome are transcribed in greater abundance than those towards the 5’ end. This {{is a result of}} structure of the genome. After each gene is transcribed, the <b>RNA-Dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> pauses to release the new mRNA when it encounters an intergenic sequence. When the RNA polymerase is paused, there is a chance that it will dissociate from the RNA genome. If it dissociates, it must reenter the genome at the leader sequence, rather than continuing to transcribe the length of the genome. The result is that the further downstream genes are from the leader sequence, the less they will be transcribed by RNA polymerase.|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> (RdRps) is highly conserved among RNA viruses. In a previous study, a {{unique set of}} mutant strains of Bovine viral diarrhea virus was obtained, encompassing either a genomic deletion of six codons or duplications of between 1 and 45 codons; these mutations affect different parts of the palm region, the most conserved part of RdRps containing the catalytic centre. In the present study, a detailed characterization of the RdRp mutant viruses was performed, demonstrating different degrees of a small-plaque phenotype in cell culture, correlating with significantly reduced viral RNA synthesis and delayed virus replication. Taken together, {{the results of this study}} demonstrate a surprising flexibility within the palm region of a plus-strandRNA virus RdRp, resulting in viral attenuation in vitro. This interesting insight into an essential viral protein may have implications for the development of vaccines and attenuated viral vectors.

25|$|Once {{inside the}} hepatocyte, HCV takes over {{portions}} of the intracellular machinery to replicate. The HCV genome is translated to produce a single protein of around 3011 amino acids. The polyprotein is then proteolytically processed by viral and cellular proteases to produce three structural (virion-associated) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins. Alternatively, a frameshift may occur in the Core region to produce an Alternate Reading Frame Protein (ARFP). HCV encodes two proteases, the NS2 cysteine autoprotease and the NS3-4A serine protease. The NS proteins then recruit the viral genome into an RNA replication complex, which is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic membranes. RNA replication takes places via the viral <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> NS5B, which produces a negative strand RNA intermediate. The negative strand RNA then serves as a template {{for the production of}} new positive strand viral genomes. Nascent genomes can then be translated, further replicated or packaged within new virus particles.

40|$|Among the {{processes}} that play essential roles in both genome defense and organism survival are those involved in chromosome comparison. They are acutely active in the meiotic cells of Neurospora crassa, where they evaluate the mutual identity of homologs by a process we call trans-sensing. When nonsymmetrical regions are found, they are silenced. The known molecular components of this meiotic silencing machinery are related to <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> Argonautes and Dicers, suggesting that the mechanisms of how heterologous chromosomal regions are silenced involves, at some stage, the production of small interfering RNAs. Neurospora has two active and clearly distinct RNA interference pathways: quelling (vegetative specific) and meiotic silencing (meiosis specific). Both pathways require {{a common set of}} protein types like <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> Argonautes and Dicers.

A common divalent cation binding site, distinct from the positions of catalytic ions, has been identified in many viral RdRps. We have applied biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches {{to show how the}} RdRp from bacteriophage 6 uses the bound noncatalytic Mn 2 to facilitate the dis-placement of the C-terminal domain during the transition from initiation to elongation. We find that this displacement releases the noncatalytic Mn 2, which must be replaced for elongation to occur. By inserting a dysfunctional Mg 2 at this site, we cap-tured two nucleoside triphosphates within the active site in the absence ofWatson-Crick base pairing with template andmapped movements of divalent cations during preinitiation.
