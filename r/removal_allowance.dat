40|$|Purpose: This work {{is focused}} on {{determination}} of effects of grinding conditions on effectiveness of abrasive electrodischarge grinding (AEDG) process applied for <b>removal</b> of machining <b>allowance</b> and forming of surface geometrical texture (SGT). These results were compared with one obtained for conventional grinding. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental investigations of deep-seated surface grinding of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy using CBN grinding wheel with metal bond were the ground for this elaboration. The effectiveness of AEDG process was assessed based on specific tangential grinding force and energy of spark electric discharge and machining results were estimated on geometrical structure parameters. Findings: The effectiveness of machining <b>allowance</b> <b>removal</b> depended on conditions of AEDG process. Significant differences in SGT formed by AEDG process and conventional grinding were revealed. Practical implications: Abrasive electrodischarge grinding is useful to be particularly suitable for efficient and effective grinding of very hard structural materials such as high-alloy steel, sintered carbides, metal-based composite materials etc. Originality/value: AEDG experiments were carried out using the typical surface finishing grinder and especially adapted generator of spark discharge pulses. The majority of such experiments in the world were performed with the electrodischarge machine tool equipped with extra grinding wheel mounted on the grinding pin and functioning {{as one of the}} electrodes put into operation via pneumatic drive...|$|R

40|$|After {{sintering}} advanced ceramics, {{there are}} invariably distortions, caused {{in large part}} by the heterogeneous distribution of density gradients along the compacted piece. To correct distortions, machining is generally used to manufacture pieces within dimensional and geometric tolerances. Hence, narrow material removal limit conditions are applied, which minimize the generation of damage. Another alternative is machining the compacted piece before sintering, called the green ceramic stage, which allows machining without damage to mechanical strength. Since the greatest concentration of density gradients is located in the outer-most layers of the compacted piece, this study investigated the <b>removal</b> of different <b>allowance</b> values by means of green machining. The output variables are distortion after sintering, tool wear, cutting force, and the surface roughness of the green ceramics and the sintered ones. The following results have been noted: less distortion is verified in the sintered piece after 1 mm allowance removal; and the higher the tool wear the worse the surface roughness of both green and sintered pieces...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{contains}} definitions for {{a process}} and a methodology for restoration of parts {{on the basis}} of the analysis of the known methods and their selection. Geometric parameters and operational properties that should be provided for restoration of parts have been determined in the paper. A process for selection of the required method for restoration parts has been improved and it makes it possible to synthesize an optimal process of the restoration according to a criterion of industrial resource consumption with due account of quality, productivity and security limits. A justification on measures that meet the required limits has been presented in the paper. The paper shows a direction of technical solutions that ensure complete use of residual life of repair fund parts. These solutions can be achieved through close application of all repair sizes of work-pieces with revision of their values, uniform <b>removal</b> of the <b>allowance</b> while cutting the work-pieces at optimum locating, application of coating processes only in technically justified cases, application of straightening with thermal fixing of its results or all-around compression of deformable elements. The paper proposes to limit a number of overhauls for the units together with restoration of basic and fundamental parts by two repairs for the whole period of their lifetime. Number of shaft journal building-up should be limited by one building-up operation throughout the whole life cycle of the part with the purpose to preserve its length within the prescribed limits. It has been recommended to expand an application area of volumetric plastic deformation of material in the form of thermoplastic distribution or reduction of repair work-pieces representing class of rotation bodies with holes that ensures an allowance to machine external and internal surfaces for nominal dimensions without coating. A structure of the coating material with fine inclusions of carbides or nitrides of metals and preferred orientation of structural components perpendicular to the restored surface under the influence of heat removal has been established in the paper. Due to surface plastic deformation the structure orientates fiber axis tangentially in the direction of relative sliding that inhibits growth of fatigue radially oriented cracks. </p...|$|R
