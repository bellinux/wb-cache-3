5000|$|When {{used for}} flowers, red often refers to purplish (<b>red</b> <b>deadnettle,</b> red clover, red helleborine) or pink (red campion, red valerian) colors.|$|E
50|$|After the queens {{emerge from}} their hibernation, they forage on flowers {{including}} crocus, Erica, Mahonia, white and <b>red</b> <b>deadnettles,</b> Prunus, flowering currant and bluebells. However, the bees forage on many other flowers, including many garden plants, such as lavender, Hebe, Rhododendron, deadnettles, thistles, and vetches, {{as well as}} ceanothus, wall flower, campanula, privet, sage, Hypericum, bramble, red bartsia, clovers, lupins, honeysuckle, sedum, knapweed, Buddleia, thistles, viper’s bugloss, and trefoils, and comfrey.|$|R

50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>deadnettle</b> (Lamium purpureum) {{contains}} phenylethanoid glycosides named lamiusides A, B, C, D and E. The {{aerial parts}} of Stachys officinalis contain phenylethanoid glycosides, (betonyosides A, B, C, D, E and F). Chemical investigation of methanol extracts from Pithecoctenium crucigerum (Bignoniaceae) showed {{the presence of}} five phenylethanoid glycosides (verbascoside, isoverbascoside, forsythoside B, jionoside D and leucosceptoside B), these all active against DPPH.|$|E
50|$|Many {{are quite}} {{specialised}} {{and can only}} thrive and reproduce where the ground has been broken by plough or spade. They are invariably annual and reproduction is by seed alone, which can in many species lie dormant for years in the soil until brought to the surface during cultivation. They have fast reproduction cycles, usually in one year from seed to seed, though some species can {{have more than one}} generation in one season. A few species such as groundsel (Senecio vulgaris), shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), <b>red</b> <b>deadnettle</b> (Lamium purpureum) and chickweed (Stellaria media) can survive unharmed through very cold weather and are often able to seed even in winter.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims There is a {{great need}} to search for natural {{compounds}} with superior prebiotic, antioxidant and immunostimulatory properties for use in (food) applications. Raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) show such properties. Moreover, they contribute to stress tolerance in plants, acting as putative membrane stabilizers, antioxidants and signalling agents. †Methods A large-scale soluble carbohydrate screening was performed within the plant kingdom. An unknown compound accumulated to a high extent in early-spring <b>red</b> <b>deadnettle</b> (Lamium purpureum) but not in other RFO plants. The compound was purified and its structure was unravelled with NMR. Organs and organ parts of <b>red</b> <b>deadnettle</b> were carefully dissected and analysed for soluble sugars. Phloem sap content was analysed by a common EDTA-based method. †Key Results Early-spring <b>red</b> <b>deadnettle</b> stems and roots accumulate high concentrations of the reducing trisac-charide manninotriose (Gala 1, 6 Gala 1, 6 Glc), a derivative of the non-reducing RFO stachyose (Gala 1, 6 Gala 1, 6 Glca 1, 2 bFru). Detailed soluble carbohydrate analyses on dissected stem and leaf sections, together with phloem sap analyses, strongly suggest that stachyose is the main transport compound, but extensive hydrolysis of stachyose to manninotriose seems to occur along the transport path. Based on the specificities of the observed carbo-hydrate dynamics, the putative physiological roles of manninotriose in <b>red</b> <b>deadnettle</b> are discussed...|$|E

Phloem sap content was analysed by a common EDTA-based method. Key results Early spring <b>red</b> <b>deadnettle</b> stems and roots accumulate high concentrations of the reducing trisaccharide manninotriose (Galα 1, 6 Galα 1, 6 Glc), a derivative of the non-reducing RFO stachyose (Galα 1, 6 Galα 1, 6 Glcα 1, 2 βFru). Detailed soluble carbohydrate analyses on dissected stem and leaf sections together with phloem sap analyses strongly suggest that stachyose is the main transport compound, but extensive hydrolysis of stachyose to manninotriose seems to occur along the transport path. Based on the specificities of the observed carbohydrate dynamics, the putative physiological roles of manninotriose in <b>red</b> <b>deadnettle</b> are discussed. Conclusions Here it is demonstrated {{for the first time}} that manninotriose is a novel and important player in the RFO metabolism of red dead deadnettle. It is proposed that manninotriose represents a temporal storage carbohydrate in early spring deadnettle, at the same time perhaps functioning as a membrane protector and/or as an antioxidant in the vicinity of membranes as recently suggested for other RFOs and fructans. This novel finding urges further research on this peculiar carbohydrate on a broader array of RFO accumulators. status: publishe...|$|E
