40|$|The firm should pursue both maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> {{capital and}} maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> equity simultaneously. Maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> capital {{is the primary}} goal for firms because maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> capital {{guarantees}} efficiency. Therefore, maximum profit, maximum {{market value of the}} firm, maximum value of equity and maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> equity are inappropriate to be the primary goal. Since gross profit is independent of capital structure, capital structure just distributes return on capital into equity and debt (i. e., maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> equity determines capital structure). The maximum return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> equity is the secondary goal that the firm pursues. Leverage makes the return <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> equity be higher than interest rate.

5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic.

For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{low gross}} on its initial release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books and lists of cult films. These reappraisals often cite the success of Silence of the Lambs and its sequels {{as the reason for}} the increased interest in Manhunter, while still favoring the earlier film over its successors. Telling of this resurgence in appreciation are the film's ratings on review aggregation sites such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes. Compiled mostly from reviews written decades after its original release, Manhunter has a metascore of 78 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and a 94% fresh <b>rating</b> <b>on</b> Rotten Tomatoes, from 33 reviews.|$|E

Students must first gain their instrument <b>rating</b> <b>on</b> the Hornet, and are then taught basic fighter manoeuvres, air combat techniques, air-to-air gunnery, and air-to-ground tactics. The course culminates with Exercise High Sierra, a biannual event that was first run at Townsville, Queensland, in 1986. The exercise lasts for two weeks and involves day and night flights, including precision strike sorties with practice and live bombs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} {{a banking}} model to analyze sweeping behavior. We find that sweeping responds positively {{to increases in}} bank loan rates and reserve ratios and negatively to increases in the interest <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> reserves or to exogenous increases in bank deposits or equity.

Empirical analysis of an explicit condition that we derive relating sweeping to the interest <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> reserves suggests with an unchanged reserve requirement, the Fed could eliminate sweeping by setting the interest <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> reserves to no less than 3. 67 percentage points below the market loan rate.
