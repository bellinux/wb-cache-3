"That was a {{conscious}} move by Max and myself, {{because we were}} listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song– I don't <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> I said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?' It worked." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoffman's profile {{continued}} to grow with the new decade, and he became an increasingly recognizable figure. Despite earlier reservations about directing for the screen, his first release of the 2010s was also his first as a film director. The independent drama Jack Goes Boating was adapted from Robert Glaudini's play of the same name, in which Hoffman had starred and directed for the LAByrinth Theater Company in 2007. He originally intended only to direct the film, but decided to reprise the main role of Jack– a lonely limousine driver looking for love– after the actor he wanted for it was unavailable. The low-key film had a limited release, and was not a high earner, though it received many positive reviews. However, Dave Edwards of the Daily Mirror remarked that [...] "Hoffman's directing debut delivers a film so weak I could barely <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about as I left", while critic Mark Kermode appreciated the cinematic qualities that Hoffman brought to the film, and stated that he showed potential as a director. In addition to Jack Goes Boating, in 2010 Hoffman also directed Brett C. Leonard's tragic drama The Long Red Road for the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Steven Oxman of Variety described the production as [...] "heavy handed" [...] and [...] "predictable", but [...] "intriguing and at least partially successful".|$|E
500|$|Wanting {{to stray}} {{away from the}} R-styled music of Thankful, which she {{described}} as a showcase of versatility, she revealed that Thankfuls success [...] "empowered me to step more into rock, step more into the soulful vibe." [...] She described {{the music of the}} second album as [...] "like the first CD in the sense that it's versatile, but it's more into the rock, It's more into the soulful roots, and it's just a little bit deeper, so it's pretty cool." [...] Dr. Luke revealed in an interview that alternative music and indie music were inspirations to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying, [...] "That was a conscious move by Max [...] and myself, because we were listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song-I don't <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> I said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!'

[...] Songs such as [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", and [...] "Because of You" [...] were also inspired by her real life experiences, the former about her relationship with an ex-boyfriend and the latter about her experience after her parents' divorce.|$|E

In 1976 when Pazder was treating Smith for depression (related to her having had a miscarriage), Smith confided {{she felt that she}} had something important to tell him, but could not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> Shortly thereafter, Pazder and Smith had a session where Smith screamed for 25 minutes non-stop and eventually started speaking in the voice of a five-year-old. Over the next 14 months Pazder spent over 600 hours using hypnosis to help Smith recover alleged memories of Satanic ritual abuse that occurred when she was five in 1954 and 1955 at the hands of her mother (Virginia Proby) and others, all of whom Smith said were members of a [...] "Satanic cult" [...] in Victoria.|$|E
