25|$|The {{indigenous}} training -to {{enable them}} to perform the most delicate tasks (indeed {{in order to do}} the concrete mixes and the containment of carpentry works, you have to bend and tie the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel,</b> making it properly or lose it)- was really hard, because the Somalian men (mostly Bantu Somali) were used to do only subsistence farming.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{structural}} concrete differs from Roman concrete in two important details. First, its mix consistency is fluid and homogeneous, {{allowing it to}} be poured into forms rather than requiring hand-layering together with the placement of aggregate, which, in Roman practice, often consisted of rubble. Second, integral <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension, whereas Roman concrete could depend only upon {{the strength of the}} concrete bonding to resist tension.|$|E

25|$|Most modern arch bridges {{are made}} from {{reinforced}} concrete. This type of bridge is suitable where a temporary centring may be erected to support the forms, <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel,</b> and uncured concrete. When the concrete is sufficiently set the forms and falseworks are then removed. It is also possible to construct a reinforced concrete arch from precast concrete, where the arch is built in two halves which are then leaned against each other.|$|E
25|$|The vehicle's inner {{structure}} {{received as}} much attention as the aerodynamics of its exterior. Fiberglass outer panels were retained, but the Sting Ray emerged with nearly twice as much steel support in its central structure as the 1958—62 Corvette. The resulting extra weight was balanced by a reduction in fiberglass thickness, so the finished product actually weighed a bit less than the old roadster. Passenger room was as good as before despite the tighter wheelbase, and the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> girder made the cockpit both stronger and safer.|$|E
25|$|When a {{concrete}} structure is designed, it is usual {{to specify the}} concrete cover for the rebar (the depth of the rebar within the object). The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes. If the reinforcement {{is too close to}} the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur. The concrete cover depth can be measured with a cover meter. However, carbonated concrete incurs a durability problem only when there is also sufficient moisture and oxygen to cause electropotential corrosion of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E

All these systems rely on a physical layer to transmit signal. Wire, wireless and powerline physical layer are commonly used. However, all these layers have their limitations and associated problems especially in existing building. Existing building without sufficient spare cable containment for future wiring, concrete chasing to install new cable containment is unavoidable for wiring new network cables. In view of higher cost and great nuisance to the occupant during concrete chasing, a feasibility study of using building <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> bars to transmit signals is discussed in this paper for future application. The principle of signal transmission in <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> bars is similar as signal coupling in a transformer by means of magnetic flux coupling. Signals are transmitted as magnetic flux {{by means of a}} transmission coil, which is installed through <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> bar and cast-in the concrete. The magnetic flux shall flow all around the <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> bars framework of the entire building. Another coil acting as receiver is installed in a remote area to couple the magnetic flux and transform the signals from the transmission coil. From the experiments in laboratory and two construction buildings, it proved that the building <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> bars framework is feasible as a physical data transmission media. Signals injected into <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> bars can be received in remote area of the entire building in acceptance performance.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the corrosion protection and control of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steels</b> in concrete is reported. The <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steels</b> were coated with local coating materials (i) bitumen, (ii) enamel paint, and (iii) local anti-rust paint. The reinforced concrete samples were immersed in a 0. 05 M NaCl solution. The study reveals the protection offered by these coatings in the sodium chloride solution. The study also reveals that the coatings used on the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steels</b> have good corrosion protection within {{the period of the}} {{experimental study}} but this cannot be guaranteed at longer periods of time. The results indicated that the enamel paint coating has the best protection against corrosion in NaCl solution, followed by the bitumen coating, and finally local anti-rust paint coating. The potentials and resistances of the coated <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steels</b> at the end of six weeks of the experiment are as follows: 1. - 300 mV and 38. 4 kilo-ohm for control sample, 2. - 210 mV and 29. 8 kilo-ohm for sample with bitumen coating, 3. - 200 mV and 28. 1 kilo-ohm for sample with enamel paint coating, and 4. - 250 mV and 34. 8 kilo-ohm for sample with local anti-rust paint coating...|$|R

25|$|Extremely durable {{high-grade}} {{concrete and}} <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> were used throughout {{construction of the}} pre-cast components, with the estimated lifespan of the bridge being in excess of 100 years. Their sheer size and weight required strengthening of the soil base during the design and preparation work for the Amherst Head staging facility, {{as well as the}} use of a crawler transport system to move pieces from fabrication to storage, and onto a nearby pier. These crawler transports, using specially designed teflon-coated concrete rails, earned the nickname lobsters from workers.|$|E
25|$|For the {{cantilevered}} floors, Wright and {{his team}} used upside-down T-shaped beams integrated into a monolithic concrete slab which formed both {{the ceiling of the}} space below and provided resistance against compression. The contractor, Walter Hall, also an engineer, produced independent computations and argued for increasing the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> in the first floor’s slab. Wright refused the suggestion. While some sources state that the contractor quietly doubled the amount of reinforcement, others say that Kaufman's consulting engineers – at Kaufman's request – redrew Wright's reinforcing drawings and doubled the amount of steel specified by Wright.|$|E
25|$|Hydro{{demolition}} is {{not used}} as much for demolition {{as it is for}} surface restoration and protection projects. When concrete has deteriorated or the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> has begun to corrode, it is necessary to remove any unsound concrete and reinforcing bars (rebar) in order to replace it with new concrete and maintain the integrity of the structure. This process has also been used to remove sound concrete that is not compromised in any way. This may be done to install a preventive cathodic protection system, or to remove concrete in structures in which vibration is a concern. Unlike jackhammers, hydrodemolition does not produce vibrations throughout a structure and therefore does not introduce micro fractures.|$|E
50|$|The arch was an {{efficient}} design because {{a more conventional}} form, such as a rectangle, {{would have resulted in}} unused space {{at the top of the}} building. The arch further reduced stresses and the need for extraneous <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel.</b> Meeting this need was important because the United States was entering World War II, which made <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> very expensive. One of the most significant aspects of this building is its use of reinforced concrete, a cheaper alternative that had been experimented with in Europe, but not used to any great effect.|$|R

25|$|Repair {{works were}} {{estimated}} at about €60 million. On 18 October, the investigation authority released the damaged section of tunnel back to Eurotunnel who then assessed the tunnel lining and replaced over one thousand bolts holding the concrete lining. The damaged concrete was then removed with {{high pressure water}} jets, damage to the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> mesh repaired and a new concrete lining applied by a shotcreting process. This used about 4000 tonnes of new concrete and was completed in early January 2009. During the remainder of January, tunnel equipment was repaired and replaced as necessary, with the installation of overhead line equipment on 28 January. After test running, Eurotunnel reopened on 9 February 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} {{scale of}} the facility alone made the construction project challenging. By the time the “conventional facility” (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 cubic yards of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent {{of the rest of}} the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 cubic yards of concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.|$|E
25|$|The {{plebiscite}} {{contained the}} condition {{that the federal government}} would subsidize 20% of the project. The federal Minister of Reconstruction, C.D. Howe, promised federal support in an October 3, 1945 letter. However, the funding fell through over a disagreement about the details of the employment arrangements. A scaled down proposal, about 20% smaller, was agreed to in its place. The work along Queen Street was abandoned temporarily, and the original $42.3 million ($ in 2012) was reduced to $28.9 million ($ in 2012) plus $3.5 million ($ in 2012) for rolling stock. After a two-year delay due to postwar labour shortages, construction on the new subway did not start until September 8, 1949. A total of 1.7 million cubic yards (1.3 million cubic metres) of material was removed and some 14,000 tons (12,700 metric tons) of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> and 1.4 million bags of cement were put into place.|$|E

25|$|In particular, FRP rods {{are useful}} for {{structures}} where the presence of steel would not be acceptable. For example, MRI machines have huge magnets, and accordingly require non-magnetic buildings. Again, toll booths that read radio tags need reinforced concrete that is transparent to radio waves. Also, where the design life of the concrete structure {{is more important than}} its initial costs, non-steel reinforcing often has its advantages where corrosion of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> is a major cause of failure. In such situations corrosion-proof reinforcing can extend a structure's life substantially, for example in the intertidal zone. FRP rods may also be useful in situations where {{it is likely that the}} concrete structure may be compromised in future years, for example the edges of balconies when balustrades are replaced, and bathroom floors in multi-story construction where the service life of the floor structure is likely to be many times the service life of the waterproofing building membrane.|$|E
25|$|An {{ironworker}} is the US {{term for}} a tradesman (man or woman) {{who works in the}} ironworking industry. A structural/ ornamental Ironworker, erects (or even dismantles) the structural steel framework of pre-engineered metal buildings, single and multi-story buildings, stadiums, arenas, hospitals, towers, wind turbines, and bridges. Ironworkers assemble the structural framework in accordance with engineered drawings. Ironworkers also unload, place and tie <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> bars (rebar) as well as install post-tensioning systems, both of which give strength to the concrete used in piers, footings, slabs, buildings and bridges. Ironworkers load, unload, place and set machinery and equipment and operate power hoists, forklifts, and aerial lifts. They unload, place and fasten metal decking, safety netting and edge rails to facilitate safe working practices. Ironworkers finish buildings by erecting curtain wall and window wall systems, pre-cast concrete and stone, stairs and handrails, metal doors, sheeting and elevator fronts. Ironworkers perform all types of industrial maintenance as well.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{for wind}} turbine parts {{other than the}} rotor blades (including the rotor hub, gearbox, frame, and tower) are largely {{composed}} of steel. Modern turbines uses a couple of tonnes of copper for generators, cables and such. Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components {{in an effort to}} make the turbines more lightweight and efficient, and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved. Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still, requires much <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> to meet the strength requirement of the turbine. Additionally, step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines., In particular, this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium. Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials. In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.|$|E

40|$|Steel {{orthotropic}} deck is {{the most}} suitable solution for long-span bridges in virtue of its low weight and good mechanical properties. However it shows a lack of adhesion with ordinary paving materials {{and for this reason}} special bonding coats are usually applied on the steel surface. Polymer-modified bitumen, asphalt-based mastic, epoxy asphalt and reinforced asphalt membrane have all been used at the interface between the hot mix asphalt (HMA) course and steel bridge decks. A description of these materials and their construction process is provided. In some extreme situations even mechanical reinforcement is necessary to provide adequate bonding between the steel deck and the asphalt pavement. The aim of this experimental study was the laboratory evaluation of the shear properties of smooth and <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> interfaces coated with a polymer-modified bitumen between the steel deck and the conventional HMA. A suitable specimen preparation procedure was preliminarily defined. The shear resistance was evaluated using the ASTRA shear test device in order to investigate the effects of temperature and normal stress on different types of HMA-steel interfaces. The results showed that <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> interfaces guarantee higher performance than smooth interfaces, especially with increasing temperature. Thus <b>reinforced</b> <b>steel</b> interfaces can be considered as a reliable solution in case of high shear traffic-induced stresses...|$|R

2500|$|Prestressing {{concrete}} is {{a technique}} that greatly increases the load-bearing strength of concrete beams. The <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> in the bottom part of the beam, which will be subjected to tensile forces when in service, is placed in tension before the concrete is poured around it. Once the concrete has hardened, the tension on the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> is released, placing a built-in compressive force on the concrete. When loads are applied, the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> takes on more stress and the compressive force in the concrete is reduced, but does not become a tensile force. [...] Since the concrete is always under compression, it is less subject to cracking and failure.|$|E
