25|$|Yum-Yum {{is being}} {{prepared}} by her friends for her wedding ("Braid the raven hair"), after which she muses {{on her own}} beauty ("The sun whose rays"). Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo return to <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> the limited duration of her impending union. Joined by Nanki-Poo and Pish-Tush, they try to keep their spirits up ("Brightly dawns our wedding-day"), but soon Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah enter to inform them of a twist in the law that states that when a married man is beheaded for flirting, his wife must be buried alive ("Here's a how-de-do"). Yum-Yum is unwilling to marry under these circumstances, and so Nanki-Poo challenges Ko-Ko to behead him on the spot. It turns out, however, that Ko-Ko has never executed anyone, not even a Blue bottle, and cannot execute Nanki-Poo, because the ex-tailor is too soft-hearted. Ko-Ko instead sends Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum away to be wed (by Pooh-Bah, as Archbishop of Titipu), promising {{to present to the}} Mikado a false affidavit in evidence of the fictitious execution.|$|E

500|$|Anne's sole {{surviving}} child, the Duke of Gloucester, {{died at the}} age {{of eleven}} on 30 July 1700. She and her husband were [...] "overwhelmed with grief". Anne ordered her household to observe a day of mourning every year on the anniversary of his death. With William childless and Gloucester dead, Anne was the only individual remaining in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. To address the succession crisis and preclude a Catholic restoration, the Parliament of England enacted the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that, failing the issue of Anne and of William III by any future marriage, the Crown of England and Ireland would go to Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant descendants. Sophia was the granddaughter of James VI and I through his daughter Elizabeth, who was the sister of Anne's grandfather Charles I. Over fifty Catholics with stronger claims were excluded from the line of succession. Anne's father died in September 1701. His widow, Anne's stepmother, the former queen, wrote to Anne to inform her that her father forgave her and to <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> her promise to seek the restoration of his line. Anne, however, had already acquiesced to the new line of succession created by the Act of Settlement.|$|E

2500|$|Elisheva Goldberg, {{writing in}} the Daily Beast in July 2012, {{rejected}} Dershowitz's argument that Walker's refusal to allow the Hebrew translation meant she was anti-Semitic. Noting that Walker had been married to a Jew and had a half-Jewish daughter, and that The Color Purple was adapted as a film directed by Jewish filmmaker Steven Spielberg, Goldberg said: [...] "Alice Walker is not boycotting Jews. She is not even boycotting Israelis. She is boycotting the government of Israel. She is boycotting what she sees as state-subsidized symbols of racism that <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> Apartheid South Africa." [...] To call Walker an anti-Semite, Goldberg said, was to [...] "devalue" [...] her own grandfather's suffering at Treblinka concentration camp.|$|E

Her office overlooks a wood deck that has been painted rusty red to <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> the soil of her native home. She's working on her first novel, set in 1148 in Cambodia. She's shy about revealing the plot. Again, she's sure it will only sell 10 copies." ...|$|E
2500|$|The World's Wife, a {{collection}} of poems by Carol Ann Duffy, features a sonnet entitled Anne Hathaway, based on the passage from Shakespeare's will regarding his [...] "second-best bed". Duffy chooses the view {{that this would be}} their marriage bed, and so a memento of their love, not a slight. Anne remembers their lovemaking as a form of [...] "romance and drama", unlike the [...] "prose" [...] written on the best bed used by guests, [...] "I hold him in the casket of my widow's head/ as he held me upon that next best bed". In Robert Nye's novel Mrs. Shakespeare: the Complete Works, which purports to be Anne's autobiographical reminiscences, Shakespeare buys the best bed with money given to him by the Earl of Southampton. When Anne comes to London, the couple use the bed for wild sexual adventures, in which they engage in role-playing fantasies based on his plays. He refers to the bed he bequeaths her as [...] "the second best" [...] to <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> the best bed of their memories. The novel was dramatised for BBC radio in 1998 with Maggie Steed playing Hathaway.|$|E
