5|$|Understanding data {{dependencies}} {{is fundamental}} in implementing parallel algorithms. No program can <b>run</b> <b>more</b> quickly than the longest chain of dependent calculations (known as the critical path), since calculations that depend upon prior calculations {{in the chain}} must be executed in order. However, most algorithms do not consist of just a long chain of dependent calculations; there are usually opportunities to execute independent calculations in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences {{the passage of}} time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent {{in the opposite direction}} (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body <b>run</b> <b>more</b> slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, all {{the trains}} were {{equipped}} with weapons so the drivers could kill animals {{hit by the}} trains. About 100 game are killed each year along the line. In September, NSB Anbud launched a service allowing passenger riding from the Gjøvik and Toten areas to transfer to a coach at Roa Station, and continue onwards to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Since the establishment, NSB Anbud has requested an additional passing loop on the Gjøvik Line. This will allow more freight trains on the line, and reduce travel time for the passenger trains by four minutes. The investment would cost NOK 50 to 70 million. During 2007, the company also accused the Norwegian National Rail Administration of giving the Gjøvik Line less priority in maintenance just because NSB Anbud had their train <b>run</b> <b>more</b> on time than trains operated by other companies.|$|E
5|$|Metrorail begins {{service at}} 5 am Monday through Friday, 7 am on Saturdays, and 8 am Sundays; it ends service at 11:30 pm Monday through Thursday, 1:00 am Friday and Saturday, and 11:00 pm on Sundays, {{although}} the last trains leave the end stations inbound {{about half an}} hour before these times. Trains <b>run</b> <b>more</b> frequently during rush hours on all lines, with scheduled peak hour headways of 4 minutes on the Red Line and 9 minutes on all other lines. Headways are much longer during midday and evening on weekdays and all weekend. The midday six-minute headways are based on a combination of two Metrorail lines (Orange/Blue and Yellow/Green) as each route can run every 12 minutes; {{in the case of the}} Red Line, every other train bound for Glenmont terminates at Silver Spring instead. Night and weekend service varies between 8 and 24 minutes, with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{has many}} counterintuitive and experimentally verified implications. These include the equivalence of mass and energy , length contraction (moving objects shorten), and time dilation (moving clocks <b>run</b> <b>more</b> slowly). The factorγ by which lengths contract and times dilate {{is known as}} the Lorentz factor and is given by , where v is the speed of the object. The difference of γ from 1 is negligible for speeds much slower thanc, such as most everyday speeds—in which case special relativity is closely approximated by Galilean relativity—but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity as v approaches c. For example, a time dilation factor of γ=2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light (v=.866c). Similarly, a time dilation factor of γ=10 occurs at v=99.5%c.|$|E

5|$|The Duke's train had <b>run</b> <b>more</b> {{slowly through}} {{populated}} areas {{owing to the}} cheering crowds, {{and by the time}} it reached Parkside the first two trains on the northern track, Phoenix and North Star, had already passed through Parkside and had pulled up ahead of the station waiting for the Duke's train to depart. By now, the passengers in the Duke's train had been travelling for almost an hour, and the water stop at Parkside was the only scheduled stop on the journey. Although it was beginning to drizzle, and despite a request from the railway engineers for passengers to remain on the trains, at 11.55am around 50 men disembarked from the Duke's train to stretch their legs. The group consisted of many of the most influential figures of the day, including the Marquess of Stafford, Charles Arbuthnot, Prince Esterházy, the Earl of Wilton, L founder Joseph Sandars and William Huskisson. As the rain had formed deep puddles {{on either side of the}} railway embankment, most of the party remained on or near the railway tracks.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in sunny and hot weather conditions Michael Schumacher clinched the first pole position of the season and the 24th of his career, with a time of 1:20.974 on his second run. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen who set a lap 0.076 seconds slower in the closing seconds of qualifying. Barrichello qualified third, and felt that his car did not feel good having not made any changes. Coulthard secured fourth position, despite losing time early in qualifying because of a fuel pressure problem. He decided against taking his team's spare car set up for Häkkinen because he believed it would take up time and had to <b>run</b> <b>more</b> fuel throughout the remainder of the session. Ralf Schumacher qualified fifth and he was suffering from excessive oversteer which prevented him from setting a quicker lap time but was delighted with his starting position. Villeneuve secured sixth position and said he achieved the best from his car. Both Jordan drivers lined up the fourth row of the grid (with Trulli ahead of Frentzen) and believed they could have a better starting position because of windy conditions. de la Rosa and Irvine rounded out the top ten fastest drivers, with de la Rosa confident of finishing in a higher position in his home country. Later on Saturday afternoon, a fuel sample from de la Rosa's car was analysed and declared illegal by the FIA and Arrows announced that it would appeal the decision, allowing de la Rosa to retain his starting position. Button, eleventh, reported his car felt unstable due to the windy conditions. He was ahead of Verstappen in the slower of the two Arrows, Salo in the faster Sauber, and Fisichella. Herbert, fifteenth, lost his front wing mounted camera after hitting a kerb {{in the early part of}} qualifying and made a minor mistake which prevented him from starting higher up the field. Diniz had excessive oversteer and managed sixteenth place. Ricardo Zonta managed seventeenth after he was unable to find a set-up which suited him and his fastest time was nine-tenths of a second slower than teammate Villeneuve. Alesi qualified eighteenth, ahead of Wurz in nineteenth. Heidfeld had engine problems and had to use the spare Prost monocoque and took 20th position. The two Minardi drivers Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane qualified at the rear of the field in positions 21 and 22.|$|E
