The Bank {{has been active}} in 97% of the villages of Bangladesh. Its success has inspired similar projects in more than 40 countries around the world, including a World Bank initiative to finance Grameen-type schemes.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015 {{spending}} review, {{the government}} also proposed a freeze in the <b>repayment</b> threshold for tuition fee loans at £21,000; a figure which was previously set to rise with average earnings. The changes, if passed, will affect all Plan 2 tuition fee loans, backdated to cover loans taken out from 2012.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. <b>Repayment</b> responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a <b>repayment</b> problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E

5|$|The Mahabharata also records an {{encounter}} between the sage Uttanka and Kalmashapada. After serving his guru Gautama {{for a hundred}} years, Uttanka is allowed to go, but must provide Gautama with Gurudakshina, a traditional <b>repayment</b> for his teacher's services. Gautama's wife Ahalya suggests that he bring her the divine earrings of Madayanti, Kalmashapada's wife, as <b>repayment.</b> Uttanka meets the cannibalistic Kalmashapada, who approaches Uttanka to eat him, but Uttanka stops him and explains that he is duty-bound to get Madayanti's earrings as gurudakshina and that he, Uttanka, will return to Kalmashapada after fulfilling his obligation. Kalmashapada agrees and directs him to his wife, who refuses to part with her earrings until Uttanka brings some token from Kalmashapada as proof of his consent. Upon returning from Kalmashapada with a token, Madayanti gives him the earrings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{productive}} use {{of agricultural}} credit in Pakistan is quite limited {{that affects the}} <b>repayments</b> behavior of the farmers and ultimately categorization of loans into default stages and finally auction of their lands. This paper attempts to analyze different factors affecting the <b>repayments</b> of agricultural credit in district Kasur of Punjab province. For the purpose purposive sampling was adopted and 60 respondents were selected after booting a list of defaulters from respective branches of UBL. Through well structured questionnaires necessary information were collected from the respondents {{as well as from}} the bank employees regarding actual delay in <b>repayments</b> of these selected clients. Finally, data were summarized using descriptive statistics and found that sloppy supervision by the bank employees, miss-utilization of loans, high interest rate and change in business/residential place of the borrowers etc. caused delay in <b>repayments</b> of agricultural credit.

5|$|By a Bangladeshi {{government}} ordinance on 2 October 1983, {{the project}} was authorised and established as an independent bank. Bankers Ron Grzywinski and Mary Houghton of ShoreBank, a community development bank in Chicago, helped Yunus with the official incorporation of the bank under {{a grant from the}} Ford Foundation. The bank's <b>repayment</b> rate suffered from the economic disruption following the 1998 flood in Bangladesh, but it recovered in the subsequent years. By the beginning of 2005, the bank had loaned over USD4.7billion {{and by the end of}} 2008, USD7.6billion to the poor.|$|E
5|$|Debt service {{funds are}} used to account for money {{that will be used}} to pay the {{interest}} and principal of long-term debts. Bonds used by a government to finance major construction projects, to be paid by tax levies over a period of years, require a debt service fund to account for their <b>repayment.</b> The debts of permanent and proprietary funds are serviced within those funds, rather than by a separate debt service fund.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Grameen Bank {{started a}} new program, {{different}} from its traditional group-based lending, exclusively targeted to the beggars in Bangladesh. This program is focused on distributing small loans to beggars. The loans are completely interest-free, the <b>repayment</b> period can be arbitrarily long, and the borrower is covered under life insurance free of cost. For example, a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US$1.50) may pay back only 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, a {{real estate}} {{developer}} dammed an unnamed stream located to the west and south of Sussex Borough and created Lake Neepaulin. The lake was the center of a planned private lakeside residential community. The lake's name is an amalgamation of the names of the original developer's children. In 2014, Wantage Township acquired the lake from the former non-profit management organization and has opened designated public areas to township residents for recreation. In acquiring the property, the municipality assumed responsibility for <b>repayment</b> of a $1.2 million dam restoration loan from the NJDEP.|$|E

Initially, France had desired a revolt against the governor of Salé to force <b>repayment</b> and avoid destruction of the city, but this did not occur. The French demanded that those who killed Christians in the city be sentenced to death, and that thieves have their hands cut off; however, the governor of Salé simply banished these people from the city.|$|E

In supporting the French Revolution in this way, the American government, urged especially by Ambassador Gouverneur Morris, was fulfilling its ten-year-old debt to France. Friendly relations between the United States and France did not long survive the Jay Treaty which came into effect in 1796; by 1798 the two nations would be engaged in the Quasi War.|$|E

In high school, White drove a red 1988 Ford Mustang GT, a gift from Michael Jackson. Despite the fame and donations, Ryan White stated that he disliked the public spotlight, loathed remarks that seemingly blamed his mother or his upbringing for his illness, and emphasized that he would be willing at any moment to trade his fame for freedom from the disease.|$|E

50|$|It is speculated that, because borrowers’ {{applications}} are stress-tested {{on the strength}} of their ability to make the monthly <b>repayments,</b> increasing numbers of borrowers are opting for mortgage terms exceeding the traditional 25 years. This results in lower <b>repayments</b> but a higher overall interest bill, as well as a longer period servicing debt.|$|R
50|$|Since 1998, <b>repayments</b> {{have been}} {{collected}} by HMRC via the tax system, and are calculated based on the borrower's current level of income. If the borrower's income is below a certain threshold (£15,000 per tax year for 2011/2012, £21,000 per tax year for 2012/2013), no <b>repayments</b> are required, though interest continues to accumulate.|$|R
5|$|In 1823 {{another major}} art {{collection}} {{came on the}} market, which had been assembled by the recently deceased John Julius Angerstein. Angerstein was a Russian-born émigré banker based in London; his collection numbered 38 paintings, including works by Raphael and Hogarth's Marriage à-la-mode series. On 1 July 1823 George Agar Ellis, a Whig politician, proposed to the House of Commons that it purchase the collection. The appeal was given added impetus by Beaumont's offer, which came with two conditions: that the government buy Angerstein's collection, and that a suitable building was to be found. The unexpected <b>repayment</b> of a war debt by Austria finally moved the government to buy Angerstein's collection, for £57,000.|$|E

At a hearing on March 11, 2014, Shelbourne announced that it had reached agreement on a <b>repayment</b> plan with the project's creditors, including Related Midwest, which had bought up much of the project's debt.
