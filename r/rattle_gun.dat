60|$|Buster Jack's eyes dilated. He gasped huskily. He {{pulled his}} gun, but {{actually}} {{did not have}} strength or courage enough to raise it. His arm shook so that the <b>gun</b> <b>rattled</b> against his chaps.|$|R
50|$|A common rookie's urge was {{to start}} {{blasting}} away upon sighting his first enemy machine. Shots taken at ranges of 1000 m stood little chance of hitting their mark. The <b>rattle</b> of machine <b>gun</b> fire would alert the intended target and gave them time to react.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're at it," [...] he remarked, wagging his head. [...] "The Germans are at Nieuport, now, {{and some}} of them are over against Pervyse. I hear sounds from Dixmude, too; the <b>rattle</b> of machine <b>guns.</b> It will be a grand battle, this! I wonder if our Albert is there." ...|$|R
60|$|Craddock {{could not}} have asked for {{anything}} better; so early next morning, with a small party armed to the teeth, he set off {{under the guidance of}} the Carib. All day they struggled through brushwood and clambered over rocks, pushing their way further and further into the desolate heart of the island. Here and there they found traces of the hunters, the bones of a slain ox, or the marks of feet in a morass, and once, towards evening, it seemed to some of them that they heard the distant <b>rattle</b> of <b>guns.</b>|$|R
60|$|The whole force then {{advanced}} to the attack with great resolution. Desperately the Highlanders defended the town, again and again the Imperialists were repulsed from the slight rampart, and when at last they won {{their way into the}} place by dint of numbers, every street, lane, alley, and house was defended to the last. Malcolm was almost bewildered at the din, the incessant roll of musketry, the hoarse shouts of the contending troops, the <b>rattling</b> of the <b>guns,</b> and the shrieks of pain.|$|R
25|$|An {{additional}} hearing {{took place}} on 1 July, {{at the insistence of}} Joseph Marichal, who was threatening to sue Cunard for their poor handling of the disaster. He testified that the second explosion had sounded to him like the <b>rattling</b> of machine <b>gun</b> fire and appeared to be below the second class dining room {{at the rear of the}} ship where he had been seated. Information about Marechal's background was sought out by the British government and leaked to the press so as to discredit him.|$|R
60|$|Coming soon to that outer {{fringe of}} bushes, beyond {{which there was}} no cover, they dropped on hands and knees and went forward in that manner until they reached a spot whence {{a good view of the}} buffalo could be obtained. The black eyes of the two Indians glittered, and the red of their bronzed faces deepened with emotion as they gazed. And truly it was a sight well {{calculated}} to stir to the very centre men whose chief business of life was the chase, and whose principal duty was to procure food for their women and children, for the whole plain away to the horizon was dotted with groups of those monarchs of the western prairies. They were grazing quietly, as though such things as the <b>rattle</b> of <b>guns,</b> the whiz of arrows, the thunder of horse-hoofs, and the yells of savages had never sounded in their ears.|$|R
50|$|The {{machine guns}} {{available}} for aircraft during the First World War were not highly accurate at longer ranges. Add {{to that the}} difficulty of aiming from a moving, bouncing gun platform at a fast moving target, {{and it is a}} marvel that anyone ever hit anything. Boelcke preferred to fly to within 100 m or less before firing, to ensure hitting what he aimed at with his opening burst. Once the <b>rattle</b> of his <b>guns</b> was heard, the advantage of surprise was gone, so it was best to make that first shot most effective.|$|R
5000|$|A royal {{proclamation}} {{issued by}} King George III in 1763 made {{it illegal to}} procure pelts from Cherokee lands without a trading license, which essentially barred hunting west of the Appalachian range. Both the Cherokee and the British, however, had considerable difficulty enforcing this ban. In 1769, Cherokee Chief Oconastota complained to the British Superintendent of Indian Affairs that the entire Cherokee Nation was [...] "filling with Hunters, and the <b>guns</b> <b>rattling</b> every way on the path." [...] While some long hunters had their pelts confiscated by the Cherokee, and a rare few were even killed, most managed to avoid detection.|$|R
5000|$|On 29 February, the III Corps and the Eritrean Corps linked {{up about}} three miles west of Abbi Addi and the trap was completed. Even so, {{a large portion of}} both armies managed to escape Badoglio's dragnet. However, the men of the Ethiopian armies were {{demoralized}} and their fighting days were over. The Ethiopians wanted {{to get away from the}} region, the high explosive bombs, the <b>rattle</b> of machine <b>gun</b> fire, and the deadly mustard gas. By the time Ras Kassa and Ras Seyoum reached Haile Sellassie's headquarters at Quorom two weeks later, they were accompanied by little more than the men of their personal bodyguards. [...] Both were present with the Emperor during the upcoming Battle of Maychew.|$|R
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} the English as I do," [...] said the Mugger. [...] "There was a white-face here when the bridge was built, and he would take a boat in the evenings and shuffle with his feet on the bottom-boards, and whisper: 'Is he here? Is he there? Bring me my gun.' I could hear him before I could see him--each sound that he made--creaking and puffing and <b>rattling</b> his <b>gun,</b> up and down the river. As surely as I had picked up one of his workmen, and thus saved great expense in wood for the burning, so surely would he come down to the Ghaut, and shout in a loud voice that he would hunt me, and rid the river of me--the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut! ME! Children, I have swum under the bottom of his boat for hour after hour, and heard him fire his gun at logs; and when I was well sure he was wearied, I have risen by his side and snapped my jaws in his face. When the bridge was {{finished}} he went away. All the English hunt in that fashion, except when they are hunted." ...|$|R

5000|$|Winged Victory is {{remarkable}} for its depictions of World War I aerial combat."They {{flew over the}} ghastly remains of Villers-Bretonneux which were still being tortured by bursting shells upspurting in columns of smoke and debris that stood solid {{for a second and}} then floated fading away in the wind. All along the line from Hamel to Hangard Wood the whiter puff-balls of shrapnel were appearing and fading multitudinously and incessantly ... A flaming meteor fell out of a cloud close by them and plunged earthwards. It was an aeroplane going down in flames from some fight above the clouds. Where it fell the atmosphere was stained by a thanatognomonic black streak ... Tom sitting there in the noise and the hard wind had the citied massy earth his servant tumbler, waiting upon his touch of stick or rudder for its guidance; instantly responding, ready to leap and frisk a lamb-planet amid the steady sun-bound sheep ... Some of the cloud peaks thrust up to ten thousand feet; in the blue fields beyond there was an occasional flash of a tilting wing reflecting the sun. Mac climbed as fast as he could. In a few minutes they were at ten thousand, and the Huns, a mile above them, were discernable as aeroplanes, bluely translucent ... <b>Rattle</b> of <b>guns</b> and flash of tracers and the Fokker in a vertical turn, red, with extension on the top planes. Tom hated those extensions. He was doing a very splitarse turn for a Hun, but tracers seemed to be finding him. Got him, oh got him: over, flopping over, nose dropping, spinning." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Forty {{minutes after}} the attack on Dale and Pork Chop Hill, tremendously heavy {{artillery}} and mortar fire fell on Old Baldy. The earth shook as if in an earthquake accompanied by flashing and deafening explosions all around B Company's position. The fleeting silhouettes of men, weapons and weakened fortifications seemed ghosts within the enemy bursts. Cries of anguish and agony mingled with our own and enemy machine <b>gun</b> <b>rattle.</b> The battle raged at every moment. We could hear at a short distance the firing of 60 and 82 mm. mortars from the enemy. Communications were lost, no one answered, not even the squadron commanders. Suddenly, I was reported {{the death of my}} platoon Sergeant replacement, Azael Salazar Osorio, then the commander of the third squad, Corporal Jose Narvaez Moncayo, who had been severed by the waist and shouted near death, to be lifted by the feet to relieve his suffering. Nothing could be done for him. At my battle station the death of Corporal Ernesto Gonzalez Varela, commander of the second squadron, was atrocious. We were almost touching elbows. He fired his machine gun on an onslaught of Chinese who came upon us when a bazooka shell hit him on the face, leaving his head tangling on his back. I thought I was living a nightmare or horror movie until new explosions on my bunker brought me back to reality. I encouraged my men and I continued to communicate with machine guns and gave instructions for a corporal to take out the flamethrower and prepare himself to shoot the enemy when they appeared." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{much for}} the general situation. Let me descend {{for a moment to}} my own trivial adventures since leaving the British front. Of France I hope to say more in the future, and so I will pass at a bound to Padua, where it {{appeared}} that the Austrian front had politely advanced to meet me, for I was wakened betimes in the morning by the dropping of bombs, the <b>rattle</b> of anti-aircraft <b>guns,</b> and the distant rat-tat-tat of a maxim high up in the air. I heard when I came down later that the intruder had been driven away and that little damage had been done. The work of the Austrian aeroplanes is, however, very aggressive behind the Italian lines, for they have the great advantage that a row of fine cities lies at their mercy, while the Italians can do nothing without injuring their own kith and kin across the border. This dropping of explosives on the chance of hitting one soldier among fifty victims seems to me the most monstrous development of the whole war, and the one which should be most sternly repressed in future international legislation--if such a thing as international law still exists. The Italian headquarter town, which I will call Nemini, was a particular victim of these murderous attacks. I speak with some feeling, as not only was the ceiling of my bedroom shattered some days before my arrival, but a greasy patch with some black shreds upon it was still visible above my window which represented part of the remains of an unfortunate workman, who had been blown to pieces immediately in front of the house. The air defence is very skilfully managed however, and the Italians have the matter well in hand.|$|R

There was auld Ravenswood brandishing his Andrew Ferrara at the head, and crying to us to come and buckle to, as if we had been gaun to a fair; there was Caleb Balderstone, that is living yet, flourishing in the rear, and swearing Gog and Magog, he would put steel through the gus of ony man that turned bridle; there was young Allan Ravenswood, that was then Master, wi' a bended pistol in his hand--it was a mercy it gaed na aff!--crying to me, that had scarce as much wind left as serve the necessary purpose of my ain lungs, 'Sound, you poltroon!--sound, you damned cowardly villain, or I will blow your brains out!' and, to be sure, I blew sic points of war that the scraugh of a clockin-hen was music to them." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “We {{roll over}} the wall and find {{ourselves}} {{in the range of}} two enemy strongpoints. But for the moment, the krauts are ignoring us. They are absorbed in trying to split the two groups of men that preceded us.A sergeant in the first platoon senses the predicament. If his men are isolated, they will likely be destroyed. He makes his decision quickly. Motioning his men to follow, he rises and with a submachine gun charges head-on toward one of the enemy positions two hundred yards away.On the flat, coverless terrain, his body is a perfect target. A blast of automatic fire knocks him down. He springs to his feet with a bleeding shoulder and continues his charge. The <b>guns</b> <b>rattle.</b> Again he goes down.Fascinated, we watch as he gets up for the third time and dashes straight into the enemy fire. The Germans throw everything they have at him. He falls to the earth; and when he again pulls himself to his feet, we see that his right arm is shattered. But wedging his gun under his left armpit, he continues firing and staggers forward. Ten horrified Germans throw down their guns and yell “Kamerad”.That is all I see. But later I learn that the sergeant, ignoring the pleas of his men to get under cover and wait for medical attention, charged the second enemy strongpoint. By sheer guts, he advanced sixty yards before being stopped by a final concentration of enemy fire. He reeled, then tottered forward another few yards before falling.Inspired by his valor and half-insane with rage, his men took over, stormed the kraut emplacement, and captured it. When they returned to their leader, he was dead.This was how Lutsky, the sergeant, helped buy the freedom that we cherish and abuse.” ...|$|R
