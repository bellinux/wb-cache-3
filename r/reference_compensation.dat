Then the system {{voltage can be}} transformed into dq coordinate. After that, the system voltage will be transformed to DC component on d axis. Then, D can be calculated in real-time property [18].

40|$|M. Ing. This study {{investigates the}} limits to which {{distortion}} can be compensated in electrical distribution networks. Many factors hinder the "ideal" compensation of the line current to a perfect sinusoidal, in phase, scaled replica of the supply voltage. The different power theories {{that can be used}} to derive the <b>reference</b> <b>compensation</b> current, is one of the fundamental limits. The differences and correspondences between the FBD and Czarnecki theories are investigated in detail. Furthermore, it is shown by simulation and practical results, that the effectivity of compensation by the instantaneous power theory is load dependent. The compensation strategy and topology also impose limits on the effectivity of compensation. The position and strategy of a compensator determine whether the consumer is able to isolate his distortion from the rest of the network, or isolate himself from the distortion of other consumers. Distortion frequencies and system impedances are chosen specifically to visually show the effect of the different topologies and strategies, by means of simulation. One of the most important limits brought about by new technology, is the lagging of the <b>reference</b> <b>compensation</b> current, due to the use of signal processing in determining the reference signals. The effect of this lagging reference is clearly shown by means of simulation and practical compensation systems. An effectivity index for this phenomenon is defined for steady state systems. The dynamic limitations of this lagging <b>reference</b> <b>compensation</b> current is investigated thoroughly. A method is derived by which the maximum fault, due to the sampling time and signal processing time, can be calculated when a high f-region occurs in the line current. The dynamic response of the compensation system is also limited by the ' di-ability of the converter. Therefore, a method is developed to calculate the individual fault contribution of the lagging reference as well as the converter. This method enables designers to determine the parameters of the signal processing system and the converter in the planning phase. The use of a maximum sampling frequency is stressed. In the experimental work, a 10 kVA, PWM-switched IGBT inverter is used as a parallel voltage fed compensator. It compensates for two non-linear loads : a three phase diode rectifier with an inductive load, and a three phase diode rectifier with a capacitive load. The practical compensation according to the instantaneous power theory of these two loads, confirms that the result of this compensation is load dependent. The effect of the lagging <b>reference</b> <b>compensation</b> current in a practical system is also shown...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Harmonics in systems are conventionally suppressed using passive tuned filters, which have practical limitations {{in terms of the}} overall cost, size and performance, and these are particularly unsatisfactory when large number of harmonics are involved Active power filtering is an alternative approach in which the filter injects suitable compensation currents to cancel the harmonic currents, usually through the use of power electronic converters. This type of filter does not exhibit the drawbacks normally associated with its passive counterpart, and a large number of harmonics can be compensated by a single unit without incurring additional cost or performance degradation. This thesis investigates an active power filter configuration incorporating instantaneous reactive power theory to calculate the compensation currents. Since the original equations for determining the <b>reference</b> <b>compensation</b> currents are defined in two imaginary phases, considerable computation time is necessary to transform them from the real three-phase values. The novel approach described in the thesis minimises the required computation time by calculating the equations directly in terms of the phase values i. e. three-phase currents and voltages. Furthermore, by utilising a sufficiently fast digital signal processor (DSP) to perform the calculation, real-time compensation can be achieved with greater accuracy. The results obtained show that the proposed approach leads to further harmonic suppression in both the current and voltage waveforms compared to the original approach, due to considerable reduction in the computation time of the <b>reference</b> <b>compensation</b> currents...|$|E

Shunt active power filters (SAPFs) are a well-known solution {{that can be}} employed to enhance electrical PQ by injecting a compensation current {{at the point of}} common coupling (PCC) of the SAPF, the load, and the electrical grid. Hence, SAPF controllers must determine the instantaneous values of the <b>compensation</b> <b>reference</b> current, including nondesirable components of the load current.
