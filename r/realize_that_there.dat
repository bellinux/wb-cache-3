Mulder ultimately agrees {{that it would be}} too dangerous to visit her. Instead, they head towards Canada, where Smith says Mulder will find his sister, Samantha. Meanwhile, the First Elder (Don S. Williams) meets with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in Teena's hospital room, confronting him with photos of his prior meeting with her, taken by X (Steven Williams). They <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a leak, and plan to smoke out its source by releasing false information about Teena being in danger.|$|E
5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is an element of shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E

Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is an element of shared attention. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object. Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant. Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face. If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E

Mulder believes that Max was abducted from the plane and that his body will not be found. Meanwhile, Scott Garrett, a Man in Black posing as an NTSB investigator, steals the zip gun from the assassin's body and erases his face and fingerprints with acid. Larold Rehbun, a passenger who sat next to Max, is found alive. His injuries indicate exposure to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a {{price to be paid}} for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E
5|$|The rate {{of growth}} of the Antarctic scallop is very slow {{compared}} to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known about the development of the veliger larvae but they may be planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb dissolved organic matter and consume bacterioplankton. When they settle, metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with byssus threads, often attaching these to the upper valves of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and growth rates of adults, researchers came to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived.|$|E

5|$|Events at Ulm {{were now}} {{reaching}} a conclusion. On 15 October Ney's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments {{and on the}} 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack began to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was little hope of rescue. On 17 October Napoleon's emissary, Ségur, signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date. Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and Neresheim and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. Fifteen hundred troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, {{but the vast majority}} of the Austrian force marched out on 21 October and laid down their arms without incident, all with the Grande Armée drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation (see infobox picture). The officers were permitted to leave, pending their signatures on a parole in which they agreed not to take up arms against France until they were exchanged. More than ten general officers were included in this agreement, including Mack, Johann von Klenau, Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, Prince Liechtenstein, and Ignaz Gyulai.|$|E

25|$|As Lovell {{designed}} mausoleums, {{he came to}} <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were {{fundamental problems}} facing above-ground burial. It had been common for centuries for above-ground burial vaults to be tightly sealed, to prevent the leakage of fluids {{and the spread of}} nauseating odors (both generated by the decomposition of the human body) from vaults. Tightly sealed vaults, however, allowed decomposition gases to build up, causing vaults to violently rupture ("exploding vault syndrome") and scatter partly-decomposed remains inside the mausoleum. Lovell designed a solution, which involved building a ventilation system and drainage system behind the vaults. He applied for a patent, which was granted on October 23, 1917 (patent number 1,244,109).|$|E

25|$|Commodity ETFs trade {{just like}} shares, are simple and {{efficient}} and provide exposure to an ever-increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, softs and agriculture. However, {{it is important}} for an investor to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are often other factors that affect the price of a commodity ETF that might not be immediately apparent. For example, buyers of an oil ETF such as USO might think that as long as oil goes up, they will profit roughly linearly. What isn't clear to the novice investor is the method by which these funds gain exposure to their underlying commodities. In the case of many commodity funds, they simply roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This does give exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the term structure, such as a high cost to roll.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason that}} the Zariski {{topology}} does not work well {{is that it is}} too coarse: it has too few open sets. There seems to be no good way to fix this by using a finer topology on a general algebraic variety. Grothendieck's key insight was to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no reason why the more general open sets should be subsets of the algebraic variety: the definition of a sheaf works perfectly well for any category, not just the category of open subsets of a space. He defined étale cohomology by replacing the category of open subsets of a space by the category of étale mappings to a space: roughly speaking, these {{can be thought of as}} open subsets of finite unbranched covers of the space. These turn out (after a lot of work) to give just enough extra open sets that one can get reasonable cohomology groups for some constant coefficients, in particular for coefficients Z/nZ when n is coprime to the characteristic of the field one is working over.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{vocational}} education in Singapore carried a negative stigma and was {{looked down upon}} as a dead-end option for underachieving students. In the 1960s, it was considered less than socially desirable educational option as {{vocational education}} was perceived that these schools were for low achieving students. Societal prejudice against less academically inclined students and vocational educational was regarded low quality and typically {{out of step with}} the changing needs of employers. The perception of technical and vocational education in Singapore are slowly changing as parents are starting to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are alternative choices for decent employment outcomes as the greater Singaporean society values vocational and technical skills highly and sees them as crucial to the country’s economic development. Vocational education has been an important part of Singapore’s unique economic planning since 1992, where it began to transform and change the perception of vocational education and decided to transform and preposition it so that it was not seen as a place of last resort for underachieving pupils. Vocational schools such as the Institute of Technical Education were intended to revolutionize vocational education and portray the institution as a world-class example of the importance of vocational skills being translated to a 21st-century knowledge-based economy. Since 1995, enrollment in vocational schools has doubled, now making up 65% of the cohort who go on to post-secondary education (ages 16–18), with 25% accepted into the ITE and another 40% attending polytechnic universities.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the shooting, Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of {{political}} rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship. On the eve of the shooting, Giffords had written to a Republican friend, Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky, saying, [...] "we need {{to figure out how to}} tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." [...] In March 2010, Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats, including Giffords's, in Arizona's 8th district. Shortly after the map's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month, Giffords said, [...] "We're in Sarah Palin's 'targeted' list, but the thing is that the way she has it depicted, we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they've got to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are consequences to that action." [...] At that point in the interview, however, the interviewer said, [...] "campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years." [...] The image was removed from Palin's [...] "takebackthe20" [...] website following the January shootings. Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a [...] "blood libel" [...] to blame her and the right wing for the attacks.|$|E

500|$|By mid-2000s, the Ballymun towers were in {{the process}} of being torn down, and the Ballymun area was the target of a €1.8billion {{regeneration}} scheme intended to create a self-sustaining community of 30,000 people that would be more successful than the original 1960s plan. [...] Despite their failure as housing, the towers had left a long cultural legacy, of which [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] was the first and perhaps best-known exemplar; the link between the towers and the song was mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin. [...] Former towers residents were not always happy with the song. [...] Lynn Connolly, whose 2006 memoir The Mun: Growing Up in Ballymun detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s, readily acknowledged the problems there and also wanted to get out at the time. [...] But she later came to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media. [...] She thus wrote, [...] "regardless of what U2 say in their song, 'Running to Stand Still', there was certainly more than one way out." [...] In a newspaper interview, Connolly suggested that the song might have had a deleterious effect: [...] "It doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture an unemployed person, living alone in a flat in Ballymun, listening to that song and agreeing with what their hero was saying." [...] She further noted that some websites erroneously state that Bono grew up in Ballymun itself, and said, [...] "Perhaps it gave him a sort of street-cred to associate himself with the estate he could see from his bedroom window in nice, safe, respectable Cedarwood Road in Glasnevin." ...|$|E
500|$|Series writer Brian Peterson {{discusses}} how {{the writing}} staff chose {{to develop the}} character: [...] "In the Smallville pilot, Al and Miles established Lex and Clark as best friends, which is, to me, {{one of the best}} aspects of the show. So when you're introducing his future love interest, why not introduce her, not as an enemy, but as the one who is constantly going to butt heads with him, where they're not gonna like each other at all at first? I think that because we chose such a different take on her, it wasn't that intimidating. She could grow into the person that everybody sees on-screen later." [...] For season six, the writers chose to start Lois down the path of investigative journalism, only in this version of the character she gets her start working for a tabloid newspaper. Writer Kelly Souders felt that if tabloid beginnings were good enough for Perry White—an additional character established in season three's [...] "Perry"—then they are good enough for Lois Lane. It adds depth to the character by showing how she struggled before becoming [...] "the reporter we all know and love". As Lois steps closer to her ultimate destiny at the Daily Planet, the writers have continued to evolve the character by having her grow out of the [...] "black and white" [...] mindset and have her begin seeing shades of gray. The writers wanted the character to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is sometimes a middle road that has to be taken. In season eight, Durance sees Clark taking a job at the Daily Planet as a chance for her character to [...] "step it up and be more involved". In this case, Lois is acting more mature, taking charge in being a mentor to Clark as he transitions into his new job. Durance describes the eighth season as a lesson in duality, with Clark realizing that he has to be two different people if he wants to have a life and save the day; Durance believes that the same applies to Lois. As Durance explains, [...] " [...] got her confidence as a journalist and on the inside, she's going oh my god I'm truly in love with , more in love than I've ever been with anyone." ...|$|E
