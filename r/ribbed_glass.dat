Still, when the black major-domo set out the comida and Miss Castro withdrew, the visitor might have lounged less complacently on the veranda had he seen her kneeling, with a face that was stamped with hatred, beside the factory medicine chest. She lifted a <b>ribbed</b> <b>glass</b> phial, and glanced at it earnestly, then let it fall back, took out another, and clutched at the chest, when she saw that the door had opened a little. Then, as the rustle of the palm-fronds suggested that the breeze was accountable for this, she slipped the bottle behind a vase on the window-sill, and went out softly. Hardly had she done so than the Señora Diaz entered silently, lifted the bottle, and read its label, and then, with a gesture which expressed both relief and perplexity, replaced it. The señora was much more observant than she seemed to be, and was by no means a friend of Victor Rideau.|$|E

50|$|Colours, {{techniques}} and materials vary {{depending upon the}} look a glassmaker is trying to achieve. Aquamarine is created {{through the use of}} copper and cobalt compounds, whereas ruby red uses a gold solution as a colouring agent. Murrine technique begins with the layering of coloured liquid glass, which is then stretched into long rods called canes (caneworking) different color canes are then arranged in a mold to form a design. Then they are heated to fusing temperatures and when fused then pulled (stretched) again like Taffy to reduce diameters. Then when cold, these canes are then sliced in cross-section, which show a layered pattern. The better-known term millefiori is a way of using lots of sliced murrine that being picked up from the marver by a gather of hot molten glass. When the amalgam of this type of murrine shows the likeness of many flowers, thus mille (thousand) fiori (flowers).

50|$|According to Geist, the Milan {{gallery and}} the roof were {{unprecedented}} in dimensions by previously built shopping arcades. Another difference with already existing passages, was the monumental {{character of the}} roof at Milan. Jodice, for example, appreciated the monumental spatial effect of the dome. In comparison to earlier emblematic arcades, such as Galerie d'Orléans (1828-1829) and Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert (1845-1847), the Milan arcade was also special {{because of the large}} spans of the vaults and the ethereal effect of the entire glass canopy. The construction of the whole Gallery was the result of international collaboration. This especially concerned the roof: the ironwork was produced, transported and installed by the French Atelier Henry Joret. The glass plates were made of flat <b>ribbed</b> <b>glass</b> by Saint-Gobain. The construction technology of the roof employs primary wrought-iron arches in order to support the glazing. By contrast, arcades that were built earlier were smaller and had simpler roofs: the same components were used for both load bearing and glazing purposes. In addition, the roof at Milan was equipped with invisible reinforcements in the supporting walls. This complicated roof is discussed as the unity of four systems that were skillfully combined through characteristic construction details. This construction technology was creative for avoiding visible tie-rods in the spans of the vaults and the dome, for a special effect of the glass plates and for the glazing bars.|$|E

The first and third semiprivate rooms each had two pairs of chairs and a couch that could accommodate three people, while the second contained two of the three-person couches instead. Under the stairway of the dome, the car contained various supplies and necessities, including a water cooler, a coat locker, and a jump seat for the porter.

40|$|For Channel Tunnel {{trains to}} run inBritain, major {{improvements}} to ourdomestic rail infrastructure have been undertaken, both before the Tunnel opened in 1994 and since. Some have proved white elephants, but most will have value even if Eurostars confine themselves to Channel Tunnel Rail Link {{at the end}} of 2007. With a high-speed line ruled out when the tunnel was promoted, British Rail had to graft a rapid service of highly sophisticated trains onto a network dependent in places on Victorian technology and overloaded at peak periods. And preparing the routes to the tunnel and providing station, freight and depot facilities for longer, faster, bulkier and heavier trains cost £ 1. 7 billion. The highest-profile project was the £ 130 million Waterloo International terminal. The choice of Waterloo stemmed from a belief that none of the alternatives — including Victoria, Bricklayers ' Arms, King's Cross (then thought too congested) and White City — could handle the predicted traffic [1]. A central position, excellent Tube connections and bearable approaches by road gave Waterloo the edge. Five terminal platforms numbered 20 - 24 were squeezed into a twisting three-hectare site on the north-west of the station, created by eliminating four platforms (18 - 21, two of them replaced by converting the taxi road) and several carriage sidings. Into this space were inserted three 400 -metre platforms, two of them islands, with a three-level concourse beneath a spectacular one-hectare <b>ribbed</b> <b>glass</b> and steel roof. Waterloo underground station gained a new escalator to the Eurostar concourse from the booking hall, and new tunnels linking the Bakerloo, Northern and Waterloo and City platforms.

For seventeen months before services began, it was hired out for parties and concerts — and may be again once Eurostar moves out: so far the terminal is earmarked only for Reading line trains while Waterloo is reconstructed, and How Britain’s railway infrastructure has gained from the Channel Tunne...|$|E

40|$|Accelerated bridge {{construction}} techniques allow for bridges to be constructed or replaced more quickly {{in order to}} save commuter time and money. One of these techniques involved the use of prefabricated bridge deck panels, which are connected to each other by high strength closure strips. This thesis report investigates the performance of a closure strip filled with ultra-high performance concrete under fatigue loads at service levels as well as at failure loads. Four nearly full-scale (150 mm deep) bridge deck specimens were constructed, each consisting of two panels connected by a UHPC filled closure strip. Two of the specimens were reinforced with <b>ribbed</b> <b>glass</b> fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcing bars and the remaining two were reinforced with sand-coated GFRP bars. One specimen fabricated with each bar type was loaded under fatigue (cyclic) loading equivalent to the maximum wheel load specified in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code for 2, 000, 000 cycles at three locations: the centre of a precast concrete panel, the centre of the closure strip, and adjacent to the closure strip. The remaining specimen of each bar type was only fatigue tested adjacent to the closure strip at the same load level for 2, 000, 000 cycles. The slabs were then loaded monotonically to failure. It was found that the specimens generally exhibited noticeably increased deflections during initial fatigue loading followed by a more gradual deflection increase {{for the remainder of the}} fatigue loading. The slabs reinforced with the ribbed GFRP bars were found to exhibit significantly larger deflections than the sand-coated bars. The slab with ribbed bars, which was intended to undergo fatigue loading at three locations, experienced failure of the bottom bars during testing at the second fatigue location. Similarly, the specimen with ribbed bars only loaded adjacent to the closure strip also did not complete the planned 2, 000, 000 cycles due to premature failure of the bottom transverse reinforcement. When loaded to failure adjacent to the closure strip, both of the specimens reinforced with the sand-coated GFRP bars experienced a punching shear failure. The punching shear failure surface typically has a cone or pyramidal shape. However, the punching cone for both specimens was truncated by the UHPC closure strip, resulting in a three sided failure cone, with slip occurring along the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPC. The specimens reinforced with ribbed bars were also loaded to failure. However, these specimens failed due to the top fibre of the concrete crushing along the length of the slab due to the lack of bottom reinforcement continuity resulting from the rebar failures during fatigue loading. Finite element models were generated in ABAQUS to provide an understanding of the general stress patterns experienced throughout the slab. The initial load comparison (model vs. measured) yielded similar results, with the model showing slightly more initial stiffness, but cracking at approximately the same load. In addition, the failure loads were compared to two building and bridge code specifications: CSA S 6 and CSA A 23. 3, and it was found that the punching shear failure for the two sand-coated GFRP reinforced specimens was less than the specified values for each of these design codes due to the punching failure occurring on only three sides of the load instead of the four sides assumed by the codes. In conclusion, the specimens with sand-coated reinforcement maintained stiffness throughout fatigue loading and failed in a three-plane punching shear mode, and the specimens with ribbed reinforcement failed during fatigue loading when the bottom transverse reinforcement broke, resulting in significant deflections and pre-empting failure by punching shear...|$|E

The second part is now dedicated to the execution of advanced numerical simulations, including parametric studies, for assisting on the optimization of this composite slab system and investigating the influence of the relevant characteristics of GFRP and DHCC components. The influence of considering isotropic or orthotropic behavior for the GFRP components and linear or nonlinear behavior for the DHCC are also investigated numerically in terms of accomplishing serviceability and ultimate limit state requisites for this structural system. The parametric studies show that the thickness of GFRP rib is the most important parameter to increase the load carrying capacity of this type of slabs. Based on the results of these parametric studies, two slabs are built and tested experimentally, and the obtained results are not only used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed structural system, but also to appraise the predictive performance of the constitutive models adopted in the FEM-based simulations.

These large collecting areas could be obtained with a mirror assembly composed {{of a large number of}} high quality glass segments each being able to deliver the required angular resolution better or equal to 5 arcsec. These segments will form a X-Ray Optical Unit (XOU), an optical subunit of the telescope, and the XOUs will be assembled to form the whole mirror system.

40|$|For {{the first}} time {{embossing}} of ribs, from 1 to 10 μm wide and ∼ 10 mm long, {{has been carried out}} in chalcogenide glass layers sputtered onto semiconductor wafer substrates, with potential to act as monomode waveguides; these features have been similarly embossed in the surface of bulk chalcogenide glasses. The embossing shows very good replication of the GaAs mould patterning to 1 μm definition, with evidence also for sub-micron replication. For the embossing, thin coatings of the chalcogenide glasses were sputtered onto wafer substrates as follows: (i) a 6 μm layer of Ge 17 As 18 Se 65 (at. %) onto porous Si-on-Si wafer substrates and (ii) a 4 μm layer of Ge 15 As 15 Se 17 Te 53 onto uncoated GaAs substrates. The Ge 17 As 18 Se 65 sputtered glass layer on porous Si-on-Si was demonstrated to slab waveguide at 1. 55 μm wavelength; it was designed to achieve monomode waveguiding at 1. 55 μm after embossing, for the 5 μm wide rib. The series of ribs, 1 – 10 μm wide, were successfully embossed in the Ge 17 As 18 Se 65 glass sputtered layer on porous Si-on-Si, but cracking of the glass layer occurred during the embossing process.

Examensarbetet innefattade utformningen och konstruktionen av maskinkåpan för det trebladiga verket. Målet med projektet var att ta fram ett tillverkningsunderlag för motorhuset bestående av ritningar, 3 D modeller, FEM-analyser samt förslag för {{material}} och tillverkningsmetod. Tillsammans med uppdragsgivarna sattes en kravspecifikation upp för maskinkåpan. Kraven innefattade utformningen, hållfastheten och materialvalet för maskinkåpan. En omsorgsfull informationssökning utfördes för att ge en bra grund till konceptgeneringen. Konceptgenreringen skedde i omgångar och i flera steg. Dels genererades idéer för specifika områden och dels för maskinkåpans totala utformning. Det slutliga konceptet blev en sammanfattning av de valda koncepten för olika områden, konceptet diskuterades och justerades efter åsikter från uppdragsgivarna. Hållfasthetssimuleringar utfördes med hänseende på den last som uppkommer då vinden är riktad rakt mot maskinkåpans ena långsida. Simuleringar utfördes för lastfall med olika vindstyrkor samt olika versioner av maskinkåpan, för att påvisa för- och nackdelar med valt koncept. För att hålla tjockleken på motorhuset nere förstärks kåpan av fyra spant av glasfiberarmering. Nosen och bakdelen sammanfogas med resterande maskinhus med stål och aluminiumbalkar. Sammanfogningen mellan sidoväggarna och över-/underdelen sker med T-balkar i stål. T-balkarna skall även fungera som fästen mot ramverket vilket skall stödja maskinkåpan och bära drivlinan. Den maximala deformationen av maskinkåpan blev 62, 2 mm vid en vindsyrka på 59, 9 m/s, orkan. En deformation som vid det kritiska lastfallet ansågs tillåten då gränsvärdet låg på 70 mm.

The aim of the project was to compile a basis for construction of the nacelle, including drawings, 3 D-models, FEM-analysis as well as proposals of suitable materials and manufacturing methods. Requirements of specifications were listed together with the representatives from GC Windpower. The demands affected the design, strength and material choice. To get a solid ground of knowledge in the start of the project a thorough search for information was performed. Many sessions of generating concepts were hold.

By the late 1960s, {{it was one of}} his best-known designs. In January 1964, Koubek designed what was then the D.C. metropolitan region's tallest office building, the 19-story steel-and-black glass clad Barlow Building (5454 Wisconsin Avenue). In August, the Freed family commissioned him to build the eight-story Chatham Apartments, the first high-rise, medium-income apartment building to be constructed among the two-story Georgian-style townhouses that comprised the 125 acre Buckingham Historic District. His first major D.C. residential structure was a nine-story apartment building (now turned to condominiums) at 1800 R Street NW, which opened in October 1964. In April 1965, construction began on the seven-story 1325 Massachusetts Avenue NW, a Modernist building with broad horizontal swaths of grey brick and glass. (The structure was home to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in 2011.) Another major office building, 1200 17th Street, NW (at the time, the headquarters of the American Psychological Association), opened in October 1965. It was a neo-Brutalist structure featuring repetitive polished concrete panels and deeply recessed rectangular windows, {{and one of the first}} high-rise office buildings on the downtown business district portion of Connecticut Avenue. That same year his 18-story Ross Building (now known as Wytestone Plaza) in Richmond, Virginia, opened—the first high-rise built in the city since 1928, and the first glass-curtain wall building constructed in the city. Koubek was also lead architect for and an investor in a syndicate ("Reservation Eleven Associates") which designed a new United States Department of Labor (DOL) building at 2nd Street NW and Constitution Avenue NW in 1966. The group proposed an arrangement in which it would construct the building, lease it to the federal government for 30 years, and then donate it to the government. Congress, cutting back on construction funds as well as interested in the build/lease/donate proposal, refused to appropriate funds for the DOL structure. Eventually, however, Koubek's syndicate lost the commission, and a new DOL building (jointly designed by the firm of Brooks, Barr, Graeber & White and the firm of Pitts, Mebane, Phelps & White) was completed in 1974.Koubek's D.C. area output slowed in the late 1960s. In February 1967, the Bureau of National Affairs (a privately held publisher of government news) commissioned him to design a six-story Modernist building at 1231 25th Street NW. (This glass-and-white concrete neo-Brutalist building was stripped to its frame in 2007, four floors added, and joined to both an existing and a new structure to create luxury apartments.) In October 1967, construction began on his design for 1401 I Street NW, west of Franklin Square. (The bland glass-and-steel box underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation in 1991. It was given a postmodern facade of finished grey concrete panels and brown granite, the center portion of the building on the south and east sides extended slightly outward to break up the flatness of the building, and twin giant six-story-high non-structural Doric columns topped by a non-structural colonnade and entablature. The building is now called Franklin Tower.) In December 1967, Koubek designed a new home for the Motion Picture Association of America at 1601 I Street NW, described as a [...] "bronze-tinted glass box on stilts enclosed by a bold screen of tan concrete". Another critic later called it [...] "elegant" [...] and as good as the work of I. M. Pei. Construction began in February 1968 on his building for One Dupont Circle NW, an eight-story office building with vertical concrete <b>ribs</b> over <b>glass</b> walls.|$|R
