60|$|At {{the time}} when the work was {{interrupted}} the builders were engaged chiefly on one of the towers, which they had carried up about one hundred and fifty feet. The stones which were used for this tower were very large, and in order to hoist them up the workmen used a monstrous crane, which was reared on the summit of it. This crane was made of timbers rising obliquely from a <b>revolving</b> <b>platform</b> in the centre, and meeting in a point which projected beyond the wall in such a manner that a chain from the end of it, hanging freely, would descend to the ground. The stones which were to go up were then fastened to this chain, and hoisted up by machinery. When they were raised high enough, that is, just above the edge of the wall, the whole crane was turned round upon its platform, in such a manner as to bring the stone in over the wall; and then it was let down into the place which had been prepared to receive it.|$|E

50|$|The French {{design was}} copied by the Royal Navy, who {{continued}} to refine the class over the next century or more, after Huguenot exiles brought designs over to England and the United Provinces. The side-by-side, forward-pointing mortars were replaced in the British designs by mortars mounted on the centerline on <b>revolving</b> <b>platforms.</b> These platforms were supported by strong internal wooden framework to transmit the forces of firing the weapons to the hull. The interstices of the framework were used as storage areas for ammunition.|$|R

5|$|General Admirals {{armament}} {{was made}} and installed in Russia. Her battery deck carried thirty-six 60-pounder muzzle-loading guns and four long 36-pounder chase guns. The upper deck had twenty-four 60-pounder guns and two long 36-pounder chase guns. Two 3-pood shell guns were mounted fore and aft on <b>revolving</b> <b>platforms.</b> In 1862 her armament was revised and two 60-pounder and the two long 36-pounder guns on her upper deck were removed. Four years later, it was rearranged with two 60-pounders moved from her upper deck to the lower deck and two long 36-pounders moved from the lower deck to the upper deck.|$|R

50|$|In 1998, {{the cover}} of Hammacher Schlemmer's 150th-anniversary catalog was graced by The Bertazzon Venetian Carousel, a {{full-sized}} fully functional carousel that sat twenty. Evoking the charm of 18th-century Venice, this carousel offered an Old World design complete with hand-rendered scenes of Venetian landmarks. Its six jumping horses, five rocking horses, and two chariots were all hand painted and the <b>revolving</b> <b>platform</b> is varnished, solid hardwood. Because each carousel was hand-built to order, it required five months for construction.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Navy {{continued}} {{to refine the}} class over the next century or more, after Huguenot exiles brought designs over to England and the United Provinces. The side-by-side, forward-pointing mortars were replaced in the British designs by mortars mounted on the centerline on <b>revolving</b> <b>platforms.</b> These platforms were supported by strong internal wooden framework to transmit the forces of firing the weapons to the hull. The interstices of the framework were used as storage areas for ammunition. Early bomb vessels were rigged as ketches with two masts. They were awkward vessels to handle, in part because bomb ketches typically had the masts stepped farther aft than would have been normal in other vessels of similar rig, {{in order to accommodate}} the mortars forward and provide a clear area for their forwards fire. As a result, by the 1800s British bomb vessels were designed as full rigged ships with three masts, and two mortars, one between each neighboring pair of masts.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} and {{versatile}} weapon used by Auto-Saharan Companies was the Cannone-Mitragliera Breda 20mm mod.35. Following the successful experience made by Italian units operating together with the nationalists in the Spanish civil war, the installation of 20mm Breda machineguns on medium trucks was begun in 1939. The gun-carriage, without its legs, was made fast to the vehicle with a pin. During the war the 20mm Breda machine-guns used different kind of ammunition, initially were available HE air defence and HE piercing ammunitions. At the end of 1942 armor-piercing incendiary ammunition was also in use. The standard Italian anti-tank cannon Ansaldo-Bohler 47/32 was used by Saharan motorized units, mainly mounted on <b>revolving</b> <b>platforms</b> on LANCIA 3 RO lorries but also on AS.37 or AS.42. The 47/32 was able to fire various kind of HE, piercing and piercing-exploding ammunition. Maximum useful range as an anti-tank gun was 700 m, the piercing power at 650 m with 30 degrees impact angle was 40 mm, at 1600 m the piercing power was reduced to only 30 mm. Since {{the beginning of the}} war, due to the progress in tank design, the usefulness as an anti-tank weapon of the 47/32 was very limited, and it proved effective only against light tanks and armoured cars.|$|R
50|$|In 1847, Imgard cut a {{blue spruce}} tree from a woods outside town, had the village {{tinsmith}} construct a star, {{and placed the}} tree in his house, decorating it with paper ornaments, gilded nuts and Kuchen.

50|$|He was {{particularly}} {{known for his}} productions of Wagner. He staged his first production of the Ring at Covent Garden (1973-76, conducted by Colin Davis). The designs by Josef Svoboda centred on a <b>revolving</b> hydraulic <b>platform.</b> In the 1980s he directed a new production for the Deutsche Oper in Berlin (the so-called 'Time Tunnel' Ring). Covent Garden later imported this production to replace a planned production by Yuri Lyubimov, which had been abandoned after Das Rheingold. Sir Bernard Haitink conducted complete cycles of the second Friedrich Ring, in 1992. The production was also staged in Washington and Japan.|$|R
50|$|The former Scenic Revolving Restaurant was renovated and reopened in late 2012 as an eatery.

50|$|L33 {{was armed}} with a primary {{armament}} of four 21 in torpedo tubes in the bow. These were supplied with eight torpedoes in total. Two additional, 18 in tubes were located on the broadside, with a single torpedo apiece. She was also equipped with a 4 in deck gun for use whilst surfaced. The gun was mounted on a <b>revolving</b> <b>platform</b> on the bridge level to increase its range and permit it to engage surfaced enemy submarines beyond torpedo range and in heavier seas. She had a crew of thirty-eight officers and enlisted crew.|$|E
50|$|In 1913, Georges Sagnac {{showed that}} if {{a beam of light}} is split and sent in two {{opposite}} directions around a closed path on a <b>revolving</b> <b>platform</b> with mirrors on its perimeter, and then the beams are recombined, they will exhibit interference effects. From this result Sagnac concluded that light propagates at a speed independent of the speed of the source. The motion of the earth through space had no apparent effect on the speed of the light beam, no matter how the platform was turned. The effect had been observed earlier (by Harress in 1911), but Sagnac was the first to correctly identify the cause.|$|E

50|$|Udny Mort House is a {{category}} B listed {{building in the}} old kirkyard at Udny Green, Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland, built in 1832. It housed corpses until they started to decompose, so their graves would not be desecrated by resurrectionists and body-snatchers digging them up to sell the cadavers to medical colleges for dissection. Bodies were permitted to be stored {{for up to three}} months before burial. The circular mort house was designed with a <b>revolving</b> <b>platform</b> and double doors.
