40|$|AbstractDespite many {{clinical}} {{advances in}} allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the {{one factor that}} is consistently required to apply HCT {{to a wide variety}} of diseases is the successful donation and the safe transport and administration of viable donor cells to the HCT recipient. Since 1987, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) has maintained a registry of volunteer HCT donors for those patients who lack a suitable related donor, facilitated the donor search, and managed the collection and transportation of donor cells to transplant centers for use in increasingly complex therapies. The NMDP has collected data on marrow and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donations as well as additional donations of lymphocytes, whole blood, or platelets. These additional donations are provided for a variety of reasons, including treating post-transplant complications such as graft failure or relapsed disease, supporting immune reconstitution or providing transfusion support. For donor safety, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> central venous catheters for collecting PBSC are monitored. Data have also been collected on rare events that may affect the integrity of the HCT product (e. g., graft clotting or leaks from the transport bag). Quality assurance and review of these donation processes is an essential component of the transplantation approach. Data from the broad NMDP experience further illuminate factors surrounding the donation process and product integrity...|$|R

40|$|The {{criteria}} used {{to judge the}} acceptability of foster parent applications {{and the relationship of}} these criteria to the actual rate of foster parent success are issues of great concern for people working with foster children. The {{purpose of this study is}} to test the predictability of a rating scheme in order to one, make effective use of home-study time and two, minimize unsuccessful placements. Factors important in this analysis are those of agency time and commitment to both client groups involved—potential foster parents and children—as well as the expectations and gratifications of the foster parents. These people are the backbone of a child care agency; in addition, they ahve a great potential in the areas of public relations and recruitment for their agency. Finally, there is the matter of effiency: the agency and applicant time spent on the home-study should be as fruitful as possible in terms of mutual assessment of the services to be provided and of suitability for the job. In relation to these assessments, whom do we accept? Whom do we reject? Why? Two specific areas are explored in this study. First, what are some characteristics of foster parents which might be of predictive value? Second, what procedures might be established to predict foster parent success? To facilitate this analysis, several assumptions are made: one, that preduction is possible in this situation; two, that reliable predictive judgments can be made; three, that predictability of foster parent success would be beneficial to foster parent applicants, to agency planning, and to the children involved; and four, that the predictive data obtained can be used in making decisions about accepting foster parent applicants. The hypothesis of this exploratory study is that: If a high score is attained on the Predictive Instrument, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> failures will be reduced.

Child welfare agencies report inadequate knowledge <b>of</b> specific <b>placement</b> predictors and assessment measures, although research has shown that placement duration is partly a function of successful parent-child match. Using Bowlby 2 ̆ 7 s attachment theory as the theoretical framework, this quantitative study examined the contributions of foster and adoptive parents 2 ̆ 7 own attachment characteristics, the child 2 ̆ 7 s type of special need, and the child 2 ̆ 7 s age at the time <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> in predicting placement duration. A convenience sample of 108 foster and adoptive parents completed three self-report instruments: the Parental Bonding Instrument measuring parental care and protection, the Relationship Scales Questionnaire measuring avoidance and anxiety related to relationships, and a researcher-created demographic questionnaire.

40|$|Optical mapping is an {{integrated}} {{system for the}} analysis of single DNA molecules. It constructs restriction maps (noted as “optical map”) from individual DNA molecules presented on surfaces after they are imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Because restriction digestion and fluorochrome staining are performed after molecules are mounted, resulting restriction fragments retain their order. Maps of fragment sizes and order are constructed by image processing techniques employing integrated fluorescence intensity measurements. Such analysis, in place of molecular length measurements, obviates need for uniformly elongated molecules, but requires samples containing small fluorescent reference molecules for accurate sizing. Although robust in practice, elimination of internal reference molecules would reduce errors and extend single molecule analysis to other platforms. In this paper, we introduce a new approach that does not use reference molecules for direct estimation of restriction fragment sizes, by the exploitation of the quantiles associated with their expected distribution. We show that this approach is comparable to the current reference-based method as evaluated by map alignment techniques in terms of the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> of optical maps to published sequence...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} trans-anal reinforcing sutures in low anterior resection {{using the}} double-stapled anastomosis technique for primary rectal cancers performed {{at a single}} institution. METHODS: The data of patients who received trans-anal reinforcing sutures were {{compared with those of}} patients who did not receive them after low anterior resection. Patients who underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection and the double-stapled anastomosis technique for primary rectal cancer between January 2008 and December 2011 were included in this study. Patients with no anastomosis, a hand-sewn anastomosis, high anterior resection, or preoperative chemoradiation were excluded. The primary outcomes measured were the incidence of postoperative anastomotic complications and placement of a diverting ileostomy. RESULTS: Among 110 patients, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> of a diverting ileostomy was significantly lower in the suture group (SG) compared with the non-suture control group (CG) [SG, n = 6 (12. 8 %); CG, n = 19 (30. 2 %), P = 0. 031]. No significant difference was observed in the rate of anastomotic leakage [SG, n = 3 (6. 4 %); CG, n = 5 (7. 9 %) ].

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} patient {{characteristics and}} characteristics of long-term care facilities that significantly affect the waiting time for transfer from hospital to nursing home. DESIGN: Cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: All patients designated to be transferred from four Winnipeg hospitals between June 1, 1988, and May 31, 1989.

40|$|Background: Confirmation <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> Double lumen endo{{bronchial}} tubes (DLETT) and bronchial blockers (BBs) {{with the}} pediatric fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) {{is the most}} preferred practice worldwide. Most centers possess standard adult FOBs, some, particularly in developing countries might {{not have access to}} the pediatric-sized devices. We have evaluated the role of preintubation airway assessment using the former, measuring the distance from the incisors to the carina and from carina to the left and right upper lobe bronchus in deciding the depth of insertion of the lung isolation device. Methods: The study was a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial consisting of 84 patients (all > 18 years) undergoing thoracic surgery over a 12 -month period. In the study group (n = 38), measurements obtained during FOB with the adult bronchoscope decided the depth of insertion of the lung isolation device. In the control group (n = 46), DLETTs and BBs were placed blindly followed by clinical confirmation by auscultation. Selection of the type and size of the lung isolation device was at the discretion of the anesthesiologist conducting the case. In all cases, pediatric FOB was used to confirm accurate <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> devices. Results: Of 84 patients (DLETT used in 76 patients; BB used in 8 patients), preintubation airway measurements significantly improved the success <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> optimal <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> lung isolation device from 25 % (11 / 44) to 50 % (18 / 36) (P = 0. 04).

We analyzed a sample of 649 cases, covering both kinship and non-kinship foster care. With the help of child welfare staff we analyzed the cases and considered variables in relation to the profiles of the children, their birth families and the foster caregivers, as well as some basic data on processes and outcomes. In general, the results indicate substantial differences with respect to other countries, especially in view of the high levels of stability and permanence of children in foster care. However, non-kinship care is scarcely established (15 %, compared to 85 % for kinship care), and the article analyzes some of the possible reasons for this. Kinship care differs from non-kinship care in many aspects, including some as important as greater rates of family reunification and a lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> disruptions.

I analyze experimental data from NYU Law School’s Innovative Financial Aid Study in which two income-contingent financial aid instruments – loan repayment assistance and tuition subsidies – were assigned by lottery {{to a set of}} applicants. The packages had equivalent monetary value, but the loan repayment assistance required the student to take on a loan that would be paid for by NYU if the student took a public interest law job after graduation, while the tuition subsidy program covered part of the students ’ tuition fee, to be reimbursed by the student if he failed to take a public interest law job at the end of law school. This difference in framing had a large effect on both enrollment and career choices: In two cohorts for whom the lottery results were announced before enrollment, recipients of the tuition assistance package were twice as likely to enroll at NYU if they received the tuition assistance package.
