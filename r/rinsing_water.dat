This requires a degree of microbiological and chemical control {{of the quality of}} the final <b>rinse</b> <b>water.</b> Aim: To report experience gained over five years of testing, reporting and managing the quality of final <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> for endoscopic devices. Methods: Three endoscope reprocessing units, each comprising five endoscope washer-disinfectors (EWDs) supplied by two reverse osmosis (RO) water units, were subjected to weekly monitoring and control of final <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> quality. EWDs were subjected to nightly thermal self-disinfection, and RO units were subjected to periodic sanitization with peracetic acid. Final <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> samples were processed periodically for total viable counts (TVCs), Pseudomonas spp., endotoxins, conductivity, environmental mycobacteria and Legionella spp. Findings: Over the five-year study period (2008 – 2013), no Pseudomonas spp., environmental mycobacteria or Legionella spp. were isolated from endoscopy <b>rinse</b> <b>water.</b> All conductivity readings were below 30 μs/cm. Endotoxin levels fluctuated over the recommended cut-off of 0. 25 EU/mL, with no correlation with TVCs. Trend analysis of TVCs established alert and action limits.

40|$|The brewing {{industry}} is a large consumer of groundwater for brewing, rinsing and cooling purposes. As regulations {{become more and more}} stringent and the cost of water increases, water recycling gains interest. This paper investigates the possibilities of nanofiltration for the treatment of brewery waste water streams in view of recycling. Four different water streams (waste water after biological treatment, bottle <b>rinsing</b> <b>water,</b> <b>rinsing</b> <b>water</b> of the brewing room and <b>rinsing</b> <b>water</b> of the bright beer reservoir) were filtered with four different nanofiltration membranes (UTC- 20, UTC- 60, Desal-HL- 51 and Desal- 5 -DK). The results for the biologically treated waste water were the most promising. For the other streams, rejection of organics was insufficient to obtain the required quality, mainly due to the high concentrations of organics such as ethanol in the feed water. Over the periods considered (3 h) only moderate flux decline (10 - 40 %) was observed for most membranes and feed solutions. For Desal- 5 -DK at high pH, an increase of the flux was observed.

40|$|Recycling of {{the spent}} <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> {{discharged}} from the wet benches commonly used in semiconductor processing is one tactic for responding to the targets for water usage published in the 1997 National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS). Not only does the NTRS list a target that dramatically reduces total water usage/unit area of silicon manufactured by the industry in the future but for the years 2003 and beyond, the NTRS actually touts goals which would have semiconductor manufacturers drawing less water from a regional water supply per unit area of silicon manufactured than the quantity of ultrapure water (UPW) used {{in the production of}} that same silicon. Achieving this latter NTRS target strongly implies more widespread recycling of spent <b>rinse</b> <b>waters</b> at semiconductor manufacturing sites. In spite of the fact that, by most metrics, spent <b>rinse</b> <b>waters</b> are of much higher purity than incoming municipal waters, recycling of these spent <b>rinse</b> <b>waters</b> back into the UPW production plant is not a simple, straightforward task. The rub is that certain of the chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing, and thus potentially present in trace concentrations (or more) in spent <b>rinse</b> <b>waters,</b> are not found in municipal water supplies and are not necessarily removed by the conventional UPW production sequence used by semiconductor manufacturers. Some of these contaminants, unique to spent <b>rinse</b> <b>waters,</b> may actually foul the resins and membranes of the UPW system, posing a threat to UPW production and potentially even causing a shutdown...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{an evaluation}} of a treatment loop designed to upgrade the quality of spent <b>rinse</b> <b>waters</b> discharged from 10 wet benches located in the fab at Sandia's Microelectronics Development Laboratory (MDL). The goal of the treatment loop is to make these waters, presently being discharged to the fab's acid waste neutralization (AWN) station, suitable for recycling as feed water back into the fab's ultrapure water (UPW) plant. The MDL typically operates 2 shifts per day, 5 days per week. Without any treatment, {{the properties of the}} spent <b>rinse</b> <b>waters</b> now being collected {{have been shown to be}} compatible with recycling about 30 % (50 / 168) of the time (weekends primarily, when the fab is idling) which corresponds to about 12 % of the present water discharged from the fab to the AWN. The primary goal of adding a treatment loop is to increase the percentage of recyclable water from these 10 wet benches to near 100 %, increasing the percentage of total recyclable water to near 40 % of the total present fab discharge to the AWN. A second goal is to demonstrate compatibility with recycling this treated spent <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> to the present R/O product water tank, reducing both the present volume of R/O reject water and the present load on the R/O. The approach taken to demonstrate achieving these goals is to compare all the common metrics of water quality for the treated spent <b>rinse</b> <b>waters</b> with those of the present R/O product water. Showing that the treated <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> is equal or superior in quality to the water presently stored in the R/O tank by every metric all the time is assumed to be sufficient argument for proceeding with plans to incorporate recycling of these spent <b>rinse</b> <b>waters</b> back into MDL's R/O tank...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test in a short term {{laboratory}} experiment the accumulation and physiological effects of As in the epiphytic lichen Xanthoria parietina. Arsenic content in treated samples increased progressively with increasing concentration in treatment solutions. Treatment of X. parietina thalli with 0. 1, 1, 10 ppm As solutions caused significant decrease of viability, measured as intensity of respiratory activity, and damages to cell membranes, assessed by increase of electric conductivity of <b>rinsing</b> <b>water</b> and lipid peroxidation products. Soluble proteins content decreased and H(2) O(2) content increased already at the lowest As concentration tested (0. 01 ppm). Photosynthetic efficiency, measured in terms of F(V) /F(M) ratio, decreased significantly only at the highest As concentration (10 ppm). It was concluded that As exposure causes physiological stress both on the mycobiont and the photobiont and that cell membrane damage, expressed in terms of electric conductivity of <b>rinsing</b> <b>water,</b> is the parameter most affected by As treatment.

40|$|To prevent Ebola transmission, {{frequent}} handwashing {{is recommended}} in Ebola Treatment Units and communities. However, {{little is known}} about which handwashing protocol is most efficacious. We evaluated six handwashing protocols (soap and water, alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS), and 0. 05 % sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high-test hypochlorite, and stabilized and non-stabilized sodium hypochlorite solutions) for 1) efficacy of handwashing on the removal and inactivation of non-pathogenic model organisms and, 2) persistence of organisms in <b>rinse</b> <b>water.</b> Model organisms E. coli and bacteriophage Phi 6 were used to evaluate handwashing with and without organic load added to simulate bodily fluids. Hands were inoculated with test organisms, washed, and rinsed using a glove juice method to retrieve remaining organisms. Impact was estimated by comparing the log reduction in organisms after handwashing to the log reduction without handwashing. <b>Rinse</b> <b>water</b> was collected to test for persistence of organisms. Handwashing resulted in a 1. 94 - 3. 01 log reduction in E. coli concentration without, and 2. 18 - 3. 34 with, soil load; and a 2. 44 - 3. 06 log reduction in Phi 6 without, and 2. 71 - 3. 69 with, soil load. HTH performed most consistently well, with significantly greater log reductions than other handwashing protocols in three models. However, the magnitude of handwashing efficacy differences was small, suggesting protocols are similarly efficacious. <b>Rinse</b> <b>water</b> demonstrated a 0. 28 - 4. 77 log reduction in remaining E. coli without, and 0. 21 - 4. 49 with, soil load and a 1. 26 - 2. 02 log reduction in Phi 6 without, and 1. 30 - 2. 20 with, soil load.

The influence of pre-treatment of the adsorbent, flow rate, particle size and initial LAS concentration on the adsorption rate is investigated in a zero length column (ZLC) set-up. The rate determining step is obtained by fitting an adsorption model and an ion exchange model describing intraparticle diffusion to the experimental data. GAC- 1240 is well described with the adsorption model following Fick’s second law. The effective diffusion coefficient of GAC- 1240 is 1. 3 × 10 − 10 ± 0. 2 × 10 − 10 m 2 /s and is not influenced by particle sizes or initial LAS concentrations. The ion exchange of LAS onto LDH is not well described by the ion exchange model. The rate determining step is obtained by comparing several models to different experimental data. A double layer model resulted in a good description of the experimental data. At the outer surface of LDH a stagnant film resistance originating from an electric double layer is assumed.

LDH was synthesized with the co-precipitation method of Reichle (1986); a solution of M 2 +(NO 3) 2 and M 3 +(NO 3) 3 and a second solution of NaOH and Na 2 CO 3 were pumped in a beaker and mixed. The precipitate that was formed was allowed to age and was subsequently washed, dried and calcined. The process parameters that were investigated are the concentration of the initial solutions, M 2 +/M 3 + ratio and type of cations. The crystallinity can be improved by decreasing the concentration of the initial solutions; this also decreases the leaching of M 3 + from the brucite-like structure into the water. The highest adsorption capacity is obtained for Mg 2 +/Al 3 + with a ratio 1 and 2 because of the higher charge density compared to ratio 3. Storing the LDH samples in water resulted in a reduction of adsorption capacity and a decrease in surface area and pore volume. Therefore, LDH is not applicable in a small device for long term use in aqueous surroundings. The adsorption capacity can be maintained during storage in a dry N 2 atmosphere...|$|E
