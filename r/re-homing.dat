40|$|When {{dogs and}} cats are not {{retained}} in a home, they are re-homed to somewhere, and {{while there is a}} collection of research around relinquishment to shelters, {{little is known about the}} general <b>re-homing</b> picture. A cross sectional random digit dial survey was conducted with an aim to learn more about who is <b>re-homing,</b> where they are <b>re-homing</b> and why they are <b>re-homing</b> owned {{dogs and cats}} in the US. We found the prevalence of <b>re-homing</b> in five years at 6 % making for an estimated 6. 12 million household <b>re-homing</b> pets every five years. Pets were most likely to be re-homed by being given to a friend or family member (37 %) closely followed by being taken to a shelter. Those who re-homed due to a reason related to the pet as opposed to reasons such as family issues were more likely to re-home to a shelter. For respondents who rented, housing reasons were the number one reason for <b>re-homing,</b> and for respondents of lower income, they were significantly more likely to re-home due to cost and housing issues as opposed to pet related issues. We conclude that some reasons for <b>re-homing</b> are not easily modified and humane <b>re-homing</b> is the best option, but that there are many areas in which intervention and prevention programs may increase retention...|$|E

40|$|In 2008 CAWC {{surveyed}} six leading UK <b>re-homing</b> organisations. This {{revealed an}} upward trend of {{cat and dog}} admissions {{over the past three}} years. Between 2007 and 2008, the RSPCA reported a 57 % overall rise in animals relinquished to them, from 7, 347 to 11, 586; a 33 % increase for dogs and 50 % for cats (Elliott, 2009). Cats Protection reported to CAWC a 77 % increase in cats relinquished between January-April 2008 compared to January – April 2007. The survey aimed to investigate the organisations’ policies and ethical principles regarding: •	assessment and selection of suitable animals for <b>re-homing</b> •	preparation of the animals for <b>re-homing</b> •	assessment of prospective new homes and owners •	advice given to prospective owners •	knowledge and communication skills of the organisational staff •	follow up procedures after <b>re-homing.</b> The ethical aspects of the <b>re-homing</b> policies are addressed. <b>Re-homing</b> decisions were based on a combination of practical inquiries and ethical criteria. Most organisations require that potential owners will not only provide good homes, but will also care about the animals. Assessments of prospective owners were in terms of well established ethical principles or commonsense intuitions. However, value judgements in the <b>re-homing</b> process will not only relate to perceptions of the animal’s welfare; but extend to notions of integrity and dignity. Further, moral assessment will extend to prospective owners, their families and network of social connexions. The ethical objective of <b>re-homing</b> organizations is to provide a ‘permanent, caring and loving home’. This is inescapably connected to the pursuit of information and knowledge about the well being of the animal; that the potential love of animals must be linked to informed caring about them. Thus it would seem the ethical standpoint of <b>re-homing</b> organisations is that of ‘care ethics’, rather than the utilitarian position commonly associated with animal welfare science.

40|$|A deplorable {{practice}} {{has emerged in}} the world of adoption. Adoptive families are now using the Internet to give their unwanted adopted children over to complete strangers, some of whom are traffickers, pedophiles, child pornographers, or worse. This practice is known as private rehoming. Through the use of online message boards and a simple notarized power of attorney document, adoptive parents are circumventing the adoption system—including its home study and background check requirements for prospective parents—and placing children in great danger. Because only a handful of states have enacted legislation directly targeting private <b>re-homing</b> and because no such legislation exists at the federal level, this Note calls for drastic change to protect the best interests of adopted children. This Note also proposes a model state statute to combat private <b>re-homing.</b> Without regulation or restraint, private <b>re-homing</b> will perpetuate a world wide web of unwanted children. The dangers that this practice poses for adopted children and the severity of its consequences demand the holistic solution that this Note recommends, which includes taking steps at both the state and federal levels to prevent and prohibit private <b>re-homing...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Re-homing</b> centres {{present a}} range of {{potential}} stressors to kennelled dogs which are likely to impact negatively on their welfare. Despite the presence of visitors to the kennel often being considered a potential stressor, empirical investigation into {{its impact on the}} behaviour and welfare of kennelled dogs in <b>re-homing</b> centres is lacking. This study investigated the influence of changing visitor access policy from open access to prohibited viewing at kennels (with organised single meetings for viewing dogs outside of the kennel environment) on the welfare of 15 dogs housed in a dog-only <b>re-homing</b> facility. Data was collected across a number of domains comprising kennel noise levels, behavioural measures (activity, repetitive behaviour, response to human approach); physiological measures (urinary cortisol:creatinine ratios); sickness events and faecal scoring. The general kennel noise levels were significantly lower when visitor access to the kennel area was restricted. Furthermore, dogs were found to display behaviour indicative of improved welfare during this time period; dogs spent significantly more time sedentary, less time moving and exhibited significantly fewer episodes of repetitive behaviours. No significant change was seen in the urinary cortisol:creatinine ratio, nor in sickness behaviour, faecal scoring or response to a human approach test. Overall, the results from this study suggest that restricting visitors from viewing the dogs while in their kennels may be better for the dogs' short term welfar...|$|E
40|$|Rabbits are {{a common}} {{companion}} animal in the UK and some reports suggest that large numbers are relinquished to <b>re-homing</b> centres each year. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of rabbits relinquished to two UK <b>re-homing</b> centres and explore reasons given for relinquishment. The centres contributed data for all rabbits that entered their centre during 2013 (n= 205). Most rabbits (59. 5 %) were relinquished by an owner. A similar number of males to females were relinquished and {{a larger number of}} rabbits were not neutered (72. 4 %) and adults (56 %). Most rabbits were healthy on arrival (61. 5 %). The most common reasons for relinquishment were: too many rabbits / unplanned litters (30. 3 %) and housing problems (23. 8 %). Rabbit related reasons accounted for 12. 2 % of rabbits relinquished. Reasons for relinquishment were associated with one of the recorded rabbit characteristics. Further detailed studies are needed to explore the dynamics of pet rabbit ownership and factors that affect the breakdown of rabbit-owner relationships in the UK...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the question of}} killing animals in research, primarily from a moral perspective, but also taking into account some of the practical and scientific considerations with moral consequences in this context. We start by exploring in which situations animals are killed in research and whether these are always inevitable, analysing re-use and <b>re-homing</b> of animals as potential alternatives. We then discuss for whom – {{and under what circumstances}} -killing matters, considering situations where there may be a conflict between the wish to avoid killing and that to avoid suffering, and further take human-animal interactions into account. We argue that, although there are relevant practical, scientific and ethical arguments favouring the euthanasia of animals in most research contexts, there is a potential for rehabilitating more animals than is currently the practice...|$|E
