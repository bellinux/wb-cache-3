50|$|She {{was fitted}} out for United States Navy service at Tietjen & Lang's {{shipyard}} at Hoboken, New Jersey. Work began on 16 November 1917. Gun platforms were added for two anti-aircraft guns forward and a 5"/51 caliber gun aft. The minelaying conversion {{enabled her to}} carry mines on three decks, and included six Otis elevators individually capable of transferring two mines every 20 seconds from the storage decks to the launching deck. Stern ports were cut for launching the mines and the <b>rudder</b> <b>quadrant</b> was raised to give adequate clearance. Watertight subdivision was improved by strengthening existing bulkheads and building two new bulkheads to divide the largest compartments so the ship might stay afloat if only one compartment were flooded. Quarters were enlarged to accommodate messing and berthing arrangements for a crew of about 400. The main machinery was overhauled and auxiliary machinery was added for the elevators, for heating the berthing spaces, for refrigerated food storage, for additional fresh water distilling capacity, for magazine sprinklers and galley and washroom plumbing, and enlarged electric generators for lighting and radio communications. Existing coal bunkers on the third deck were replaced with a bunker in the hold forward of the boiler room with chutes to load coal over the mines. Larger boats and heavier anchors required larger davits and anchor windlass, and the mines required specialized handling machinery.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of yaw dampers: series yaw dampers and {{parallel}} yaw dampers. The servo actuator of a parallel yaw damper will actuate the rudder independently of the rudder pedals while the servo actuator of a series yaw damper is clutched to the <b>rudder</b> control <b>quadrant</b> and will result in pedal movement when the system commands the rudder to move.|$|R
