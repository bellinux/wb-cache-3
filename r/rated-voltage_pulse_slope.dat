40|$|The {{choice of}} the {{modulation}} format is the principle factor in realising a highperformance bandwidth efficient communication system at an acceptable cost and complexity. Pulse time modulation technique represents an attractive alternative to purely digital or purely analogue modulation schemes which has received considerable attention over the years. But very little work has been reported on <b>pulse</b> <b>slope</b> modulation. In this work a <b>pulse</b> <b>slope</b> modulation introduced and full wavefonn characteristics is given. A simple novel receiver has been proposed, {{which is based on}} converting the PSM waveform into a PAM waveform by sampling the received PSM signal at the rise time interval. This design eliminates the use of a differentiator and a voltage slicer adopted in the classical demodulation technique, and it offers simplicity and improved noise performance. A new signal-t-noise formula has been presented for the first time thus enabling users to predict the system noise performance. Experimental results have shown excellent agreement to within + 1 dB with theoretical predictions using the new formula. Results obtained show the potential of PSM in tenns of simplicity and better noise perfonnance compared to its counter part pulse amplitude modulation. Although PTM has many advantages over analogue and digital schemes when employed as a single channel system, it becomes a challenge when multiplexing is involved. Isochronous PTM schemes are suitable while the anisochronous schemes are not. One solution to overcome this problem is to adopt a hybrid or compound modulation technique, where both isochronous and anisochronous schemes can be combined. Compound frequency and width modulation (CPFWM) is one such a scheme which offers bandwidth efficiency, simplicity and low cost over the more commonly used multiplexed techniques. Detailed investigation of CPFWM has been given and in an expression for its spectrum has been developed. The results obtained have been clarified practically and by means of computer simulation to within + 1 dB. In CPFWM, cross talk in the PFM and pWM channels are due to width modulation and frequency modulation, respectively. The main cause of cross talk is the carryover energy from one edge to the next edge. This effect is studied and he results obtained for the cross talk are compared with the predicted data showing an agreement to within + 1 dB. Results were also compared with time division multiplexed pulse position modulation, showing comparable performance and under certain conditions CPFWM offering better performance. Noise performance of PFM and PWM channels has been theoretically and experimentally investigated. It has been shown that PFM is superior to PWM over a wide range of modulation indices and pulse characteristics. When both channels are identical in bandwidth and modulation conditions, PFM offers a 7 dB improvement compared to PWM channel. The noise perfonnance of CPFWM system is also compared with digital and analogue modulation schemes. For 25 dB CNR CPFWM offers a 40 dB SNR which is 20 dB higher than amplitude modulation, 1 7 dB lower than PCM system. At CNR > 35 dB its performance approaches that of PCM system.

40|$|In the {{developing}} chicken embryo yolk sac vasculature, {{the expression of}} arterial identity genes requires arterial hemodynamic conditions. We hypothesize that arterial flow must provide a unique signal that is relevant for supporting arterial identity gene expression and is absent in veins. We analyzed factors related to flow, pressure and oxygenation in the chicken embryo vitelline vasculature in vivo. The best discrimination between arteries and veins was obtained by calculating the maximal pulsatile increase in shear rate relative to the time-averaged shear rate in the same vessel: the relative <b>pulse</b> <b>slope</b> index (RPSI). RPSI was significantly higher in arteries than veins. Arterial endothelial cells exposed to pulsatile shear in vitro augmented arterial marker expression as compared with exposure to constant shear. The expression of Gja 5 correlated with arterial flow patterns: the redistribution of arterial flow provoked by vitelline artery ligation resulted in flow-driven collateral arterial network formation and was associated with increased expression of Gja 5. In situ hybridization in normal and ligation embryos confirmed that Gja 5 expression is confined to arteries and regulated by flow. In mice, Gja 5 (connexin 40) was also expressed in arteries. In the adult, increased flow drives arteriogenesis {{and the formation of}} collateral arterial networks in peripheral occlusive diseases. Genetic ablation of Gja 5 function in mice resulted in reduced arteriogenesis in two occlusion models. We conclude that pulsatile shear patterns may be central for supporting arterial identity, and that arterial Gja 5 expression plays a functional role in flow-driven arteriogenesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of hierarchical vascular networks {{results from the}} complex interplay between genetic factors and epigenetic factors such as oxygen and hemodynamics. The differentiation of blood vessels into arteries and veins was initially thought to be exclusively mediated by hemodynamic forces. This theory has been questioned, because endothelial progenitor cells express arterial and venous specific (marker-) genes even before their assembly in primary networks {{and the start of}} blood flow. The identification of marker-genes and the evaluation of their specific function in the vasculature are of essential importance for a deeper understanding of vascular development. The present study examined whether 1) the expression-patterns of the connexins known to be expressed in the vasculature: Cx 37, Cx 40 and Cx 43 are specific for arteries or veins during embryonic development, 2) the expression of Cx 40 is regulated by epigenetic factors such as oxygen and blood flow, 3) hemodynamic parameters that are characteristic for embryonic arteries and veins exist in vivo 4) the function of connexins is essential for the embryonic vasculature. Conclusions: Cx 40 is a good marker for developing arteries and its expression is likely not to be regulated by oxygen, but by hemodynamics. Characteristic differences of blood flow in developing arteries and veins of the yolk sac are 1) the pulsatility (determined by relative amplitude and relative maximum acceleration) and 2) the velocity (accompanied by the resulting shear rate). The relative maximum acceleration is the most selective of these parameters. Combination of the maximum acceleration and the mean relative pseudo-shear rate {{in the form of a}} quotient, the <b>Pulse</b> <b>Slope</b> Index (PSI), optimizes the separation of arterial and venous hemodynamic properties. The observed differences may explain the artery-specific expression pattern of Cx 40. Since the effects of inhibiting connexins were first observed in arteries, connexins appear to exert an essential role specifically in these vessels. Moreover, the aberrance of the retinal vasculature in postnatal Cx 40 -deficient mice indicates a key role of Cx 40 in the development of vascular networks...|$|R
40|$|A three-level {{downhole}} array {{is being}} operated in a 1500 -m-deep borehole within the seismically active Newport-Inglewood fault zone, Los Angeles basin. The array {{consists of three}} three-component 4. 5 Hz seismometers deployed at the surface, and at 420 and 1500 m depth. An M = 2. 8 earthquake that occurred 0. 9 km away from the array {{at a depth of}} 5. 3 km on 31 July 1986 generated rays traveling almost vertically up the downhole array. The P- and S-wave pulse shapes show increasing pulse rise time with decreasing depth, and the initial <b>pulse</b> <b>slope</b> is less steep at the surface than at 1500 m. The average value of t_s/t_p between 1500 and 420 m depth is 1. 7 and between 420 and 0 m is 3. 4. A near-surface site response results in amplification on the P wave by a factor of four and S waves by a factor of nine. These data indicate a near-surface Q_α of 44 ± 13 for rays traveling almost vertically. In the case of S waves, most of the high frequency content of the waveform beyond ∼ 10 Hz observed at 1500 m depth is lost through attenuation before the waveform reaches 420 m depth. The average Q_β is 25 ± 10 between 1500 and 420 m depth and 108 ± 36 between 420 and 0 m depth. The spectra of the S waves observed at 420 and 0 m of the downward reflected S phases may overestimate Q_β, because they are limited to a narrow band between 5 and 10 Hz and affected by the near-surface amplification. A Q_c of 160 ± 30 at 6 Hz was determined from the decay rate of the coda waves at all three depths. The corner frequency as determined from displacement spectra may be higher (f_c ∼ 10 Hz) at 1500 m depth than at (f_c ∼ 7 Hz) 420 and 0 m depth. Similarly, f_(max) significantly decreases as the waveforms travel toward the earth's surface, indicating that f_(max) is affected by near-surface attenuation. Beyond f_c, the average slopes of the spectra falloff of P-wave spectra is ∼f^(− 2) at 1500 m depth and ∼ f^(− 3) at the surface...|$|R

The shortest pulsewidth of 53. 3 ps at 1 GHz with spectral linewidth of 0. 09 nm at modulation power of 17 dBm can be obtained, which corre-sponds to a time–bandwidth product of 2. 8. The threshold modu-lation {{power and the}} maximum frequency detuning range for har-monic mode-locking of the SOAFL are 11. 5 dBm and 180 kHz, re-spectively. The mode-locked SOAFL gradually recovers back to si-nusoidal-wave modulation mode at the detuning frequency beyond 400 kHz. The <b>pulse</b> broadening <b>slopes</b> for the positive- and neg-ative-frequency detuning regions of 0. 48 and 0. 375 ps/kHz are de-termined, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: Our {{aim was to}} compare relative oxygen pulse (adjusted for body weight) curves in athletes at their maximal heart rate during treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing. METHODS: A total of 180 elite soccer players were categorized in quartiles according to their maximum heart rate values (n = 45). Oxygen consumption, maximum heart rate and relative oxygen pulse curves in the extreme quartiles, Q 1 and Q 4, were compared at intervals corresponding to 10 % of the total duration of a cardiopulmonary exercise testing. RESULTS: Oxygen consumption was similar among all subjects during cardiopulmonary exercise testing; however subjects in Q 1 started to exhibit lower maximum heart rate values when 20 % of the test was complete. Conversely, the relative oxygen pulse was higher in this group when cardiopulmonary exercise testing was 40 % complete (p<. 01). Although {{the slopes of the}} lines were similar (p =. 25), the regression intercepts differed (p<. 01) between Q 1 and Q 4.

40|$|Estimates of {{the effect}} of pulse {{stretching}} on satellite laser altimetry in particular the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), by cloud multiple scattering were made from an analytical method and from Monte Carlo calculations. The path delay of the return pulse was found to be largest for low-level clouds with particle radii (3 - 20 microns). The magnitude of the path delay was affected by several factors including cloud height, cloud optical depth, cloud particle size, particle shape, and receiver field of view. Polar aerosol and Rayleigh scattering usually added less than 1 cm to the overall path delay. Path delay estimates for all cloud conditions would be less if a simple Gaussian fit of the return pulse peak were used to measure the pulse's centroid. However, care must be taken in determining the centroid as factors such as <b>pulse</b> width, surface <b>slope</b> and the fitting method used will affect the estimate. A planned application for laser altimetry is high precision monitoring of the height change of polar ice sheets.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that collapse of the quantum wave function can be made consistent with relativity by specifying collapse to occur along special spacelike spacetime intervals. The special case of two entangled particles has been considered in some detail. When the entangled particles have the same mass, the world line of their center of mass bisects the spacetime interval along which collapse occurs, so we have taken to calling them symmetric spacetime intervals. In previous work, symmetric spacetime intervals were taken as a hypothesis. In this paper, they are derived and the concept is shown to apply equally well to entangled photons at light speed and to matter particles at sublight speeds. The derivation shows that {{the slope of the}} symmetric spacetime interval is numerically equal to the velocity of the center of mass of the entangled pair as previously hypothesized.

40|$|The {{cholinergic}} modulation of {{the electrical}} properties of spinal motoneurones {{was investigated in}} vitro, {{with the use of}} the whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique in lumbar spinal cord slices from juvenile urodeles (Pleurodeles waltlii). Bath application of acetylcholine (20 μm) with eserine (20 μm) induced an increase in the resting membrane potential, a decrease of the input resistance, a decrease of the action potential amplitude, and a reduction of the medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP) that followed each action potential. Moreover, the firing rate of motoneurones during a depolarizing current <b>pulse</b> and the <b>slope</b> of their stimulus current–spike frequency relation were increased. All of these effects were mimicked by extracellular application of muscarine (20 μm), and blocked by application of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (0. 1 – 1 μm). They were not observed during bath application of nicotine (10 μm). These results suggest that the cholinergic modulation of spinal motoneurone excitability was mediated by activation of muscarinic receptors. Our results further show that the muscarinic action primarily resulted from a reduction of the Ca 2 +-activated K+ current responsible for the mAHP, an inhibition of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih, and an enhancement of the inward rectifying K+ current, IKir. We conclude that cholinergic modulation can contribute significantly to the production of motor behaviour by altering several ionic conductances responsible for the repetitive discharge of motoneurones...|$|R
40|$|A thought {{experiment}} is presented {{that provides a}} hint as to how quantum wave functions can collapse in a relativistically consistent way. The thought experiment consists of a central source of photon pulses midway between two detectors, which is examined relativistically from both the lab frame and a frame moving {{with respect to the}} source and detectors. The total number of pulses between the two detectors is the only invariant and this leads to the idea that collapse might occur along special spacetime intervals, which we call symmetric spacetime intervals. In the current formalism of quantum mechanics, collapse is envisioned to occur “instantaneously”, in clear violation of relativity. It is shown that what the current formalism actually specifies is that collapse is merely spacelike. However, if quantum collapse occurs along symmetric spacetime intervals, then collapse of the wave function can be made consistent with relativity and all observers can agree upon which of two spacelike-separated causally connected events is the cause and which the effect.

Although several quantitative sensory testing methods exist to characterize the nociceptive function, it remains difficult to distinguish the contributions of individual mechanisms. Intra-epidermal electrical stimulation of nociceptive fibers allows defining stimuli with temporal properties within the timescale of these mechanisms. Here, we studied the effect of stimulus properties on the psychophysical detection probability. A psychophysical detection experiment was conducted including 30 healthy human participants. Participants were presented with electrical stimuli having various temporal properties. The pulse-width was varied for single pulse stimuli (either 420 or 840 μs), and the inter-pulse interval for double pulse stimuli (10, 50, or 100 ms). Generalized linear mixed models were used to obtain estimates of thresholds and slopes of the psychophysical function. The 840 -μs single pulse resulted in a lower threshold and steeper slope of the psychophysical function than the 420 -μs single pulse. Moreover, a double-pulse stimulus resulted in a lower threshold and steeper <b>slope</b> than single <b>pulse</b> stimuli. The <b>slopes</b> were similar between the double pulse stimuli, but thresholds slightly increased with increasing inter-pulse intervals.

40|$|Ulysses was {{launched}} in October 1990, and its Solar X-ray/Cosmic Gamma-Ray Burst Experiment (GRB) has provided more than 13 years of uninterrupted observations of solar X-ray flare activity. Due to the large variation of the relative solar latitude and longitude of the spacecraft orbit {{with respect to the}} Earth, the perspective of the GRB instrument often differed significantly from that of X-ray instruments on Earth-orbiting satellites. During extended periods the GRB experiment made direct observations of flares on the hidden face of the Sun, providing a unique record of events not visible to other instruments. The small detector area of GRB and its optimization for very high counting rates minimized the effects of pulse pile-up. We interpret the spectra, time histories, and occurrence distribution patterns of GRB data in terms of “thermal feed-through”, the confusion of thermal soft X-rays and non-thermal hard X-rays. This effect is a systematic problem for scintillation-counter spectrometers observing the solar hard X-ray spectrum.

It was also found that higher fit women had significantly shorter time to recovery for maximum slope compared with the lower fit women.

The Tagish Lake meteorite shows a unique visible reflectance spectrum identical {{to that of the}} D and T type asteroids.

This fouling phenomenon is a common issue in fluidized bed boilers, where challenging fuels with possibly high and challenging ash content are often fired in. Basic characteristics of the phenomenon are discussed briefly, followed by a short review {{of research on the}} methods of modelling and predicting fouling tendency. A method to examine fouling through heat transfer calculations was tested in this thesis. Primary aim was to verify applicability of this selected method in real large-scale boilers via performing a retrospective analysis on earlier measurement data. Reference clean state heat transfer coefficients of certain heat exchangers were compared to calculated states by using data from control system log files, and the comparisons were formulated into thermal resistances of the deposit layer. The control system log files contained data from earlier measurement campaigns. Calculated thermal resistances increased along cumulating deposition, until a cleansing soot blowing <b>pulse</b> is actuated. <b>Slopes</b> of these rising thermal resistance curves were extracted, forming estimates of fouling rates per each fouling period. Calculated thermal resistance build-ups matched soot blowing operation times well with only a few exceptions, and so the selected method seemed to express actual fouling decently in general. Calculated resistances and fouling rates were compared to other operational factors, including main steam power, fuel feed variation and measured flue gas pressure change at studied heat exchangers. Certain findings were made, even though available data was not completely sufficient. While decent correlation with slight steam power changes was not identifiable, studying the flue gas pressure change showed very evident relation with thermal resistances.

40|$|The {{pulse-echo}} method {{is one of}} the most important in ultrasonic imaging. In many areas, including medical applications and nondestructive evaluation, it constitutes one of the fundamental principles for aquiring information about the examined object. An ultrasonic pulse is transmitted into a medium and the reflected pulse is recorded, often by the same transducer. In the area of 3 -dimensional imaging, or surface profiling, the distance between the object and the transducer is estimated to be proportional to the time-of-flight (TOF) of the pulse. If the transducer is then moved in a plane parallell to the object, a surface profile can be obtained. Usually some sort of correlation between echoes is performed to estimate their relative difference in TOF. However, this assumes that the shape of the echoes are the same. This is not the case as the shape is dependent on the surface in the neighbourhood of the transducer's symmetry axis and this shape will vary as the transducer is moved across the surface. The change in signal shape will reduce the accuracy of the TOF estimation. A simple example is when the surface has a step. The resulting echo consists of the superposition of two echoes; one from the "top" and one from the "bottom". The TOF estimate will then be almost arbitrary. Another difficulty with pulse-echo imaging is the lateral resolution. The ultrasonic beam is not infinitesimally thin but has a non-neglectable spatial extent, even for focused transducers. This means that two point reflectors separated laterally with only a small distance can not be resolved by ultrasound. The spatial decompostion of the ultrasonic echoes suggested in this licentiate thesis can be used to extract information from the pulse deformation and to reduce the lateral resolution in the following way: * In surface profiling, the surface is modelled as piecewise plane, i. e. the reflected pulse stems from a local plane and perpendicular object. If we instead model the part of the surface that reflects the ultrasonic <b>pulse</b> as a <b>sloping</b> plane there are two advantages. If we can estimate both the distance to, and the slope of, the surface, we can either increase the accuracy or decrease the number of scanning points while maintaining the same accuracy. * To increase the lateral resolution we have to take into account how points off the symmetry axis contribute to the total echo. If we know this, some kind of inverse spatial filter or other method can be constructed in order to improve the resolution. This thesis is comprised of the following five parts: Part A 1 : (Magnus Sandell and Anders Grennberg) "Spatial decomposition of the ultrasonic echo using a tomographic approach. Part A: The regularization method"We conclude that since the pulse-echo system can be considered linear, i. e. the echo from an arbitrary object can be thought of as the sum of the echoes from the contributing points on the surface, it would be very useful to know the echo from a point reflector. By doing this spatial decomposition we can simulate the echo from any object. It is, however, not possible practically to measure the single point echo (SPE) directly. If the reflector is to be considered pointlike, its size has to be so small that the echo will dissappear in the background noise. If it is increased, there will be spatial smoothing. Instead, we propose an indirect method that uses echoes from sliding halfplanes. This results in measurements with far better SNR and by modifying methods from tomography we can obtain the SPE. An error analysis is performed for the calculated SPE and simulated echoes from sloping halfplanes, using the obtained SPE, are compared with measured ones. Part A 2 : (Anders Grennberg and Magnus Sandell) "Experimental determination of the single point echo of an ultrasonic transducer using a tomographic approach"The main ideas of Part A 1 are presented in this conference paper. It was presented at the Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society in Paris, France in October 1992. Part B 1 : (Anders Grennberg and Magnus Sandell) "Spatial decomposition of the ultrasonic echo using a tomographic approach. Part B: The singular system method"In this part we continue the approach of spatially decomposing the ultrasonic echo. The SPE is again determined from echoes from sliding halfplanes. Here we interpret the SPE and the halfplane echoes to belong to two different weighted Hilbert spaces. These are chosen with regard to the properties of the SPE and the measured echoes. The SPE is supposed to belong to one of these spaces and is mapped by an integral operator to the other space. This is measured but the measurements also contain additive noise. A continuous inverse to this operator does not exist so the problem is ill-posed. A pseudo-inverse to this operator is constructed by using a singular value decomposition (SVD). By decomposing the halfplane echoes with N basis functions from the SVD, the SPE can be found. The spatial decomposition made in this part can be useful to obtain the long-term goals of estimating the slope of a tilted plane and to increase the lateral resolution. Part B 2 : (Anders Grennberg and Magnus Sandell) "Experimental determination of the ultrasonic echo from a pointlike reflector using a tomographic approach"This is a contribution to the IEEE 1992 Ultrasonic Symposium in Tucson, USA. It is an extract of Part B 1 and deals with the SVD-based inversion of the halfplane echoes. Part C : (Anders Grennberg and Magnus Sandell) "Estimation of subsample time delay differences in narrowbanded ultrasonic echoes using the Hilbert transform correlation"This part deals with a method for increased axial resolution. Using the fact that airborne ultrasonic pulses are narrowbanded, a new algorithm for estimating small time-delay is described. This method can be used in conjuction with a normal TOF-estimator. The latter can make a robust and rough (i. e. within a few samples) estimate and the remaining small time-delay is estimated using our proposed method. Another area of application is an improved averaging algorithm. Airborne ultrasound suffers from a jitter which is caused by air movement and temperature gradients. This jitter can be modelled as a small random time shift. A straightforward averaging will then be a summing of pulses that are not aligned in time which results in a pulse deformation. By estimating the time shift caused by the jitter, all echoes can be time aligned and no pulse deformation will occur when summing them. Godkänd; 1994; 20080401 (ysko...|$|R
