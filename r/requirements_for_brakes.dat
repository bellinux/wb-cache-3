40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{accurately}} calculate the braking efficiency factor of drum brake shoe of heavy truck, virtual prototyping {{of a heavy}} truck's brake is demonstrated. The <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>brakes</b> include not only its performance but also its comfort, serviceability and working lifetime, which must be high. The finite element analysis software ANSYS and the multi-body system simulation software MSC. ADAMS were used to establish the drum brake nonlinear 3 D simulation model. The model was built by developing joint program module between the rigid shoe and the flexible lining and nonlinear contact force program module between the lining and the rigid drum. Using this model, the simulation was executed for the drum brake of 32 t heavy duty truck. The {{results show that the}} simulated braking efficiency factor coincides with experimental results of the braking efficiency factor of the heavy truck drum brake...|$|E

A second moment reliability index is used to design test codes {{for the assessment of}} variable amplitude disk brake fatigue life.

The index gives possibilities to take all uncertainties in the fatigue life assessment into account, including scatter in material, production, and usage but also systematic errors like model errors in test set up, stress calculations, damage hypothesis, as well as statistical uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Wear {{resistance}} and Frictional stability are key performance <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>brake</b> lining. Automotive brake linings are usually made of various ingredients such as binder, filler, friction modifiers and reinforcement. Rockwool is a mineral fiber and steel fiber is a metallic fiber. In this work reinforcement fibers used are both the mineral and metallic fibers with six different composition prepared and tested. The result shows that metallic fibers should be high compared to mineral fiber for best frictional performance and wear resistance. Friction-wear {{properties of the}} reinforced samples were investigated on the cast iron disc as a counterpart using a pin on disc wear tester. The investigation confirmed that the sample with increase in steel fiber (4 %, 8 % and 12 %) improves the wear resistance. On the other hand specimen with high content of Rockwool fiber forms an improper ratio among the other ingredients. The SEM images of the sample indicated that an increase in steel fiber higher than 12 % content resulted in adhesive wear. Analysis of the experimental result shows that the sample with 12 % steel fiber and 8 % Rockwool fiber exhibited the optimum friction-wear behavior. Finally the effect of environment on the composites was investigated in water, salt water and oil...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to obtain an insight into various secondary <b>braking</b> systems <b>for</b> goods vehicles. Practical tests were carried out with a tractor- semi-trailer combination. The performance of various split braking systems as well as spring brake actuators are shown. With {{nearly all of the}} secondary braking systems it is possible to obtain sufficient deceleration to meet legal <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> the <b>braking</b> path. The critical point however is lateral stability. The report concludes with recommendations <b>for</b> legal <b>requirements</b> concerning lateral stability both on dry and on wet road surfaces. It is concluded that: lateral stability must be obtained on both a dry and a wet road surface; tractors for semi-trailers should have a split braking system; and service <b>brakes</b> <b>for</b> motor vehicles and trailers (semi-trailers) should have a certain braking capacity in case a failure occurs (emergency braking capacity). As a solution it is proposed that the emergency braking capacity of the service brake shall be at least 50 % of the normal required capacity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, {{automotive}} {{brake rotors}} {{are made with}} cast iron. Besides having economical advantage, cast iron rotor provides many disadvantages due to its weight, such as reduction in fuel efficiency, increase in green house gas emission, and increase in noise, vibration and hardness. With the development of commercial aluminum composites, composite brake rotors are now manufactured. However, the present commercial composite materials are not specifically made <b>for</b> <b>brake</b> application and there are drawbacks. A major drawback is their poor elevated temperature property. In this paper, the unique properties offered by an aluminum composite <b>for</b> <b>brake</b> application is addressed, and an approach to compensate its properties <b>for</b> <b>brake</b> application is highlighted...|$|R
