He brought the county its first manufacturing company and stopped the practice of giving away gravel, drains, and bridge lumber from district warehouses to private citizens.

5|$|The present-day parish of Ifield {{covers the}} west of Crawley and its rural hinterland. The A23 and A2220 roads, between County Oak and the A264, form the eastern and {{southern}} boundaries.

The northern border is close to the county boundary with Surrey and the southern edge of Gatwick Airport.|$|E
5|$|Although Dean's {{landfall}} in Mexico {{occurred in}} a relatively uninhabited area and the storm's well-predicted track gave ample warning, the storm inflicted extreme damage. In Majahual, the only town to experience {{the full force of}} the hurricane, hundreds of buildings were destroyed. Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, it took more than six months to fix all of the region's more <b>rural</b> <b>roads.</b> Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities for aid. Together, they established a housing-repair fund which contributed to the reconstruction of over 37,000residences.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Chandler urged {{implementation}} of the state's first <b>rural</b> <b>roads</b> program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Act. He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment and in 1938, proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state's assistance rolls. He increased funding to the state's hospitals and asylums, and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937. Following the flood, Chandler convinced the legislature to construct a new reformatory at La Grange.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Auxois are still bred for meat production, and in 2001, 50% {{of the horses}} bred were intended for slaughter. However, the power and gaits of the breed make them valued for competitive and leisure driving, as well as equestrian tourism. The smaller horses of the breed are used for milk production. The Auxois is used for celebrations, such as weddings, and historical reenactments. It is also used for logging, and in recent years, has been increasingly used in agriculture, being found in vineyards, gardens and farms. The use of them {{for the maintenance of}} <b>rural</b> <b>roads</b> is also in planning.|$|E
5|$|During a {{confrontation}} between rebels and British forces {{at the village}} of an-Nazla ash-Sharqiya in early December 1937, al-Hajj Muhammad was wounded, but managed to evade capture when the mukhtar (village headman) escorted him to safety in a nearby cave. Four of al-Hajj Muhammad's men died in the battle. After the British withdrew from the area, al-Hajj Muhammad was treated by local doctors until January 1938 when he received more advanced care in Damascus. He returned to Palestine later that month. By early 1938, the rebels consolidated control {{over much of the}} countryside and the <b>rural</b> <b>roads.</b> These areas became increasingly dangerous for British forces, who were mostly concentrated in the main towns.|$|E

5|$|Like the Philadelphia {{extension}}, {{the western}} extension required {{the building of}} long bridges, including those that cross the Beaver River and the Allegheny River. The overpasses along the road consisted of steel girder bridges and through plate girder bridges. Unlike the other segments, the concrete arch bridge was not used for overpasses, although {{it was used to}} carry the turnpike over other roads. On August 7, 1950, the roadway opened between the Irwin and Pittsburgh interchanges. Ohio Governor Frank Lausche led a dedication ceremony on November 26, 1951. The extension opened to the Gateway toll plaza near the Ohio border on December 26, 1951. At the time, the highway ended in a cornfield. Traffic followed a temporary ramp onto local <b>rural</b> <b>roads</b> until the connecting Ohio Turnpike could be built. On December 1, 1954, the Ohio Turnpike opened.|$|E
5|$|Post-storm {{analysis}} showed that, while less deadly, Dean's first {{and more powerful}} landfall caused significantly more infrastructural damage than its second. Where the landfall occurred at the town of Majahual specifically, {{and the state of}} Quintana Roo generally, communities took longer to recover than {{in the rest of the}} country. Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, it took more than six months to fix all of the region's <b>rural</b> <b>roads.</b> Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities and secured Mex$755million (US$74.8million) of aid. Combined with the state's contribution of $270million (US$26.7million), a housing-repair fund of over $1,025million (US$101.5million) was established. In the three months immediately following the storm, over 37,000houses were rebuilt or repaired using monies from this fund.|$|E
5|$|The {{state has}} a large, {{multimodal}} transportation system with the largest road network in the country. The state is well connected to its nine neighbouring states and almost all other parts of India through the national highways (NH). It boasts 42 national highways, with a total length of 4,942km (9.6% of the total NH length in India). The Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation was established in 1972 to provide economical, reliable, and comfortable transportation in the state with connecting services to adjoining states and boasts as being the only State Transport Corporation that runs in profit in the entire nation. All cities are connected to state highways, and all district headquarters are being connected with four lane roads which carry traffic between major centres within the state. One of them is Agra Lucknow Expressway, which is a 302km (188mi) controlled-access highway constructed by Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) to reduce vehicular traffic in previously congested roads. This expressway is country’s largest Greenfield Expressway which reduced the travel time between Lucknow and Agra from 6 hours to 3.30 hours. Other district roads and village roads provide villages accessibility to meet their social needs as also the means to transport agriculture produce from village to nearby markets. Major district roads provide a secondary function of linking between main roads and <b>rural</b> <b>roads.</b> Uttar Pradesh has the highest road density in India, (1,027km per 1000km2) and the largest surfaced urban-road network in the country (50,721km).|$|E
