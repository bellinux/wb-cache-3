40|$|Introduction: The {{decrease}} in inspiratory muscle strength {{may affect the}} respiratory health, especially in the elderly. Generally, the handgrip strength {{is used as a}} functional capacity indicator. Thus, our objective was to verify inspiratory muscle strength in a sample of elderly and investigate possible associations with measured handgrip strength. Methods: Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP in cmH 2 O) was assessed using a dynamometer for respiratory muscles (MicroRPM®), whereas handgrip strength (HG in kg) was evaluated using a hydraulic dynamometer (JAMAR®). Body mass index (BMI in kg/m 2) was calculated from weight (kg) and height (m). The association between MIP and HG was analyzed based on Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for p < 0. 05. Results: A sample of 21 older day-care center attendants (2 males and 19 females) aged 79 ± 6 years old with a BMI (29. 6 ± 3. 5 kg/m 2) were assessed. MIP scored 64. 0 ± 19. 8 cmH 2 O for males (around 65 % of the expected 98. 2 ± 2. 7 cmH 2 O) and 39. 1 ± 19. 5 cmH 2 O for females (around 60 % of the expected 64. 1 ± 3. 2 cmH 2 O). Moreover, an HG of around 30. 0 ± 9. 9 kg and 24. 2 ± 3. 9 kg was obtained for males and females, respectively, which were below average for both genders. Lastly, a positive <b>relation</b> <b>indicator</b> between HG and MIP was attained with p = 0. 001 and rs = 0. 660. Conclusions: Results suggest an association between the diminishing of MIP and the decreasing of the functional capacity measured by the HG, indicating the importance of inspiratory muscle training in elderly. Nevertheless, further studies with larger samples are recommended to validate these results. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims {{to provide}} an {{original}} contribution evaluating several kinds of relations between four areas of innovation activities - training, technology, organization, ICT – industrial relations and firm’s economic performance. Quantitative evidence for a SME based local production system is provided by exploiting two datasets: the first is derived from a direct survey carried out in 2005 collecting data on innovations, labour flexibility and industrial relations; the second is represented {{by a panel of}} official balance sheets data for the period 1998 - 2004. The analysis is divided in two consequential parts. We first examine the drivers of different innovation strategies. Among the many factors and control variables investigated as stimulating innovations, we focus in particular on industrial relations, labour flexibility strategies, and firm’s past economic trends. Second, we exploit the aforementioned innovation indicators as potential drivers of firm productivity. Though the core of the analysis is based on a cross section framework the two related steps and the rich set of information allow coping with endogeneity issues. Training activities and organizational changes show strong links with many industrial <b>relations</b> <b>indicators,</b> thus emerging as industrial relations driven innovations. The ICT innovation index results more influenced by firms past performances, than by industrial <b>relations</b> <b>indicators,</b> as technological innovation does. The analysis about labour productivity drivers shows that training activities are the most relevant factors. Then, ranked consequently, technological innovation, organisational innovations and, finally, ICT also appear to impact on productivity levels. It is worth noting that the role of ICT emerges more robustly when endogeneity is specifically addressed. Finally, the role of firm size seems here to be overshadowed by other drivers...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relevance}} of sector differences in comparative industrial relations. A critique of the ‘methodological nationalism’ of traditional comparative industrial relations is proposed {{on the basis of}} an empirical analysis of industrial <b>relations</b> <b>indicators</b> in nine different sectors across the 27 EU member states. It is found that industrial relations vary across sectors as deeply as they do across countries, and that a cluster analysis of sectoral industrial relations produces very different results from one at national aggregate level. The concept of ‘national model’ of industrial relations, implying coherence and homogeneity within countries, and typologies of geographic industrial relations ‘types’ are therefore put in question. The article concludes by pointing at the theoretical and methodological implications of a focus on the sector as an important level of analysis...|$|R

The search for publications in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ProQuest electronic databases from January 1990 to March 2008 identified 879 publications, from which 21 cohort studies were selected that evaluated gender as an independent variable and incidence of functional disability in elderly as the outcome.

The main risk factors for functional disability in the elderly, regardless of gender, were: lack of schooling, living in rental housing, chronic diseases, arthritis, diabetes, visual impairment, body mass index above 25, poor self-perceived health, cognitive impairment, depression, slow gait, sedentary lifestyle, tiredness while performing daily activities, and limited diversity in social relations...|$|R

40|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} in comparative research on industrial relations of analysis concentrating on differences and similarities between countries, that is, focusing on aggregates measured at the national level. But what happens {{if there are no}} (more) differences in industrial relations systems between countries? If there are not differences the question arises if comparative research is becoming meaningless? Concentrating predominantly on statistical and methodological aspects, it is argued in this article that over recent decades industrial relations systems have changed {{in such a way that}} the national level has become less relevant as a unit of analysis. It is explained that this development in the nature of the field affects the measurement of its indicators which form the backbone of any comparison. On the basis of an empirical comparison of key industrial <b>relations</b> <b>indicators</b> in the European Union member states, it is concluded that comparative research has not reached a dead end, but rather that the field might have to reconsider the relevant unit for analysis. It is shown that the relevant unit for analysis has shifted increasingly from the national towards the sectoral level. One consequence of this shift is that from a methodological perspective comparisons between sectors, rather than between countries, are nowadays often more informative...|$|R
