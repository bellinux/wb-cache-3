On Janmashtami day in 1955, he <b>recited</b> <b>the</b> entire Bhagavad Gita.

5|$|Romeo and Juliet {{may be the}} most-filmed play of all time. The {{most notable}} {{theatrical}} releases were George Cukor's multi-Oscar-nominated 1936 production, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet. The latter two were both, in their time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare film ever. Romeo and Juliet was first filmed in the silent era, by Georges Méliès, although his film is now lost. The play was first heard on film in The Hollywood Revue of 1929, in which John Gilbert <b>recited</b> <b>the</b> balcony scene opposite Norma Shearer.|$|E

5|$|The White House Passover Seder was {{an annual}} private dinner {{held at the}} White House on the Jewish holiday of Passover during the {{presidency}} of Barack Obama.

5|$|The {{following}} year, with Obama {{elected president}} and his junior staffers working in the White House, Obama encouraged the group to hold the Seder again. The 2009 event {{was the first time}} that a sitting U.S. president conducted a Passover Seder in the White House. The White House switchboard was reportedly swamped with callers seeking a dinner invitation. The White House Seder was scheduled for the second night of Passover to allow Jewish staffers to spend the first Seder on the first night of Passover with their families. About 20 guests sat around a table in the Old Family Dining Room reading the Haggadah and sampling the traditional Seder foods. Malia and Sasha Obama, being the youngest in attendance, <b>recited</b> <b>the</b> Four Questions and engaged in the search for the afikoman.|$|E
5|$|After {{handing over}} the {{earrings}} and taking leave of his guru, Uttanka went to Hastinapur, {{the kingdom of}} King Janamejaya. He resolved to teach a lesson to Takshaka who had caused him trouble. He informed Janamejaya that it was Takshaka who had killed his father Parikshit and advised Janamejaya to perform a snake sacrifice to exterminate the serpents. Uttanka {{was one of the}} rishis who participated in the Sarpa Satra yagna initiated by the king. Sarpa Satra was meant to draw all serpents to the sacrificial fire to certain death by the chanting of mantras. After the serpents started falling into the sacrificial fire, Takshaka was not to be found anywhere. Uttanka then <b>recited</b> <b>the</b> mantras with great vigour to draw Takshaka to the fire. In mortal fear, Taskshaka took shelter with Indra and got himself tied to the throne of Indra for protection. Uttanka, who realised that Takshaka had taken refuge with Indra, intensified his mantras to ensure that not only Takshaka but also Indra along with his throne were drawn to the fire. Indra freed the snake from the throne and escaped. However, when Takshaka was about to drop to death into the sacrificial fire, Astika, a young boy well versed in scriptures, son of the sage Jaratkaru intervened with Janamejaya. Astika ensured that the Sarpa Satra was stopped and the life of Takshaka was saved.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to {{the usual}} pattern of making a blessing before the commandment, the blessing for {{relieving}} one's bodily needs and the blessing for ritually rinsing the hands are both <b>recited</b> afterwards. In <b>the</b> former case, it is forbidden to recite any blessing while one feels one's need, and so the blessing is postponed. In the latter case, one may also not <b>recite</b> <b>the</b> blessing beforehand since clean hands are a prerequisite for <b>reciting</b> <b>the</b> blessing. Even if one is certain that one's hands are clean (for example, at the Rabbinically-instituted rinsing before breaking bread), one still <b>recites</b> <b>the</b> blessing afterwards to avoid confusion.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{those who}} <b>recite</b> <b>the</b> azharot at all, {{the most common}} custom is to recite them {{sometime}} {{during the period of}} Shavuot. They are variously <b>recited</b> during <b>the</b> Shavuot synagogue mussaf, mincha or arvit service, or during the Sabbath prior to Shavuot. Some Sephardic diaspora communities chant the Positive Commandments of the azharot {{on the first day of}} Shavuot, and the Negative Commandments on the second day.Sephardic/Eastern communities <b>recite</b> <b>the</b> azharot of Ibn Gairol, while North African communities of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya <b>recite</b> <b>the</b> azharot of Barceloni.
