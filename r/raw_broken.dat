40|$|The {{probability}} of nontornadic severe weather event reports near any {{location in the}} United States for {{any day of the}} year has been estimated. Gaussian smoothers in space and time have been applied to the observed record of severe thunderstorm occurrence from 1980 to 1994 to produce daily maps and annual cycles at any point. Many aspects of this climatology have been identified in previous work, but the method allows for the consideration of the record in several new ways. A review of the <b>raw</b> data, <b>broken</b> down in various ways, reveals that numerous nonmeteorological artifacts are present in the raw data. These are predominantly associated with the marginal nontornadic severe thunderstorm events, including an enor-mous {{growth in the number of}} severe weather reports since the mid- 1950 s. Much of this growth may be associated with a drive to improve warning verification scores. The smoothed spatial and temporal distri-butions of the {{probability of}} nontornadic severe thunderstorm events are presented in several ways. The distribution of significant nontornadic severe thunderstorm reports (wind speeds 65 kt and/or hailstone diameters 2 in.) is consistent with the hypothesis that supercells are responsible for the majority of such reports. 1...|$|R

6000|$|Blistered Feet.--To {{prevent the}} feet from blistering, it {{is a good}} plan to soap the inside of the {{stocking}} before setting out, making a thick lather all over it. A <b>raw</b> egg <b>broken</b> into a boot, before putting it on, greatly softens the leather: of course the boots should be well greased when hard walking is anticipated. After some hours on the road, when the feet are beginning to be chafed, take off the shoes, and change the stockings; Putting what was the right stocking on the left foot, and the left stocking on the right foot. Or, if one foot only hurts, take off the boot and turn the stocking inside out. These were the plans adopted by Captain Barclay. when a blister is formed, [...] "rub the feet, on going to bed, with spirits mixed with tallow dropped from a candle into the palm of the hand; on the following morning no blister will exist. The spirits seem to possess the healing power, the tallow serving only to keep the skin soft and pliant. This is Captain Cochrane's advice, and the remedy was used by him in his pedestrian tour." [...] (Murray's Handbook of Switzerland.') The recipe is an excellent one; pedestrians and teachers of gymnastics all endorse it.|$|R

60|$|Boiled {{with water}} this forms a thick glutinous mass, with a rather {{astringent}} taste, and is eaten with salt, limes, and chilies. Sago-bread {{is made in}} large quantities, by baking it into cakes in a small clay oven containing six or eight slits side by side, each about three-quarters of an inch wide, and six or eight inches square. The <b>raw</b> sago is <b>broken</b> up, dried in the sun, powdered, and finely sifted. The oven is heated over a clear fire of embers, and is lightly filled with the sago-powder. The openings are then covered with a flat piece of sago bark, and in about five minutes the cakes are turned out sufficiently baked. The hot cakes are very nice with butter, and when made {{with the addition of}} a little sugar and grated cocoa-nut are quite a delicacy. They are soft, and something like corn-flour cakes, but leave a slight characteristic flavour which is lost in the refined sago we use in this country. When not wanted for immediate use, they are dried for several days in the sun, and tied up in bundles of twenty. They will then keep for years; they are very hard, and very rough and dry, but the people are used to them from infancy, and little children may be seen gnawing at them as contentedly as ours with their bread-and-butter. If dipped in water and then toasted, they become almost as good as when fresh baked; and thus treated they were my daily substitute for bread with my coffee. Soaked and boiled they make a very good pudding or vegetable, and served well to economize our rice, which is sometimes difficult to get so far east.|$|R
40|$|A {{socio-economic}} {{study was}} carried out in northern Ghana to verify the importance of rice parboiling to poverty alleviation. Consumer acceptability and sensory evaluation carried out showed that there was a high correlation between consumer acceptability and sensory attributes developed by a trained panel for both raw and cooked rice. An improved prototype rice parboiling vessel was designed and constructed and this vessel more than doubled the quantity of paddy usually parboiled per batch in northern Ghana. It also reduced fuel and water usage by 50 % and 30 % respectively. Ghanaian consumers preferred imported rice to locally produced parboiled rice. They also preferred parboiled rice that had a clean, translucent and uniform appearance. Percent starch damage, an important quality indicator increased with parboiling intensity. On intense laboratory parboiling, milling yield increased by 7 % over the <b>raw</b> milled sample. <b>Broken</b> grains increased on mild parboiling and only began to decrease when paddy was soaked at 90 °C and steamed for at least 8 minutes. The most intensely parboiled sample had a broken level of 5. 06 %. Water absorption index increased with parboiling intensity. Thiamine content increased linearly with parboiling. Riboflavin however peaked with paddy soaked at 70 °C and steamed for 12 minutes and decreased with further intensification of parboiling. X-ray diffraction pattern of the raw milled sample was the A-type. While the severest laboratory parboiled sample had an A-type pattern, the commercially parboiled sample had a typical V-pattern. The characteristic aroma of Ghanaian parboiled rice is influenced mainly by 2 -decena, 2 -heptenal and acetic acid. Raman and solid-state 13 C CP-MAS NMR spectra were used in investigating changes in conformation of the protein and starch components due to parboiling. Artisanal parboiling was just as effective as commercial parboiling in the denaturisation of rice protein. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} methodological aspects of defining ?Arab Spring? as a revolutionary wave. Its relevance {{is defined by}} topical events in the Middle East today. The ambiguity of opinions on ?Arab Spring? and effects it caused require more detailed analysis of revolutionary wave in African countries and scientifically justified methods for its generalization. Some researchers believe that events in countries of North Africa cannot be called revolutions. According to them ?Arab Spring? {{should be considered as}} a wave of socio-political upheavals. In return some authors claim the events of ?Arab Spring? were developing precisely like revolutions and consider their opponents? definition of ?revolution? narrow and obsolete. The wave of social protests that rose in these countries was a result of a period of certain evolutionary changes that reached the point of quantity turning into quality. Those changes led to transformations, which were not properly completed and as a result were halted, canned or converted to war or subsequent reaction. A revolution is impossible to start in one day, it embodies years of preceding development processes and itself takes continuous amount of time. Thus, revolution is a process that can be independent from its stated duration. Revolution ? as an inherent denial of evolution that precedes it and gradually accumulates certain changes that prepare the interruption of gradualness ? often succumbs to the disruption from different processes and outer forces that are caused by cumulative movement. Revolutionary interruptions of movement are not isolated, hermetically sealed processes. During cumulative movement and interactions outer processes can intrude in the flow of revolution and therefore disrupt the logic of its formation, which means it will either self-destruct, remain unfinished, or perform not ?in the <b>raw?</b> and become <b>broken</b> up because of outer forces? unnecessary actions. This can cause zigzags, oscillations, rollbacks, deviations in the process of revolutionary development. But they also don?t change to nothing. The tendency, the direction in which the transformation was realized is kept in any way. On the contrary, the uncertainty of this state, its unfinished form indicates revolutionary nature of this period. Turning to theoretical cognitive branch of philosophical categories in their general form and utilizing them in regards to specific situations can provide powerful methodological research base to the revolution phenomenon in general and social revolutions in particular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|$|R
40|$|South Africa has {{witnessed}} series of social unrest, {{many of which}} ended in violence by very poor communities who allege poor delivery of basic goods and services. The majority of South African citizens are poor and pervasive inequality exists {{between men and women}} and between black and white peoples of the country. The poverty alleviation strategies inequalities and the consequences of poverty amongst women in rural areas (Ozoemena, 2010). Cacadu District municipality has done a study analysis on poverty alleviation in 2009 - 2010 together with the Baviaans municipality to verify which areas was the most poorest in Baviaans municipality. The findings came as Vondeling and Riertbron which was the poorest area. The focus was on tourism side because Baviaans is the tourist area. Rietbron and Vondeling is part of Baviaans Arts and craft program that was previously funded by DEDEAT R 500, 00 but only benefited after incorporated to Baviaans municipality as they were previously managed by Cacadu District Municipality before and the municipality decided to invest in this areas. The funding for DEDEAT was utilized for trainings, starting material and equipment’s and building of the Baviaanskoof Craft Shop for two projects which is Vondeling and Steytlerville and Rietbron did not benefit at that time. This study focuses on the income generating projects in Baviaans municipality with the view to describe the experiences of individuals who participate in these income generating projects. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the contribution of income generating projects in addressing poverty alleviation. Steytlerville projects is using waste materials like old newspaper, <b>raw</b> material, <b>broken</b> cups to do jewellery. Vondeling and Rietbron project is an angel factory producing beaded wire angels by using materials locally produced merino wool, wire wool, beads and local products such as ostrich feathers. This study is based on a case study which gives a description of poverty and reflects an involvement process of beneficiaries or communities in an income generating project and how it is impacting on their livelihoods. Qualitative and quantitative methodology were used. According to Neuman (2000 : 30), the quantitative data methods refer to the collection of data using numbers, counts and measures of things and qualitative research basically involves the use of words, pictures description and narratives”. Data was collected for interviews. In order to collect accurate information, an interview was conducted based on the author’s research questions. Research was conducted in different areas like Steytlerville, Vondeling and Rietbron. A questionnaire was used as a form of data collection for the three projects. These interviews were conducted formally in a focus group composed of the projects members. In Steytlerville they were 5 members, Vondeling 7 members and Rietbron 10 members which make a sample of 22 members. These projects have two craft shop where they sell their product which is Willomore craft shop and Baviaanskloof craft shop. The craft shop has been established to create an outlet by which locally sustainably made craft can be displayed and sold. The craft shop has been developed in such a way that is a real life example of a green building and business. The craft shop is an example of how to be environmentally friendly and utilise nature in such a way that it is sustainable and does not destroy it. The research findings suggested that in certain instances, Baviaans Craft project has been successful in generating income for members. The market for these crafters is mainly tourists. From this research it came out clear that some of the project members were able to acquire skills which help them to find employment in well-established craft business. Despite the successful of Baviaans Craft project, the project members were somewhat constrained in managing and running the business. For example with response for special markets, they had to make use of external skills i. e. someone who made contacts with the export market and there after divide the profits amongst members. The project members were not adequately empowered in management skills...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{stress and}} {{disturbance}} {{can affect the}} structure and functioning of marine ecosystems by altering their physical, chemical and biological features. In estuaries, benthic invertebrate communities play important roles in structuring sediments, influencing primary production and biogeochemical flux, and occupying key food web positions. Stress and disturbance can reduce species diversity, richness and abundance, with ecological theory predicting that biodiversity will be at its lowest soon after a disturbance with assemblages dominated by opportunistic species. The Avon-Heathcote Estuary in Christchurch New Zealand has provided a novel opportunity {{to examine the effects}} of stress, in the form of eutrophication, and disturbance, in the form of cataclysmic earthquake events, on the structure and functioning of an estuarine ecosystem. For more than 50 years, large quantities (up to 500, 000 m 3 /day) of treated wastewater were released into this estuary but in March 2010 this was diverted to an ocean outfall, thereby reducing the nutrient loading by around 90 % to the estuary. This study was therefore initially focussed on the reversal of eutrophication and consequent effects on food web structure in the estuary as it responded to lower nutrients. In 2011, however, Christchurch was struck with a series of large earthquakes that greatly changed the estuary. Massive amounts of liquefied sediments, covering up to 65 % of the estuary floor, were forced up from deep below the estuary, the estuary was tilted by up to a 50 cm rise on one side and a corresponding drop on the other, and large quantities of <b>raw</b> sewage from <b>broken</b> wastewater infrastructure entered the estuary for up to nine months. This study was therefore a test of the potentially synergistic effects of nutrient reduction and earthquake disturbance on invertebrate communities, associated habitats and food web dynamics. Because there was considerable site-to-site heterogeneity in the estuary, the sites in this study were selected to represent a eutrophication gradient from relatively “clean” (where the influence of tidal flows was high) to highly impacted (near the historical discharge site). The study was structured around these sites, with components before the wastewater diversion, after the diversion but before the earthquakes, and after the earthquakes. The eutrophication gradient was reflected in the composition and isotopic chemistry of primary producer and invertebrate communities and the characteristics of sediments across the sample sites. Sites closest to the former wastewater discharge pipe were the most eutrophic and had cohesive organic -rich, fine sediments and relatively depauperate communities dominated by the opportunistic taxa Capitellidae. The less-impacted sites had coarser, sandier sediments with fewer pollutants and far less organic matter than at the eutrophic sites, relatively high diversity and lower abundances of micro- and macro-algae. Sewage-derived nitrogen had became incorporated into the estuarine food web at the eutrophic sites, starting at the base of the food chain with benthic microalgae (BMA), which were found to use mostly sediment-derived nitrogen. Stable isotopic analysis showed that δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of most food sources and consumers varied spatially, temporally and in relation to the diversion of wastewater, whereas the earthquakes did not appear to affect the overall estuarine food web structure. This was seen particularly at the most eutrophic site, where isotopic signatures became more similar to the cleaner sites over two-and-a-half years after the diversion. New sediments (liquefaction) produced by the earthquakes were found to be coarser, have lower concentrations of heavy metals and less organic matter than old (existing) sediments. They also had fewer macroinvertebrate inhabitants initially after the earthquakes but most areas recovered to pre-earthquake abundance and diversity within two years. Field experiments showed that there were higher amounts of primary production and lower amounts of nutrient efflux from new sediments at the eutrophic sites after the earthquakes. Primary production was highest in new sediments due to the increased photosynthetic efficiency of BMA resulting from the increased permeability of new sediments allowing increased light penetration, enhanced vertical migration of BMA and the enhanced transport of oxygen and nutrients. The reduced efflux of NH 4 -N in new sediments indicated that the capping of a large portion of eutrophic old sediments with new sediments had reduced the release of legacy nutrients (originating from the historical discharge) from the sediments to the overlying water. Laboratory experiments using an array of species and old and new sediments showed that invertebrates altered levels of primary production and nutrient flux but effects varied among species. The mud snail Amphibola crenata and mud crab Austrohelice crassa were found to reduce primary production and BMA biomass through the consumption of BMA (both species) and its burial from bioturbation and the construction of burrows (Austrohelice). In contrast, the cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi did not significantly affect primary production and BMA biomass. These results show that changes in the structure of invertebrate communities resulting from disturbances can also have consequences for the functioning of the system. 	The major conclusions of this study were that the wastewater diversion had a major effect on food web dynamics and that the large quantities of clean and unpolluted new sediments introduced to the estuary during the earthquakes altered the recovery trajectory of the estuary, accelerating it at least throughout the duration of this study. This was largely through the ‘capping’ effect of the new liquefied, coarser-grained sediments as they dissipated across the estuary and covered much of the old organic-rich eutrophic sediments. For all aspects of this study, the largest changes occurred at the most eutrophic sites; however, the surrounding habitats were important as they provided the context for recovery of the estuary, particularly because of the very strong influence of sediments, their biogeochemistry, microalgal and macroalgal dynamics. There have been few studies documenting system level responses to eutrophication amelioration and to the best on my knowledge there are no other published studies examining the impacts of large earthquakes on benthic communities in an estuarine ecosystem. This research gives valuable insight and advancements in the scientific understanding of the effects that eutrophication recovery and large-scale disturbances can have on the ecology of a soft-sediment ecosystem...|$|R
