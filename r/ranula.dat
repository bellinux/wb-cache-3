5000|$|A <b>ranula</b> {{is a type}} of mucocele, and {{therefore}} could be classified as a disorder of the salivary glands. Usually a <b>ranula</b> is confined {{to the floor of the}} mouth (termed a [...] "simple ranula"). An unusual variant is the cervical <b>ranula</b> (also called a plunging or diving <b>ranula),</b> where the swelling is in the neck rather than the floor of the mouth. The term <b>ranula</b> is also sometimes used to refer to other similar swellings of the floor of mouth such as true salivary duct cysts, dermoid cysts and cystic hygromas. The Latin word rana means [...] "frog" [...] (<b>ranula</b> = [...] "little frog").|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ranula</b> — {{the name}} used when a {{mucocele}} {{occurs in the}} floor of the mouth (underneath the tongue). Ranulas may grow to a larger size than mucoceles at other sites, and they are usually associated with the sublingual gland, although less commonly they may also arise from the submandibular gland or a minor salivary gland. Uncommonly, a <b>ranula</b> may descend into the neck rather than the mouth (plunging <b>ranula).</b> If small, the <b>ranula</b> may be left alone, but if larger and causing symptoms, excision of the sublingual gland may be indicated.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study’s aim was {{to assess}} the effect of highly active {{antiretroviral}} drugs (HAART) on benign lymphoepithelial cysts (BLEC) of the parotid and <b>ranulas.</b> Study design. The records of 10 HIV-positive patients who presented with BLEC were reviewed, and 14 HIV-positive patients who presented with <b>ranulas</b> were prospectively enrolled. Patients in both groups received the same combination of HAART and were clinically evaluated for the first 3 months. Patients with <b>ranulas</b> were followed for an additional 3 months. A clinical reduction {{in the size of the}} lesions was considered to be a positive outcome. RESULTS. All parotid glands with BLEC resolved within 3 months. No positive results were observed in <b>ranulas</b> during the first 3 months. However, some of the <b>ranulas</b> displayed a positive result after the initial 3 months of HAART. CONCLUSIONS. In contrast to BLEC, <b>ranulas</b> in HIV-positive patients seem to present a mixed and delayed response to HAART. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{documented}} and generally accepted that enlargement of parotid salivary glands, as part of HIV-related salivary gland diseases (HIV-SGD), may be the initial symptoms/manifestations of the HIV infection. Oral mucoceles and <b>ranulas</b> are also frequently described as oral manifestations, in association with HIV infection. However, {{little is known about}} these latter lesions as being the initial symptoms indicative of an HIV infection. This prospective study has investigated the possibility that oral mucoceles in general, and <b>ranulas</b> in particular, could be the initial symptoms of an underlying and undiagnosed HIV infection. A total of 50 patients including cases of oral mucoceles and <b>ranulas</b> were consulted in a tertiary referral hospital set up. Nineteen (63 %) out of 30 HIV-positive patients presenting with oral mucoceles/ranulas, did not know their HIV status at the first consultation. Oral mucoceles/ranulas were for these patients, the only motives for visiting the health facility, and they were also the only clinical identifiable features (symptoms). Oral mucoceles and <b>ranulas</b> should, in the context of HIV-salivary gland diseases, be considered as initial symptoms and early manifestations of HIV infection. Routine HIV testing in all patients with oral mucoceles and <b>ranulas</b> is, according to this study, justified and should be recommended. [URL]...|$|R

50|$|Minor {{trauma to}} the floor of the mouth is thought to damage the {{delicate}} ducts that drain saliva from the sublingual gland into the oral cavity. The lesion is a mucous extravasation cyst (mucocele) of the floor of mouth, although a <b>ranula</b> is often larger than other mucoceles (mainly because the overlying mucosa is thicker). They can grow so large that they fill the mouth. The most usual source of the mucin spillage is the sublingual salivary gland, but ranulas may also arise from the submandibular duct or the minor salivary glands in the floor of the mouth. A cervical <b>ranula</b> occurs when the spilled mucin dissects its way through the mylohyoid muscle, which separates the sublingual space from the submandibular space, and creates a swelling in the neck. It may occur following rupture of a simple <b>ranula.</b> Rarely, ranulas may extend backwards into the parapharyngeal space.|$|E

40|$|The {{three most}} {{frequently}} diagnosed salivary gland diseases are salivary gland infections, sialolithiasis and mucoceles. Salivary gland infections are usually of bacterial or viral etiology {{and can be}} divided into acute and chronic types. Occasionally they can result from obstruction of the salivary duct, an autoimmmune disease or cancer therapy. Infections can occur in all types of salivary glands and are observed at all ages. Sialolithiasis is characterized by the development of calcified structures in the salivary glands, especially in the submandibular gland. Sialoliths are generally attributed to retention of saliva and are usually accompanied by swelling and pain when a salivary stimulus is applied. Mucoceles can be differentiated into mucus extravasation phenomenon or mucus escape reaction, mucus retention cysts and <b>ranulas.</b> They result from extravasation of saliva into the surrounding soft tissues or from retention of saliva within the duct...|$|R
40|$|HIV-salivary gland {{associated}} {{disease is}} a well accepted concept in the HIV-related literature. Parotid swellings, especially in its cystic benign lymphoepithelial form, have been largely reported. Oral mucoceles (<b>ranulas)</b> were also associated with HIV in some publications. The exact nature of this link between mucoceles and HIV is still to be clarified. The mainstream treatment of most of parotid pathologies and oral mucoceles remains surgical approach. Strong evidences do, however, exist about lymphopithelial lesions of parotid glands that have been successfully treated with antiretroviral drugs. We present a case of intraoral mucocele, coexisting with bilateral parotid gland lymphoepithelial lesions, on a 2 -year-old HIV-positive patient. Both parotid gland swellings and the sublingual mucocele have completely regressed following antiretroviral therapy. No surgical intervention was required. Conversely to benign lymphoepithelial lesions of parotid glands, the regression of oral mucocele on HIV-positive patient, following antiretroviral drugs therapy {{appears to be a}} rare phenomenon.

5000|$|A <b>ranula</b> usually {{presents}} as {{a translucent}} blue, dome-shaped, [...] swelling in the tissues {{of the floor}} of the mouth. If the lesion is deeper, then there is a greater thickness of tissue separating from the oral cavity and the blue translucent appearance may not be a feature. A <b>ranula</b> can develop into a large lesion many centimeters in diameter, with resultant elevation of the tongue and possibly interfering with swallowing (dysphagia). The swelling is not fixed, may not show blanching and is non-painful unless it becomes secondarily infected. The usual location is usually lateral to the midline, which may be used to help distinguish it from a midline dermoid cyst. A cervical <b>ranula</b> presents as a swelling in the neck, with or without a swelling in the mouth. In common with other mucoceles, ranulas may rupture and then cause recurrent swelling. Ranulas may be asymptomatic, although they can fluctuate rapidly in size, shrinking and swelling, making them hard to detect.|$|E

40|$|Few {{cases of}} {{plunging}} <b>ranulas</b> (PRs) occur during childhood and the lesions are frequently misdiagnosed. Here, a PR {{in a child}} is reported along with a literature review. A seven-year-old female complaining of swelling in the midline neck, left-submandibular region, was evaluated. No oral cavity or major salivary glands abnormalities were detected. On palpation, a soft, painless, and fluid-containing mass was observed. The suspicion PR was performed by ultrasound. The diagnosis was confirmed with a histopathological examination. The lesion was removed with a cervical approach, without recurrence. PR is an uncommon condition in children under 10 years of age. Differential diagnosis depends on clinical examination and ultrasonography. A computed tomography-scan and magnetic resonance imaging can be performed if the diagnosis remains uncertain.

40|$|Abstract Background Mucoceles are benign lesions {{related to}} the minor salivary glands and their {{respective}} ducts frequently affecting oral structures which are generally asymptomatic. Mucoceles are generally characterized by swollen nodular lesions preferentially located on the lower lip and differ from the so-called <b>ranulas,</b> which are lesions located {{on the floor of}} the mouth and {{related to the}} sublingual or submandibular glands. Methods The objective of the present study was to analyze data such as age, gender, race and site of the lesion of 173 mucocele cases diagnosed at the Discipline of Stomatology, São José dos Campos Dental School, UNESP, over a period of 24 years (April 1980 to February 2003). Results Of the 173 cases analyzed, 104 (60. 12 %) were females and 69 (39. 88 %) were males. Age ranged from 4 to 70 years (mean ± SD: 17 ± 9. 53) and most patients were in the second decade of life (n = 86, 49. 42 %); white (n = 124, 71. 68 %). The lower lip was the site most frequently affected by the lesions (n = 135, 78. 03 %), whereas the lowest prevalence was observed for the soft palate, buccal mucosa, and lingual frenum. Conclusion In this study, mucoceles predominated in white female subjects in the second decade of life, with the lower lip being the most frequently affected site. </p...|$|R
50|$|Treatment of ranulas usually {{involves}} {{removal of the}} sublingual gland. Surgery may not be required if the <b>ranula</b> is small and asymptomatic. Marsupialization may sometimes be used, where the intra-oral lesion is opened to the oral cavity {{with the aim of}} allowing the sublingual gland to re-establish connection with the oral cavity.|$|E
50|$|The histologic {{appearance}} {{is similar to}} mucoceles from other locations. The spilled mucin causes a granulation tissue to form, which usually contains foamy histiocytes. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging {{may be useful to}} image the lesion. A small squamous cell carcinoma obstructing the Wharton duct may require clinical examination to be distinguished from a <b>ranula.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{the space}} {{contains}} pus, the usual treatment is by incision and drainage. The {{site of the}} incision is intra-oral, made lateral to sublingual plica. Incision of the plica itself {{can result in a}} <b>ranula,</b> or an incision placed medial to the plica can damage Wharton's duct, the sublingual artery and veins and the lingual nerve.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{location}} {{to find a}} mucocele is the inner surface of the lower lip. It {{can also be found}} on the inner side of the cheek (known as the buccal mucosa), on the anterior ventral tongue, and the floor of the mouth. When found {{on the floor of the}} mouth, the mucocele is referred to as a <b>ranula.</b> They are rarely found on the upper lip. As their name suggests they are basically mucus lined cysts and they can also occur in the Paranasal sinuses most commonly the frontal sinuses, the frontoethmoidal region and also in the maxillary sinus. Sphenoid sinus involvement is extremely rare. When the lumen of the vermiform appendix gets blocked due to any factor, again a mucocele can form.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Comparative {{study to}} {{evaluate}} various surgical methods {{for the treatment}} of <b>ranula.</b> Method: Thirty two patients were retrospectively studied regarding treatment method namely, excision of the <b>ranula,</b> marsupialization, and excision of the <b>ranula</b> combined with sublingual gland removal, recurrence and complications. All available specimens were histologically studied. Result: There were 25 female and 7 male patients. The mean age was 13. 5 years.

40|$|The {{reported}} case describes a mismanaged extensive recurrent plunging <b>ranula</b> that occupied {{a large portion}} of the neck. The <b>ranula</b> is usually clinically diagnosed. However, absence of visible intra-oral signs may mislead the diagnosis and leads to improper surgical management.

The recurrence rate varies according to the procedure performed. Diverse methods of treating <b>ranula</b> have been reported in the literature with variable results. These include marsuplization, excision of the <b>ranula,</b> incision of the <b>ranula</b> and drainage of the contents, excision of the sublingual gland and drainage.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONOral <b>ranula</b> is a {{retention}} cyst {{that arises}} from the salivary gland with recurrence rate of up to 25 % after complete excision of <b>ranula</b> and up to 2 % in case of complete excision of <b>ranula</b> and sublingual gland. Major salivary gland aplasia is a rare finding that is usually associated with other developmental anomalies. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe report a 15 -year-old female patient presented with recurrent intraoral cystic swelling that was documented to be sublingual <b>ranula.</b> CT scan revealed also the absence of right submandibular salivary gland with persistence of its Whartons duct. This combination has never been reported previously. DISCUSSIONThe combination of recurrent sublingual <b>ranula</b> associated with aplasia of ipsilateral submandibular salivary gland and persistence of Whartons duct has never been reported before in the literature, a finding that may provide the base for future research.

40|$|Background: <b>Ranula</b> is a {{retention}} cyst of the sublin-gual gland, which enlarges progressively {{and extends}} {{into the surrounding}} soft tissues. The name “ranula” {{is derived from the}} Latin word “rana ” meaning “frog”. These represent for 6 % of all oral sialocysts. Two variants have described in the literature: simple oral <b>ranula</b> and the deep diving or plunging <b>ranula.</b> The plunging <b>ranula</b> has the potential to spread into deeper parapharyngeal spaces and presents a diag-nostic dilemma due to its clinical similarity with other neck masses such as cystic hygroma, thyroglossal duct cyst, intramuscular hemangioma, cystic/neo-plastic thyroid disease, branchial cyst. We report a case of large oral <b>ranula</b> involving the floor of mouth treated successfully by surgical excision. Case Report: This case report involves an unusually large <b>ranula</b> involving right floor of the mouth in a 30 -year-old female patient. Following detailed clinical examina-tion, radiological interpretation and histopathological diagnosis, surgical excision was performed along with the involved sublingual gland. The patient was fol-lowed up on a regular basis and was disease free. Summary and Conclusion: The best treatment for an oral/simple <b>ranula</b> is excision of the lesion along with the involved gland. This case report involving the floor of the mouth, is interesting and unique due to its unusually large size and the complete treatment ren-dered by us i. e., excision of the lesion along with the involved sublingual gland and the subsequent con-firmation with the histopathological findings...|$|E
40|$|The {{mucocele}} is a mucus extravasation cyst {{arising from}} the salivary gland. Although it is a common?lesion of the minor salivary gland, it is uncommon when it originated from the submandibular gland. The <b>ranula</b> {{is a form of}} mucocele which specifically occurs in the floor of the mouth and the sublingual gland is generally accepted as the origin of <b>ranula.</b> They can be classified into two types based on extent: simple <b>ranula</b> are confined to the sublingual space and plunging <b>ranula</b> extend into the adjacent space. It is difficult to differentiate the submandibular gland mucocele from the plunging <b>ranula</b> because both of them can occupy the submandibular space. A 37 -year old male visited our clinic with the chief complaint of left facial swelling. The patient's history revealed that he had suffered from a cystic lesion {{on the left side of}} the floor of the mouth 10 months previously. He supposed the cystic lesion had come from trauma at other dental clinics. Using CT and MRI, we diagnosed a simple <b>ranula</b> on the sublingual space and a submandibular gland mucocele. We then excised the mucocele with the submandibular gland by an extraoral approach and the sublingual gland by an intraoral approac...|$|E
40|$|Ranulas {{originate}} from the extravasation and subsequent accumulation of saliva from the sublingual gland. If a sali-vary duct is obstructed, secretory back-pressure builds {{leading to a}} duct rupture with mucus being forced into the surrounding tissues. The origin of the <b>ranula</b> was unknown until {{toward the end of}} the twentieth century, when some authors concluded that the <b>ranula</b> arose from the sublin-gual gland. 1, 2 The sublingual gland is a spontaneous secre-tor and produces a continuous flow of mucus even in the absence of nervous stimulation. 3 Ranulas typically have a bluish appearance and a fairly well-circumscribed, soft, painless, fluid-containing intraoral swelling. Most of the patients with <b>ranula</b> present with a gradually enlarging swelling of the floor of the mouth. The swelling is round or oval, and fluctuant. An intraoral swelling accompanied by a submandibular, cervical, and parapharyngeal exten-sion is often defined as plunging <b>ranula.</b> 4 CT scanning plays an important role in the diagnosis of a <b>ranula.</b> 5 - 7 While most simple ranulas involve the sublingual space, the plunging <b>ranula</b> extends to the parapharyngeal space and the cervical space. In rare cases, a plunging <b>ranula</b> can have a subtle septation, which is usually related to a previous surgical treatment or traumatic history. The pre-sent report described a rare case of a giant plunging <b>ranula</b> with several septa and fluid-fluid levels.
