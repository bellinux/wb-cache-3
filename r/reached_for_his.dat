5|$|The {{subsequent}} events {{remain in}} dispute. Henry Davis, a teenage black employee of Oscar Davis, maintained that Odell Waller had fired at Oscar Davis without provocation or warning, hitting him four times. Oscar Davis's sons testified {{that their father}} had stated before he died that Waller had shot him without cause. One son added that Davis had said Waller had continued to shoot after Davis had already fallen to the ground. The testimony of other witnesses, including Waller's relatives, was inconclusive, as they were too distant to hear the conversation between Waller and Davis. Waller stated that Davis had refused to let him take the Waller family share of the wheat, and had <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> pocket as if to draw a gun; Waller then fired on Davis.|$|E
5|$|Earp {{was named}} deputy sheriff {{in the area}} {{including}} newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were {{a considerable number of}} disagreements over mining claims and property rights, which Earp had a part in. On March 28, several feet of snow were still on the ground. Bill Buzzard, a miner of dubious reputation, began constructing a building when one of Wyatt's partners, Jack Enright, tried to stop the construction. Enright claimed the building was on part of his property. Words were exchanged and Buzzard <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> Winchester. He fired several shots at Enright and a skirmish developed. Allies of both sides quickly took defensive positions between snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp and his brother James stepped {{into the middle of the}} fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt. Shoshone County Deputy W. E. Hunt then arrived and ordered the parties to turn over their weapons.|$|E

25|$|He {{was remarkably}} {{consistent}} {{once he had}} won his first team place, {{but when he was}} injured it came about in unusual circumstances. Playing against Middlesex at Lord's, he fell off a chair in the dressing-room as he <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> clothes and broke his wrist, missing the remainder of the summer of 1921. His benefit match in 1922 against Kent at Headingley, Leeds raised £1,891 and he hit the winning runs, after scoring 20 of the 24 required to win, to secure victory by ten wickets. He suffered from sciatica {{in the latter part of}} his career, and he played his last match for Yorkshire in 1927.|$|E
500|$|Black Flag's {{change in}} musical style and {{appearance}} alienated {{many of their}} original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> microphone. Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote [...] "When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of what I {{really want to do}} to them." [...] During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist Michael Azerrad later commented that [...] "his powerful physique was a metaphor for the impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself." [...] Rollins has since replied that [...] "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 8, 1899, John Bad Elk fired several {{shots from}} his pistol from or {{near his home}} on the Pine Ridge Reservation. [...] At the time Bad Elk was {{employed}} as a tribal police officer for the Oglala Lakota Sioux tribe. [...] Captain Gleason, {{who was in charge}} of that part of the reservation, heard the shots and asked Bad Elk to stop by his office to discuss the matter, but Bad Elk did not show up. [...] Gleason then ordered several other tribal police officers to arrest Bad Elk and to take him to the Pine Ridge Agency, about 25 miles away. [...] Three officers contacted Bad Elk, who refused to go with them, telling them that he would go in the morning. [...] The officers then tried to arrest Bad Elk, who shot and killed John Kills Back. [...] Bad Elk claimed that Kills Back had <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> pistol and that Bad Elk fired in self-defense. [...] Kills Back and the other officers did not have an arrest warrant, nor was the offense one that they could arrest for without a warrant.|$|E

500|$|Soon, the {{prominent}} cattlemen sent out an assassination squad to kill Nate Champion {{on the morning}} of November 1, 1891. Champion and another man named Ross Gilbertson were sleeping in a cabin in Middle Fork of Powder River when a group of armed men went inside. Two of them went in while another stood by outside. Champion was immediately awakened by the intrusion, and as the gunmen pointed their weapons at him, Champion <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> own pistol hidden under a pillow and a shootout commenced. Champion successfully shot two of the gunmen; mortally wounding and killing Billy Lykins. The rest of the assassination squad subsequently fled. Champion was left uninjured except for some facial powder burns from the gunfight. In a subsequent investigation of the attack, the names of those involved were leaked to two ranchers: John A. Tisdale and Orley “Ranger” Jones. However, both men were ambushed while they were riding, which outraged many of the small ranchers and farmers in the county. By early 1892, violence had reached something of a peak; newspapers, such as the Big Horn County Rustler, published articles and speculations that a [...] "war" [...] was on the way.|$|E
500|$|In English law, {{an assault}} means {{to act in}} such a way that the {{claimant}} or victim apprehends the application of immediate unlawful force upon themselves. The key elements of the tort are therefore that the defendant acts, and does so {{in such a way}} that the claimant is put in fear of [...] "immediate physical violence". There is no requirement that actual damage be caused. In R v Costanza, the courts held that threats made by a stalker could be assault, while in R v Ireland, the House of Lords said that in the right situation (specifically, harassing phone calls) silence could be enough. In some situations an act which would otherwise be assault can be mitigated by the language used. In Tuberville v Savage, the defendant <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> sword and told the claimant that [...] "if it were not [...] time, I would not take such language from you"; it was held that despite the threatening gesture, this meant the claimant was not in immediate danger. The actions must give the claimant reasonable expectation that the defendant is going to use violence; if a fist was raised in front of the claimant, it could be enough. If the fist was raised from inside a police van following arrest, it would not.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch, Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E

2500|$|The Tacoma and the Indianapolis {{passed a}} little south of Three Tree Point. ... Capt. Coffin pulled down {{a window and}} leaned out in the driving rain.

Coffin <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> own whistle cord. [...] Three long blasts. [...] And he let the last blast die away slowly, until {{it was only a}} moan in the throat of the whistle. [...] “That’s the last time we pass each other,” he said.|$|E
2500|$|The prosecutors' {{theory of}} the case is that the video direct {{evidence}} shows that Mehserle deliberately <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> weapon. They argued: [...] "What {{we see in the}} video is an officer releasing his control of a suspect, standing up, drawing his weapon, with some difficulty, and shooting it." [...] Jacobson agreed in deciding to set bail at $3 million that Mehserle's claim of Taser confusion was inconsistent with his earlier statement to a fellow officer, and that Mehserle might be changing his story. He later imposed a gag order on attorneys and investigators in the case, prohibiting them from releasing future filings or otherwise commenting to the press.|$|E

2500|$|The Slater-Morrill Shoe Company factory {{was located}} on Pearl Street in Braintree, Massachusetts. On April 15, 1920, {{two men were}} robbed and killed while {{transporting}} the company's payroll in two large steel boxes to the main factory. One of them, Alessandro Berardelli—a security guard—was shot four times as he <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> hip-holstered [...]38-caliber, Harrington & Richardson revolver; his gun was not recovered from the scene. The other man, Frederick Parmenter—a paymaster who was unarmed—was shot twice: once {{in the chest and}} a second time, fatally, in the back as he attempted to flee. The robbers seized the payroll boxes and escaped in a stolen dark blue Buick that sped up and was carrying several other men. As the car was being driven away, the robbers fired wildly at company workers nearby.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, Fiore {{seems to}} have {{traveled}} a good deal in northern Italy, teaching fencing and training men for duels. In 1395, Fiore can be placed in Padua training the mercenary captain Galeazzo Gonzaga of Mantua for a duel with the French Marshal Jean II Le Maingre (who used the war name [...] "Boucicaut"). Galeazzo made the challenge when Boucicaut called into question the valor of Italians at the royal court of France, and the duel was ultimately set for Padua on 15 August. Both Francesco Novello da Carrara, Lord of Padua, and Francesco I Gonzaga, Lord of Mantua, were in attendance. The duel was to begin with spears on horseback, but Boucicaut became impatient and dismounted, attacking his opponent before he could mount his own horse. Cattaneo landed a solid blow on the Frenchman's helmet, but was subsequently disarmed. At this point, Boucicaut <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> poleaxe but the lords intervened to end the duel.|$|E
2500|$|At {{around midnight}} on November 7, 1881, Miller was {{drinking}} at Dick Darling's Broadway saloon {{with several of}} his friends including Bill Bowie, George Law Jr., Harry Rice, Charles Crawford and Billy Temple. After an hour, Tracy was seen peeking into the saloon from the front entrance. A few minutes later, he reentered the saloon and {{walked up to the}} bar to order a whiskey sour. He then turned to Miller and said [...] "I came in here to kill you" [...] before drawing a revolver and pointing it at his head before shooting him in the stomach. Miller <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> pistol but collapsed onto the floor. Miller was taken by ambulance to the New York Hospital where he died from his wounds shortly after his arrival. Tracy was arrested and tried for his murder, however he was found not guilty due to perjured testimony and returned to running his saloon.|$|E
