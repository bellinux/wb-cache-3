Balderstone Mill, erected in 1880, was the first organised factory system in the village, its <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> had 320 <b>looms,</b> and the cloth it produced sold on the Manchester Cotton Exchange. The mills closed in 1980.|$|R
50|$|The 1834 mill {{consisted}} of an engine house with detached chimney, a five storey spinning mill and a two storey 60m by 11m <b>weaving</b> <b>shed.</b> The <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> housed 320 <b>looms</b> arranged in rows of four across the building. These {{consisted of}} one loom 2.7 m wide and three 2.1m wide {{with a central}} 0.9 m alley and two wall alleys of 0.4 m. The spinning mill housed twelve mules with 6000 spindles, these would be a mixture and hand operated mules and self- actors. Self- actors could not produce the finest counts at this time. The floor separation is 3.2m. This mill was demolished {{to make way for}} the 1877 Stott mill.|$|R
50|$|The Muzeum Fabryki (Fabric museum) is {{situated}} within the Manufaktura complex {{which was built}} on the 30 hectare site of the industrialist Izrael Poznański. He followed the example of the Lancashire mill owners proving houses and a church and a hospital on-site for his workers. Poznański was a master weaver, by making a good marriage he was able to start employing weavers in cottages he provided. In 1872 he built his first steam driven <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> for power <b>looms</b> on Ogrodowa street. Two storey workers' houses followed. By 1878 he has a house on the corner of Ogrodowa and Zachodnia streets; his new spinning mill was expanded from 3600 spindles to 50,000 spindles. In 1900, he died and his son Ignacy Poznański took over. In 1903 the new house was completed and was known as Poznanski's palace. World War I stopped the expansion, and the interwar years were financial difficult. During World War I the factories were occupied, and on its conclusion the state nationalised the asset. The factories closed in 1992.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> is a {{distinctive}} type of single storey mill {{developed in the}} early 1800s in Lancashire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire to accommodate the new power looms weaving cotton, silk, woollen and worsted. A <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> can be a stand alone mill, or a component of a combined mill. Power looms cause severe vibrations requiring them to be located on a solid ground floor. In the case of cotton, the <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> needs to remain moist. Maximum daylight is achieved, by the sawtooth [...] "north-facing roof lights".|$|R

50|$|The mill was of four-storey construction, {{with a large}} {{single-storey}} <b>weaving</b> <b>shed.</b> After {{the fire}} in 1918 it was remodelled into a single-storey building, space being taken from the <b>weaving</b> <b>sheds</b> for a new preparation area. On closure in 1982 it was reconfigured by Burnley Council, the <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> was partitioned, about a third being used for rentable industrial units, and a similar area being used for visitor facilities. The 37 m chimney and the 60 m x 25 m lodge lay to the south. The boiler house, the engine house and chimney are Scheduled Ancient Monuments. The whole site was granted Grade 1 listed status in 2013 giving protection {{to the rest of}} the building.|$|R
50|$|Cotton weaving {{did take}} place in the village and several <b>weaving</b> <b>sheds</b> were {{constructed}} in the area.|$|R
50|$|<b>Weaving</b> <b>sheds</b> {{added in}} 1836 and 1838 were of two storeys and housed 305 looms. Before the 1830s, {{spinning}} mills produced cotton, that was put-out to hand-loom weavers {{who worked in}} their own homes or small loom shops, like the one Greg owned at Eyam. Hand-loom weaving continued in parallel to power loom weaving throughout the 19th century. Around 1830 the power loom became sufficiently viable for independent <b>weaving</b> <b>sheds</b> to be set up, and for larger owners to add <b>weaving</b> <b>sheds</b> to their spinning mills. A <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> needed the correct light and humidity and a floor that was stable enough to withstand the vibration caused by the picking of many looms. Quarry Bank Mill is of national significance in that it used two-storey side-lit buildings rather the a single storey sheds with a saw-tooth roof. The first two-storey shed at Quarry Bank was 33 m by 6.5 m. The 1838 building was 30 m by 10 m to which a storey was added in 1842 for warping and beaming. In the Gregs pragmatic way, looms were purchased gradually.|$|R
50|$|Trafalgar mill to {{the west}} of Waterloo shed {{is an example of a}} {{combined}} mill- one that did the spinning and then passed the yarn to its own <b>weaving</b> <b>sheds.</b> This was a four-storey stone built in 1840 as mule spinning mill and later extended with attached <b>weaving</b> <b>sheds.</b> Sprinkler systems became essential in the 1880s and a water tank was added. Clock Tower mill, on the north side of the canal east of Sandygate was another. It was built c. 1840 by George Slater; there were four- and five-storey spinning mills by the canal and a six-storey 5-by-9-bay with a clock tower, the <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> was to the east. John Watts (Burnley) Ltd ran the mill from 1890 to the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Bancroft Shed was a <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> in Barnoldswick, Lancashire, England. It is {{situated}} {{on the road to}} Skipton, in Yorkshire was started in 1914 and commissioned in 1920 for James Nutter & Sons Limited. The mill closed in 1979 and was demolished. The engine house, chimneys and boilers were preserved and maintained as a working steam museum. The mill was the last steam driven <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> to be constructed and the last to close.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} shedding {{methods were}} {{developed for the}} harness loom-one where any one harness or combination of harnesses was lifted while the other harnesses remained stationary. This type of loom {{is known as a}} rising <b>shed</b> <b>loom,</b> and examples include the table loom, dobby loom or the Jack loom. The other method used in harness looms is where some harnesses are raised while others are lowered. The second method lessened the effort of lifting the selected harnesses because they no longer needed to be raised as high as in a rising <b>shed</b> <b>loom.</b> Counterbalance and countermarch looms are of this second type.|$|R

50|$|As {{originally}} {{built the}} <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> was about 51 m by 34 m, with the typical north facing roof lights (windows) giving natural light fronted on Burnley Road, by a two storey 9 m wide warehouse. The 1903 extension involved leasing 8000 sqyd m2 of adjoining land {{and building a}} new <b>weaving</b> <b>shed,</b> which housed 990 looms and was 50 m by 46 m, doubling {{the size of the}} <b>weaving</b> floor. This <b>shed</b> is known as top shed or Siberia due to it starting up before the steam heating pipes were working. A new warehouse was built at right angles to the existing one fronting Burnley Road.|$|R
50|$|Opening in 1920, Bancroft Shed {{missed the}} {{profitable}} years. During the Great War, Britain {{lost much of}} its export market, and only the most specialised <b>weaving</b> <b>sheds</b> survived.|$|R
5000|$|Construction {{began in}} 1888. On 1 November 1889, during construction, the factory façade {{collapsed}} due to insecure fixings {{and the wind}} which blew it down. 29 women were killed in adjacent <b>weaving</b> <b>sheds.</b> The building was completed in 1892. (The story of the disaster is carved in a section of stone beneath the base of Templeton Gate, installed during refurbishment work to the area in 2005.) The building was completed in 1892, {{at a cost of}} £20,000 but restoration of the collapsed facade and <b>weaving</b> <b>sheds</b> added £3000 to the building costs.|$|R
5000|$|John William Hartley {{constructed}} a small <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> in Glusburn and a John Horsfall came over from Oxenhope to learn his trade with him. John Horsfall then married John William Hartley's daughter Grace in 1844 {{and at first}} became his partner and then the sole owner of the <b>weaving</b> <b>shed.</b> He was extremely successful and his business grew rapidly. He required more workers, which meant that additional terraced housing was built. The main building of the mill dates from this time, which at its peak employed 500 people.|$|R

50|$|During the {{hostilities}} all manufacture {{was under}} Government control. Buildings were requisitioned {{for the war}} effort, and the quiet spinning mills and <b>weaving</b> <b>sheds</b> of Lancashire were put to other purposes. A good example is how Rover and Rolls-Royce moved into Barnoldswick to produce and later design aero engines. When weaving was re-established in the early 1950s, expectations and attitudes had changed, and the thousand <b>loom</b> <b>sheds</b> such as Queen Street Mill were laid out in eight and ten loom sets and the weavers were on minimum wage contracts. Britain had become a net importer of cotton cloth. Slowly each mill began weaving out. The last mill Bancroft Shed closed in December 1978.|$|R
