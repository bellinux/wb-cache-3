5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a preliminary design review {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|E

5|$|Specifying power levels over 100% {{may seem}} nonsensical, {{but there was}} a logic behind it. The 100% level does not mean the maximum {{physical}} power level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development—the expected <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date. Engine power level affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, which was why power levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Physical-layer network coding (PNC) is an {{effective}} strategy for increasing the throughput of wireless networks. In the current literatures, PNC without <b>rate</b> and <b>power</b> adaptation is mainly focused. Realizing that the transmission efficiency can be improved through <b>rate</b> and <b>power</b> adaptation in wireless networks, this paper focuses on developing a <b>rate</b> and <b>power</b> adaptation scheme for PNC. Through formulating how the data <b>rate</b> and transmission <b>power</b> affect the bit error rate (BER) of involved links in PNC, we observe that with a given data <b>rate,</b> the transmission <b>power</b> has to satisfy some constraints. Using these power constraints, we obtain a candidate set of optimal transmission power. By traversing the candidate set and the data rates supported by nodes, a <b>rate</b> and <b>power</b> adaptation scheme is developed. To test its performance, we apply the proposed scheme into an existing PNC-supported MAC protocol. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve the throughput and delay performance in various scenarios.

40|$|Abstract—Next {{generation}} wireless {{systems will}} be required to support heterogeneous services with different transmission rates that include real time multimedia transmissions, as well as non-real time data transmissions.

However, the aircraft was damaged on 18 June 1935 during its transit to the fly-offs at Wright Field. To compete with the Curtiss Model 75, a single-seat aircraft with retractable undercarriage, Seversky rebuilt the aircraft into the single seat SEV-1XP, replacing the SEV-2XP's fixed landing gear with a retractable undercarriage where the mainwheels retracted backwards into the wing, and an 850hp (634kW) R-1820-G5 replacing the -F3 of the SEV-2XP. The SEV-1XP was delivered to Wright Field on 15 August for evaluation, which was generally successful, although the Cyclone failed to deliver its <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> and the SEV-1XP only reached 289mph (465km/h) rather that the 300mph (483km/h) predicted by Seversky.|$|E
25|$|Airflows {{can be used}} to run {{wind turbines}}. Modern {{utility-scale}} wind turbines range from around 600kW to 5 MW of <b>rated</b> <b>power,</b> although turbines with rated output of 1.5–3 MW have become the most common for commercial use. The largest generator capacity of a single installed onshore wind turbine reached 7.5 MW in 2015. The power available from the wind {{is a function of the}} cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typically full load hours of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually, but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.|$|E

25|$|A {{turbocharger}} remedies {{this problem}} by compressing the air back to sea-level pressures (turbo-normalizing), or even much higher (turbo-charging), {{in order to produce}} <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> at high altitude. Since the size of the turbocharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the turbocharger is oversized for low altitude. The speed of the turbocharger is controlled by a wastegate. Early systems used a fixed wastegate, resulting in a turbocharger that functioned much like a supercharger. Later systems utilized an adjustable wastegate, controlled either manually by the pilot or by an automatic hydraulic or electric system. When the aircraft is at low altitude the wastegate is usually fully open, venting all the exhaust gases overboard. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the wastegate must continuously close in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the wastegate fully closes and the engine still produces full power is the critical altitude. When the aircraft climbs above the critical altitude, engine power output decreases as altitude increases, just as it would in a naturally aspirated engine.|$|E
