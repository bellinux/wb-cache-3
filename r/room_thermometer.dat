Certain aspects of substandard storage conditions existed, in varying degrees, in significant percentages of pharmacies regardless of the pharmacists’ qualifications, experience, or awareness about the local regulations of community pharmacy practice. Stricter monitoring by the authorities regarding the adherence of community pharmacies to optimal conditions of storing medicines is recommended. Continuing education of community pharmacists must also be improved. </p...|$|R

5000|$|A sensor's {{sensitivity}} indicates {{how much}} the sensor's output changes when the input quantity being measured changes. For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1 cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, the sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope Dy/Dx assuming a linear characteristic). Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a <b>room</b> temperature <b>thermometer</b> inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer. Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages.. [...] Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly higher speed and sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches.|$|R

40|$|At the new {{institute}} {{building of}} Fraunhofer ISE, both mechanical and free night ventilation {{is used for}} passive cooling of the offices. The results from a monitoring of room temperatures in 21 office rooms during summer 2002 show that room temperatures exceeds 25 °C in less than 8 % of the working hours, even at high ambient air temperatures. In two offices, experiments were carried out {{in order to determine}} the efficiency of night ventilation dependent on air change rate, solar and internal heat gains. During the experiments, meteorological data, air change rates, air temperatures (incl. three-dimensional temperature field), surface temperatures (floor, ceiling, window, and internal wall) and the operative <b>room</b> temperature (globe <b>thermometer)</b> were measured. The aim is to identify two characteristic building parameters, i. e. the thermal loss factor H and the solar aperture G. Though the night ventilation effect is described only by the thermal loss factor H, the solar aperture G is necessary to determine the complete energy balance for the room. Thus, the night ventilation effect can be separated from other terms in the energy balance. The experiments (one room with and one without night ventilation) are evaluated by using both a parametric model and the ESP-r building simulation programme. While the results from the building simulation match the measurements but deals with many input parameters, the parametric model deals only with two building characteristics and few weather data but does not agree well with measurements at each time step. Therefore, both models are merged in order to develop a method for data evaluation in office buildings with night ventilation and to provide a simple model for integration in a building management system...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That I {{have been}} so well in body and so cheerful in mind ever since I left home--I mean cheerful on the whole, not without seasons of sadness, but so mercifully {{strengthened}} at all times--must, I think, without any foolish enthusiasm, be remembered by me as a special act of God's goodness and mercy. I was not the least weary of the sea. Another month or two would have made very little difference to me, I think. I am very fond of it, and I think of my voyages to come without any degree of dread from that cause, and I {{have no reason to}} expect any great discomfort from any other. I have my whole stock of lemon syrup and lime juice, so that the salt meat on the [...] "Southern Cross" [...] will be counteracted in that way; and going round those islands we shall be ashore every few days. But what most surprises me is this: that when I am alone, as here at night in a great (for it is large) cheerless, lonely room, as I should have thought it once; though I can't help thinking of my own comforts at home, and all dear faces around me, though I feel my whole heart swelling with love to you all, still I am not at all sad or gloomy, or cast down. This does surprise me: I did not think it would or could be so. I have indeed prayed for it, but I had not faith to believe that my prayer would be so granted. The fact itself is most certain. I have at Alfington, when alone of an evening, experienced a greater sense of loneliness than I have once done out here. Of this hitherto I feel no doubt: it may be otherwise any day of course; and to what else can I attribute this fact, in all soberness of mind, but to the mercy of God in strengthening me for my work? Much of it may be the effect of a splendid climate upon my physique, that is true; for indeed to find flowers in full blossom, green meadows, hot suns, birds singing, etc., in midwinter, with a cool, steady breeze from the sea invigorating me all the while, is no doubt just what I require; but to-day we have a north-easter, which answers to your south-west wind, with pouring rain, and yet my spirits are not going down with the barometer. All the same, the said barometer will probably soon recover himself; for I believe these heavy storms seldom last long. There is no fire in the room where I sit, which is the Bishop's room when he is here; no fire-place indeed, as it opens into Mrs. Selwyn's <b>room.</b> The <b>thermometer</b> is 58°, and it is midwinter.' ...|$|R
60|$|These {{were the}} days of rivalry, and even open war, between the two great fur companies, the Hudson's Bay and the North-West. The Admiralty had commended Franklin's expeditions to the companies, who were to be requisitioned for the {{necessary}} supplies. But the disorders of the fur trade, and the demoralization of the Indians, owing to the free distribution of ardent spirits by the rival companies, rendered {{it impossible for the}} party to obtain adequate supplies and stores. Undeterred by difficulties, Franklin set out from Fort Providence to make his way to the Arctic seas {{at the mouth of the}} Coppermine. The expedition reached the height of land between the Great Slave Lake and the Coppermine, on the borders of the country which had been the scene of Hearne's exploits. The northern forest is here reduced to a thin growth of stunted pine and willow. It was now the end of August. The brief northern summer was drawing to its close. It was impossible to undertake the navigation of the Arctic coast till the ensuing summer. Franklin and his party built some rude log shanties which they called Fort Enterprise. Here, after having traversed over two thousand miles in all from York Factory, they spent their second winter in the {97} north. It was a season of great hardship. With the poor materials at their hand it was impossible to make their huts weatherproof. The wind whistled through the ill-plastered seams of the logs. So intense was the winter cold that the trees about the fort froze hard to their centres. In cutting firewood the axes splintered as against stone. In the officers' <b>room</b> the <b>thermometer,</b> sixteen feet from the log fire, marked as low as fifteen degrees below zero in the day and forty below at night. For food the party lived on deer's meat with a little fish, tea twice a day (without sugar), and on Sunday a cup of chocolate as the luxury of the week to every man. But, undismayed by cold and hardship, they kept stoutly at their work. Richardson investigated the mosses and lichens beneath the snow and acquainted himself with the mineralogy of the neighbourhood. Franklin and the two lieutenants carried out observations, their fingers freezing with the cold of forty-six below zero at noon of the brief three-hour day in the heart of winter. Sunday was a day of rest. The officers dressed in their best attire. Franklin read the service of the Church of England to his assembled company. For the French-Canadian Roman Catholics, Franklin did the best he {98} could; he read to them the creed of the Church of England in French. In the leisure part of the day a bundle of London newspapers was perused again and again.|$|R
40|$|Energy savings is a {{frequently}} discussed {{issue in}} today’s society {{and it is}} desirable to save energy with intelligent solutions that does not cost too much and still are reliable. One way to achieve this in the building sector could be by using smarter control and regulation systems for the indoor climate. The feedback system is a regular solution for control and regulation nowadays, where the investigated parameter is measured and compared with a reference value. An alternative method, called feed-forward, has been evaluated and discussed in this master thesis. The idea of the feed-forward system is to predict the forthcoming indoor climate, to prevent a change before it occurs. This is preferably done by using small measurable variations from existing sensors in the <b>room</b> such as <b>thermometers,</b> carbon dioxide sensors, relative humidity sensors and presence sensors. The aim of this thesis {{is to find a}} way to predict a forthcoming increase of the internal heat load, caused by people entering an office room. To find the most suitable parameter or a combination between them for predicting this, a number of tests measuring the mentioned parameters have been performed. The tests were performed at a very flexible test room, in an HVAC-point of view, at Building Services Engineering’s test facility at Chalmers University of Technology. Due to the limitation of the thesis, to only consider internal heat generated by humans, presence is a crucial factor that needs to be examined. Data achieved from the presences sensors does not give enough information, since they only have the ability to tell if someone enters the room and not the number of present people. The response time (dead time) is an important feature of the sensors, which needs to be tested in order to find the parameter that first indicates that people have entered the room. The performed tests show that the carbon dioxide concentration was the fastest parameter to respond compared to the other measured parameters. This means that there is a potential in predicting a temperature raise, caused by internal heat generated by humans, by measuring the carbon dioxide concentration. The idea is to use this prediction to improve the system and thereby raise the thermal indoor climate and at the same time save energy...|$|R
