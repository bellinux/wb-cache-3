Soon, Michael finds out, through her, where the Others are and decides to leave her in search for his son, Walt (Malcolm David Kelley). Mr. Eko and Jin find Michael, leading him back to Libby and the group and {{allowing}} them to start their journey. During their trek in [...] "Abandoned", numerous tragedies occur, including the mysterious disappearance of Cindy {{and the death of}} Shannon (Maggie Grace).

They asked for nothing but what they were entitled to, and what she had taught them to prize as their dearest inheritance.

60|$|All animals, when feeble with age, or sickly, or wounded, {{have the}} habit of going away deep into the loneliest coverts, and there lying down where the leaves shall {{presently}} cover them. So that one rarely finds a dead bird or animal in the woods where thousands die yearly. Even your dog, that was born and lived by your house, often disappears when you thought him too feeble to walk. Death calls him gently; the old wolf stirs deep within him, and he goes away where the master he served will never find him. And so with your cat, which is only skin-deep a domestic animal; and so with your canary, which in death alone would be free, and beats his failing wings against the cage in which he lived so long content. But these all go away singly, each to his own place. The caribou is the only animal I know that <b>remembers,</b> <b>when</b> his separation comes, the ties which bound him to the herd winter after winter, through sun and storm, in the forest where all was peace and plenty, and on the lonely barrens where the gray wolf howled on his track; so that he turns with his last strength from the herd he is leaving to the greater herd which has gone before him--still following his leaders, remembering his first lesson to the end.|$|E

But though her Ladyship hath the sweetest voice, both in {{speaking}} and singeing (she plays the church organ, and singes there most beautifully), I cannot think Gammer Jenkins can have any comfort from it, being very deaf, by reason of her great age. She has her memory perfectly, however, and <b>remembers</b> <b>when</b> my honoured Grandmother Rachel Lady Castlewood lived here. She says, my Grandmother was the best woman in the whole world, gave her a cow when she was married, and cured her husband, Gaffer Jenkins, of the collects, which he used to have very bad. I suppose {{it was with the}} Pills and Drops which my honoured Mother put up in my boxes, when I left dear Virginia. Having never been ill since, have had no use for the pills. Gumbo hath, eating and drinking a great deal too much in the Servants' Hall. The next angel to my Grandmother (N.B. I think I spelt angel wrong per last), Gammer Jenkins says, is Lady Maria, who sends her duty to her Aunt in Virginia, and remembers her, and my Grandpapa and Grandmamma when they were in Europe, and she was a little girl. You know they have Grandpapa's picture here, and I live in the very rooms which he had, and which are to be called mine, my Lord Castlewood says.|$|E
6000|$|We have beheld {{her as the}} maid, the wife, the widow; now we see her in a {{separate}} and insulated character; she was, in all her attributes, Nurse Toothaker. And Nurse Toothaker alone, with her own shrivelled lips, could make known her experience in that capacity. What a history might she record of the great sicknesses, in which she has gone {{hand in hand with}} the exterminating angel! She <b>remembers</b> <b>when</b> the small-pox hoisted a red banner on almost every house along the street. She has witnessed when the typhus fever swept off a whole household, young and old, all but a lonely mother, who vainly shrieked to follow her last loved one. Where would be Death's triumph, if none lived to weep? She can speak of strange maladies that have broken out, as if spontaneously, but were found to have been imported from foreign lands, with rich silks and other merchandise, the costliest portion of the cargo. And once, she recollects, the people died of what was considered a new pestilence, till the doctors traced it to the ancient grave of a young girl, who thus caused many deaths a hundred years after her own burial. Strange that such black mischief should lurk in a maiden's grave! She loves to tell how strong men fight with fiery fevers, utterly refusing to give up their breath; and how consumptive virgins fade out of the world, scarcely reluctant, as if their lovers were wooing them to a far country. Tell us, thou fearful woman! tell us the death-secrets! Fain would I search out the meaning of words, faintly gasped with intermingled sobs, and broken sentences, half audibly spoken between earth and the judgment-seat! ...|$|E

6000|$|Coming {{to later}} times, Buffon (20/82. The passage is given 'Bull. Soc. d'Acclimat.' 1858 page 11.) on {{comparing}} the flowers, fruit, and vegetables {{which were then}} cultivated with some excellent drawings made {{a hundred and fifty}} years previously, was struck with surprise at the great improvement which had been effected; and remarks that these ancient flowers and vegetables would now be rejected, not only by a florist but by a village gardener. Since the time of Buffon the work of improvement has steadily and rapidly gone on. Every florist who compares our present flowers with those figured in books published not long since, is astonished at the change. A well-known amateur (20/83. 'Journal of Horticulture' 1862 page 394.), in speaking of the varieties of Pelargonium raised by Mr. Garth only twenty-two years before, remarks, [...] "What a rage they excited: surely we had attained perfection, it was said; and now not one of the flowers of those days will be looked at. But none the less is the debt of gratitude which we owe to those who saw what was to be done, and did it." [...] Mr. Paul, the well-known horticulturist, in writing of the same flower (20/84. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1857 page 85.), says he <b>remembers</b> <b>when</b> young being delighted with the portraits in Sweet's work; [...] "but what are they in point of beauty compared with the Pelargoniums of this day? Here again nature did not advance by leaps; the improvement was gradual, and if we had neglected those very gradual advances, we must have foregone the present grand results." [...] How well this practical horticulturist appreciates and illustrates the gradual and accumulative force of selection! The Dahlia has advanced in beauty in a like manner; the line of improvement being guided by fashion, and by the successive modifications which the flower slowly underwent. (20/85. See Mr. Wildman's address to the Floricult. Soc. in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1843 page 86.) A steady and gradual change has been noticed in many other flowers: thus an old florist (20/86. 'Journal of Horticulture' October 24, 1865 page 239.), after describing the leading varieties of the Pink which were grown in 1813 adds, [...] "the pinks of those days would now be scarcely grown as border- flowers." [...] The improvement of so many flowers and the number of the varieties which have been raised is all the more striking when we hear that the earliest known flower-garden in Europe, namely at Padua, dates only from the year 1545.
