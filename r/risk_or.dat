5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable <b>risk</b> <b>or</b> harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that <b>risk</b> <b>or</b> experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E

5|$|In many European {{countries}} (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) the <b>risk</b> <b>or</b> {{dose limit}} for {{a member of}} the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10,000 years after closure. Moreover, the U.S. EPA’s proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit.|$|E

5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional <b>risk</b> <b>or</b> uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{analyses}} {{show that}} detours that increase flight distance {{by up to}} 20% will often be adaptive on aerodynamic grounds – a bird that loads itself with food to cross a long barrier flies less efficiently. However some species show circuitous migratory routes that reflect historical range expansions and are far from optimal in ecological terms. An example is the migration of continental populations of Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus, which fly far east across North America before turning south via Florida to reach northern South America; this route {{is believed to be}} the consequence of a range expansion that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Detours may also be caused by differential wind conditions, predation <b>risk,</b> <b>or</b> other factors.|$|E
