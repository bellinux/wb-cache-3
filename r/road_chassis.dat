40|$|Load data {{representing}} severe customer usage {{is needed}} throughout a chassis development program; {{the majority of}} these chassis loads originate with the excitation from the <b>road.</b> These <b>chassis</b> loads are increasingly derived from vehicle simulations, however simulating a vehicle traversing long roads is impractical and a method to produce short roads with given characteristics must be developed. The first step is to consider the road to be a realization of an underlying stochastic process. There are many methods currently available to characterize roads when they are assumed to be homogeneous (see [1], for example). The issue of nonstationarity that arises when a vehicle traverses a homogenous road at a varying speed has also been discussed [2, 3]. Recent work shows that rough roads that are of interest for durability predictions are not homogeneous, however [4]. This work is focused on the characterization of rough roads for durability predictions. The objective of this work is to determine the correlation between road profile measurement points and to determine if an interval of influence exists. That is, this work establishes the interval of influence for typical rough highways in the United States. This interval can then be used in subsequent stochastic models of the road topology.

40|$|Abstract- A Vehicle is a Structural Assembly which {{consists}} of many components coupled together to make the vehicle to run on initial conditions as well as under various load conditions. Vehicles are designed to carry loads like trucks, buses and cars. Different types of vehicles with wide variety of its applications {{are present in the}} market which capacity varies from 1 Tonne to 40 Tonnes and more. The present scenario in automotive industry is an increase in demand of trucks not only on the cost and weight aspects but also on improved complete vehicle features and overall work performance. The chassis {{plays an important role in}} the design of any truck. The chassis design in general is a complex methodology and to arrive at a solution which yields a good performance is a tedious task. Since the chassis has a complex geometry and loading patterns, there is no well-defined analytical procedure to analyze the chassis. So the numerical method of analysis is adopted, in which Finite Element Technique is most widely used method. Vehicle chassis is an important part which supports the major load of the vehicle assembly. As vehicle chassis plays a vital role, its design has to be subjected to Structural Analysis to validate against all the possible cases of load applications and failures to strengthen the design.

40|$|To further improve fuel {{consumption}} of future trucks {{and to be}} able to measure the gains obtained from new inventions, accurate test methods have to be defined. The three main tests currently used at Volvo are: <b>road</b> testing, <b>chassis</b> dynamometer and computer simulations. In this project the three {{fuel consumption}} test methods are evaluated with the Volvo FH and its main rivals to get an indication of the results reliability. If the test gives different fuel consumptions but has similar percentage differences between the trucks a fixed relation between test methods is obtained. The <b>chassis</b> dynamometer’s <b>road</b> load is based on the measured force at the vehicle for every vehicle speed. To find this relation a coast down test for each truck is performed; the test is based on continuous logging of vehicle speed and time while driving the equipage at neutral gear from 85 - 16 km/h. The tests were done in February and consequently weather influenced the results, with wet tracks, winds and low temperatures. The road tests were carried out in April with less restrictive environment, but also using bedded tires and different trailers. The resulting fuel consumption at the Lv-Bo-Lv (Landvetter-Borås-Landvetter) duty cycle for each truck were without exception lower for the road tests compared to the chassis dynamometer results. The percentage difference between the tests were not constant for the different trucks but rather close to the difference in-between trucks attained from the coast downs at full speed, which reflects the Lv-Bo-Lv duty cycle well, (except for the road inclinations). This proves that the coast downs’ were influenced by non-truck specific matters. Great care must be taken during preparation of vehicles prior to fuel consumption and driving resistance tests. Weather influences the results the most and has to be measurably stable between the different tests. The vehicles have to be accurately prepared with similar tires, correctly adjusted deflectors, same trailer and engines with the similar specifications and wear. At the conducted tests several of previously mentioned issues were omitted, the results were therefore heavily affected, finally suggestions for future testing has been established...|$|R
40|$|Product {{development}} in automotive industry is still deeply based on experimentation: test benches and road test facilities are used both for components testing and models validation. Nevertheless a growing role {{is played by}} numerical simulation and nowdays by virtual experimentation. The latter is required by the increasing complexity of the systems and cost saving. Moreover new products involve {{a higher level of}} integration between mechanics, electronics and computer science, which makes difficult a rapid and low cost prototyping. The design of the vehicle is currently applied to the overall system instead of assembling subsystems separately developed and tested. This approach requires that the same level of integration is achieved on numerical codes and simulators, to be able to operate hardware and software for virtual experimentation in mechatronic systems. This paper briefly describes the experience done since few years, by Fiat Auto and Politecnico di Torino (Dept. Mechanics) in developing methods and codes for vehicle dynamics modeling, also in presence of active devices for driver assistance. Several models have been assessed and validated and look suitable to support simultaneously <b>road</b> testing and <b>chassis</b> design, as well as education and entrainement of specialized teams. Numerical and experimental results are shown to describe the level of approximation achieved in vehicle dynamics prediction. Preferred environments of codes development have been MATLAB and SIMULINK, eventually operated in co-simulation with other products, like ADAMS Car (MDI) and SWIFT-TYRE (TNO). This allows having a lighter code, open for improvements, quite popular and known both for road test technicians and designers.

40|$|As {{one of the}} brake-induced {{noises and}} vibrations, hot judder is forced vibration, which is caused by {{unevenness}} of the brake disc due to the thermal mechanical interactions in wheel brakes. Brake disc unevenness is normally described and evaluated as the Disc Thickness Variation (DTV) and the disc’ Lateral Run-Out (LRO). DTV and LRO gener-ate Brake Pressure Variation (BPV) and Brake Torque Variation (BTV) in wheel brakes, which are transmitted to the driver and perceived by the driver as the brake pedal pulsa-tion, the steering wheel oscillation, the car body vibrations, and low-frequency drone noises inside a vehicle. Hot judder is characterized by hot spots on the disc surfaces. The frequency of hot judder {{is dependent on the}} wheel rotational speed, showing order behaviors. The num-ber of hot spots generally corresponds to the dominant order of hot judder. In the last decades, most of the hot judder tests have been carried out with brake dynamometers, and high numbers (typically around 10) of hot spots were found in the majority of the tests. The generation and development mechanisms of the high dominant order have been almost the exclusive focus of current hot judder researches. However, the influ-ences of the vibrations and noises (with higher frequencies compared with the low-order cold judder) caused by high-order hot judder on the driver’s subjective perception have been still not clarified. That is to say, it is still unknown in which form and under which conditions, the high-order hot judder can be transmitted to and perceived by the driver, and thus causing customer complaints. A top-down approach is used in order to investigate the influences of high-order judder on driver’s perception with respect to two aspects: the incidence of high-order hot jud-der in vehicle tests and the drivers’ perception of high-order hot judder. The first aspect is mainly investigated by studying the transferability of dynamometer tests to vehicle tests and by identifying the incidence of high-order hot judder in production brakes. Specifically, identical brakes from one front brake and one rear brake are separately tested with a brake dynamometer and through vehicle tests by means of <b>road</b> tests and <b>chassis</b> dynamometer tests, and all brakes of four production passengers are identified with accelerometers attached on the brake caliper and the caliper bracket. The perception of high-order hot judder is chiefly studied by investigating its transfer behaviors. Global transfer functions from BPV/BTV to the selected driver interface quantities (brake pedal pulsation, steering wheel oscillation, seat track vibrations, and vehicle interior drone noise) are defined, which establish the links between the hot judder intensity in the wheel brake and the intensity at the driver interface. In order to identify the transfer functions with a high signal-noise-ratio and better reproducibility, a novel testing method is adopted: vehicle tests with brake discs that are artificially modi-fied with the desired surface shapes simulating the high-order DTV/LRO. Altogether three vehicles with seven different modified discs are tested. Two critical levels of drone noise (60 and 80 dB(A)) are selected according to the general vehicle total noise level and the human’s perception characteristics of sound. The perception threshold values of the driver interface vibrations are obtained through regression analysis between their subjective ratings and objective measurements. Based on the critical drone noise levels and the threshold values of vibrations, as well as the global transfer functions, threshold values of BPV and BTV for perceiving the high-order judder are computed. Concerning the incidence of high-order judder, both the dominant order and the thermal increases of BTV and BPV for the dominant order showed great discrepancies in differ-ent test types (e. g. brake dynamometer or vehicle, drag braking application with con-stant velocity and constant pressure/torque or stop braking application with decreasing velocity and constant deceleration/pressure). Hot judder behaviors in the brake dyna-mometer test were not transferable to the vehicle tests. Besides, no evident high-order hot judder has been identified in all the brakes of the four passenger cars. Generally, hot judder seems to be more likely to be excited at the brake dynamometer than in the vehi-cles. Therefore, brake dynamometer test is still appropriate for detecting hot judder in the early phase of brake development, and thus preventing its occurrence in the vehicle. Regarding the driver’s perception, the drone noise is the most probable reason leading to customer complaints, since higher than 100 Hz less than 10 Nm BTV is required to perceive the drone noise and 50 Nm BTV can already result in unacceptable drone noise. The driver is less sensitive to the vibrations caused by high-order judder. Roughly at least 20 Nm BTV or 2. 5 bar BPV is needed for perceiving the vibrations, and the perception is most possibly due to the steering wheel oscillation or the vertical vehicle vibration. Moreover, some resonances in the transfer paths {{play a significant role in}} the high-order judder transmission. Although the investigations in this work are limited to three vehicles, the practical significance of high-order hot judder on the driver’s percep-tion is revealed for the first time. With these results, the impact of the measured BTV and BPV of hot judder, e. g. in the brake dynamometer tests, can be assessed. Combining these results, the most effective and efficient way to mitigate the high-order hot judder would be reducing its occurrences in the wheel brakes and diminishing the prominent resonances in the transfer paths...|$|R
