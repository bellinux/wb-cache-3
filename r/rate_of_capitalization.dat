50|$|Capitalization, {{in their}} theory, {{is a measure}} of power, as {{illuminated}} through the present discounted value of future earnings (while also taking into account hype and risk). This formula is basic to finance which is the overarching logic of capitalism. The logic is also inherently differential as every capitalist strives to accumulate greater earnings than their competitors (but not profit maximization). Nitzan and Bichler label this process differential accumulation.

40|$|The {{essence of}} the idea of human capital is of "investment in people" in order to improve their productivity. Education and health costs are {{generated}} in the hope of future benefits, hence the term "human capital investment". In general, the human capital is treated as an investment. Moreover, the investment is a continuous one, targeting either the development (training or continuous education courses, for example) or to maintain the capital stock (regular medical appointments, for example). Accepting numerous studies published in the last decades regarding the human capital, we will mention education as a main factor contributing to the training and development of individuals. The costs of education are investments in the human capital, investments that assure the accumulation and avoidance of its depreciation. In countries, there is a consensus, that parts of the level of government investment include also the need for investment in educational services, governments undoubtedly playing a central role in directing the formation and development of human capital. We need to invest in human capital, doubly so as that the investment in education is a profitable one, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> of the investment in education ranging from 5 - 30 %, according to OECD statistics...|$|E
40|$|The new {{revision}} of the land register is intended to give each real estate unit an assessed value which approximates the market value. The provided approach has statistical nature. However, {{in the absence of}} a well-established market, the coming reform requires the use of the indirect estimation procedure. This paper proposes a method for estimating the capitalization rate that could usefully be applied in mass appraisal. The proposed model for the evaluation of the capitalization rate is intended as an alternative to traditional inferential processes that apply in real estate market. It can be used even in market segments that are not enough active and does not require the use of technical adjustments assigned from estimators. The procedure is based on a speculative-financial real estate market model. According to this model real factors and monetary factors affect the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>capitalization.</b> In addition, it assumes that market prices are formed by a process of synthesis of economic-social and personal services. For cadastral purposes it is necessary to purify the market values experienced by these individual influences in order to estimate the average market value. In this paper, the application of a specific multi-criteria approach for estimating capitalization rate is tested. The method is based on the consideration of the mutual influences of the factors that determine capitalization rates. It aims to objectify property values which, by their own nature, are partly subjective. The procedure is applicable to urban and extra-urban micro and macro-estimation and it is based on the UTA approach and on the fuzzy measures theory...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a number}} of issues related to the treatment of trade credit internationally, a priori (treatment by banking regulators) and a posteriori (treatment by debtors and creditors in the case of default), which are currently of interest to the trade finance community, in particular the traditional providers of trade credit and guarantees, such as banks, export credit agencies, regional development banks, and multilateral agencies. The paper does not deal with the specific issue of regulation of official insured-export credit, under the OECD Arrangement, which is a specific matter left out of this analysis. Traditionally, trade finance has received preferred treatment on the part of national and international regulators, as well as by international financial agencies in the treatment of trade finance claims, on grounds that trade finance was one of the safest, most collateralized, and self-liquidating forms of trade finance. Preferred treatment of trade finance also reflects the systemic importance of trade, as in sovereign or private defaults a priority is to treat expeditiously trade lines of credits to allow for such credit to be restored and trade to flow again. It is not only a matter of urgency for essential imports to be financed, but also a pre-condition for economic recovery, as the resumption of trade is necessary for ailing countries to restore balance of payments equilibrium. The relatively favourable treatment received by trade finance was reflected in the moderate <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> for cross-border trade credit in the form of letters of credit and similar securitized instruments under the Basel I regulatory framework, put in place in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. However, as the banking and regulatory communities moved towards internal-rating based and risk-weighted assets systems under the successor Basel II framework, {{a number of}} complaints emerged with respect to the treatment of trade credit particularly in periods of crisis. Issues of pro-cyclicality, maturity structure and country risk have been discussed at some length in various fora, including in the WTO at the initiative of Members. Part of the issue was that Basel II regulation was designed and implemented in a manner that, in periods of banking retrenchment, seemed to have affected the supply of trade credit more than other potentially more risky forms of lending. With the collapse of trade in late 2008 and early 2009, the regulatory treatment of trade credit under Basel II clearly became an issue and was discussed by professional banking organizations, regulators and international financial institutions. A sentence made its headway into the communiqu 9 of G- 20 Leaders in London in April 2009, calling upon regulators to exercise some flexibility in the application of Basel II rules, in support of trade finance. As the issue of removing the obstacles to the supply of trade finance spread became part of the public debate, discussions with respect to the regulatory treatment of trade finance {{in the context of the}} making of Basel III rules are now raising political attention...|$|E
40|$|Both the {{numerator}} and denominator <b>of</b> {{real estate}} <b>capitalization</b> <b>rates</b> may experience {{different degrees of}} movement as markets evolve from one phase of the cycle to another. Capitalization rate interpretations become especially difficult surrounding these turning points. The issue takes two forms. First, periods of market transformation create confusion about what cap rate to apply. Opportunities may occur at turning points to introduce substantially different numerator estimates, which results in multiple capitalization rates for the same property and thus compromises the decision rules of modern investment theory. Second, simultaneous changes in its components (i. e., riskfree rate, risk premium and expected growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> income) cause <b>capitalization</b> <b>rates</b> to change, sometimes in unpredictable ways.

The research aims are to evaluate the growth and development of existing financial instruments and to recommend for introducing new financial instruments in the capital market of Bangladesh. The data are taken from the Dhaka stock exchange for the year 1977 to 2010 for interpretation of development and the data from 2003 to 2010 are taken for analysis and hypothesis test. There are only five products traded including three types of bonds.

40|$|The {{properties}} of income-to-price ratios in asset markets have potentially far reaching implications for understanding investor behavior. Prevailing levels of {{commercial real estate}} (CRE) capitalization rates, similar to price / earnings ratios for stocks and owner equivalent rent-to-price relatives for houses, may foretell future investment returns and income growth rates. In CRE capitalization rate models, rent growth rates often proxy for the net operating income (NOI) growth <b>rates.</b> Empirical studies <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> <b>rate</b> predictive powers produce inconsistent results that may be due either {{to the use of}} these rent growth proxies, model misspecification, or both.

40|$|Theories of society, as of nature, are {{characterized}} by their elementary particles. The elementary particle of neoclassical economics is the util. The elementary particle of classical Marxism is abstract labour. These elementary particles represent material quanta. They are deemed useful because both neoclassical economics and classical Marxism analyze capitalism {{as a mode of}} production and consumption. In this paper we offer a different approach. We argue that, most broadly, capitalism should be seen not as a mode of production, but a mode of power. From a viewpoint of power, utils and abstract labour are useless. They represent absolute magnitudes, whereas power is inherently relative. To understand the capitalist mode of power we need new elementary particles. The basic unit of analysis we begin with is differential capitalization. Capitalization represents the present value of expected future earnings (ex-post future earnings modified by investors 2 ̆ 019 hype), which in turn are corrected for risk perceptions and discounted by the normal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return. Differential <b>capitalization</b> benchmarks the <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> any owner or group of owners against the average owner.

40|$|Enlightened by {{the theory}} of Tiebout and Hamilton about {{property}} tax as a benefit tax and the new view reformulated by George R. Zodrow and Peter Mieszkowski, this dissertation seeks to study the <b>capitalization</b> and regressivity <b>of</b> Government <b>Rates</b> in Hong Kong, which have already existed for 165 years {{in the city and}} are equivalent to property tax mentioned in western literature. Since both Hong Kong and Mainland China share the same structure of land lease system, it is meaningful to study the implications <b>of</b> <b>Rates</b> in the property market in Hong Kong at the juncture of a new wave of property tax reform in China commencing with the latest property tax experiment in two major cities: Chongqing and Shanghai. 　　This dissertation first reviews the history and describes the roles <b>of</b> Government <b>Rates</b> in the financial revenue and expenditure system of the Hong Kong Government to get a clear picture <b>of</b> where <b>Rates</b> are from, how they are collected and where they have been spent on. Meanwhile, effects <b>of</b> <b>Rates</b> and public expenditures on local residential property values of different classes during the year 1974 - 2008 are examine by applying time series of housing price index, percentage <b>of</b> <b>Rates</b> charge, and public expenditure, etc. Furthermore, in order to test whether Hamilton’s intra-jurisdictional capitalization exists, transaction data of the year 2000 from EPRC are employed to examine whether low income housing (small units) sells at relatively higher price compared with high income housing (large units) due to the fiscal surplus. The empirical results show no <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rates</b> but <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> public goods exists and the Rates payment is shifted forward into the housing price. We find out that Rates in Hong Kong is not a capital tax, and actually it is a benefit tax and user fee paid for public goods. The last part of the dissertation concludes valuable lessons for the property tax reform in Mainland China. ii 2 published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
