In addition, 11 United States Colored Troops were organized in Philadelphia. During the war, between 89,000 and 90,000 Philadelphians were on enlistment rolls.

500|$|The {{original}} Volunteers' Corps {{went out}} of service in December 1918, soon after German defeat and Transylvania's de facto union (see Great Union Day).

They call the Corps' April 26 meeting a [...] "1st Alba Iulia". Within Transylvania itself, opinion was more divided. Shortly before the Hungarian–Romanian War erupted, members of Corps were required to present themselves for <b>reenlistment.</b> The old rivals from within the Romanian National Party, who led the Directory Council of Transylvania after 1918, allegedly refused to welcome the Corps back as a single unit, and plans for its mobilization had to be dropped.

500|$|Town Point Park in {{downtown}} plays host {{to a wide}} variety of annual events from early spring through late fall. Harborfest, the region's largest annual festival, celebrated its thirtieth anniversary in 2006. It is held during the first weekend of June and celebrates the region's proximity and attachment to the water. The Parade of Sail (numerous tall sailing ships from around the world form in line and sail past downtown before docking at the marina), music concerts, regional food, and a large fireworks display highlight this three-day festival. Bayou Boogaloo and Cajun Food Festival, a celebration of the Cajun people and culture, had small beginnings. This three-day festival during the third week of June has become one of the largest in the region and, in addition to serving up Cajun cuisine, also features Cajun music. Norfolk's Fourth of July celebration of American independence contains a spectacular fireworks display and a special Navy <b>reenlistment</b> ceremony. The Norfolk Jazz Festival, though smaller by comparison to some of the big city jazz festivals, still manages to attract the country's top jazz performers. It is held in August. The Town Point Virginia Wine Festival has become a showcase for Virginia-produced wines and has enjoyed increasing success over the years. Virginia's burgeoning wine industry has become noted both within the United States and on an international level. The festival has grown with the industry. Wines can be sampled and then purchased by the bottle and/or case directly from the winery kiosks. This event takes place during the third weekend of October.

2500|$|The {{first section}} of the book's third chapter follows up on the [...] "handful of {{animated}} humus" [...] metaphor, restructuring it as the {{point of departure for}} an imaginary dialogue the writer carries out with himself. It offers additional detail on the general history of Humulești, an account leading {{as far back as the}} Polish–Ottoman War of 1672–1676, and briefly mentioning the passage of Austrians on their quest to find the beautiful princess Natalia (events which the writer claims to have witnessed himself). This exposition leads the narrator to conclude that the place of his birth [...] "do not live like a bear in its lair". His statement serves to introduce the next period in Nică's life: his <b>reenlistment</b> in school, which this time around is a new institution founded on the orders of Moldavian Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, and presided upon by theologian Isaia [...] "Popa Duhu" [...] Teodorescu. There follows a detailed rendition of Ghica's opening speech, as witnessed by Creangă himself. The story then focuses on Teodorescu, his methods for teaching arithmetic rules such as cross-multiplication, and his apparent despondency when faced with students such as Nică Oșlobanu (depicted as unruly and egotistic). This attitude leads to conflict between Teodorescu and parson Niculai Oșlobanu, the boy's father. Enhanced by a quarrel over theological and administrative matters, it culminates with Oșlobanu and his subordinate monks chasing Teodorescu out of their establishment.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of his enlistment, a Carabinier signs his first {{contract}} for five years which is validated after a period of instruction, and confirmation period in which ability and motivation are verified.

A Carabinier can pursue his career and commitments by successive <b>reenlistments</b> after each five years of service until reaching age 55, subjecting to meet all the conditions of fitness. Promotion on merit allows a number of Carabiniers to reach the various grades of noncommissioned officers. However, a very low turnover rate of enlistments means that 50% finish their military career as a Carabinier first or second class.|$|R

40|$|Background: Child {{soldiers}} are often both victims and perpetrators of horrendous acts of violence. Research with former child soldiers has consistently shown {{that exposure to}} violence is linked to trauma-related disorders and that living in a violent environment is correlated with enhanced levels of aggression. Objective: To gain more insight into the experiences and the mental health status of former child soldiers, we conducted a survey with N 200 former child soldiers and adult combatants in the DR Congo. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews concerning military experiences, experienced and perpetrated violence, and mental health. Results: Former child soldiers reported more experienced and perpetrated violence, a greater severity of trauma-related suffering, as well as higher appetitive aggression than adult ex-combatants. Appetitive aggression was related to more perpetrated violence, higher military ranks, voluntary recruitment and higher rates of <b>reenlistments</b> in former child soldiers. Conclusions: Our results indicate that growing up in an armed group is related {{to higher levels of}} trauma-related disorders and aggressive behavior. This may explain the challenge of reintegrating former child soldiers. It is thus important to consider mental health problems, particularly trauma-related disorders an...|$|R
5000|$|On 28 August 1632, on the {{initiative}} of Philip IV, a special Corps of troops was ordered to be formed with veteran soldiers, <b>reenlistments</b> and Knights of noble ancestry - men so skilled that they only took arms when the Monarch assumed command in person, designating it [...] "King's Guard Colonelship." [...] Its organization commenced in Almansa in 1634, its force fixed at fifteen companies with 90 harquebusiers, 40 musketeers, and 60 corslets and pikemen each. Later, in 1638, it was augmented to twenty. Its first Colonel, Count Duke of Olivares, Don Gaspar de Guzmán, whose post was the recently created [...] "King's Guard Colonelship," [...] was in command of very distinguished soldiers of great renown. In 1640, Philip IV elevated it to the category of King's Guard Regiment and in 1664 to Castile Tercio.
