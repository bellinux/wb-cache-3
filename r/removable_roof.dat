25|$|The third {{generation}} Corvette, patterned after the Mako Shark II concept car, was introduced for the 1968 model {{year and was}} in production until 1982. C3 coupes featured the first use of T-top <b>removable</b> <b>roof</b> panels. It introduced monikers that were later revived, such as LT-1, ZR-1, Z07 and Collector Edition. In 1978, the Corvette's 25th anniversary was celebrated with a two-tone Silver Anniversary Edition and an Indy Pace Car replica edition of the C3. This {{was also the first}} time that a Corvette was used as a Pace Car for the Indianapolis 500.|$|E
25|$|The G class {{featured}} imported General Motors-Electro-Motive Division technology (prime mover, alternator and traction motors) on {{a locally}} designed frame and body. Major advances introduced {{with the class}} included cab air conditioning, onboard toilet, Trimount type high adhesion bogies, and Super Series wheel creep control to enable heavier loads to be hauled. The locomotives were designed to be of minimum mass, allowing a higher fuel load. The body consists of two side trusses with load bearing supports, roofbows and integral cabs. The side panels are made of fibreglass for the minimum weight, with various accessories mounted in <b>removable</b> <b>roof</b> hatches.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Ajax {{moved to}} a new home ground in the {{southeast}} of the city known as the Amsterdam Arena. This was built by the Amsterdam city authority at a cost of $134 million. The stadium is capable of holding approximately 52,000 spectators. The average attendance in 2006–07 was 48,610, rising in the next season to 49,128. The Arena has a retractable roof and set a trend for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the Arena has earned a reputation for a terrible grass pitch caused by the <b>removable</b> <b>roof</b> that, even when open, takes away too much sunlight and fresh air. During the 2008–09 season, ground staff introduced an artificial lighting system that has finally reduced this problem considerably.|$|E
50|$|The first open-top buses with <b>removable</b> <b>roofs</b> and 65 transit buses {{were put}} into service on 6 September 2011, all under the name City Master. The rest of the buses, as well as another 15 {{cabriolet}} buses with <b>removable</b> <b>roofs</b> ordered in late 2011.|$|R

2500|$|Built by Los Angeles metalshop, Cartel Customs, and {{displayed}} at 2014 SEMA show, this concept car {{is the first}} targa top version of any 86-based models. Apart from the Porsche 911-style <b>removable</b> <b>roof,</b> it features upgraded and lowered coil-over suspension, 19-in forged chrome wheels, upgrade braking system and a turbocharged engine with a centre exhaust tip. Inside it has an upgraded sound system and two-tone beige/black leather interior (including over the dashboard). The exterior is characterised by enlarged wheelarches and an integrated [...] "duck tail" [...] rear spoiler, and is painted in two-tone Azzurro California Blue with a contrasting black sill line {{up to the roof}} and rear louvre window.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} this type of {{building}} remains largely unexplored by serious historians. Even in contemporary Italian fortress construction, <b>removable</b> <b>roofs</b> or light roof structures have been documented e.g. at the [...] in Florence. In the sixteenth century, Franconian military engineers leant heavily on Italian innovations.|$|R

2500|$|Features {{of the new}} generation's {{structure}} {{include a}} carbon fiber hood and <b>removable</b> <b>roof</b> panel. The fenders, doors and rear quarter panels remain composite. At {{the rear of the}} car, the trademark round taillights have changed to a more squarish form. [...] The underbody panels are made of [...] "carbon-nano" [...] composite and it makes use of a new aluminum frame which locates the four wheels an inch farther apart, front to rear and side to side. [...] Luggage space decreased by 33% from the previous generation's. The overall weight of the car was not announced by General Motors for many months after its first showing in January 2013. [...] Despite the increased use of aluminum and other light weight materials, numerous publications reported that the weight would remain essentially unchanged from that of the previous generation's. [...] In August, 2013, the weight of the new Corvette was reported to be , meaning it would weigh more than the previous generation's C6 ZR1 model (...) [...] The ZR1 C6 weight included a supercharger and intercooler on its 6.2L engine.|$|E
2500|$|For 1968, {{both the}} Corvette body and {{interior}} were completely redesigned. As before, {{the car was}} available in either coupe or convertible models, but coupe was now a notchback fitted with a near-vertical removable rear window and <b>removable</b> <b>roof</b> panels (T-tops). A soft folding top was included with convertibles, while an auxiliary hardtop with a glass rear window was offered at additional cost. Included with coupes were hold down straps {{and a pair of}} vinyl bags to store the roof panels, and above the luggage area was a rear window stowage tray. The enduring new body's concealed headlights moved into position via a vacuum operated system rather than electrically as on the previous generation, and the new hide-away windshield wipers utilized a problematic vacuum door. The door handles were flush with the top of the doors with a separate release button. Front fenders had functional engine cooling vents. Side vent windows were eliminated from all models, replaced with [...] "Astro Ventilation", a fresh air circulation system. In the cabin, a large round speedometer and matching tachometer were positioned in front of the driver. Auxiliary gauges were clustered above the forward end of the console and included oil pressure, water temperature, ammeter, fuel gauge, and an analog clock. A fiber-optic system appeared on the console that monitored exterior lights and there was no glove box. The battery was relocated from the engine area to one of three compartments behind the seats to improve weight distribution. New options included a rear window defroster, anti-theft alarm system, bright metal wheel covers, and an AM-FM Stereo radio. All cars ordered with a radio, like the C2 cars, continued to be fitted with chrome-plated ignition shielding covering the distributor to reduce interference.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, small block engine {{displacement}} increased from [...] to , though output remained the same. All other engines and transmission choices remained unchanged {{from the previous}} year, though the L30 base engine was now the ZQ3 and the L79 motor was redesignated the L46. All cars featured [...] steel wheels (increased from 7inches). Tire size remained the same, although {{this was the first}} year for optional white lettered tires and the last for red striped tires. Carried over from the previous year were seven available rear axle ratios ranging from 2.73 to 4.56. Standard ratio remained 3.08 with automatic and 3.36 with manual transmission. The optional Positraction rear axle, mandated on many engine/gearbox combinations, was installed on more than 95% of the cars. [...] "Stingray" [...] script nameplates appeared on front fenders, now one word, in contrast to the “Sting Ray” name used previously. Exterior door handles were redesigned so the finger plate would actuate the door, eliminating the separate release button. Backup lights were integrated into the inboard taillights, headlight washers were added, and front grilles were made all black. Side mounted exhausts and front fender vent trim were options for this year only. On the inside, revised door panels provided additional shoulder room in the C3's tighter cabin and headrests became standard. Steering wheel diameter was reduced from 16 to 15inches to permit easier entry and exit, the ignition switch was moved from the dash to the steering column, and map pockets were added to the dash area in front of the passenger seat. Accounting for 57% of the cars, coupes with their <b>removable</b> <b>roof</b> panels, began a trend of outselling roadsters. An extended production cycle due to a labor dispute increased '69 volume. This was the last year for the L88 engine and the only year for the ZL1 option, which offered an all-aluminum [...] big-block engine listed at [...] Rare options: ZL1 aluminum block (2), J56 heavy-duty brakes (115), L88 engine (116), L89 aluminum heads (390).|$|E
50|$|In 2010, the {{government}} of the Republic of Macedonia ordered 202 double-decker buses from the Chinese manufacturer Yutong, two of which were open top buses with <b>removable</b> <b>roofs</b> to be used by tourists (15 more buses like these were ordered in late 2011) and the remaining 200 as city buses for the capital city of Skopje.|$|R
5000|$|From about 1550 onwards, however, {{there is}} {{historical}} {{evidence of the}} actual use of such roof structures in fortifications. In the sphere of influence of the Franconian free imperial city of Nuremberg some [...] have survived to the present or been reconstructed. For instance, some cavaliers and bastions at the imperial city fortress of Lichtenau at [...] are topped by such constructions. Numerous corbels on the curtain walls indicate the intention to build <b>removable</b> <b>roofs,</b> but contemporary illustrations show that these plans did not come fully to fruition. A bird's eye view {{at the time of}} the Thirty Years' War (around 1630, Swedish State Archives) portrays a defensive system with <b>removable</b> <b>roofs</b> on four of the five bastions. The three cavaliers also have correspondingly open superstructures. No roofs can be seen above the curtain walls. This illustration view largely corresponds to the present state of this Renaissance fortress.|$|R
