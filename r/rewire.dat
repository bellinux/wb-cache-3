5|$|Reconfigurable {{computing}} {{is the use}} of a field-programmable {{gate array}} (FPGA) as a co-processor to a general-purpose computer. An FPGA is, in essence, a computer chip that can <b>rewire</b> itself for a given task.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{the hall}} briefly closed {{as part of}} a £500,000 {{modernisation}} programme to <b>rewire</b> the building and improve the technical facilities, as well as redecorating the backstage area. In 1999, removable seats were installed {{in the front of the}} stalls, in response to rock concerts where fans at the front wanted to move around freely, as well as increasing capacity. The official capacity of the hall is now 2,075.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the downregulation of KCC2 observed following neuronal trauma, and the consequent depolarizing shift of GABAA-mediated synapses, may be an aspect of neuronal de-differentiation. De-differentiation of damaged portions {{of the nervous system}} would allow for neuronal networks to return to higher levels of plasticity in order to <b>rewire</b> of surviving neurons to compensate for damage in the network. In addition, reduced glutamatergic transmission upon KCC2 downregulation may serve as a homeostatic process to compensate for the reduced GABA transmission due to altered chloride extrusion.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, logic {{synthesis}} constrains {{the solution}} space of later design steps, such as physical design, {{because they are}} applied in sequence. <b>Rewiring</b> is a technique to restructure a circuit while maintaining its functionality. Since design properties and objectives can be considered during postsynthesis <b>rewiring,</b> it can help relieve constraints put forth by decisions made at earlier design steps. The extent of <b>rewiring</b> of a <b>rewiring</b> algorithm has {{a great impact on}} the success of the design flow. This paper presents a powerful <b>rewiring</b> technique that in addition to unifying all previously proposed Set-of-Pair-of-Functions-to-be-Distinguished based <b>rewiring</b> techniques, it can perform <b>rewiring</b> with more than one wire which increases our ability to circumvent poorlydecided design constraints. With this ability, the <b>rewiring</b> ability of using different numbers of wires is reported {{for the first time in}} this paper. It can be used for runtime/quality trade-off in any given <b>rewiring</b> application. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} SPFDs (Sets of Pairs of Functions to be Distinguished) was {{introduced}} in context of FPGA synthesis [10]. Subsequently, SPFDs were used for <b>rewiring</b> networks of FPGAs [10, 11, 12]. It was experimentally shown [11, 12] that SPFD-based <b>rewiring</b> techniques could outperform ATPG-based <b>rewiring</b> techniques in terms of <b>rewiring</b> ability, i. e. it could find alternates wires for {{a larger number of}} wires in the network. In this paper, we provide formal arguments to strengthen the claim that <b>rewiring</b> using SPFDs is indeed more powerful than <b>rewiring</b> based on ATPG methods...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an in-depth {{study of the}} theory and algorithms for the SPFD-based (Set of Pairs of Functions to be Distinguished) <b>rewiring,</b> and explores the flexibility in the SPFD computation. Our contributions are in the following two areas: (1) We present a theorem and a related algorithm for more precise characterization of feasible SPFD-based <b>rewiring.</b> Extensive experimental results show that for LUT-based FPGAs, the <b>rewiring</b> ability of our new algorithm is 70 % higher than SPFD-based local <b>rewiring</b> algorithms (SPFD-LR) [19][21] and 18 % higher than the recently developed SPFD-based global <b>rewiring</b> algorithm (SPFD-GR) [20]. (2) In order to achieve more <b>rewiring</b> ability on certain selected wires used in various optimizations, we study the impact of using different atomic SPFD pair assignment methods during the SPFD-based <b>rewiring.</b> We develop several heuristic atomic SPFD pair assignment methods for area or delay minimization and show that they lead to 10 % more selected <b>rewiring</b> ability than the random (or arbitrary) assignment methods. When combining (1) and (2) together, we can achieve 38. 1 % higher general <b>rewiring</b> ability. 1...|$|R
25|$|The {{main parts}} of the Vocaloid 2 system are the Score Editor (Vocaloid 2 Editor), the Singer Library, and the Synthesis Engine. The Synthesis Engine {{receives}} score information from the Score Editor, selects appropriate samples from the Singer Library, and concatenates them to output synthesized voices. There is basically {{no difference in the}} Score Editor and the Synthesis Engine provided by Yamaha among different Vocaloid 2 products. If a Vocaloid 2 product is already installed, the user can enable another Vocaloid 2 product by adding its library. The system supports three languages, Japanese, Korean, and English, although other languages may be optional in the future. It works standalone (playback and export to WAV) and as a <b>ReWire</b> application or a Virtual Studio Technology instrument (VSTi) accessible from a digital audio workstation (DAW).|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{automation}} incorporates {{programmable logic}} controllers in the manufacturing process. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming. PLCs make use of programmable memory, storing instructions and functions like logic, sequencing, timing, counting, etc. Using a logic based language, a PLC can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs, the input devices being sensors and output devices being motors, valves, etc. PLCs are similar to computers, however, while computers are optimized for calculations, PLCs are optimized for control task and use in industrial environments. They are built so that only basic logic-based programming knowledge is needed and to handle vibrations, high temperatures, humidity and noise. The greatest advantage PLCs offer is their flexibility. With the same basic controllers, a PLC can operate a range of different control systems. PLCs make it unnecessary to <b>rewire</b> a system to change the control system. This flexibility leads to a cost-effective system for complex and varied control systems.|$|E
25|$|German Schuko {{socket outlets}} were once widely used {{alongside}} the British standard BS546 round pin plugs (both 3-pin and 2-pin varieties). However, {{both of these}} systems were replaced by BS 1363, standardised as Irish Standard IS 401 (Plug) and IS411 (Socket outlet). This standard eliminated incompatibilities between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and was chosen as it was completely incompatible with both the old Schuko or BS 546 installations and encouraged people to <b>rewire</b> their homes {{to comply with the}} new standard. It removed the possibility of connecting Class I (requiring an earth connection) appliances, to socket outlets that are either unearthed (ungrounded) or with incompatible earthing contacts – e.g. 2-pin side-earthed Schuko plug will not make earth contact with a 3-hole, 5-amp BS 546 socket. This harmonisation occurred before the advent of pre-fitted 2-pin plugs on appliances destined for the European 220-volt market, which might have led to a different outcome. Until UK and Irish voltages were standardised at 230 volts in the 1990s, it was common for such plugs to be pre-fitted on appliances destined for the Irish market, although they were prohibited on appliances destined for the United Kingdom market. Both countries now require the pre-fitting of BS 1363 plugs on domestic appliances.|$|E
40|$|A {{concept of}} bypass <b>rewiring</b> is {{introduced}} and random bypass <b>rewiring</b> is analytically and numerically investigated with simulations. Our {{results show that}} bypass <b>rewiring</b> makes networks robust against removal of nodes including random failures and attacks. In particular, random bypass <b>rewiring</b> connects all nodes except the removed nodes on an even degree infinite network and makes the percolation threshold 0 for arbitrary occupation probabilities. In our example, the even degree network is more robust than the original network with random bypass <b>rewiring</b> while the original network is more robust than the even degree networks without random bypass. We propose a greedy bypass <b>rewiring</b> algorithm which guarantees the maximum size of the largest component at each step, assuming which node will be removed next is unknown. The simulation result shows that the greedy bypass <b>rewiring</b> algorithm improves the robustness of the autonomous system of the Internet under attacks more than random bypass <b>rewiring...</b>|$|R
40|$|Analysis of <b>rewired</b> {{upstream}} subnetworks impact-ing downstream differential {{gene expression}} aids the delineation of evolving molecular mechanisms. Cu-mulative statistics based on conventional differen-tial correlation are limited for subnetwork <b>rewiring</b> analysis since <b>rewiring</b> {{is not necessarily}} equiva-lent to change in correlation coefficients. Here we present a computational method ChiNet to quan-tify subnetwork <b>rewiring</b> by statistical heterogeneity that enables detection of potential genotype changes causing altered transcription regulation in evolving organisms. Given a differentially expressed down-stream gene set, ChiNet backtracks a <b>rewired</b> up-stream subnetwork from a super-network includ-ing gene interactions known to occur under vari-ous molecular contexts. We benchmarked ChiNet for its high accuracy in distinguishing <b>rewired</b> artificial subnetworks, in silico yeast transcription-metabolic subnetworks, and <b>rewired</b> transcription subnetworks for Candida albicans versus Saccharomyces cere-visiae, against two differential-correlation based sub-network <b>rewiring</b> approaches. Then, using transcrip-tome data from tolerant S. cerevisiae strain NRRL Y- 50049 and a wild-type intolerant strain, ChiNet identi-fied 44 metabolic pathways affected by <b>rewired</b> tran-scription subnetworks anchored to major adaptively activated transcription factor genes YAP 1, RPN 4, SFP 1 and ROX 1, in response to toxic chemical chal-lenges involved in lignocellulose-to-biofuels conver-sion. These findings {{support the use of}} ChiNet in <b>rewiring</b> analysis of subnetworks where differential interaction patterns resulting from divergent nonlin-ear dynamics abound...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Semantic overlay {{networks}} cluster peers {{that are}} semantically, thematically or socially close into groups, {{by means of}} a <b>rewiring</b> procedure that is periodically executed by each peer. This procedure establishes new connections to similar peers and disregards connections to peers that are dissimilar. Retrieval effectiveness is then improved by exploiting this information at query time (as queries may address clusters of similar peers). Although all systems based on semantic overlay networks apply some <b>rewiring</b> technique, there is no comprehensive study showing the effect of <b>rewiring</b> on system’s performance. In this work, a framework for studying the attribution of <b>rewiring</b> strategies in semantic overlay networks is proposed. A generic approach to <b>rewiring</b> is presented and several variants of this approach are reviewed and evaluated. We show how peer organisation is affected by the different design choices of the <b>rewiring</b> mechanism and how these choices affect the performance of the system overall (both in terms of communication overhead and retrieval effectiveness). Our experimental evaluation with real-word data and queries confirms the dependence between <b>rewiring</b> strategies and retrieval performance, and gives insights on the trade-offs involved in the selection of a <b>rewiring</b> strategy.

500|$|Within a {{month of}} moving into the Governor's Mansion, Brown noticed {{significant}} deterioration in the wiring and ordered a full inspection. The Department of Buildings and Construction's preliminary report stated [...] "If this was a privately operated structure, this office would have no alternative other than to give the operator 30 to 60 days to <b>rewire</b> the structure." [...] The report {{went on to say}} that the mansion was a virtual firetrap. Upon receiving the report, Brown immediately moved his family out of the mansion and back to Cave Hill, his estate in Lexington. The Department of Buildings and Construction forbade use of the mansion for overnight purposes or group meetings until repairs could be made. Brown's Cave Hill estate was officially designated the temporary executive mansion, and the state agreed to furnish Brown's groceries, reimburse him for entertaining official guests, and pay for telephone calls made in his capacity as governor. He was also given a travel allowance.|$|E
500|$|In the essay, Carr {{introduces}} {{the discussion of}} the scientific support for the idea that the brain's neural circuitry can be rewired with an example in which philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche {{is said to have been}} influenced by technology. According to German scholar Friedrich A. Kittler in his book Gramophone, Film, Typewriter, Nietzsche's writing style became more aphoristic after he started using a typewriter. Nietzsche began using a Malling-Hansen Writing Ball because of his failing eyesight which had disabled his ability to write by hand. The idea that Nietzsche's writing style had changed for better or worse when he adopted the typewriter was disputed by several critics. Kevin Kelly and Scott Esposito each offered alternate explanations for the apparent changes. Esposito believed that [...] "the brain is so huge and amazing and enormously complex that it's far, far off base to think that a few years of Internet media or the acquisition of a typewriter can fundamentally <b>rewire</b> it." [...] In a response to Esposito's point, neuroscientist James Olds stated that recent brain research demonstrated that it was [...] "pretty clear that the adult brain can re-wire on the fly". In The New York Times it was reported that several scientists believed that it was certainly plausible that the brain's neural circuitry may be shaped differently by regular Internet usage compared with the reading of printed works.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, we {{implement}} a new <b>rewiring</b> based flow for FPGA performance improvement in post layout design stage. The <b>rewiring</b> engine {{is based on}} SPFD techniques, which is demonstrated to be suitable to work on LUT-based FPGA circuit. The <b>rewiring</b> engine is coupled with the routing stage of VPR, which is currently the most powerful academic CAD tool for FPGA design. While comparing with the already high quality timing results provided by VPR, our new flow can further reduce the delay of the critical path by 11. 72 % averagely without affecting the original placement or increasing the circuit area. We also compared the results of SPFD-based <b>rewiring</b> with ATPG-based <b>rewiring,</b> which is another most commonly used <b>rewiring</b> technique for FPGA delay optimization.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{epidemic}} spreading on <b>rewiring</b> networks is introduced and analyzed {{for the case}} of scale free steady state networks. It is found that contrary to what one would have naively expected, the <b>rewiring</b> process typically tends to suppress epidemic spreading. In particular {{it is found that}} as in static networks, <b>rewiring</b> networks with degree distribution exponent γ > 3 exhibit a threshold in the infection rate below which epidemics die out in the steady state. However the threshold is higher in the <b>rewiring</b> case. For 2 <γ≤ 3 no such threshold exists, but for small infection rate the steady state density of infected nodes (prevalence) is smaller for <b>rewiring</b> networks. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{whether a}} given network is typical or {{atypical}} for a random-network ensemble (i. e., network-ensemble comparison) has widespread applications ranging from null-model selection and hypothesis testing to clustering and classifying networks. We develop {{a framework for}} network-ensemble comparison by subjecting the network to stochastic <b>rewiring.</b> We study two <b>rewiring</b> processes, uniform and degree-preserved <b>rewiring,</b> which yield random-network ensembles that converge to the Erdos-Renyi and configuration-model ensembles, respectively. We study convergence through von Neumann entropy (VNE), a network summary statistic measuring information content based on the spectra of a Laplacian matrix, and develop a perturbation analysis for the expected effect of <b>rewiring</b> on VNE. Our analysis yields an estimate for how many <b>rewires</b> are required for a given network to resemble a typical network from an ensemble, offering a computationally efficient quantity for network-ensemble comparison that does not require simulation of the corresponding <b>rewiring</b> process.

2500|$|Restoration {{work began}} in April 2013 as a station <b>rewire</b> which quickly {{grew into a}} {{heritage}} inspired project. The view taken was to restore the station to a 1949 state with British rail branding and reminisces of the GER and LNER railways. As to use one era would prove too costly and the budget was only for a <b>rewire.</b> The paint scheme was chosen by the Fen line users and was based upon a GER steam unit which had blue red and gold, gardenia is a heritage colour used and was also chosen. GER cast iron benches were made locally by East Coast Castings in Wotton and BR style totems were hand-made alongside LNER station clocks and coat hangers. Ticket machine were relocated to more sensible positions and re-branded to match the aesthetics intent.
