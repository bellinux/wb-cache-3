40|$|Don Hoi Lord wetland {{located near}} Mae Klong river mouth {{in the area}} of Samut Songkhram province, upper the Gulf of Thailand. The wetland was {{registered}} as the 1099 th Ramsar site. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Solen spp.) is an important species in the sandbars which are a part of this wetland. Fisherman has harvested <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> for generating income more than 2 generations. Due to the previous studies, <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population has decreased through the time. The objective of this study aims to explore possible sustainable management policies for Don Hoi Lord by using Companion Modelling approach (ComMod). The approach mainly consists of Agent-based simulation model (ABM) and participatory simulation workshop with stakeholders involvement. To achieve the aim of the study, there are 3 parts including: 1) ecological study of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population and its environmental factors especially sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC) between June 2008 - May 2009; 2) socio-economic study to understand fisherman harvesting behavior and <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> market mechanism; and 3) ABM development from field study finding and test the management scenarios with the ABM. Moreover, the ABM was used in participatory simulation workshop to validate the ABM and to exchange and discuss on <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> sustainable management. The results from ecological study showed that <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population was in crisis due to the decreasing of population. Mean density of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> was 0. 51 ± 0. 30 clam/m 2 which has been the lowest record among previous scientific studies since 1982. In addition, <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> density had negative correlation with %organic matter in soil sediment and particulate sediment in water column (p < 0. 05) but it was not correlated with POC. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> market is being driven by a trader who buys all <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> from a fisherman and processed <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> as clam meat before distributing to market. The trader set <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> buying price from fisherman independently based on their <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> stock and a current market demand. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> demand usually was increased during weekend and, presently the trader distributing processed <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> to a restaurant and a merchant in fresh market. Regarding fisherman, there were 2 factors affected fisherman's decision to harvest <b>razor</b> <b>clam,</b> firstly the density of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> and secondly <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> price. Due to the low <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> density, fisherman had to harvest on other species instead of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> but <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> is still the first priority. The ABM development was done by added i-stage distribution model and re-calibrated until the simulation model represented system behavior. Then, the management scenarios were tested with the ABM and it was found that reserved zoning accompany with quota system was the best scenario for sustaining <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population. Next, spatial interface of the ABM was upgraded based on socio-economic finding and the upgraded ABM was used in participatory simulation workshop with stakeholders. The workshop can be a forum for discussion among stakeholders by using ABM as mediator and stakeholders in the workshop which could share their representations for collective agreement to achieve the goal. Finally, the whole process of ComMod at Don Hoi Lord by communicating and coworking between researcher and stakeholders in the field study could help them instituted the group to working on sustainable management by implementing a reserved or forbidden zone on the sandbar at Don Hoi Lord.

2500|$|Canadian or Alaskan grizzlies {{are larger}} than those that reside in the American Rocky Mountains. This is due, in part, to the {{richness}} of their diets. In Yellowstone National Park in the United States, the grizzly bear's diet consists mostly of whitebark pine nuts, tubers, grasses, various rodents, army cutworm moths, and scavenged carcasses. [...] None of these, however, match the fat content of the salmon available in Alaska and British Columbia. With the high fat content of salmon, {{it is not uncommon}} to encounter grizzlies in Alaska weighing [...] Grizzlies in Alaska supplement their diet of salmon and clams with sedge grass and berries. In areas where salmon are forced to leap waterfalls, grizzlies gather at the base of the falls to feed on and catch the fish. Salmon are at a disadvantage when they leap waterfalls because they cluster together at their bases and are therefore easier targets for the grizzlies. Grizzly bears are well-documented catching leaping salmon in their mouths at Brooks Falls in Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska. They are also very experienced in chasing the fish around and pinning them with their claws. At such sites such as Brooks Falls and McNeil Falls in Alaska, big male grizzlies fight regularly for the best fishing spots. Grizzly bears along the coast also forage for <b>razor</b> <b>clams,</b> and frequently dig into the sand to seek them. During the spring and fall, directly before and after the salmon runs, berries and grass make up the mainstay of the diets of coastal grizzlies.|$|E

40|$|Don Hoi Lord, {{a coastal}} wetland {{in the upper}} gulf of Thailand, is famous for the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Solen regularis), which {{is a source of}} food and income for local fishermen. However, the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> {{population}} is significantly decreasing so the aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> fishery and develop a management plan engaging the different stakeholders in collective discussions. A participatory modelling approach was used, including (a) agent-based modelling (ABM) and (b) role-playing games (RPG). First, an individual-state distribution model of the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population was designed and calibrated to synthesise knowledge. Two RPG sessions supported by this biological model were organised to initiate collective learning and promote discussion among stakeholders. After playing with the baseline scenario showing the actual harvesting situation, discussions led to the definition of alternative scenarios for clam management such as establishment and rotation of zones closed for harvesting, and quota systems. These scenarios developed during the RPG sessions were more deeply investigated with an agent-based model that included fishermen agents and the individual-state distribution model of the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population. Simulations of different scenarios (reserve, quota and combination of reserve and quota) were produced to enable better informed discussion between different stakeholders. Stakeholders have acknowledged that management through rotating reserves is not efficient if the duration of reserves is too short. They have realised that the efficiency of reserves is hard to assess without better data on clam recruitment. They have also explored another management option which is the quota system. In the final stage, the local participatory process was endorsed by the incumbent regional policy-making actor. Unfortunately, because of rapid administrative rotation the project abruptly lost support. This unexpected event emphasises the need for continuous monitoring of all actors entering and/or leaving the system, which can radically change the interactions among them and, therefore, the whole management context.

40|$|Residual {{antibiotics}} from aquacultural farming may alter {{microbial community}} structure in aquatic environments {{in ways that}} may adversely or positively impact microbially-mediated ecological functions. This study investigated 26 ponds (26 composited samples) used to produce fish, <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> and shrimp (farming and drying) and 2 channels (10 samples) in a saltwater aquacultural farm in southern China to characterize microbial community structure (represented by phospholipid fatty acids) in surface sediments (0 - 10 cm) with long-term exposure to residual antibiotics. II out of 14 widely-used antibiotics were quantifiable at mu g kg(- 1) levels in sediments but their concentrations did not statistically differ among ponds and channels, except norfloxacin in drying shrimp ponds and thiamphenicol in <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> ponds. Concentrations of protozoan PLFAs were significantly increased in sediments from <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> ponds while other microbial groups were similar among ponds and channels. Both canonical-correlation and stepwise-multiple-regression analyses on microbial community and residual antibiotics suggested that roxithromycin residuals {{were significantly related to}} shifts in microbial community structure in sediments. This study provided field evidence that multiple residual antibiotics at low environmental levels from aquacultural farming do not produce fundamental shifts in microbial community structure.

40|$|After feeding female Eriocheir sinensis on an {{optimized}} formulated diet {{or fresh}} <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> Sinonovacula constricta for 7 months, their reproductive performance and o¡spring quality were compared. To evaluate diet nutrient contents, the proximate, fatty acid and amino acid compositions of the formulated diet and the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> were analysed. The nutritional {{value of the}} diets was determined by assessing survival, gonadosomatic index (GSI) and hepatosomatic index (HSI) of female crabs from both diet treatments, together with the percentage of females that spawned, total egg production per female and fecundity (number of eggs g 1 female wet weight). Furthermore, the quality of eggs and newly hatched larvae fromthe two dietary treatments were determined using the following parameters: egg diameter, wet weight and dry weight, hatchability, proximate and fatty acid pro¢le of eggs, larval carapace length, resistant to starvation and osmotic shock, larval survival and development to the zoea II stage. Higher protein, phospholipids (PL) and amino acids (AA) contents {{were found in the}} <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> while the formulated diet contains higher levels of ash, total lipid (TL) and 18 : 1 n- 9, 18 : 2 n- 6 and 22 : 6 n- 3 fatty acids. Although female crabs fed the two di¡erent diets showed similar reproductive performances, newly hatched zoea I larvae produced by the crabs fed the formulated diet had signi¢cantly longer mean carapace length and shorter development time to the zoea II stage under identical culture condition (Po 0. 05). Moreover, dietary fatty acid appeared to have more signi¢cant e¡ects on the fatty acid composition of the hepatopancreas than it did on mature ovaries or eggs. This suggests that the fatty acid proofile of mature ovaries is indicative of the specific fatty acid required for ovarian development in E. sinensis. In conclusion, our results show that the optimized formulated diet developed in this laboratory can totally replace the <b>razor</b> <b>clam,</b> a broodstock food widely used in E. sinensis hatcheries in China.
