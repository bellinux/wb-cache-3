40|$|An {{extensible}} {{software system}} must protect its resources from being abused by untrusted software extensions. The access control policies of extensible software systems are traditionally enforced by {{some form of}} <b>reference</b> <b>monitors.</b> Recent study of access control policies advocates the use of obligation policies, which impose behavioural constraints to the future actions of the accessor after the access is granted. It is argued that obligation policies provide continuous protection to the system. Not all obligation policies can be enforced by <b>reference</b> <b>monitors.</b> We argue that humans have long recognized the unenforceability of naively formulated obligation policies, and have devised standard policy idioms {{to cope with the}} issue. We therefore developed tool support to assist a policy developer in using such policy idioms. First, we designed a policy language to capture the idiomatic elements of obligation policies, {{in such a way that}} the elements are modular and composeable. Second, we designed a type system for capturing patterns of policy composition that preserve enforceability, such that well-typed policies are enforceable. Third, we designed a compilation algorithm that compiles well-typed policies into <b>reference</b> <b>monitors.</b> Such a framework helps policy developers articulate obligation policies and refine them into enforceable ones...|$|R

Low-cost portable monitors can supplement existing networks in both developed and industrializing regions to increase density of sites and data.

Seven Portable University of Washington Particle (PUWP) monitors were calibrated with optical and gravimetric PM 2. 5 <b>reference</b> <b>monitors</b> in Xi'an, China in December 2013. Pairwise correlations between the raw PUWP and the <b>reference</b> <b>monitors</b> were high (R 2  =  0. 86 – 0. 89).

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to protecting computer systems from malicious or other misbehaved code typically involve (1) monitoring code for unacceptable behavior as it runs, or (2) detecting potentially misbehaved code and preventing it from running at all. These approaches are effective when unacceptable {{behavior can be}} detected in time to take remedial action, but in many settings and for many im-portant security policies this is computationally expensive or provably impossible. A third approach, termed in this dissertation program-rewriting, involves auto-matically rewriting code prior to running {{it in such a}} way that acceptable behavior is preserved but unacceptable behavior is not. Rewritten code can be run without further analysis or monitoring because it is guaranteed to exhibit only acceptable behavior. Program-rewriting has received recent attention in the literature in the form of in-lined <b>reference</b> <b>monitors,</b> which implement approach 1 above by in-lining security checks directly into the code being monitored.
