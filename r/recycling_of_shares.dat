40|$|Small-scale {{subsistence}} {{farmers in}} South Africa {{have been introduced}} to genetically modified (GM) crops {{for more than a}} decade. Little is known about i) the extent of transgene introgression into locally recycled seed, ii) what short and long-term ecological and socioeconomic impacts such mixing of seeds might have, iii) how the farmers perceive GM crops, and iv) to what degree approval conditions are followed and controlled. This study conducted in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, aims primarily at addressing the first of these issues. We analysed for transgenes in 796 individual maize plants (leaves) and 20 seed batches collected in a village where GM insect resistant maize was previously promoted and grown as part of an governmental agricultural development program over a seven year period (2001 - 2008). Additionally, we surveyed the varieties of maize grown and the farmers' practices <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> and <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> seed in the same community (26 farmers were interviewed). <b>Recycling</b> and <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> seeds were common in the community and may contribute to spread and persistence of transgenes in maize on a local or regional level. By analysing DNA we found that the commonly used transgene promoter p 35 s occurred in one of the 796 leaf samples (0. 0013 %) and in five of the 20 seed samples (25 %). Three of the 20 seed samples (15 %) included herbicide tolerant maize (NK 603) intentionally grown by the farmers from seed bought from local seed retailers or acquired through a currently running agricultural development program. The two remaining positive seed samples (10 %) included genes for insect resistance (from MON 810). In both cases the farmers were unaware of the transgenes present. In conclusion, we demonstrate that transgenes are mixed into seed storages of small-scale farming communities where <b>recycling</b> and <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> seeds are common, i. e. spread beyond the control of the formal seed system...|$|R

The diversification of patterns and shapes {{can be accomplished by}} the origin of novelties lineage specific traits of new adaptive value. Much recent data suggest that novelties can arise from co-option: <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> genetic circuitry. One of the most beautiful examples of this is found in butterfly wing patterns. Some wings have conspicuous circular paintings called eyespots development of which is divided in four main stages: prepattern, focus determination, focal signaling and cellular differentiation. There are some gaps in our knowledge about genes involved in this pattern design. Experiments with Junonia coenia revealed the expression of hedgehog around the foci in larvae, and, in Bicyclus anynana pupae, imunohistochemistry analysis showed the expression of Wingless, also a morphogen. Here, we studied the co-option of those two signaling pathways in formation of novelties using in situ hybridization to detect spatial patterns of gene expression. hedgehog was found only in the posterior area of larval wings with no higher expression around the foci as observed for J. coenia. On the other hand, it was detected that both sense and anti-sense transcripts for wingless were being expressed in eyespot foci at the same time. A model was designed to explain this finding that requires that different cells should be expressing wingless mRNA and anti-transcript. To have a better comprehension about Hedgehog and Wingless pathways involvement in eyespot formation we also analyzed expression of other genes: patched (hedgehog receptor), frizzled (wingless receptor) and groucho (a negative regulator of wingless signal transduction). However, there is still a lot to be done and the necessity of functional tests is clear...|$|R

It focuses on open data generated during disasters, and analyses how these voluminous ‘free disaster data,’ such as social media posts, images, damage assessment reports, etc., could be reused and recycled to serve purposes other than emergency response and relief. To illustrate this, the paper makes use of a previous research that analysed how the open data of Super Typhoon Haiyan, the hydrometeorological disaster which affected several nations, and gained both local and global attention, could be reused and recycled as inputs for development planning, especially in post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation, and pre-disaster mitigation and prevention planning...|$|R
