60|$|All the jealous {{doubts and}} fears of Antonio were now confirmed. He did not <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> the resentment of his happy rival at being thus interrupted, but turned from the place in sudden wretchedness of heart. That Inez should love another, would have been misery enough; but {{that she should be}} capable of a dishonourable amour, shocked him to the soul. The idea of {{deception}} in so young and apparently artless a being, brought with it that sudden distrust in human nature, so sickening to a youthful and ingenuous mind; but when he thought of the kind, simple parent she was deceiving, whose affections all centred in her, he felt for a moment a sentiment of indignation, and almost of aversion.|$|E
60|$|The musters of the Midland counties, 80,000 strong, were {{to form a}} {{separate}} army, and were to march at once to a spot between Windsor and Harrow. The rest were to gather {{at the point of}} danger. The coast companies were to fall back wherever the enemy landed, burning the corn and driving off the cattle, and avoiding a battle until the force of the neighbouring counties joined them. Should the landing take place as was expected in Suffolk, Kent, or Sussex, it was calculated that between 30,000 and 40,000 men would bar the way to the invaders before they reached London, while 20,000 men of the western counties would <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> the Duke of Guise, who had engaged to bring across an army of Frenchmen to aid the Spaniards.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} escape his {{consideration}} that Mrs. Skimpole and the daughters <b>remained</b> behind <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> the baker, {{but this was}} so old a story {{to all of them}} that it had become a matter of course.

60|$|The army {{expected}} {{some signs}} of resistance at the gates, which, if offered, they were prepared <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> and overcome. Their plan was, after entering the city, to seek Caesar and demand their discharge from his service. They {{knew that he was}} under the necessity of immediately making a campaign in Africa, and that, of course, he could not possibly, as they supposed, dispense with them. He would, consequently, if they asked their discharge, beg them <b>to</b> <b>remain,</b> and, <b>to</b> induce them to do it, would comply with all their expectations and desires.|$|R

40|$|Intermediate {{filaments}} (IF) {{are essential}} to maintain cellular and nuclear integrity and shape, to manage organelle distribution and motility, to control the trafficking and pH of intracellular vesicles, to prevent stress-induced cell death, and to support the correct distribution of specific proteins. Because of this, IF {{are likely to be}} targeted by a variety of pathogens, and may act in favor or against infection progress. As many IF functions <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> be identified, however, little is currently known about these interactions. Herpesviruses can infect a wide variety of cell types, and are thus bound <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> the different types of IF expressed in each tissue. The analysis of these interrelationships can yield precious insights into how IF proteins work, and into how viruses have evolved to exploit these functions. These interactions, either known or potential, will be the focus of this review...|$|R

We conducted two self-paced reading experiments using Japanese double-scrambling constructions. We observed reading time slowdowns at the nominative NP {{and at the}} verb in scrambled sentences, and we show evidence that the slowdown at the nominative NP reflects the parser's expectation <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> a verb, and the slowdown at the verb arises because the parser anticipated an intransitive verb. Finally, we will provide some preliminary results from an ERP study...|$|R
