40|$|Abstract People with {{dementia}} or {{other kinds of}} cognitive failure {{are at risk of}} getting lost when they are out walking. Depending on weather conditions, this is potentially a life-threatening risk. Electronic tracking is proposed as a tool to allow safe walking, and a help for the caregivers to locate a missing care recipient in the event of getting lost. Many trials of and inquiries into electronic tracking have appeared in recent years. This paper makes a preliminary literature <b>review</b> <b>and</b> <b>reports</b> on a local trial. There are interesting differences in the level of technical difficulties and the drop-out rates of users. A great benefit for many users, many obstacles make it hard to use the technology for others. Too little is known about when the technology is appropriate and how to make it work in practice. We discuss several directions for further research. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{corporate}} governance {{in the professional}} football industry. Boards of companies are under increasing pressure to operate in an open and accountable manner. Codes of good practice, recommendations from the Company Law Reform <b>Review</b> <b>and</b> <b>reports</b> by independent consultancy agencies have applied pressure on directors to adhere to good practice. Bottom up pressure has come from shareholders and other stakeholding. Our survey of both football clubs boards and the stakeholding groups they serve reveals that standards of governance practice in football varies considerably. Based on our survey results, this paper argues that there need to be three main improvements to the {{corporate governance}} of the football industry. First, stakeholding groups need to organize as trusts to ensure effective participation in corporate governance. Second, football club boards need to comply with company law and codes of conduct more closely. And third, a tailored code of best practice needs to be developed to guide and inform the {{major players in the}} industry. N. B.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a critical literature <b>review</b> <b>and</b> <b>reports</b> {{on the findings}} of three empirical studies, examining the relationship between life events and psychological problems in people with intellectual disabilities. An introduction is provided in Chapter 1. The critical review (Chapter 2) describes the current evidence base in relation to a critical framework that aims to establish life event exposure as a causal risk factor for psychological problems. Chapter 3 presents the results of a longitudinal study, using data from proxy informants, and begins to address the need for further longitudinal data in establishing life events as a risk factor. Chapter 4 presents the results of a self-report study of life events, psychological problems and social support, intended to establish whether valid data on life events could be obtained using self-report interviews with people with intellectual disabilities The putative role of social support as a moderator in the relationship between life events and psychological problems is also examined. Chapter 5 presents the results of a longitudinal study of life events in children with intellectual disabilities, which begins to address the need for further studies of life events in children with intellectual disabilities, and in particular, the need for longitudinal evidence. Chapter 6 draws together a number of conclusions from the present work, and provides a methodological critique. The findings in the reported studies are broadly consistent with published reports on life events in people with intellectual disabilities. Life events can be said to be a risk factor for psychological problems in adults with intellectual disabilities, though insufficient data has yet been gatheredt o establishl ife events as a causarl isk factor. In children with intellectual disabilities, the data suggest a number of specific relationships between certain types of life event and psychological disorder, rather than global associations...|$|E
40|$|Erythropoietic protoporphyria, EPP, is an {{inherited}} disease {{in which the}} main clinical manifestations are painful cutaneous sensitivity to intense light and liver disease which in some requires liver transplantation for survival. This thesis originated in questions and perceived limitations in understanding that accompanied {{the management of the}} patient in Study I. Study I-II details the successful reversal of liver failure in an EPP patient, compiles treatment modalities in a comprehensive literature <b>review</b> <b>and</b> <b>reports</b> curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) which had previously never been attempted in this context. HSCT leads to long-standing genotypic correction in the erythroid tissues and that this is enough to prevent the phenotypic manifestations. In Study II, we discuss some differences between EPP mouse models and human EPP and conclude that findings in EPP mice models should be interpreted with caution before they are applied to human EPP. Study III explores the risk for and the protection from phototoxic injuries caused by surgical luminaires. In this study we explored the risk for burn injuries in non-transplant surgery, the characteristics of optimal filters for use during liver transplant surgery, and different models to study light induced phototoxicity in vitro. We concluded that surgical light is harmless for EPP patients that are not in cholestatic liver failure and undergoing liver transplantation, that a yellow filter which blocks wavelengths below 470 nm seems optimal for liver transplantation and that an in vitro erythrocyte assay was a good model for studying phototoxicity. Study IV is a comprehensive review of the Swedish EPP cohort including demographic, clinical, biochemical and genetic features. An extensive questionnaire, genotyping and testing {{of a large number of}} biochemical parameters were used to collect data. In 2008 the prevalence in Sweden was 1 : 180, 000. Nine novel ferrochelatase mutations were found. Women had a lower erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration than men and tended to have a higher vitamin D concentration. Alterations in red blood cell parameters, iron parameters and liver function tests were common and 20 % had previously been diagnosed with gall stone disease. Life quality was markedly reduced by the disease and available treatments for phototoxicity had poor efficacy for most. The most common reported age at onset of symptoms was the first year of life, yet the mean age at diagnosis was 22 years. This diagnostic delay had worsened in the 21 st century. Study V describes all EPP patients that have been liver transplanted in Europe. We identified 37 transplants in 33 patients and compiled the overall outcome, the frequency of EPP specific complications such as disease recurrence in the graft, phototoxic burn injuries and postoperative neuropathy, any EPP specific treatments that had been used preoperatively and background characteristics including EPP genotype and erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentrations. The overall survival was 80 percent at one year and 66 percent at five and ten years. Recurrent EPPrelated graft disease was common but did not seem to affect long-term survival. None of the patients that had been protected by light filters were burnt, in contrast to 20 % of the unprotected patients. Fifteen percent had prolonged postoperative motor neuropathy. Some of the limitations in knowledge that motivated this thesis have been elucidated but study results also point to several aspects of EPP that deserve further attention...|$|E
