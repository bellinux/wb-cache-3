40|$|Up to {{now it was}} not {{possible}} to design and use <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> <b>disc</b> units for a specific nitrogen removal. To fullfil the stringent requirements regarding the effluent concentrations of total nitrogen, it was often necessary to rebuild these treatment plants with high financial expenses. The scope of this research project was to prove the suitability of rotating biological contactors (RBC) for controlled nitrogen removal and to find design criteria for pre-denitrification. With two full-scale RBCs (1, 200 m" 2 disc-area each) investigations of pre-denitrification were carried out for a period of one year. By an air-tight plastic cover the transfer of oxygen to the partially submerged discs was prevented. The two experimental RBCs were integrated as the first stage in an existing, nitrifying RBC treatment plant. The large-scale pilot plant was charged with domestic wastewater from the treatment plant of the University of Stuttgart. It was possible to prove successfully the use of covered RBCs for controlled nitrogen removal by pre-denitrification. The operation was stable and without any problems. The denitrification capacities, reached during the experiments, are comparable to similar reactors for pre-denitrification. With the found design criteria and operation instructions it is possible to design and operate covered RBCs for pre-denitrification. (orig.)

40|$|Biofilms are {{involved}} {{in all kinds of}} biofouling and cause a significant economic loss of billions of dollars annually, worldwide. In order to effectively control the growth of biofilms, it is necessary to investigate the structure of biofilms grown under different conditions. Several methods are available to monitor biofilm progression, but their applications are limited by low intensity, high labour intensity, intrusive sampling, and long time lags from sampling to results. The goal of this research was to monitor biofilm growth using a <b>biological</b> <b>rotating</b> contact <b>disc,</b> based on the total plate count, scanning electron microscopy and the light reflection.

40|$|The writer {{recognised}} in {{the early}} 1970 s {{that there was a}} need to focus on improvements to on-site wastewater treatment technology, effluent disposal and associated aspects of water pollution control. At the time there was considerable potential for applied research in the development of improved treatment and effluent disposal technologies since some 16 to 20 % of the populations in New Zealand and Australia relied on on-site or decentralised wastewater treatment and effluent disposal. This thesis covers applied research projects undertaken in New Zealand, during the period 1974 - 1990, and in Queensland from 1992 to the present day. These experiences have been written up {{in the form of a}} guide to the dissertation (contained within the initial three chapters) and eight technical portfolios. During University of Auckland post-graduate studies in 1974 the writer reviewed the unique problems of widely fluctuating wastewater loads from coastal and lakeside communities, camping grounds and resort areas. The review evaluated improvements to septic tanks, alternative effluent disposal systems, upflow pebble filters, lagoons, <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> <b>discs,</b> and composting toilets. Solutions for handling fluctuating wastewater loads have been further extended. Due to failed effluent trenches in Northland New Zealand, associated mainly with problem clay type soils, the writer undertook experimental work on the determination of soil permeability by field and laboratory techniques, investigated soil properties impacting on effluent disposal and researched alternative methods of on-site effluent treatment during the period 1976 - 1979. This included experimental work on evapotranspiration (ET) systems and the compilation of selected plants, shrubs and trees for planting within ET systems in the Northland and Auckland areas. This work has been directly applied to much of Queensland. An experimental Clivus Type domestic composting toilet was established in 1976 and monitored in Kerikeri, Northland, New Zealand. The design of associated greywater and disposal systems consequently took place in New Zealand and Queensland. The then Queensland Department of Primary Industries (Water Resources) identified the need to develop alternative wastewater treatment technologies in the early 1990 s. The writer set up an Artificial Wetlands Research and Advisory Committee to develop this technology within the range of climatic conditions in Queensland. This thesis focuses on the design rationale, nitrification and de-nitrification of effluent in reed/gravel beds or sub-surface wetlands. A postal survey of Australian effluent disposal systems was undertaken during the period 2000 - 2001. This showed that a broad range of disposal techniques were being used. A range of innovative (more non-conventional) treatment and disposal systems have been presented for use in Australasia. Raised sand mounds for effluent treatment have not been used on a wide spread basis in New Zealand and much of Australia. The performance of an existing sand mound, the design based on AS/NZS 1547 : 2000, located in Morayfield, Queensland has been assessed. A survey of deep shaft disposal was undertaken over much of the North Island of New Zealand over the period 1976 - 1977. This unique method of post-treatment and effluent disposal has merit in locations where shallow trenching is not appropriate and in deeper more permeable soils, that are clear of the groundwater. Experimental work on the use of lime and solar salt brines with seawater and magnesium salts, for treating municipal wastewater and a range of process waters was undertaken in New Zealand over the period 1984 - 1986. This work was extended as a joint research project with the Queensland University of Technology in the mid- 2000 s. This thesis reflects on past experimental and innovative work on on-site wastewater treatment and effluent disposal in Australasia and it recommends improvements and/or alternative technologies that can used to achieve higher standards of treatment. It consists of three chapters and eight portfolios covering separate topics. The connections between the chapters and the portfolios are shown in Figure 2 a of Chapter 2. The conclusions drawn from each portfolio are collated and summarized in Chapter 3. Copies of selected papers and technical reports are compiled in a separate Volume 2. ...|$|R

50|$|A <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> {{contactor}} or RBC is {{a biological}} treatment process {{used in the}} treatment of wastewater following primary treatment. The primary treatment process means protection by removal of grit and sand and course material through a screening process, followed by a removal process of sediment by settling. The RBC process involves allowing the wastewater to come in contact with a biological medium in order to remove pollutants in the wastewater before discharge of the treated wastewater to the environment, usually a body of water (river, lake or ocean). A <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> contactor is a type of secondary (Biological) treatment process. It consists of a series of closely spaced, parallel discs mounted on a rotating shaft which is supported just above the surface of the waste water.

50|$|Rotating Cell Biofilm Reactor (RCBR) is a {{new type}} of {{biological}} process based on biofilm active sludge used in wastewaters treatment.

Such a result is obtained using - instead of a set of disks fixed on the central structured tree - many tridimensional plastic elements as carriers. These carriers are used to furnish the necessary biological surface for the cohesion of the bacterial film, responsible of the depuration process. These plastic elements are contained in a cilindric permeable cell, which is like the shape of the reactor cell of a traditional rotating RBC plant.

40|$|Organic loading (weight {{per unit}} time per volume) {{is useful for}} the design of <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> {{contactors}} (RBC) and for comparison with the other processes such as activated sludge or oxidation ponds. The present study puts emphasis on the significance of this control or design parameter because it allows direct comparison of the RBC system's performance when operated under various circumstances and with different kinds of wastewater. The results of the paper proved that, the COD removal in <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> contactor systems {{is a function of the}} organic loading rate. However, each of the wastewater concentration and flow rate are also influence on the system efficiency but theirs impact can be combined by the effect of organic loading. The majority of COD removal (40 - 85 % of the total removal depending on the organic loading applied) occurs in the first stages of the system. There is a strong correlation between the organic loading and the concentration of the suspended solids in the <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> contactor basin. At higher loadings higher concentrations noted. At a loading of about, (24 g/m 2. d) suspended solids were 225, 125, 35, and 25 mg/L in the first, second, third and, the fourth stage respectively. To achieve an effluent quality of (BOD < 25 mg/L, COD < 60 mg/L), the system must be operated on organic loadings of about (22 gBOD/m 2. d and 65 gCOD/m 2. d) respectively.
