We develop dilation theory for the non-selfadjoint algebras _θ and _u which {{are associated with}} the commutation relation permutation θ of a 2 graph and, more generally, with commutation relations determined by a unitary matrix u in M_m() ⊗ M_n(). We show that a defect free row contractive representation has a unique minimal dilation to a *-representation and we provide a new simpler proof of Solel's row isometric dilation of two u-commuting row contractions. Furthermore it is shown that the C*-envelope of _u is the generalised Cuntz algebra Ø_X_u for the product system X_u of u; that for m≥ 2 and n ≥ 2 contractive <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> <b>need</b> not be completely contractive; and that the universal tensor algebra _+(X_u) need not be isometrically isomorphic to _u.

40|$|What we have {{described}} {{here are some}} results of a design study for what we envisage as a much larger-scale project, to design, construct, implement and test an IR system based specifically and explicitly upon the recognition that the <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> information <b>need</b> is the central problem of IR. We view information needs as Anomalous States of Knowledge and therefore aim to design an IR system in which ASKs have explicit structural representations. Our intention, then, is that the system should consist of a structural text-analysis program, a collection of abstracts, a suite of retrieval algorithms and a mechanism whereby user and system interact. The goals of the system {{can be described as}} follows: (a) To build a <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> the enquirer's state of knowledge {{in the form of a}} network of associations between words. (b) To examine this structure, and to interpret certain characteristics of the network as potential anomalies in the state of knowledge. (c) To search structured document descriptions with a view to resolving the anomalies; i. e. to modify the searcher's network, using components of document structures, so that the identified characteristics disappear. These system objectives will be achieved through dialogue with the user, and the system would operate as shown in Fig. 1. We consider that the design study has at least partly justified our initial premises and assumptions in the following ways: 1. It is possible to obtain problem statements from IR system users which can be used to derive adequate <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> ASKs; 2. Abstracts appear to be sufficient document surrogates for information representation in such a system; 3. Even though there are problems in our <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> <b>need</b> and information, they appear to have identifiable characteristics which are potentially useful f~>r IR purposes. Some aspects of our system have been rather less well studied than others, and some significant problems remain to be resolved. These include: 1. retrieval mechanisms 2. refinement of the analytic procedure...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{evolution}} of the concept of participation by underlining its theoretical and technical pros and cons. Moreover, we put in evidence that participatory processes in public decision-making show significant implementation difficulties. On the one hand, public managers and policy makers often emphasize the role of participatory processes as providers of social equity and fair <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> and expectations <b>of</b> the local communities. On the other hand, the use of participation by the very same managers and policy makers is often used strategically, in order to move public opinion in the direction theywant. The Sardinian Regional Landscape Plan (RLP) represents an emblematic case of this dichotomy. Our analysis of the participatory processes implemented during the elaboration and revision phases of the RLP highlights that although participation could be utilized as a way to enforce democratic rights, the main goal of the regional administration was legitimation of already-taken decisions concerning the establishment of public policies. As a consequence, planning is subordinated to political constraints and, at the same time, it is shaped by the political system...|$|R

40|$|The central {{problems}} that goal-directed animals must solve are: ‘What do I need and Why, Where and When {{can this be}} obtained, and How do I get it?' or the H 4 W problem. Here, we elucidate the principles underlying the neuronal solutions to H 4 W {{using a combination of}} neurobiological and neurorobotic approaches. First, we analyse H 4 W from a system-level perspective by mapping its objectives onto the Distributed Adaptive Control embodied cognitive architecture which sees the generation of adaptive action in the real world as the primary task of the brain rather than optimally solving abstract problems. We next map this functional decomposition to the architecture of the rodent brain to test its consistency. Following this approach, we propose that the mammalian brain solves the H 4 W problem on the basis of multiple kinds of outcome predictions, integrating central <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> and drives (e. g. hypothalamus), valence (e. g. amygdala), world, self and task state spaces (e. g. neocortex, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, respectively) combined with multi-modal selection (e. g. basal ganglia).
