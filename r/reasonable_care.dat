5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used <b>reasonable</b> <b>care</b> to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
25|$|If {{injury is}} caused by an animal, the {{possessor}} is bound to compensate the injured person for any injury arising therefrom, unless <b>reasonable</b> <b>care</b> in keeping according to the species {{and nature of the}} animal has been exercised, or unless the injury would have been occasioned notwithstanding the exercise of such <b>reasonable</b> <b>care.</b> The possessor may claim for reimbursement against the third party, who has excited or provoked the animal, or against the possessor of another animal which has caused the excitement or provocation.|$|E
25|$|If an automobile, {{motorcycle}} {{or other}} motor vehicles which need {{not to be}} driven on tracks in use has caused the injury to another, the driver shall be liable for the injury arising therefrom, unless he has exercised <b>reasonable</b> <b>care</b> to prevent the injury.|$|E

25|$|The {{employer}} {{shall be}} jointly liable to make compensation for any injury which the employee has wrongfully caused {{to the rights}} of another in the performance of his duties. However, the employer is not liable for the injury if he has exercised <b>reasonable</b> <b>care</b> in the selection of the employee, and in the supervision of the performance of his duties, or if the injury would have been occasioned notwithstanding the exercise of such <b>reasonable</b> <b>care.</b> If compensation cannot be obtained according to the provision of the preceding sentence, the court may, on the application of the injured person, take the financial conditions of the employer and the injured person into consideration, and order the employer to compensate for a part or the whole of the injury. The employer who has made compensation as specified in the preceding sentence may claim for reimbursement against the employee committed the wrongful act.|$|E
25|$|The person, {{who runs}} a {{particular}} business or does other work or activity, shall be liable for the injury to another if {{the nature of the}} work or activity, or the implement or manner used might damage to another.

25|$|Harriton sued Dr Stephens in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, {{claiming}} that Dr Stephens failed to exercise <b>reasonable</b> <b>care</b> in {{his treatment of}} her mother, and but for that failure her mother would have terminated her pregnancy and Harriton {{would not have been}} born. The judge hearing the action, Justice Tim Studdert, dismissed the action as well as two other wrongful life cases brought at the same time.|$|E

25|$|<b>Reasonable</b> <b>care</b> must {{be taken}} not to {{puncture}} or tear membrane dry suits, because buoyancy and insulation depend entirely on the air space in the undersuit, (whereas a wetsuit normally allows water to enter, and retains its insulation despite it). The dry suit material offers essentially no buoyancy or insulation itself, so if the dry suit leaks or is torn, water can soak the undersuit, with a corresponding loss of buoyancy and insulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{liability}} for negligence … is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay … The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take <b>reasonable</b> <b>care</b> to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee {{would be likely to}} injure your neighbour.|$|E
25|$|A flooded suit {{may contain}} so much water that the diver cannot {{climb out of}} the water because of the weight and inertia. In this case it may be {{necessary}} to cut a small slit in the lower part of the leg to let water drain out as the diver rises out of the water. This will take some time, and agility will be seriously compromised. The damage should not be difficult to repair if the slit is cut with <b>reasonable</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacturer}} {{is liable}} for the injury to another arising from the common use or consumption of his merchandise, unless there is no defectiveness in the production, manufacture, process, or design of the merchandise, or the injury is not caused by the defectiveness, or the manufacturer has exercised <b>reasonable</b> <b>care</b> to prevent the injury. The manufacturer mentioned in the preceding sentence {{is the person who}} produces, manufactures, or processes the merchandise. Those, who attach the merchandise with the service mark, or other characters, signs to the extent enough to show it was produced, manufactured, or processed by them, shall be deemed to be the manufacturer. If the production, manufacture, process, or design of the merchandise is inconsistent with the contents of its manual or advertisement, it is deemed to be defective. The importer shall be as {{liable for the}} injury as the manufacturer.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the start}} of litigation, an {{investigation}} by the Lay Observer and the Law Society itself (which became known as the Ely Report) highlighted [...] "an appalling catalogue of errors, insensitivity and poor judgment" [...] in the handling of the Davies Affair by the Law Society internal disciplinary organisation. The report found [...] "administrative failures, wrong decisions, mistakes, errors of judgement, failures in communication and insensitivity... the whole affair was a disgrace to the Society". The Society paid compensation to Parsons for their mishandling of the situation and said that they would compensate victims of similar cases where they had failed to investigate complaints with <b>reasonable</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
500|$|Prior to 1957, {{visitors}} to a property were classified in different ways, and this classification determined {{the duty of}} care an owner or tenant had to them. These were [...] "contractors" [...] such as hotel guests (the highest level of duty; a duty {{to ensure that the}} premises were fit {{for the purposes of the}} contract), [...] "invitees", such as a customer in a shop (owed a less onerous duty; a duty to take <b>reasonable</b> <b>care</b> to prevent damage from an unusual danger), [...] "licensees", such as a friend invited to a party (a less onerous duty; a duty to warn of any concealed danger or trap of which the occupier knew) and [...] "uninvited persons" [...] such as trespassers (who were owed no duty of care, except to refrain from deliberately or recklessly causing them harm).|$|E
500|$|Goff {{looked at}} the {{relationship}} between nuisance and Rylands v Fletcher, particularly how they treat strict liability. In nuisance, liability is strict in that the defendant can be liable {{even if he has}} taken <b>reasonable</b> <b>care,</b> but this is kept [...] "under control" [...] by the principle that a defendant is not liable for actions a reasonable user takes on his land. He took into consideration an article published by F.H. Newark in 1949, in which Newark called the decision in Rylands [...] "a simple case of nuisance" [...] rather than a revolutionary doctrine that established strict liability outside nuisance. Goff also found similarities between the principle of [...] "non-natural use" [...] under Rylands and that of the [...] "reasonable user" [...] requirement in nuisance, concluding that [...] "t would lead to a more coherent body of common law principles if the rule [...] were to be regarded essentially {{as an extension of the}} law of nuisance".|$|E
50|$|Under {{traditional}} common law, {{a property}} possessor (not necessarily the owner) has no duty whatsoever to trespassers.

500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of state courts accept {{that there must be}} a duty of care for there to be liability: the courts of Wisconsin, though, have stated that they have adopted Andrews' approach, and impose liability when there was a duty to any person, whether or not that person is the plaintiff. The Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965) amended the earlier formulation only slightly, but the third Restatement (2009), takes an approach closer to that of Andrews in focusing on whether the defendant engaged in an activity that carried a risk of harm to another (not necessarily the plaintiff), and on whether the defendant exercised <b>reasonable</b> <b>care.</b> The new formulation makes foreseeability, or the scope of the risk, not a hurdle that must be overcome, as in Palsgraf, but a factor to be weighed with others when determining whether there was negligence. Thus, according to law professor David Owen in his 2009 article, [...] "the Restatement (Third) discards Judge Cardozo's elemental work in Palsgraf so long ago. And... also rejects Judge Andrew's [...] valuable insight that juries should be offered a wide range of fairness factors, beginning with foreseeability, in figuring how far responsibility should extend".|$|E
