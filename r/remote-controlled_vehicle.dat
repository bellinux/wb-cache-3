5000|$|Several designs, {{such as the}} Danish Hydrema 910, {{are based}} on a truck chassis with an {{armoured}} cab and a flail mounted behind on what would otherwise be the cargo space. They are able to drive to the mined site like any other road vehicle. During flailing operations, they slowly drive in reverse over the mine field - in this way, the cab is kept as far as possible from any detonations. Some mine-flail vehicles are operated under remote-control for safety. The Swiss Digger DTR D-2 is a smaller, four ton, <b>remote-controlled</b> <b>vehicle</b> that is more easily moved to remote or inaccessible locations and may be used in more confined areas. Tanks are still used to carry flails; examples include the Norwegian Army's Leopard AMCV - a Leopard tank that was modified by Hagglunds to carry an Aardvark flail system. The German Army is equipped with the Keiler [...] (mine clearing tank [...] "wild boar"), based on a M48 Patton main battle tank. The first of 24 Keilers was supplied to the German Army by Rheinmetall in 1997.|$|E

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportCanada goose {{conflicts}} in suburban areas of NYS have been increasing {{based on a}} recent IPM survey of school districts. Communities continue to search for non-lethal ways to manage geese, as many urban flocks are not easily hunted. We explored a novel method using hobby aircraft (a drone) to disperse problem goose flocks. We also implemented goose fecal transects on turf grass areas at a local park, along with distributing educational fliers to recreational users of these sites. The drone was ineffective for hazing geese from turf grass areas at the park. We then tried {{a combination of a}} <b>remote-controlled</b> <b>vehicle</b> (RCV) along with pyrotechnics (bird bangers) to disperse goose flocks. The RCV was very effective in open turf areas and athletic fields. Pyrotechnics were also effective for hazing geese from both turf grass and water areas near the park and golf course. However, we were unable to break site fidelity of the goose flocks, as they sought refuge on the inlet canal for Cayuga Lake where we could not effectively haze the birds. Fecal counts along transects declined over time, but it was unclear if this was due to our hazing efforts, or routine movements of geese away from the park as the summer progressed...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{proof of}} concept {{planetary}} lander is to safely deliver an exploration rover to a planet surface. This lander {{was designed to be}} used as the last stage of landing in the existing entry, descent, and landing procedures used in previous Mars missions. The design improved upon past missions to Mars by reducing risk of failure during landing by utilizing a passive system with no electronics or control systems while also increasing landing site accuracy. These goals were accomplished by incorporating external crushable materials and internal damping systems. Five drop tests of our final design were completed. The test results can be used for scaling the components of the modular design to suit different planet conditions. Our scaled down test article design absorbed 7. 40 % of the energy absorbed by the previous Mars landing systems. The <b>remote-controlled</b> <b>vehicle</b> payload we used survived all of our tests. To scale up our design for a Spirit sized mission, we recommend using a crushable material design with 350 cylinders with the dimensions of 0. 06 m radius, 0. 00196 m thickness, and 0. 1377 m height. Our design can be used for multiple payload landing applications, including care packages and supply deliveries...|$|E
40|$|ZAPATA ENGINEERING {{challenged}} our {{engineers and}} scientists, which included robotics expertise from Carnegie Mellon University, {{to design a}} solution to meet our client's requirements for rapid digital geophysical and radiological data collection of a munitions test range with no down-range personnel. A prime concern {{of the project was}} to minimize exposure of personnel to unexploded ordnance and radiation. The field season was limited by extreme heat, cold and snow. Geographical Information System (GIS) tools were used throughout this project to accurately define the limits of mapped areas, build a common mapping platform from various client products, track production progress, allocate resources and relate subsurface geophysical information to geographical features for use in rapidly reacquiring targets for investigation. We were hopeful that our platform could meet the proposed 35 acres per day, towing both a geophysical package and a radiological monitoring trailer. We held our breath and crossed our fingers as the autonomous Speedrower began to crawl across the playa lakebed. We met our proposed production rate, and we averaged just less than 50 acres per 12 -hour day using the autonomous platform with a path tracking error of less than +/- 4 inches. Our project team mapped over 1, 800 acres in an 8 -week (4 days per week) timeframe. The expertise of our partner, Carnegie Mellon University, was recently demonstrated when their two autonomous vehicle entries finished second and third at the 2005 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge. 'The Grand Challenge program was established to help foster the development of autonomous vehicle technology that will some day help save the lives of Americans who are protecting our country on the battlefield', said DARPA Grand Challenge Program Manager, Ron Kurjanowicz. Our autonomous <b>remote-controlled</b> <b>vehicle</b> (ARCV) was a modified New Holland 2550 Speedrower retrofitted to allow the machine-actuated functions to be controlled by an onboard computer. The computer-controlled Speedrower was developed at Carnegie Mellon University to automate agricultural harvesting. Harvesting tasks require the vehicle to cover a field using minimally overlapping rows at slow speeds in a similar manner to geophysical data acquisition. The Speedrower had demonstrated its ability to perform as it had already logged hundreds of acres of autonomous harvesting. This project is the first use of autonomous robotic technology on a large-scale for geophysical surveying...|$|E

40|$|The {{important}} initial {{step for}} remediation {{of hazardous waste}} is contaminant analysis since the cleanup operation can not begin until the contaminants in hazardous waste sites have been clearly identified. Ames Laboratory, one of the U. S. Department of Energy sites, has developed a robotic sampling system for automation of real-time contaminant analysis in situ which will provide the advantage of lowering the cost per sample, eliminating personnel exposure to hazardous environments, and allowing quicker results. Successful accomplishment of real-time contaminant analysis will require a remote manipulator to perform the sampling tasks in remote and unstructured surroundings, and a <b>remote-controlled</b> guide <b>vehicle</b> to move a remote manipulator into the desired sampling location;This thesis focuses on the design and construction of a <b>remote-controlled</b> guide <b>vehicle</b> to move the robotic sampling system into the contaminated field to obtain soil samples at the desired locations, {{the development of an}} integrated dynamic model of a remote manipulator, the identification of dynamic parameters in the integrated dynamic model, and the design of a mobile robotic sampling system. A four-wheeled vehicle prototype has been constructed and its performance tested manually in the field to verify the design requirements. To remotely control the vehicle, mechanical requirements to activate the brake, throttle, transmission, and steering linkages were determined based on experimental results. A teleoperated control utilizing hundred feet long umbilical cords was first employed to remotely control the vehicle. Next, the vehicle was modified to remotely operate in the field by radio control without the aid of long umbilical cords, satisfying all the design specifications;To reduce modeling error in the robotic system, the integrated dynamic system comprised of a remote manipulator (located on a trailer pulled by the <b>remote-controlled</b> guide <b>vehicle)</b> and its drive system has been modeled.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in microtechnology and mobile robotics {{have made it}} feasible to create extremely small automated or <b>remote-controlled</b> <b>vehicles</b> which open new application frontiers. One of these possible applications is the use of nanorovers (robotic vehicles of the order of 10 grams or less) in planetary exploration. Such vehicles could be used, for example, to survey areas around a lander, or even to be distributed along the lander descent trajectory, and to look for a particular substance such as water ice or microfossils. The objective of this activity is twofold: to create a useful nanorover system using current-generation technology including mobility, computation, power, and communication in a 10 gram package, and also to advance selected technologies which offer breakthroughs in size reduction. NASA planetary missions have been under increasing pressure to reduce their launch mass requirements so that less expensive launch vehicles can be used. For example, the Delta launch vehicle is less than one-fifth the cost of the Titan, and the Taurus is less than half the cost of the Delta. In order to launch on these inexpensive vehicles, significant reductions in mass must be achieved. For example, the Science package o...|$|R
