The chemical bonding states and compositions of the deposited films are analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in-situ ellipsometry measurements are {{performed on the}} deposited films for optical characterization. The effects of the partial pressure ratio of TMOS to N 2 O and the <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>input</b> <b>power</b> on {{the properties of the}} film are investigated. Capacitance-voltage measurements are performed in metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors to obtain the electrical properties of the deposited films. As the partial pressure of N 2 O decreases, the refractive index begins to decrease, reaches a minimum, and then increases again. We attribute the variation of the refractive index to the incorporation of oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen atoms. FTIR absorption bands are observed from about 850 to 1000 cm− 1 and 1120 to 1180 cm− 1, and {{can be attributed to the}} formation of a nitrogen-incorporated silicon-oxide film.

The AGCs were used to estimate the SDR <b>input</b> <b>power</b> and SNR of the received signal and the characterization results showed a nonlinear response to SDR <b>input</b> <b>power</b> and temperature. In order to estimate the SDR input from the AGCs, three algorithms were developed and implemented on the ground software of the SCAN Testbed.

40|$|In {{preliminary}} building energy assessments, it {{is often}} desired to estimate a motor's <b>input</b> <b>power.</b> Motor power estimates in this context should be rapid, safe, and noninvasive. Existing methods for motor <b>input</b> <b>power</b> estimation, such as direct measurement (wattmeter), Current Method, and Slip Method were evaluated. If installed equipment displays <b>input</b> <b>power</b> or average current, then using such readings are preferred. If installed equipment does not display <b>input</b> <b>power</b> or current, the application of wattmeters or current clamps is too time-consuming and invasive for the preliminary energy audit. In that case, if a shaft speed measurement is readily available, then the Slip Method is a satisfactory method for estimating motor <b>input</b> <b>power.</b> An analysis of performance data for 459 motors suggests comparable performance for predicting normalized (to the nominal motor <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> motor <b>input</b> <b>power</b> with the Current and Slip Methods: 10. 0 % and 9. 9 % RMSE, respectively. Both of these methods may be improved by applying regression on the predicted variable and/or nameplate parameters. For example, the Slip Method could be improved by applying a second-order regression, thereby reducing the predicted load factor residual RMSE of the data set from 9. 0 % to 8. 2 %. The Current and Slip Methods were also evaluated on two real motors. The normalized (to the nominal motor <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> predicted <b>input</b> <b>power</b> RMSE for the Current Method was on average 15 % for the two motors; for the Slip Method the corresponding average was 17. 5 %. In some cases, shaft speed measurements may not be available. A temperature-based approach for estimating motor <b>input</b> <b>power</b> was investigated. Other required parameters include ambient temperature, motor efficiency, and a motor thermal constant. The temperature approach offers quick, safe, and non-invasive motor power estimation. However, thermal coefficients may vary significantly across motors and a model to predict the thermal coefficients {{has yet to be}} developed. Furthermore, the temperature approach has a very strong dependence on motor efficiency uncertainty. Experiments were performed on two motors to determine their motor thermal constants. If a motor's thermal constants and running efficiency are known, then this method gave motor <b>input</b> <b>power</b> estimates with a RMSE (normalized to the nominal <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> on the order of 4 % for the studied motors...|$|R
