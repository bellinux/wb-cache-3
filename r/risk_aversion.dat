The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone.

25|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>aversion</b> {{is a kind}} {{of trading}} {{behavior}} exhibited by the foreign exchange market when a potentially adverse event happens which may affect market conditions.

25|$|A {{major reason}} why {{quantified}} models of utility are influential {{today is that}} risk and uncertainty have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory. Quantified utility models simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing marginal utility implies <b>risk</b> <b>aversion.</b> In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of prudence, which means convex marginal utility.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} {{selection}} criterion for decision analysis is subjective. The choice of criterion is made {{outside of the}} analysis (it is exogenous). One of the influences on this choice on this is attitude to risk. <b>Risk</b> <b>aversion</b> describes how willing or unwilling someone is to take risks. Evidence indicates that most, but not all, individuals prefer certain outcomes to uncertain ones. Risk-averse individuals prefer decision criteria that reduce the chance of the worst possible outcome, while risk-seeking individuals prefer decision criteria that maximize the chance of the best possible outcome. In terms of returns on investment, if {{society as a whole}} is risk-averse, we might be willing to accept some investments with negative expected returns, e.g., in mitigation. Such investments may help to reduce the possibility of future climate damages or the costs of adaptation.|$|E

Conducting meta-analyses of recent studies, she demonstrates that, while statistically significant differences in measures of mean <b>risk</b> <b>aversion</b> are sometimes found, the substantive size of these group-level differences tend to be small (on {{the order of a}} fraction of a standard deviation), and many other studies fail to find a statistically significant difference at all.

500|$|Films {{are a major}} form of entertainment, {{although}} not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: documentary film, for example, aims to create a record or inform, although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: [...] "The LumiÃ¨re brothers {{were the first to}} send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public." [...] In 1908, PathÃ© launched and distributed newsreels and by World War I, films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. [...] "In {{the first decade of the}} [...] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms." [...] The Americans first [...] "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," [...] but [...] "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle". Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. Animation, for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences. The advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the 21st century made it [...] "possible to do spectacle" [...] more cheaply and [...] "on a scale never dreamed of" [...] by Cecil B. DeMille. From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the [...] "only mass entertainment" [...] but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, <b>risk</b> <b>aversion</b> and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced. Sophisticated visual effects and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and fantastic) but also to animate non-living items such as Lego normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form. Creators of The Lego Movie [...] "wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer." [...] The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a home theatre, recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.|$|E

40|$|When asset {{markets are}} {{incomplete}} {{there are almost}} always many Pareto improving policy interventions, provided there are multiple commodities and households. Remarkably, these interventions do not involve adding any new markets. Focusing on tax policy, I create a framework for proving the existence of Pareto improving taxes, for computing them, and for estimating {{the size of the}} Pareto improvement. It requires information about how taxes and prices affect aggregate, but not individual, demand. If taxes targeting current incomes are Pareto improving, then they must cause an equilibrium price adjustment, whose role is to redistribute wealth across states, creating insurance beyond the assets'. Conversely, I prove that if the price adjustment is sufficiently sensitive to <b>risk</b> <b>aversions,</b> then for almost all <b>risk</b> <b>aversions</b> and endowments, Pareto improving taxes exist. I show how to verify this sensitivity test with standard demand theory, which Turner (2003 a) extends from complete to incomplete markets. I show that different policies generically admit Pareto improving taxes, by showing they all pass this same sensitivity test. These include (a) tax rates on purchases of assets, (b) lump-sum taxes on present income plus one flat tax rate on purchases of assets, (c) asset measurable tax rates on capital gains, (d) tax rates on net purchases of present commodities. I give a formula for the welfare impact of taxes, numerically identifying the Pareto improving taxes. The formula requires information about individual marginal utilities and net trades, and about the derivative of aggregate, not individual, demand with respect to prices and taxes. I estimate the rate of Pareto improvement by defining an agent's equilibrium insurance deficit. This deficit vanishes exactly when her commodity demand is as though markets were complete. The rate is quadratic in the insurance deficits, and affine in the level of trade and in the proximity to price crashesPareto improvement, taxation, incomplete markets...|$|R

Irreversibility of the investment in product development is introduced in a continuous-time stochastic model applying the real option literature.
