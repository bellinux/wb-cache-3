5|$|The {{first step}} in fusion {{involves}} the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of gp120 to CD4. Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> domains of gp120 and allowing them {{to interact with the}} target chemokine receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.|$|E

50|$|Extravasated {{neutrophils}} in {{the cellular}} phase {{come into contact}} with microbes at the inflamed tissue. Phagocytes express cell-surface endocytic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that have affinity and efficacy against non-specific microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Most PAMPs that bind to endocytic PRRs and initiate phagocytosis are cell wall components, including complex carbohydrates such as mannans and β-glucans, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycans, and surface proteins. Endocytic PRRs on phagocytes reflect these molecular patterns, with C-type lectin <b>receptors</b> <b>binding</b> to mannans and β-glucans, and scavenger <b>receptors</b> <b>binding</b> to LPS.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{intrinsic}} efficacy (<b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> ability) of epinephrine, high concentrations of the drug cause negative side effects when treating asthma. The value of using nebulized epinephrine in acute asthma is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Both {{envelope}} proteins (E1 and E2) {{are highly}} glycosylated and important in cell entry. E1 {{serves as the}} fusogenic subunit and E2 acts as the <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> protein. E1 has 4–5 N-linked glycans and E2 has 11 N-glycosylation sites.|$|E
25|$|In {{the example}} {{shown to the}} left, ligand-binding curves are shown for two ligands with {{different}} binding affinities. Ligand binding is often characterized {{in terms of the}} concentration of ligand at which half of the <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> sites are occupied, known as the IC50, which is related to but different from the dissociation constant. The ligand illustrated by the red curve has a higher binding affinity and smaller Kd than the ligand illustrated by the green curve. If these two ligands were present at the same time, more of the higher-affinity ligand would be bound to the available <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> sites. This is how carbon monoxide can compete with oxygen in binding to hemoglobin, resulting in carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Dioxins and dioxin-like {{compounds}} are teratogens that exert {{their effects}} through the {{aryl hydrocarbon receptor}} (AhR) {{in conjunction with the}} <b>receptor's</b> <b>binding</b> partner, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). The protein encoded by this gene represses signal transduction by the AhR by competing with the arylhydrocarbon <b>receptor</b> for <b>binding</b> to the ARNT. Expression of the repressor is stimulated by the receptor/translocator heterodimer, thereby regulating receptor function through a negative feedback mechanism. In addition, the encoded protein can bind to nuclear factor-kappa B.|$|R
40|$|The {{superior}} temporal gyrus (STG) {{is strongly}} {{implicated in the}} pathophysiology of schizophrenia,particularly with regards to auditory hallucinations. In this study, using in situ quantitative autoradiography in postmortem tissue, we investigated the binding of the [3 H]ketanserin to 5 -HT 2 A receptors and [3 H] mesulergine to 5 -HT 2 C receptors in the left STG of 8 male schizophrenic patients compared to 8 control subjects. A strong [3 H]ketanserin binding was observed in the STG, however {{there was a very}} weak [3 H] mesulergine binding in the STG. A significant decrease in binding of [3 H]ketanserin was clearly observed in schizophrenia patients in comparison with control subjects. There were no significant correlations between 5 -HT 2 A binding density and age, postmortem intervals, or brain pH. These results suggest that the alterations of the 5 -HT 2 A receptors contribute to the pathophysiology of the STG in schizophrenia. Furthermore, there is a clear tendency for a positive correlation between 5 -HT 2 A and muscarinic M 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>bindings,</b> and for negative correlations between 5 -HT 2 A and GABAA <b>receptor</b> <b>bindings</b> and between muscarinic M 1 and GABAA <b>receptor</b> <b>bindings.</b> This provides a possible mechanism of auditory hallucinations through interactions between 5 -HT 2 A, acetylcholine muscarinic and GABA transmissions in the STG in schizophrenia...|$|R

25|$|NMDA receptors {{are another}} cation channel {{that is more}} {{permeable}} to Ca2+. The function of NMDA receptors is dependant on Glycine <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> as a co-agonist within the channel pore. NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present.|$|E
25|$|Plasmin is inactivated by {{proteins}} such as α2-macroglobulin and α2-antiplasmin. The {{mechanism of}} plasmin inactivation involves the cleavage of an α2-macroglobulin at the bait region (a {{segment of the}} aM that is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage) by plasmin. This initiates a conformational change such that the α2-macroglobulin collapses about the plasmin. In the resulting α2-macroglobulin-plasmin complex, the active site of plasmin is sterically shielded, thus substantially decreasing the plasmin's access to protein substrates. Two additional events occur {{as a consequence of}} bait region cleavage, namely (i) a h-cysteinyl-g-glutamyl thiol ester of the α2-macroglobulin becomes highly reactive and (ii) a major conformational change exposes a conserved COOH-terminal <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> domain. The exposure of this <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> domain allows the α2-macroglobulin protease complex to bind to clearance receptors and be removed from circulation.|$|E
25|$|Class 3 Semaphorins (SEMA3s) {{regulate}} angiogenesis by modulating {{endothelial cell}} adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival and {{the recruitment of}} pericytes. Furthermore, semaphorins can interfere with VEGF-mediated angiogenesis since both SEMA3s and VEGF-A compete for Neuropilin <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> at endothelial cells. The relative expression levels of SEMA3s and VEGF-A may therefore be important for angiogenesis.|$|E

25|$|Ipilimumab (Yervoy) {{is a human}} IgG1 {{antibody}} {{that binds}} the surface protein CTLA4.

CTLA4 binds to CD80 or CD86, preventing the binding of CD28 to these surface proteins and therefore negatively regulates the activation of T-cells.|$|E
25|$|It was {{suggested}} {{as early as}} 1967 (when {{the exact nature of}} those channels was still unknown) that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors bound acetylcholine in a cooperative manner due to the existence of several binding sites.

A few clinical head-to-head comparisons have been made and candesartan, irbesartan and telmisartan appear to be slightly more effective than losartan in lowering blood pressure.

25|$|In the {{presence}} of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a competitive progesterone receptor antagonist (in the absence of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a partial agonist). Mifepristone is a 19-nor steroid with a bulky p-(dimethylamino)phenyl substituent above {{the plane of the}} molecule at the 11β-position responsible for inducing or stabilizing an inactive receptor conformation and a hydrophobic 1-propynyl substituent below the plane of the molecule at the 17α-position that increases its progesterone <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> affinity.|$|E

In animal studies 3-bromocytisine stimulates the release of dopamine and noradrenaline and increases locomotor activity.|$|R
