40|$|Abstract—We {{analyze the}} {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) of a multiuser fieldbus communication scheme which applies discrete multitone (DMT) modulation. In particular, we derive very accurate analytical expressions on the SNR in down- and uplink. Thereby each subscriber is modeled by a transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>circuit</b> which comprises major noise sources. It {{turns out that}} a strong noise funneling arises in uplink where several subscribers have simultaneously access to the channel. For that reason, we derive two low-complexity optimization strategies where one compensates for the near-far effect and the other optimizes the operating point of the digital-to-analog converter. The presented methods provide fairness between subscribers and a significant gain in uplink SNR, simultaneously. Besides, we analyze exem-plary networks and show that simulation results are in excellent agreement with our analytical expressions. Additionally, both illustrate that optimization can yield gains of several dBs in uplink SNR such that the fieldbus communication scheme offers comparable SNR performance in both communication directions.

30|$|Physical {{separation}} and inherent attenuation between the transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>circuits</b> introduces {{a small amount}} of passive suppression. However, typically passive suppression (or the isolation through a circulator) alone is insufficient to allow reliable full-duplex communications [30]. Additional signal processing is required to actively suppress and reduce the strength of the self-interference to the noise floor. In general, some of this active suppression must be achieved before the received signal is digitised, i.e., in the analog domain, since entirely digital suppression is usually not feasible due to limited ADC resolution when the external signal-of-interest is small relative to the self-interference [2].|$|R

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} for realising full-duplex systems {{is the presence of}} strong self-interference arising from physically close transmitting and receiving antennas [1, 4, 5]. A full-duplex system can also be implemented using only a single antenna and a circulator; however, imperfect isolation will still allow self-interference signals to leak between the transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>circuits.</b> The power of the self-interference signal can be orders of magnitude larger than any external signal of interest, and full-duplex systems must therefore implement self-interference suppression [2]. Ideally, this suppression will reduce the power of the self-interference signal to or below the noise floor. Where this cannot be achieved, the residual self-interference will lower the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduce throughput.|$|R
