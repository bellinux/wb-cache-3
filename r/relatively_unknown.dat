5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and shot) noise but those concepts were <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> and little understood at the time despite an early paper by Schottky in 1918 on shot noise. To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.|$|E
5|$|Everybody {{had thought}} St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural {{firebreak}} {{in the form}} of a wide, empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, an enormous stroke of bad luck meant that the building was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by a <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.|$|E

5|$|Gilliam {{originally}} {{believed that}} Pitt {{was not right}} {{for the role of}} Jeffrey Goines, but the casting director convinced him otherwise. Pitt was cast for a comparatively small salary, as he was still <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> at the time. By the time of 12 Monkeys release, however, Interview with the Vampire (1994), Legends of the Fall (1994), and Se7en (1995) had been released, making Pitt an A-list actor, which drew greater attention to the film and boosted its box-office standing. In Philadelphia, months before filming, Pitt spent weeks at Temple University's hospital, visiting and studying the psychiatric ward to prepare for his role.|$|E

5|$|Many {{actors were}} {{considered}} to replace Reeves including: Simon Baker Denny, Jon Bon Jovi, Patrick Muldoon, Johnathon Schaech, Christian Slater, and Billy Zane. Bullock initially suggested Matthew McConaughey, who passed on the role, prompting her to suggest Jason Patric, {{with whom she had}} wanted to work since seeing his performance in After Dark, My Sweet (1990). De Bont was skeptical of featuring a <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> actor such as Patric, but was reminded by the studio that Bullock and Reeves were also <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> prior to Speed, and ultimately chose Patric based on his role in Sleepers (1996). Patric was paid a reported $4.5–$8 million for his role in Speed2 and used his salary to finance a 1998 drama, Your Friends & Neighbors. After accepting the role, Patric stated that he never saw Speed or had any intentions of seeing it; Reeves said he was looking forward to seeing Patric star in the sequel. After Reeves declined to appear in Speed2, the screenplay was rewritten to remove his character from the story, which De Bont wanted to deal with early in the film. His absence is explained in the first scene, where Annie talks about how her relationship with Jack did not work out, and mentions her current relationship with Alex (Patric), before his character is introduced in the film.|$|E

Although the practice was beginning to attract an overseas constituency, it remained <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> in the Western world until the Spring of 1999, when tensions between Falun Gong and Communist Party authorities became a subject of international media coverage. With the increased attention, the practice gained a greater following outside China. Following {{the launch of the}} Communist Party's persecution of Falun Gong, the overseas presence became vital to the practice's resistance in China and its continued survival.|$|E

5|$|After {{showing the}} game at the Macworld Expo, Bungie was mobbed with {{interest}} and orders for the game. The game was not finished until December 14, 1994; Jones {{and a few other}} employees spent a day at a warehouse assembling boxes so that some of the orders could be filled before Christmas. The game was a critical and commercial success, and is regarded as a <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> but important part of gaming history. It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only games like Doom and System Shock. The game's volume of orders was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone orders could not scale to the demand and hired another company to handle {{the tens of thousands of}} orders. Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E

Sheet music sales soared during the War, enabling Boosey & Hawkes to buy Editions Russes which held the rights to the most valuable works of Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky. The company also purchased the lease of the Royal Opera House in London in 1944, rescuing it from becoming a permanent dance hall and providing a venue for world-class ballet and opera in the capital.|$|E

5|$|Following the speech, Nixon {{formally}} selected Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland as {{his running}} mate, who received 1119 delegate votes, with the distant second being Governor Romney with 186. Agnew was <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> nationally, and was selected due to his purported appeal to African Americans, and work for the Nixon campaign after an embarrassing experience {{as the head of}} the Draft Rockefeller movement. It was later noted that the convention had featured Nixon as the centrist candidate with Rockefeller to his left and Reagan to his right. The same analysis applied to the general campaign, as commentators noted that Nixon would stand to the right of the still undecided Democratic nominee but would fall to the left of American Independent Party candidate George Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Hooper {{produced}} the film {{for less than}} $300,000 (about $ adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, {{so that he could}} finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor. Louis Perano of Bryanston Pictures eventually purchased the distribution rights. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally.|$|E

40|$|The {{expected}} value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) denotes {{the value of}} eliminating uncertainty on a subset of unknown parameters involved in a decision model. The EVPPI {{can be regarded as}} a decision-theoretic sensitivity index, and has been widely used for identifying <b>relatively</b> important <b>unknown</b> parameters. It follows from Jensen's inequality, however, that the standard nested Monte Carlo computation of the EVPPI results in biased estimates. In this paper we introduce two unbiased Monte Carlo estimators for the EVPPI based on multilevel Monte Carlo method, introduced by Heinrich (1998) and Giles (2008), and its extension by Rhee and Glynn (2012, 2015). Our unbiased estimators are simple and straightforward to implement, and thus are of highly practical use. Numerical experiments show that even the convergence behaviors of our unbiased estimators are superior to that of the standard nested Monte Carlo estimator...|$|R
5|$|In April 1985, Wilkinson {{formed a}} {{campaign}} committee {{in advance of}} the 1987 gubernatorial election. <b>Relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> statewide, Wilkinson was the first candidate to enter the race. The Democratic primary field eventually grew to include two previous Kentucky governors, John Y. Brown, Jr. and Julian Carroll; sitting Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, who would later win two terms as governor in 2007 and 2011; and Grady Stumbo, cabinet secretary for Governor Martha Layne Collins. Early in the race, Brown was the clear-cut favorite, while Wilkinson was picked to finish fifth. Wilkinson financed his own campaign and campaign manager Danny Briscoe suggested that he hire a campaign consultant {{to reach out to the}} state's large concentration of undecided voters. After a few interviews, Wilkinson hired a then-unknown political consultant named James Carville; Carville later went on to chair Bill Clinton's successful presidential campaign in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In Paris, Bizet {{discovered}} the difficulties faced by young and <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> composers {{trying to get}} their operas performed. Of the capital's two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the , the former offered a static repertoire in which works by foreign composers, particularly Rossini and Meyerbeer, were dominant. Even established French composers such as Gounod had difficulty getting works performed there. At the Opéra-Comique, innovation was equally rare; although more French works were performed, the style and character of most productions had hardly changed since the 1830s. However, one condition of the Opéra-Comique's state funding was that from time to time it should produce one-act works by former Prix de Rome laureates. Under this provision, Bizet wrote La guzla de l'Emir, with a libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré, and this went into rehearsal early in 1862.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{recorded}} about Charlton's early life, {{as he grew}} up in a <b>relatively</b> <b>unknown</b> mining district. It is known, however, that Charlton was born on 15 March 1866 in Linton, Victoria, a small town near Ballarat that today has less than 500 residents. He was born to Matthew Charlton, an English miner from Durham, and Mabel (née Foard). In 1871, the five-year-old Charlton's father moved with his family to Lambton, a suburb of Newcastle, New South Wales. After primary education at Lambton Public School, Charlton began work at Lambton Colliery as a coal trapper; a children's-only job opening trapdoors for coal carts. When too old for the job, Charlton was given a job at the coal-face. At 23 he married Martha Rollings at nearby New Lambton.|$|E
