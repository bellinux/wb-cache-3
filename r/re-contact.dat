2500|$|Phoenix was NASA's sixth {{successful}} landing out {{of seven}} attempts {{and was the first}} successful landing in a Martian polar region. The lander completed its mission in August 2008, and made a last brief communication with Earth on November 2 as available solar power dropped with the Martian winter. The mission was declared concluded on November 10, 2008, after engineers were unable to <b>re-contact</b> the craft. [...] After unsuccessful attempts to contact the lander by the Mars Odyssey orbiter up to and past the Martian summer solstice on May 12, 2010, JPL declared the lander to be dead. The program was considered a success because it completed all planned science experiments and observations.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earthworm}} is a limbless annelid worm with a hydrostatic skeleton {{that moves}} by peristalsis. Its hydrostatic skeleton {{consists of a}} fluid-filled body cavity surrounded by an extensible body wall. The worm moves by radially constricting the anterior portion of its body, resulting {{in an increase in}} length via hydrostatic pressure. This constricted region propagates posteriorly along the worm's body. As a result, each segment is extended forward, then relaxes and <b>re-contacts</b> the substrate, with hair-like setae preventing backwards slipping.|$|R

50|$|The Space Shuttle {{main engines}} (SSMEs) were ignited at T-6.6 seconds. The SSMEs were liquid-fueled {{and could be}} safely shut down (and the launch aborted if necessary) until the Solid Rocket Boosters ignited at T=0 (which was at 11:38:00.010 EST) and the {{hold-down}} bolts were released with explosives, freeing the vehicle from the pad. At lift off, the three SSMEs were at 100% of their original rated performance, and began throttling up to 104% under computer control. With the first vertical motion of the vehicle, the gaseous hydrogen vent arm retracted from the External Tank (ET) but failed to latch back. Review of film shot by pad cameras showed that the arm did not <b>re-contact</b> the vehicle, and thus it was ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident. The post-launch inspection of the pad also revealed that kick springs on four of the hold-down bolts were missing, but they were similarly ruled out as a possible cause.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2002, Magnifico Arts {{presented}} a show ReMo: ReModernism {{of graduate students}} from the University of New Mexico. At an artists' talk, Kevin Radley, an art professor at the University of California, Berkeley said, [...] "Remodernism isn't about going backwards, but about surging forward." [...] In an essay that accompanied the exhibition, Radley wrote: ...there {{seems to be a}} re-emergence of confidence in the artist's singular voice - a renewal of the belief that an artist can explore their own natures without the restraints of the ironic, the cynical or the didactic. To <b>re-contact</b> the notions of presence, reinvent their sense of beauty and renew our need for intimacy. [...] The show curator, Yoshimi Hayashi, said: ReMo incorporates ideas from Modernism, Avantegardism, and Post Modernism; thus synthesizing an alternative and real time contemporary approach to art. In ReMo, issues such as multiculturalism, irony, the sublime, and identity are considered; however, they do not become the art itself. The reconsideration and redefinition of the traditions are sought not by mere deconstructionism, but rather by connecting new nodes of ideas. Therefore, by definition, ReMo is fundamentally cellular and its roots stem from provincial art settings.|$|E
50|$|The Portraits of American Life Study (abbreviated PALS, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity) is a panel study focusing on religion in the United States, particularly {{as it relates to}} racial and ethnic diversity. The study's first wave of data collection took place in 2006, and surveyed 2,610 people. In 2008, the researchers attempted <b>re-contact</b> with the 522 original respondents who attended religious services several times per year despite not being a member of a religious congregation. The original 2006 study was led by sociologists Michael Emerson of Rice University and David Sikkink of the University of Notre Dame. In 2012, the researchers surveyed exactly the same people they originally surveyed six years earlier. The 2012 survey showed that a significantly higher percent of Americans (58%) respected all religions equally than did in the original 2006 survey (one-third). In 2016, University of Oklahoma sociologist Samuel Perry analyzed data from the PALS and found that people who watch pornography {{at least once a week}} are more likely to be religious six years later. A 2013 Brandeis University analysis of the PALS found that people who consider religion important in their lives are more likely to make decisions based on their religion.|$|E

40|$|Once an {{incidental}} finding (IF) {{is discovered}} {{in the course of}} genomic research, the researchers are faced with {{the question of whether or}} not that finding should be reported back to the study participant. A large number of hypothetical studies and policy documents on this issue have been published, but there are very few empirical studies to inform the bioethics debate. Within a biobank research study of somatic mutations in breast carcinomas, ten germline BRCA 1 / 2 mutations were incidentally detected. After thorough discussions within a group of experts, the mutation carriers (n = 7) or relatives of deceased carriers (n = 3) were <b>re-contacted</b> and informed about the findings. Eight out of ten accepted to receive the information and underwent confirmatory testing. One year later, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with three of the study participants. All of them felt that BRCA mutations {{discovered in the}} course of research should be reported back to the individual study participants. In this paper, we report our step-by-step experiences of the <b>re-contacting</b> process. We hope that our detailed reporting will be helpful for other researchers and clinicians that are faced with similar situations. The results of our study lend empirical support to opinion that IFs that meet the three baseline criteria of analytic validity, clinical significance, and actionability should be reported back to the individual study participants...|$|R
50|$|The working {{mechanism}} of the triboelectric nanogenerator {{can be described as}} the periodic change of the potential difference induced by the cycled separation and <b>re-contact</b> of the opposite triboelectric charges on the inner surfaces of the two sheets. When a mechanical agitation is applied onto the device to bend or press it, the inners surfaces of the two sheets will get into close contact and the charge transfer will begin, leaving one side of the surface with positive charges and the other with negative charges. This is just the triboelectric effect. When the deformation is released, the two surfaces with opposite charges will separate automatically, so that these opposite triboelectric charges will generate an electric field in between and thus induce a potential difference across the top and bottom electrodes. In order to screen this potential difference, the electrons will be driven to flow from one electrode to the other through the external load. The electricity generated in this process will continue until the potentials of the two electrodes get back to even again. Subsequently, when the two sheets are pressed towards each other again, the triboelectric-charge-induced potential difference will begin to decrease to zero, so that the transferred charges will flow back through the external load, to generate another current pulse in the opposite direction. When this periodic mechanical deformation lasts, the alternating current (AC) signals will be continuously generated.|$|E
5000|$|Roupell's 36th Brigade were {{deployed}} {{as part of}} 12th (Eastern) Infantry Division in April 1940 and {{became part of the}} British Expeditionary Force (BEF), taking part in the Battle of France. The German thrust near the Somme river towards Abbeville eventually cut off the BEF, northern French and Belgian forces from the rest of France. Roupell's brigade headquarters near Doullens was attacked by enemy troops and on being told of the threat Roupell is reported to have exclaimed: [...] "Never mind the Germans. I'm just going to finish my cup of tea." [...] When the brigade headquarters was overrun on 20 May 1940, Roupell gave the order for the survivors to split up into small groups and endeavour to <b>re-contact</b> Allied toops. Roupell, with a captain and French interpreter, avoided capture, hiding by day and walking at night for over a month. They arrived at a farm near Rouen where the two officers remained for almost two years, working as labourers. With the help of the French Resistance they were moved through unoccupied France into non-belligerent Spain, finally boarding ship in Gibraltar and returning to the United Kingdom. Following his return he was appointed commanding officer of 114th Infantry Brigade on 18 March 1943, a command he held until 2 November that year.

40|$|Aims: A common {{objective}} of epidemiological surveys {{is to provide}} population-level estimates of health indicators. Survey results tend to be biased under selective non-participation. One approach to bias reduction is to collect information about non-participants by contacting them again and asking them to fill in a questionnaire. This information is called <b>re-contact</b> data, and it allows to adjust the estimates for non-participation. Methods: We analyse data from the FINRISK 2012 survey, where <b>re-contact</b> data were collected. We assume that the respondents of the <b>re-contact</b> survey {{are similar to the}} remaining non-participants with respect to the health given their available background information. Validity of this assumption is evaluated based on the hospitalization data obtained through record linkage of survey data to the administrative registers. Using this assumption and multiple imputation, we estimate the prevalences of daily smoking and heavy alcohol consumption and compare them to estimates obtained with a commonly used assumption that the participants represent the entire target group. Results: This approach produces higher prevalence estimates than what is estimated from participants only. Among men, smoking prevalence estimate was 28. 5 % (23. 2 % for participants), heavy alcohol consumption prevalence was 9. 4 % (6. 8 % for participants). Among women, smoking prevalence was 19. 0 % (16. 5 % for participants) and heavy alcohol consumption 4. 8 % (3. 0 % for participants). Conclusion: Utilization of <b>re-contact</b> data is a useful method to adjust for non-participation bias on population estimates in epidemiological surveys.

40|$|The Crew Return Vehicle (CRV) {{slated for}} use on the International Space Station (ISS) {{provides}} a safe return for up to seven crew members under various emergency conditions. One of the most demanding situations for executing the escape involves separating from a tumbling ISS Current requirements specify a maximum Root Sum Square (RSS) tumble rate of 2 degrees/second, with the additional requirement for an expedited departure from any ISS attitude. The design of a trajectory that ensures no <b>re-contact</b> with the ISS poses many challenges on the Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C) system of the vehicle. To ensure no <b>re-contact</b> the trajectory design employs a two burn sequence, with the first burn preventing near-term collision and the second burn preventing far-field <b>re-contact</b> This presentation describes the approach used to design and to evaluate trajectories for CRV departure from the baselined location on the ISS Node 3 starboard.

40|$|Abstract Background Large-scale whole genome {{sequencing}} (WGS) studies promise to revolutionize cancer research by identifying targets for therapy and by discovering molecular biomarkers to aid early diagnosis, to better determine prognosis {{and to improve}} treatment response prediction. Such projects raise a number of ethical, legal, and social (ELS) issues that should be considered. In this study, {{we set out to}} discover how these issues are being handled across different jurisdictions. Methods We examined informed consent (IC) forms from 30 cancer {{genome sequencing}} studies to assess (1) stated purpose of sample collection, (2) scope of consent requested, (3) data sharing protocols (4) privacy protection measures, (5) described risks of participation, (6) subject <b>re-contacting,</b> and (7) protocol for withdrawal. Results There is a high degree of similarity in how cancer researchers engaged in WGS are protecting participant privacy. We observed a strong trend towards both using samples for additional, unspecified research and sharing data with other investigators. IC forms were varied in terms of how they discussed <b>re-contacting</b> participants, returning results and facilitating participant withdrawal. Contrary to expectation, there were no consistent trends that emerged over the eight year period from which forms were collected. Conclusion Examining IC forms from WGS studies elucidates how investigators are handling ELS challenges posed by this research. This information is important for ensuring that while the public benefits of research are maximized, the rights of participants are also being appropriately respected. </p...|$|R
