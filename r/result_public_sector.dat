As {{part of this}} process, standard setters must define the elements {{to be used in}} the accounting system. As a <b>result</b> <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> accounting bodies have adopted varied definitions of assets. All these definitions, in contrast to corporate accounting definitions, make allowance for some physical, intangible, or infrastructure assets to be accounted for off the balance sheet. In this article, we explore the varied definitions promulgated by the standards from the International Federation of Accountants, the United States, and Finland. Secondly, we discuss the assets that are excluded from balance sheet recognition and the basis for the conclusions to mandate off balance sheet status. Finally, we discuss if the existing treatment of off balance sheet assets is consistent with the use of the assets and produces a relevant, complete balance sheet...|$|E
30|$|The {{opponents of}} {{healthcare}} privatization backed their arguments by highlighting {{the negative effects}} of privatization on healthcare systems and vulnerable populations [4, 7]. Mexico was one of the many countries that received loans from the WB in 1997 to privatize its social security system which drastically changed the conditions of health [7]. As a <b>result,</b> <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> organizations faced budget reductions that led to an erosion of healthcare services and left millions of unemployed and low-income people without insurance [7 – 9]. IMF’s monetarist strategies towards prioritizing fiscal restraint (low budget deficits) and price stability (low inflation) were unreasonably restrictive. These policies have prevented many developing countries from improving long-term public health investment by decreasing the percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) allocated to the underlying public health infrastructures [4]. These policies negatively impacted low-income people and increased the inequity in access to health care. Such strict strategies resulted in thousands of deaths due to tuberculosis in Eastern Europe as public healthcare had been weakened [8, 10].|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This study {{seeks to}} survey {{managers}} of an Australian government-owned enterprise undergoing organisational {{change as a}} <b>result</b> of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> reform, specifically, National Competition Policy and Corporatisation. The {{purpose of the study}} is to examine the extent/type of organisational change and leadership style adopted to implement this change. [...] - Design/methodology/approach - To understand the effect of reforms, the researcher explored the extent of change and leadership style through the use of an intra-organisational survey in a government-owned Electricity Supply Corporation in Queensland, Australia. The instrument also included qualitative components to enable the researcher to qualify the statistical results. [...] - Findings - Within the <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> there is an uneasy tension between the need for a revolution of outdated bureaucracies in order to enhance flexibility and innovation, on the one hand, and the desire to maintain the standards and procedures that are necessary for quality civic service for a broad range of stakeholders, on the other. The results {{of this study indicate that}} there was significant organisational change and, according to responses, a change of leadership style indicative of this dilemma. [...] - Research limitations/implications - The implications suggest the consideration of embedded factors while determining the processes and directions of change. Furthermore, it is necessary to choose a leadership style that is indicative of the type of change to be implemented. Additionally, greater participation by organisational members can increase the success of organisational change. The limitations of the study include the measurement of organisational change and leadership style. This instrument was originally used in structured interviews; however, measures were taken to validate the instrument in its altered setting. Further, the study is confined to a single electricity organisation. Fertile fields for future research projects could include a larger quantitative study conducted with multiple states or nation-wide electricity distribution companies.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Early stage {{venture capital}} {{investments}} declined sharply following the post- 2000 technology crash. Investment activity began to pick-up by mid-decade, {{in large measure}} as a <b>result</b> of increased <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> involvement, but has been brought to a halt by the global financial crisis. At the regional scale, several northern regions now have more than their expected share of early stage venture capital investment. However, deal sizes are small, hence early stage venture capital, measured by the total amount invested, remains over-concentrated in London and the south-east. Moreover, the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> now dominates much of the investment activity in the midlands and north. The paper argues that <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> venture capital is unable to create entrepreneurial regions and that a regionally-based model of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> venture capital is ineffective because it lacks scale. A new approach for venture capital-deficient regions is therefore required which gives greater emphasis to the demand-side...|$|R
