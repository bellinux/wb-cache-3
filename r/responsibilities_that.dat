5|$|The Isenberg Fellows RAP {{is divided}} into two {{different}} groups. Students of the Business in Society Fellows will explore how businesses operate in and impact a community. It will highlight the social <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> businesses have, including ethics and community service. The other group is called the Diversity & International Business Fellows, and these students will learn about the global and diversity issues that businesses are facing today.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean pantheon already {{included}} many divinities that were subsequently encountered in Classical Greece, {{although it is}} difficult to determine whether these deities had the characteristics and <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> would be attributed to them in later periods. In general, the same divinities were worshipped throughout the Mycenaean palatial world. There may be some indications for local deities at various sites, in particular in Crete. The uniformity of Mycenaean religion is also reflected in archaeological evidence with the phi- and psi-figurines that have been found all over Late Bronze Age Greece.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fictional}} city of Mitakihara, Japan, {{a middle school}} student named Madoka Kaname and her friend Sayaka Miki {{encounter}} a small, cat-like creature named Kyubey. It offers a contract in which a girl may have any wish granted in exchange for obtaining magical powers and being tasked with fighting against witches. Meanwhile, a transfer student and magical girl named Homura Akemi tries to stop Madoka from making the contract with Kyubey at all costs. Madoka and Sayaka then meet Mami Tomoe, an upperclassman at the same school {{who is also a}} magical girl and offers to bring them along on her witch hunts so that they may learn of the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> come with being a magical girl.|$|E

25|$|English {{tort law}} is the law {{governing}} implicit civil <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> people have to one another, {{as opposed to those}} responsibilities laid out in contracts. It provides legal remedies, often the payment of money, to those who have been damaged by someone else's failure to meet these implicit responsibilities. Other countries' tort laws can work quite differently.|$|E
25|$|It is {{considered}} a greater sin to advertise one's fasting than to {{not participate in the}} fast. Fasting is a purely personal communication between the Orthodox Christian and God, and in fact has no place whatsoever in the public life of the Coptic Orthodox Church. If one has <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> cannot be fulfilled because of fasting, then it is perfectly permissible not to fast.|$|E

He generally delegated or neglected many of the formal political <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> he was assigned, usually citing his poor health.|$|E
25|$|The Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) {{was founded}} in 1943 by Paul H.

25|$|Academic {{anatomical}} pathology is practiced at university medical centers by pathologists {{who are also}} university faculty. As such, they often have diverse <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> may include training pathology residents, teaching medical students, conducting basic, clinical, or translational research, and/or performing administrative duties, all {{in addition to the}} practice of diagnostic {{anatomical pathology}}. Pathologists in academic settings often sub-specialize in a particular area of anatomic pathology and may serve as consultants to other pathologists regarding cases in their specific area of expertise.|$|E

Longtime DOB member Helen Sandoz, who had taken over editing it after an interim period after Barbara Gittings left, was so burdened by the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> it was affecting her relationship. She {{passed it on to}} Barbara Grier in 1968, who had been contributing to the magazine as a book reviewer and poetry writer. Grier edited the magazine from Kansas City and was a relative newcomer to the workings of the DOB, despite contributing to the magazine since 1957.|$|E
25|$|The Physician Charter {{sets forth}} {{a series of}} {{professional}} principles and <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> physician should seek to embody in their practice, including {{the principles of the}} primacy of patient welfare, patient autonomy, and social justice. The Physician Charter has been endorsed by more than 130 organizations, translated into 12 languages, and 100,000 copies have been distributed. In 2014 the ABIM Foundation partnered with McGraw-Hill to publish Understanding Medical Professionalism. The book was authored by medical professionalism experts Wendy S. Levinson, MD; Shiphra Ginsburg, MD; Frederic W. Hafferty, PhD; and Catherine R. Lucey, MD.|$|E

25|$|The young Owain ap Gruffydd was {{possibly}} fostered {{at the home}} of David Hanmer, a rising lawyer shortly to be a justice of the Kings Bench, or {{at the home of}} Richard FitzAlan, 3rd Earl of Arundel. Owain is then thought to have been sent to London to study law at the Inns of Court. He probably studied as a legal apprentice for seven years. He {{was possibly}} in London during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. By 1383, he had returned to Wales, where he married David Hanmer's daughter, Margaret, started his large family and established himself as the Squire of Sycharth and Glyndyfrdwy, with all the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> entailed.|$|E
25|$|President Miguel de la Madrid (1982–88), {{took office}} during the {{aftermath}} of the crash of the Mexican economy. During his administration, municipalities were entrusted with providing water supply and sanitation services within the framework of a general decentralization process. At the same time, state governments were made responsible for technical and financial assistance. They were also authorized to decide about the municipalities' capacity for providing the services. Most municipalities neither received the necessary financial resources nor the technical assistance to fulfill their new <b>responsibilities.</b> <b>That</b> is why in 1988 only 10 of 31 Mexican states had devolved responsibility to the municipalities and where they did, service quality and efficiency usually deteriorated.|$|E
25|$|Winter Games (1988) {{was based}} on a story by Yitzhak Ben-Ner, adapted to the screen by Dita Guery (together with Meir Doron, Gilad Evron, and Ram Loevy, who had earlier collaborated on Bread). Ostensibly the story of the Jewish {{underground}} movement fighting against the British in Mandatory Palestine as seen {{from the perspective of a}} young boy, it is also a classic Bildungsroman about a boy transitioning into manhood with all the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> this entails. At the same time, however, it can also be seen as a metaphor for the State of Israel and its transition from youthful idealism of its founders' generation to the recognition of the stark realities facing a nation in its forties.|$|E

25|$|Medicare {{finds itself}} in the odd {{position}} of having assumed control of graduate medical education, currently facing major budget constraints, and as a result, freezing funding for graduate medical education, {{as well as for}} physician reimbursement rates. This halt in funding in turn exacerbates the exact problem Medicare sought to solve in the first place: improving the availability of medical care. However, some healthcare administration experts believe that the shortage of physicians may be an opportunity for providers to reorganize their delivery systems to become less costly and more efficient. Physicians' assistants and Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners may begin assuming more <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> traditionally fell to doctors, but do not necessarily require the advanced training and skill of a physician.|$|E
25|$|In Nigeria, school {{counseling}} began in 1959 and exists in some high schools. It rarely exists {{at the elementary}} school level. Where there are federally funded secondary schools, there are some professionally trained school counselors. However, in many cases, there are only teachers who function as career masters/mistresses. School counselors often have teaching and other <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> take time away from their {{school counseling}} tasks. The Counseling Association of Nigeria (CASSON) was formed in 1976 to promote the profession, but there is no code of ethics. However, a certification/licensure board has been formed. Aluede, Adomeh, & Afen-Akpaida (2004) discussed the overreliance on textbooks from the USA and the need for school counselors in Nigeria to take a whole-school approach and lessen the focus on individual approaches and honor the traditional African world view that values the family and community's roles in decision-making as paramount for effective decision-making in schools.|$|E
25|$|Holt came {{to regard}} the {{referendum}} as indicative of {{a shift in the}} national mood. In the following months, he toured Aboriginal communities and consulted with indigenous leaders, including Charles Perkins and Kath Walker. Despite opposition from state governments, he created a new Office of Aboriginal Affairs within the Prime Minister's Department, as well as a new advisory body called the Council of Aboriginal Affairs (chaired by H. C. Coombs). According to Coombs and Paul Hasluck, Holt had little interest in indigenous affairs before becoming prime minister. Despite this, he brought about a fundamental shift in the way policy was handled, paving the way {{for the federal government to}} assume many of the powers and <b>responsibilities</b> <b>that</b> had previously been the preserve of the states. Indigenous academic Gary Foley has said that Holt's death was a setback for Aboriginal people, as his successors did not show the same commitment to the framework that he established.|$|E
