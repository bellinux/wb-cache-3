5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language {{in terms of the}} concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> cannot be made. Blake, in his edition of the Liber, suggests that Book I once existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either manuscript E or {{an earlier version of}} that manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.|$|E

The effects of the Rights Respecting School initiative can be seen not just through school councils but also through the inclusive, participative way the whole school works during lessons, meal times, play, class and through parents’ involvement.|$|E
25|$|Bondage and {{discipline}} are {{two aspects of}} BDSM that {{do not seem to}} <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> because of the type of activities involved, but they have conceptual similarities, and that is why they appear jointly. Contrary to the other two types, B does not define the tops and bottoms itself, and is used to describe the general activities with either partner being the receiver and the giver.|$|E

Although shoaling fish can <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in a loose way, with each fish swimming and foraging somewhat independently, they are nonetheless aware of {{the other members of the}} group as shown by the way they adjust behaviour such as swimming, so as to remain close to the other fish in the group. Shoaling groups can include fish of disparate sizes and can including mixed-species subgroups.|$|E
25|$|Particle {{physicists}} study matter {{made from}} fundamental particles whose interactions are mediated by exchange particles – gauge bosons – acting as force carriers. At {{the beginning of}} the 1960s a number of these particles had been discovered or proposed, along with theories suggesting how they <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> some of which had already been reformulated as field theories in which the objects of study are not particles and forces, but quantum fields and their symmetries, however, attempts to unify known fundamental forces such as the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force were known to be incomplete.|$|E
25|$|The {{gender of}} God {{may be viewed}} as either a literal or an allegorical aspect of a deity who, in {{classical}} western philosophy, transcends bodily form. Polytheistic religions commonly attribute to each of the gods a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually. In most monotheistic religions, God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually. Thus, in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and <b>relate</b> <b>to,</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{none of the}} {{variables}} studied had a higher correlation than [...]52, the authors knew by combining variables, they could reach higher levels of correlation. Because combining variables that were tightly <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> did not raise the correlation coefficient, they needed to find which elements were highly predictive but not <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|R

25|$|Functional {{theories}} of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, {{it is reasonable}} to assume that its structures are best analysed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional {{theories of}} grammar differ from formal theories of grammar, in that the latter seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former defines the functions performed by language and then relates these functions to the linguistic elements that carry them out. This means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used, and not just to the formal relations between linguistic elements.|$|E
25|$|Social {{psychology}} {{is the study}} of how humans think about each other and how they <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g. conformity, persuasion), and the formation of beliefs, attitudes, and stereotypes about other people. Social cognition fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology in order to understand how people process, remember, or distort social information. The study of group dynamics reveals information about the nature and potential optimization of leadership, communication, and other phenomena that emerge at least at the microsocial level. In recent years, many social psychologists have become increasingly interested in implicit measures, mediational models, and the interaction of both person and social variables in accounting for behavior. The study of human society is therefore a potentially valuable source of information about the causes of psychiatric disorder. Some sociological concepts applied to psychiatric disorders are the social role, sick role, social class, life event, culture, migration, social, and total institution.|$|E
500|$|Syntax is {{the rules}} and {{processes}} that describe how sentences are formed in a particular language, how words <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> within clauses or phrases and how those phrases <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> within a sentence to convey meaning. Khmer syntax is very analytic. Relationships between words and phrases are signified primarily by word order supplemented with auxiliary verbs and, particularly in formal and literary registers, grammatical marking particles. Grammatical phenomena such as negation and aspect are marked by particles while interrogative sentences are marked either by particles or interrogative words equivalent to English [...] "wh-words".|$|E

In their decision, the Supreme Court held that the CDA's [...] "use of the undefined terms 'indecent' and 'patently offensive' will provoke uncertainty among speakers about how the two standards <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and just what they mean." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} three pick up beats as André 3000 counts [...] "one, two, three, oh" [...] and then leads {{into the first}} verse. The lyrics begin to {{describe}} the protagonist's concerns and doubts about a romantic relationship. He wonders if they are staying together just [...] "for tradition", as in the lines [...] "But does she really wanna [...] / But can't stand to see me / Walk out the door?" [...] André 3000 commented, [...] "I think it's more important to be happy than to meet up to...the world's expectations of what a relationship should be. So this is a celebration of how men and women <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the 2000s". The song then leads into the chorus, which consists of the line [...] "Hey ya!" [...] repeated eight times, accompanied by a synthesizer performing the bassline.|$|E
