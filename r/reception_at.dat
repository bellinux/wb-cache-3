5|$|Frankel praised Livolsi {{for making}} the film's four key montages—the opening credits, Miranda's coat-tossing, Andrea's makeover and the Paris introduction—work. The third was {{particularly}} challenging as it uses passing cars and other obstructions to cover Hathaway's changes of outfit. Some scenes were also created in the editing room, such as the <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> the museum, where Livolsi wove B-roll footage in to keep the action flowing.|$|E

5|$|Although Mullum Malarum {{opened to}} a tepid box office <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> its 15 August 1978 (Independence Day) release, {{positive}} reviews from critics and favourable {{word of mouth}} helped make it a success. Rajinikanth's performance as Kali received unanimous praise, and it is widely considered the best performance of his career. The film won the Filmfare Award for Best Film– Tamil and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize (for Rajinikanth).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{opening to}} {{positive}} <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, Money Never Sleeps received polarized reviews from critics, who generally praised the acting, but considered it an unnecessary sequel.

5|$|During 1987, {{relations}} improved steadily, with U.S. military inspectors {{present at}} Soviet military manoeuvres, {{an agreement to}} establish centers on Reducing Nuclear Threat, and a first round of negotiations aimed at banning nuclear tests. The thaw in relations {{was reflected in the}} cultural sphere. Matlock’s invitation to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya to attend a <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> Spaso House provided a way for Matlock to judge Gorbachev’s intentions, as earlier Soviet leaders would have considered it a provocation.|$|E
5|$|During {{a tour of}} the Philippines {{the month}} after the Yesterday and Today furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had {{expected}} them to attend a breakfast <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> the Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Released in July 1968, Thunderbird 6 had {{a mediocre}} <b>reception</b> <b>at</b> the box office, which {{ruled out the}} {{production}} of further sequels in the Thunderbirds film series. Critical response has remained mixed: although the special effects have been praised, commentators are divided {{on the quality of}} the plotting, which is considered either well-paced and concluding on a note of high action, or confusing and inordinately long, with little visual spectacle to contrast with the dialogue. Nevertheless, Thunderbird 6 is viewed favourably in comparison to Jonathan Frakes' 2004 film adaptation, receiving praise for the perceived agelessness of its entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|The Foehls knew {{many in the}} Hollywood film industry, and {{a number}} of film stars stayed at the hotel.
