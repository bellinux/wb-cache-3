5|$|A July 1966 {{report by}} the New York Academy of Medicine Committee on Public Health cautioned that New York City's air-pollution problem made it {{susceptible}} to acute and lethal episodes and recommended a reduction of air pollution. Further, the <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that scientists had likely not identified {{the full range of}} harmful pollutants or health effects caused by air pollution.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, {{a report}} was {{commissioned}} on water resources {{within a reasonable}} distance of Cardiff. The <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that the Taff Fawr scheme would fulfil the town's requirements at the least cost and {{it was decided to}} create Llanishen Reservoir. Construction of the reservoir started in 1882 by the engineer James Simpson for the Cardiff Waterworks Company and was completed in 1886.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of the blood stains found inside 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked {{at the top of}} the basement stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that this might have been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E

5|$|Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, Karl Boy-Ed, Franz von Papen, Dr. Heinrich Albert, and Franz von Rintelen, among others, were Germans {{investigated}} for producing propaganda. All were previously evicted from the United States for {{being part of}} a German espionage ring. The United States Brewers Association, the National German-American Alliance, and the Hamburg-American steamship line were investigated. The final <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that these organizations, through financial support, bribes, boycotts, and coercion, sought to control the press, elections, and public opinion.|$|E
5|$|Rieve and his {{executive}} officer were both severely criticized {{for failing to}} take all possible steps to save Karlsruhe in a later investigation into the sinking. The <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that since the ship was still afloat after two hours, and two torpedoes were required to sink her, {{it might have been}} possible to take her under tow back to Kristiansand or another port. In addition, the forward pumps still had power, and so the flooding could have been slowed enough to permit a return to a safe harbor.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 IPCC report noted many {{observed}} {{changes in}} the climate, including atmospheric composition, global average temperatures, ocean conditions, and others. The <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict. In addition, the report considered that {{it is likely that}} storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century, and declared it more likely than not that there has been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity.|$|E
50|$|This <b>report</b> <b>concludes</b> that HTML5 is {{a welcome}} {{addition}} to the mobile party, {{but it does not}} negate device and OS fragmentation.|$|R
40|$|A {{recent report}} {{released}} by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) Department of Agricultural Economics and the UNL Bureau of Business Research outlines {{the economic impact of}} agriculture to Nebraska. Using 2010 data, the <b>report</b> <b>concludes</b> that agriculture provides over 40 percent of the state’s total business receipts, 26. 9 percent of the state’s gross state product and 24 percent of the state’s total workforce. In short, the <b>report</b> <b>concludes</b> that more than a fourth of Nebraska’s economy {{can be attributed to the}} agricultural production complex...|$|R
50|$|A September 2016 Amazon Watch <b>report</b> <b>concludes</b> that {{imports of}} crude oil by the US are driving {{rainforest}} destruction in the Amazon and releasing significant greenhouse gases.|$|R
5|$|The Peruvian {{government}} {{investigated the}} accident, {{and in its}} final <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that the probable cause of the accident was the improper execution of engine-out procedures by the flight crew, with contributing factors of improper loading of the aircraft and improper maintenance procedures by company personnel. There was also evidence of a coverup and falsification of critical maintenance records by LANSA employees during the investigation process. The Peruvian government subsequently fined LANSA {{and some of its}} employees, and suspended the airline's operating license for 90 days as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the crash in Dryden criticised {{approaches}} to deicing. It made several points, including recommending the use of Type II deicing fluid rather than Type I, deicing trucks near the runway {{rather than at the}} gate, and that the crew should inspect their wings not only from the cockpit, but also the cabin. The <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that competitive pressures caused by commercial deregulation cut into safety standards and that many of the industry’s sloppy practices and questionable procedures were placing pilots in difficult situations.|$|E
5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual guarantee of business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were highly prized. For those who were not confident in their sales ability, a healthy profit was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply. A 1966 US Government <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> {{that it was possible to}} guarantee a 100% domestic profit on piasters, and that a 50% profit could be safely achieved by using black market exchange rates and depositing one's money in an American bank.|$|E
25|$|However, the International Fund for Animal Welfare {{conducted}} a study that disputed these findings. This <b>report</b> <b>concludes</b> the Canadian commercial seal hunt results in considerable and unacceptable suffering.|$|R

5|$|Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be {{the subject}} of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) risk assessment, the results of which may {{determine}} what, if any, control will placed on BZP throughout the European Union. The risk assessment comes about {{as the result of a}} joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Free Expression Policy Project {{assisted}} 33 academics {{specializing in}} journalism, with filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted {{the sale of}} violent video games to youths. In 2004 the organization operated at the National Coalition Against Censorship. In 2005 the organization {{was part of the}} Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. Within the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP operated through the Democracy Program at the law school. In 2006 the organization, in collaboration with the Brennan Center for Justice, released a report on the inefficiency of Internet filtering. The 87-page <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that academic-based censorship of material on the Internet was far too broad and harmed free expression of ideas. The FEPP became independent from both the National Coalition Against Censorship and the Brennan Center for Justice in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, the {{architect}} informed the project group that the Parliament {{would need to}} be further increased in size by 4,000squaremetres (43,000sqft). A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by {{the architect}} John Spencely. The <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.|$|E

5|$|Miskovsky {{left the}} CIA in 1964, {{and worked for}} the Federal Maritime Commission and the Treasury Department for four years. In 1967, Miskovsky was {{appointed}} to lead an investigation concerning the 1967 Detroit riot for the Kerner Commission. During the investigation, Miskovsky interviewed civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Miskovsky's <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that the United States was transitioning into two separate societies, one black and the other white, and that the societies were inherently unequal. In 1968, Miskovsky was appointed the director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization which gave legal aid to those whose civil liberties were violated. From 1977 to 1981, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Miskovsky served as {{general counsel for the}} Federal Home Loan Bank Board.|$|E
5|$|The Danish foreign {{ministry}} reviewed the 348documents that the BBC obtained in 2001 under the Freedom of Information Act. In January 2009, foreign minister Per Stig Møller commissioned {{a study by}} the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) to compare the 348 documents with 317 documents released by the Department of Energy in 1994 in order to determine if the 348 documents contained any new information about an intact nuclear weapon at Thule. In August 2009, DIIS published its report, which contradicted the assertions of the BBC. The <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that there was no missing bomb, and that the American underwater operation was a search for the uranium-235 of the fissile core of a secondary. For the first time, the report was able to present an estimate of the amount of plutonium contained in the pits of the primaries.|$|E
5|$|The FEPP {{conducted}} a survey in 2001 which revealed that online monitoring software, including Net Nanny, SurfWatch, and Cybersitter, cast too broad a net and often blocked legitimate educational websites {{in their attempts to}} censor material from youths. In 2003, the organization assisted 33 academics in filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted the sale of violent video games to minors. In coordination with the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP released a public policy report in 2006 on the inefficiency of Internet filtering; the <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that freedom of expression was harmed by such online censorship activity. In 2007, the FEPP became an independent organization.|$|E

50|$|In 2005 Durham's female high-security wing with 120 prisoners was {{discontinued}} and {{the prisoners}} transferred elsewhere, after HM Inspectorate of Prisons <b>reports</b> <b>concluded,</b> following several suicides, {{that it was}} unsuitable for housing female prisoners.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{analysts have}} argued that Israel {{implemented}} such a strategy during the 2008-09 Gaza War, with the Goldstone <b>Report</b> <b>concluding</b> that the Israeli strategy [...] "designed to punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian population".|$|R
5|$|The July 26, 1977, USCG Marine Casualty Report {{suggested}} that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures. The <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that these devices failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, Fitzgerald plummeted to the bottom without warning. Video footage of the wreck site showed that most of her hatch clamps were in perfect condition. The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged clamps were probably the only ones fastened. As a result, ineffective hatch closure caused Fitzgerald to flood and founder.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the number}} of {{artillery}} tubes within South Vietnam increased to 430, including new 122mm and 130mm guns, while armored forces were estimated to have increased to 655 tanks and armored personnel carriers, including the new Soviet-built BTR-152. By the end of 1974, the North Vietnamese General Staff had created two army corps headquarters, matching South Vietnam's command and control structure in the I and II Corps Tactical Zones. Most independent North Vietnamese infantry regiments in the south were also combined into divisional structures. A U.S. Defense Attaché Office (established in 1973 to replace MACV, the 50 officers and men of the DAO coordinated all military assistance to South Vietnam) <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that the PAVN had increased their strategic reserve from two divisions to seven, making 70,000 additional troops available to augment the 200,000 combat and 100,000 support troops already in South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Bømlo Municipal Council voted {{unanimously}} {{in favor of}} the Triangle Link on 22 February 1988. Two days later, the issue was discussed in Stord Municipal Council. Olav Akselsen at first proposed supporting the pontoon bridge, but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported the Triangle Link. The following week, Sveio Municipal Council voted in favor the Triangle Link, without either a debate or dissent in the council. Fitjar Municipal Council voted on 15 March to work with both proposals. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989, estimating the costs at NOK890 million. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry remain, but the other four ferry services be terminated. The <b>report</b> <b>concluded</b> that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry, that the project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions.|$|E
5000|$|On March 2, 2012, {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of hostilities, the United Nations Human Rights Council released a comprehensive <b>report</b> <b>concluding</b> that in total 60 civilians were killed and 55 wounded by the NATO air campaign.|$|R
