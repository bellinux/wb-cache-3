50|$|Despite {{the similar}} {{sounding}} names, polyfluorene is {{unrelated to the}} element fluorine. Fluorene, a principal repeat unit in polyfluorene derivatives, was isolated from coal tar and discovered by Marcellin Berthelot prior to 1883.Its name originates from its interesting fluorescence, fluorene {{became the subject of}} chemical-structure <b>related</b> <b>color</b> variation (visible rather than luminescent), among other things, throughout the early to mid-20th century. Since it was an interesting chromophore researchers wanted to understand which parts of the molecule were chemically reactive, and how substituting these sites influenced the color. For instance, by adding various electron donating or electron accepting moieties to fluorene, and by reacting with bases, researchers were able to change the color of the molecule.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the results of the}} {{extension}} of the mathematical morphology to color images by treating multichannel data as vectors. The approach presented here uses the HSI and <b>related</b> <b>color</b> spaces (intuitives). A modification of the lexicographical order for vectorial processing is developed. The importance of this new method lies on automatic selection of elements of the HSI and <b>related</b> <b>color</b> spaces to form an ordering structure. The achievement of the algorithm is realized through the introduction of a weight factor to reduce the high preference of the first component of the classic lexicographical order. Experimental results demonstrate the improvement of this new method...|$|E

40|$|Color is {{a salient}} feature which conveys {{important}} {{information about the}} objects in our visual world and may help identification and recognition. Previous psychophysical experiments in humans suggest that color can be beneficial in visual memory tasks, when shape information is no longer available. Here, we ask whether color in natural scenes improves object recognition under conditions in which shape information is degraded. We used a procedure based on Fourier analysis to create natural scenes, for which we manipulated color and shape information independently. Psychophysical performance of human observers was measured in a delayed matching to sample paradigm. Our observers were presented with natural scenes that contained object <b>related</b> (<b>color</b> image), irrelevant (colored noise) or no color (achromatic image and noise) for which we parametrically varied shape information by introducing noise into the images. Subjects performed significantly better when images contained object <b>related</b> <b>color</b> than no or irrele vant color information across the different noise levels (N = 8, p< 0. 05). In addition, performance across subjects did not differ for the achromatic stimuli and the images including unrelated color. Our results suggest that recognition of natural scenes can be enhanced by color information that {{is related to the}} object...|$|E

Slightly different types of hole <b>related</b> <b>color</b> centers are formed in Yb:YAG crystals containing small levels of iron impurities. Furthermore, excitation spectroscopy on the UV irradiated Yb:YAG samples could confirm an energy transfer process between Yb 3 + and Yb 2 + ions.

40|$|International audienceThis paper targets two <b>related</b> <b>color</b> {{manipulation}} problems: Color transfer for modifying an image's {{colors and}} colorization for adding colors to a grayscale image. Automatic methods {{for these two}} applications propose to modify the input image using a reference that contains the desired colors. Previous approaches usually do not target both applications and suffer from two main limitations: possible misleading associations between input and reference regions and poor spatial coherence around image structures. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that uses the textural content of the images to guide the color transfer and colorization. Our method introduces an edge-aware texture descriptor based on region covariance, allowing for local color transformations. We show that our approach is able to produce results comparable or better than state-of-the-art methods in both applications...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the role played by color centers in the {{deterioration}} of l umen output of lamp phosphors with special attention to the halophosphates is pre-sented. Color center dynamics in halophosphates result in a rapid degradation in phosphor brightness within minutes aiter trm beginning of lamp life. An examination of the extent and rapidity of this effect is reviewed. Unirradiated spectral characteristics of halophosphates are dependent on growth stoichi-ometry.

40|$|We present {{investigations}} on single Ni/Si <b>related</b> <b>color</b> centers produced via ion implantation into single crystalline type IIa CVD diamond. Testing different ion dose combinations {{we show that}} there is an upper limit for both the Ni and the Si dose 10 ^ 12 /cm^ 2 and 10 ^ 10 /cm^ 2 resp.) due to creation of excess fluorescent background. We demonstrate creation of Ni/Si related centers showing emission in the spectral range between 767 nm and 775 nm and narrow line-widths of 2 nm FWHM at room temperature. Measurements of the intensity auto-correlation functions prove single-photon emission. The investigated color centers can be coarsely divided into two groups: Drawing from photon statistics and the degree of polarization in excitation and emission we find that some color centers behave as two-level, single-dipole systems whereas other centers exhibit three levels and contributions from two orthogonal dipoles. In addition, some color centers feature stable and bright emission with saturation count rates up to 78 kcounts/s whereas others show fluctuating count rates and three-level blinking.

40|$|We {{propose a}} general and compact scheme for the {{computation}} of the periods and amplitudes of the chiral persistent currents, magnetizations and magnetic susceptibilities in mesoscopic fractional quantum Hall disk samples threaded by Aharonov [...] Bohm magnetic field. This universal approach uses the effective conformal field theory for the edge {{states in the}} quantum Hall effect to derive explicit formulas for the corresponding partition functions in presence of flux. We point out the crucial role of a special invariance condition for the partition function, following from the Bloch-Byers-Yang theorem, which represents the Laughlin spectral flow. As an example we apply this procedure to the Z_k parafermion Hall states and show that they have universal non-Fermi liquid behavior without anomalous oscillations. For {{the analysis of the}} high-temperature asymptotics of the persistent currents in the parafermion states we derive the modular S-matrices constructed from the S matrices for the u(1) sector and that for the neutral parafermion sector which is realized as a diagonal affine coset.

40|$|Abstract—An {{image fusion}} method must ideally {{preserve}} both the {{detail of the}} panchromatic image {{and the color of}} the mul-tispectral image. Existing image fusion methods incur the gamut problem of creating new colors which fall out of the RGB cube. These methods solve the problem by color clipping which yields undesirable color distortions and contrast reductions. An im-proved nonlinear IHS (intensity, hue, saturation; iNIHS) color space and <b>related</b> <b>color</b> transformations are proposed in this paper to solve the gamut problem without appealing to color clipping. The iNIHS space includes two halves, one being constructed from {{the lower half of the}} RGB cube by RGB to IHS transformations, and the other from the upper half of the RGB cube by CMY to IHS transformations. While incurring no out-of-gamut colors, desired intensity substitutions and additions in substitutive and additive image fusions, respectively, are all achievable, with the saturation component regulated within the maximum attainable range. Good experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed method.
