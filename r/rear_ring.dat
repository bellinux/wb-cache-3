50|$|The Class 290 was a {{development}} of the earlier Class 270 locomotives, studied under the Rete Adriatica; it kept the wheelbase, but replaced the boiler with a slightly bigger one, with a minimally coned <b>rear</b> <b>ring.</b> Its construction was continued under the new FS management, which made it one of its twelve standard designs; {{it was the last}} and most successful 0-6-0 Italian locomotive.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{this being}} the era for the {{adoption}} of the (also Belgian) Belpaire firebox, which Hughes had introduced on his other designs and rebuilding work, Flamme now considered it 'obsolete'.. Flamme's new design was for a round-topped firebox of the maximum possible size, and with radial firebox stays rather than the older and troublesome girder stays. The tapered <b>rear</b> <b>ring</b> of the boiler allowed the highest firebox to be used with a practical diameter of boiler, even though the British loading gauge meant that there could be no dome.|$|E
50|$|The ghost ring sight is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the fastest type of aperture sight. It is fairly accurate, easy to use, and obscures the target less than nearly all other non-optical sights. Because of this, ghost ring sights are commonly installed on combat shotguns and submachine guns (and to a much lesser extent, rifles). The ghost ring is a fairly recent innovation, and differs from traditional aperture sights in the extreme thinness of the <b>rear</b> <b>ring,</b> and the slightly thicker front sight. The thin ring minimizes the occlusion of the target, while the thicker front post makes it easy to find quickly.|$|E
50|$|The boiler had a Belpaire firebox with a {{somewhat}} higher top surface. A larger steam dome was fitted {{on top of}} the <b>rear</b> boiler <b>ring.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit ring gear was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached <b>rear</b> unit <b>ring</b> gear to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the <b>rear</b> unit <b>ring</b> gear band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the <b>rear</b> unit <b>ring</b> gear had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the <b>rear</b> unit <b>ring</b> gear with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit ring gear were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Mauser, {{the bolt}} lift arc on the Mosin-Nagant is 90 degrees, versus 60 degrees on the Lee-Enfield. The Mauser bolt handle {{is at the}} rear of the bolt body and locks behind the solid <b>rear</b> {{receiver}} <b>ring.</b> The Mosin bolt handle is similar to the Mannlicher: It is attached to a protrusion on the middle of the bolt body, which serves as a bolt guide, and it locks protruding out of the ejection/loading port in front of a split <b>rear</b> receiver <b>ring,</b> also serving a similar function to Mauser's [...] "third" [...] or [...] "safety" [...] lug.|$|R
5000|$|The Super Redhawk {{was only}} {{available}} in stainless steel {{with a number}} of finishes. [...] The standard finish is brushed steel, with a semi-gloss look. Polished, high-gloss versions have also been offered, though this option is not currently available. Stainless steel one-inch scope rings are included, using the standard Ruger lockup common to all Ruger integral bases. These rings easily allow removing the scope from the handgun, without significantly altering zero, or eye-relief, once the scope is re-installed. The Super Redhawk uses different front and rear rings, with the <b>rear</b> <b>ring</b> being shorter than the front ring due to differences in frame height. [...] Ruger Model 77 bolt-action rifles also use a higher ring in the rear than in the front.|$|E

5000|$|Freeride {{mountain}} bikes are often geared differently to downhill or other {{mountain bikes}}. There are three main types of Freeride mountain bike gearings, these are Single Speed, Short Range and Long Range. Single Speed mountain bikes use a single chainring at the front, mounted to the cranks, {{and a single}} cog at the rear, normally mounted to a freewheel or a freehub. A Short range freeride bike uses a single chainring at the front, with a cassette hub, containing multiple (usually 7 or 10) cogs, {{ranging in size from}} 10 teeth to 24 teeth. A Long range freeride bike normally has a single chainring at the front (however older bikes may have 2 or 3) with multiple (10 or 11) cogs at the rear mounted on a cassette hub, ranging in size from 10-36t. The larger number of gears and larger <b>rear</b> <b>rings</b> provide a more [...] "low low gear" [...] for climbing up steep surfaces.|$|R

500|$|Twenty-seven A3s {{were built}} from new, until 1935, with little {{variation}} {{except for a}} new type of boiler with a [...] "banjo dome", an oval steam collector that was placed on top of the <b>rear</b> boiler <b>ring.</b> The first banjo dome was hidden beneath the casing of Cock o' the North of 1934; it was subsequently used in the A4 streamliners. The last nine A3 Pacifics were constructed with the device in 1935, and it became a standard fitting on all LNER large, wide-firebox boilers that were applied to new locomotives until 1949. It was also applied to replacement boilers on the A3s.|$|R

50|$|The use {{of round}} rear and front {{sighting}} elements for aiming at round targets, like used in ISSF match shooting, {{takes advantage of}} the natural ability of the eye and brain to easily align concentric circles. Even for the maximum precision, there should still be a significant area of white visible around the bullseye and between the front and <b>rear</b> sight <b>ring</b> (if a front ring is being used). Since the best key to determining center is the amount of light passing through the apertures, a narrow, dim ring of light can actually be more difficult to work with than a larger, brighter ring. The precise sizes are quite subjective, and depend on both shooter preference and ambient lighting, which is why target rifles come with easily replaceable front sight inserts, and adjustable aperture mechanisms.|$|R

50|$|When a {{cartridge}} is fired, {{the case}} expands {{to seal the}} sides of the chamber. This seal prevents high-pressure gas from escaping into the action of the gun. Because a conventional chamber is slightly oversized, an unfired cartridge will enter freely. In a chamber-ring delayed firearm, the chamber is conventional in every respect except for a concave ring within the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired, the case expands into this recessed ring and pushes the bolt face rearward. As the case moves to the <b>rear</b> this <b>ring</b> constricts the expanded portion of the case. The energy required to squeeze the walls of the cartridge case slows the rearward travel of the case and slide, reducing their mass requirements. The first known use of the system was on the Fritz Mann pistol in 1920 and later on the High Standard Corp. model T3 experimental pistol developed by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer while working for High Standard. The SIG SG 510 rifle family incorporates a chamber ring near the shoulder. The Seecamp pistol has a <b>ring</b> near the <b>rear</b> end of the chamber.|$|R
5000|$|The {{theory of}} {{operation}} behind the aperture sight is often {{stated that the}} human eye will automatically center the front sight when looking through the rear aperture, thus ensuring accuracy. [...] However, aperture sights are accurate even if the front sight is not centered in the rear aperture due to a phenomenon called parallax suppression. [...] This is because, when the aperture is smaller than the eye's pupil diameter, the aperture itself becomes the entrance pupil for the entire optical system of target, front sight post, rear aperture, and eye. As long as the aperture's diameter is completely contained within the eye's pupil diameter, the exact visual location of the front sight post within the <b>rear</b> aperture <b>ring</b> {{does not affect the}} accuracy, and accuracy only starts to degrade slightly due to parallax shift as the aperture's diameter begins to encroach {{on the outside of the}} eye's pupil diameter. An additional benefit to aperture sights is that smaller apertures provide greater depth of field, making the target less blurry when focusing on the front sight.|$|R

50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock the reverse unit ring gear from turning by {{engaging}} external teeth machined into that ring gear. From 1951 on, a cone clutch {{did the same thing}} when oil pressure was up, and a spring-loaded parking pawl was allowed to lock the same ring gear in the absence of oil pressure. This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the external teeth if that ring gear were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the rear unit sun gear. The planet carrier of this gearset was splined to the planet carrier of the reverse unit. The <b>rear</b> unit <b>ring</b> gear hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear. Because the rear unit band was not applied for reverse, the rear unit and reverse unit compounded causing the combined planet carriers to rotate opposite to the input torque and at a further reduced speed. The output shaft was machined onto the rear unit and reverse unit planet carriers.|$|R

The design and predicted performance of the turbopump are reviewed. Results are presented for measured pump and bearing performance during testing on the NASA Technology Test Bed (TTB) Engine located at MSFC. The most significant results were obtained from proximity probes located in the bearing bore which revealed large subsynchronous precession at ten percent of shaft speed during engine start which subsided prior to mainstage power levels and reappeared during engine shutdown at equivalent power levels below 65 % of nominal. This phenomenon has been attributed to rotating stall in the diffuser. The proximity probes also revealed the location of the bearing in the bore for different operating speeds. Pump vibration characteristics were improved as compared to pumps tested with ball bearings. After seven starts and more than 700 seconds of testing, the pump showed no signs of performance degradation...|$|R

25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim <b>rings,</b> <b>rear</b> seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|R
60|$|Another strange sight I saw, for in that {{swift and}} narrow stream which the {{drawbridge}} spanned whereby the English fled was moored a great black barge, its stem and stern showing {{on either side}} of the bridge. Boats were being swiftly pulled forth from it into the stream, and as I gazed, there leaped up through the dark one long tongue of fire. Then I saw the skill of it, namely, to burn down the drawbridge, and so cut the English off from all succour. Fed with pitch and pine the flame soared lustily, and now it shone between the planks of the drawbridge. On the stone platform of the boulevard, wherein the drawbridge was laid, stood a few English, and above them shone the axe of a tall squire, Glasdale, as it fell on shield and helm of the French. Others held us at bay with long lances, and never saw I any knight do his devoir more fiercely than he who had reviled the Maid. For on his head lay all the blame of the taking of the boulevard. To <b>rear</b> of him <b>rang</b> the shouts of them of Orleans, who had crossed the broken arch by the beam; but he never turned about, and our men reeled back before him. Then there shone behind him the flames from the blazing barge; and so, black against that blaze, he smote and slew, not knowing that the drawbridge began to burn.|$|R
