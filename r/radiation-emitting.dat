40|$|In vitro {{assessment}} of Lipiodol-targeted radiotherapy for liver and colorectal cancer cell lines Sir We read {{with great interest}} the article by Al-Mufti et al (1999) (Br J Cancer 79 : 1665 – 1671). However, we found the concept on which their study design was based needs to be clarified. The cytotoxic action of a chemotherapeutic drug on cancer cells {{is different from that}} of a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical. For a chemotherapeutic drug such as a methylating agent to produce its cytotoxicity, its molecules need to enter the cancer cells before it can act on their DNA. That is why P-glycoprotein, which causes efflux of the drug molecule out of the cells, leads to drug resistance. On the other hand, the <b>radiation-emiting</b> isotope contained in a radiopharmaceutical produces its cytotoxic effect by bombarding the DNA of the cancer cells with beta particles or depositing radiatio...|$|R

40|$|Much of our {{knowledge}} of galaxies comes from analysing the <b>radiation-emitted</b> by their stars, which depends on the present number of each type of star in the galaxy. The present number depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which describes the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed, and knowledge of {{it is critical to}} almost every aspect of galaxy evolution. More than 50 years after the first IMF determination(1), no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal among different types of galaxies(2). Previous studies indicated that the IMF and the dark matter fraction in galaxy centres cannot both be universal(3 - 7), but they could not convincingly discriminate between the two possibilities. Only recently were indications found that massive elliptical galaxies may not have the same IMF as the Milky Way(8). Here we report a study of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the large representative ATLAS(3 D) sample(9) of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass, using detailed dynamical models. We find a strong systematic variation in IMF in early-type galaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratios, producing differences of a factor of up to three in galactic stellar mass. This implies that a galaxy's IMF depends intimately on the galaxy's formation history...|$|R

50|$|Auger therapy (AT) {{is a form}} of {{radiation}} therapy for the treatment of cancer which relies on a large number of low-energy electrons (emitted by the Auger effect) to damage cancer cells, rather than the high-energy radiation used in traditional radiation therapy. Similar to other forms {{of radiation}} therapy, Auger therapy relies on radiation-induced damage to cancer cells (particularly DNA damage) to arrest cell division, stop tumor growth and metastasis and kill cancerous cells. It differs from other types of radiation therapy in that electrons emitted via the Auger effect (Auger electrons) are released in large numbers with low kinetic energy. Because of their low energy, these electrons damage cells over a very short range: less than the size of a single cell, on the order of nanometers. This very short-range delivery of energy permits highly targeted therapies, since the <b>radiation-emitting</b> nuclide is required to be inside the cell to cause damage to its nucleus. However, this is a technical challenge; Auger therapeutics must enter their cellular targets to be most effective. Auger therapeutics are small molecules, capable of entering cells of interest and binding to specific sub-cellular components, which contain one (or more) heavy atoms capable of emitting Auger electrons by radioactive decay or external excitation.|$|E

Alcohol, morphine, opium, and cannabis were all included on the list of these [...] "addictive" [...] and/or [...] "dangerous" [...] drugs. The law also established a federal cadre of food and drug inspectors that one Southern opponent of the legislation criticized as [...] "a Trojan horse with a bellyful of inspectors and other employees." [...] Penalties under the law were modest, but an under-appreciated provision of the Act proved more powerful than monetary penalties. Goods found in violation of the law were subject to seizure and destruction {{at the expense of the}} manufacturer. That, combined with a legal requirement that all convictions be published as Notices of Judgment, proved to be important tools in the enforcement of the statute and had a deterrent effect upon would-be violators. Deficiencies in this original statute, which had become noticeable by the 1920s, led to the replacement of the 1906 statute with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which was enacted in 1938 and signed by President Franklin Roosevelt. The 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, along with its numerous amendments, remains the statutory basis for federal regulation of all foods, drugs, biological products, cosmetics, medical devices, tobacco, and <b>radiation-emitting</b> devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.|$|E

Terry goes to Bruce for help but he refuses, feeling he is too old and too weak to be of any use and instead tells Terry to take the evidence to Barbara Gordon (who has become the new Police Commissioner). After the evidence of the illegal weapon production is forcibly taken from Terry by Derek Powers, Terry subsequently steals the Batsuit, intending to bring Powers to justice. Bruce initially opposes all of Terry's efforts and vehemently demands he return the suit but Terry convinces Bruce to let him take on the Batman mantle, partially by drawing on the fact they both lost a parent to criminals, and subsequently defeats Mr. Fixx. During the battle, Powers is exposed to the chemical and forced to flee into hiding to receive treatment which subsequently mutates him into a <b>radiation-emitting</b> entity, though he uses artificial skin to hide the accident. Realizing that crime and corruption are running rampant in Gotham without Batman's presence, Bruce offers Terry the chance to assume the role of Batman in addition working as Bruce's chauffeur and assistant so that Terry can support his family.|$|E
