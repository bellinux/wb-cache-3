Obstruction can be initially screened by ultrasound and confirmed by a radionuclide scan with furosemide challenge. <b>Retrograde</b> <b>ureteropyelography</b> and/or intravenous urography may be required to define the level of the stricture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Congenital mid-ureteral {{stricture}} {{is a rare}} malformation of the ureter {{leading to}} prenatal and neonatal hydronephrosis. Site characterization of the narrowing is important to optimize the surgical approach to the newborn affected by hydronephrosis. Case presentation We report a female EM with a rare form of hydronephrosis, (i. e. mid-ureteral stricture) which was detected early during pregnancy by imaging techniques. During fetal life both conventional fetal Ultrasound and maternal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were used to diagnose the obstruction. Magnetic Resonance pyelography and <b>retrograde</b> <b>Ureteropyelography</b> were performed after delivery and before surgical correction and confirmed the finding. Furthermore, we revisited the literature using online MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The literature reported only a few cases of prenatal diagnosis of early onset mid-ureteral stricture. Conclusion Mid-ureteral stricture is a rare cause of prenatal hydronephrosis. The diagnosis should not be delayed in order to apply the appropriate surgical approach. As a result, we showed the usefulness of fetal MRI and postnatal Magnetic Resonance pyelography, {{in the event that}} radionuclide renography with Tc-MAG 3 was less informative, to allow the detection of the site of ureteral narrowing. Intrasurgical <b>retrograde</b> <b>ureteropyelography</b> confirmed these findings. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{a case of}} an {{ingested}} toothpick partially migrating {{from the}} sigmoid colon, causing massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to arterial-colic fistula, and stricture of the left ureter is presented. A 70 -year-old male {{was admitted to the}} emergency department after having feces mixed with fresh and coagulated blood for the past two days. Computed tomography and <b>retrograde</b> <b>ureteropyelography</b> showed the stricture of the left ureter, 1. 5 cm below the branching of iliac artery, without any signs of malignancy. Colonoscopy showed fresh blood in the rectum and sigmoid colon up to the neoplasm like granulation tissue mixed with fresh and coagulated blood, which almost obstructed the lumen. Explorative laparotomy showed a foreign body (toothpick) perforating the sigmoid colon through the mesenterial wall, and being stocked with one-third into the left internal iliac artery, causing arterial-colic fistula. The remaining part of the toothpick was surrounded by granulation tissue and chronic inflammatory process, pressing on the distal third of the left ureter. We conclude that a swallowed toothpick may cause a significant gastrointestinal injury {{with a wide variety of}} clinical manifestations, and it must be treated with caution. The imaging studies are often inadequate in detecting toothpicks, and thus, we insist on a physical examination, as the best indicator of injury...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Iatrogenic {{ureteral}} injuries {{can occur}} during various abdominopelvic and retroperitoneal surgical procedures including gynecological, urological, colorectal and vascular. Objective. The aim {{of our study}} was to examine the incidence and types of iatrogenic ureteral injuries occurred over the period of 16 years, as well as to evaluate the values of applied diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Methods. A retrospective analysis of clinical data (medical records and operative reports) of 55 patients (11 male and 44 female; mean age 54. 5 years) with verified iatrogenic ureteral injury from 1998 to 2014, was performed. Results. Iatrogenic ureteral injuries occurred during gynecological procedures in 55 %, urological in 25 %, colorectal in 15 % and vascular in 5 % of cases. Mechanisms of injury were incomplete transection (n= 23), complete transection (n= 1), ligation (n= 7), partial perforation (mucosal abrasion) (n= 13) and total perforation (n= 1). The most frequent diagnostic procedures for postoperative identification of ureteral injuries were abdominal ultrasonography, excretory urography, antegrade pyeloureterography and <b>retrograde</b> <b>ureteropyelography.</b> Early therapeutic procedures were applied in 35 (64 %), while delayed in 20 cases (36 %). Early (30 days) postoperative complications were verified in 14 cases (25 %). Conclusion. Among different surgeries that may lead to the development of iatrogenic ureteral injury, gynecological procedures represent the most common cause. Rapid diagnosis enables immediate ureteral repair and is associated with low morbidity rates, representing a major factor contributing to the treatment success and ultimately preserving the renal function...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We present our {{experience}} with retroperitoneoscopic lymphatic disconnection {{for the treatment}} of patients with intractable chyluria. Materials and Methods: From November 1996 to March 2003, 12 patients (three females and nine males), with intractable chyluria were treated at our department with the retroperitoneoscopic technique. Diagnosis was based on urine examination for the presence of chyle and fat globules, cystoscopy, excretory urogram and <b>retrograde</b> <b>ureteropyelography.</b> The technique of retroperitoneoscopic management of chyluria consisted of nephrolympholysis, ureterolympholysis, hilar vessel stripping, fasciectomy and nephropexy. The first three procedures were done in all cases, whereas fasciectomy was only done in four cases and nephropexy in three as required. Results: Chyluria disappeared in all ipsilateral renal units of the patients who underwent retroperitoneoscopic management but it recurred in two patients at 1 and 9 months of follow up from the contralateral side. Both the cases have since been successfully treated with contralateral retroperitoneoscopic management. Complications included lymphatic leak through the drain, which persisted for 5 days in one case and an inadvertent clipping of a branch of the posterior segmental artery of the kidney in one. The latter patient did not have pain or hypertension and the renal scan did not reveal any focal deficit at follow up. All patients were followed periodically from 6 to 54 months (mean of 31 months). Conclusion: Retroperitoneoscopic chylolymphatic disconnection is a safe and effective management of intractable chyluria. The reroperitoneoscopic approach provides direct access to the kidney without transgressing the peritoneum...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Retroperitoneal {{fibrosis}} (RPF) {{represents a}} chronic pathological process characterized by fibrosis which entraps and compresses the ureters {{and the great}} {{blood vessels in the}} retroperitoneal space. A specific form of RPF is idiopathic RPF, an uncommon collagen vascular disease of unclear etiology. The series of 15 patients which underwent open surgical repair due to idiopathic RPF is presented herein. Methods. From 1989 to 2012, 11 male and 4 female patients underwent surgery due to primary RPF. The ureters were entrapped unilaterally (7 patients), or bilaterally (8 patients). Major symptoms included low back pain due to hydronephrosis (9 patients), uremia (4 patients), and urinary tract infection (2 patients). The diagnosis was based on intravenous urography (IVU), <b>retrograde</b> <b>ureteropyelography</b> and computed tomography (CT). Results. Surgical procedures included intraperitoneal ureteral displacement (8 patients) and ureteral wrapping with omental flap (6 patients). One patient underwent bilateral ureteral stenotic segments resection and oblique ureterography, followed by wrapping with omental flap. Pathological examination confirmed primary RPF in all patients. The mean operative time was 3. 5 h (range 2. 5 - 4. 5 h). The average intrahospital stay was 21 days (range 16 - 26 days). The mean follow up was 32 months (6 - 46 months). During the follow up, 12 patients had improvement on IVU. Conclusion. Early recognition of signs and symptoms of RPF is of the utmost importance for the outcome. Surgical procedures, including ureteral wrapping with omental flap, or intraperitoneal ureteral displacement, usually represent definitive treatment...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} multidetector {{computed tomography}} urography (MDCTU) for diagnosing upper urinary tract (UUT) urothelial tumour {{by comparison with}} <b>retrograde</b> <b>ureteropyelography</b> (RUP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: MDCTU and RUP were used in a selected series of adult patients presenting with haematuria. Entry criteria were based on findings on intravenous urography and were chosen to ensure a high prevalence of UUT urothelial tumour to allow a valid retrospective comparison of the diagnostic techniques. MDCTU and RUP studies were scored for the presence and absence of UUT urothelial tumour by two radiologists, retrospectively and independently, and while unaware of the demographic and clinical information. The reference standards were the histopathology and clinical follow-up. RESULTS: MDCTU and RUP were used in 106 patients over a 24 -month period. RUP was attempted in 151 of 212 UUTs; the corresponding MDCTU for each UUT was reviewed. MDCTU was a true-positive (TP) for urothelial tumour in 31, true-negative (TN) in 111, false-positive (FP) in eight and false-negative (FN) in one UUT, giving a sensitivity of 0. 97, a specificity of 0. 93, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0. 79 and a negative PV (NPV) of 0. 99. RUP was technically successful and diagnostic in 96 % of the UUTs (143 / 151). For diagnosing urothelial tumour, RUP was TP in 26, TN in 112, FP in four and FN in one UUT, giving a sensitivity of 0. 97, specificity of 0. 93, a PPV of 0. 79 and NPV of 0. 99. CONCLUSION: This study validates quantitatively the use of MDCTU for diagnosing UUT urothelial tumour...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To assess {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} of supine percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients for whom prone position or general anesthesia is contraindicated or not preferable due to associated comorbidities, overweight or ipsilateral upper ureteric calculi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty two patients (37 males and 15 females, mean age 33 ± 10. 2 years) were included in this study. Supine position was selected due to anesthetic considerations (preexisting compromised cardiopulmonary status, morbid obesity (body mass index > 40 kg/m²) and/or other associated medical comorbidities), impossible prone position due to bone deformities or associated ipsilateral upper ureteric stone. Regional anesthesia was used in 24 patients while 28 patients underwent general anesthesia. After standard cystoscopy and <b>retrograde</b> <b>ureteropyelography</b> in the dorsal lithotomy position, the position was modified using 3 liters of saline bag below the ipsilateral upper flank. Percutaneous access to the pelvicalyceal system was performed through the posterior axillary line under fluoroscopic guidance. RESULTS: Successful renal puncture was achieved in all cases. Single access via the lower calyx was {{the most commonly used}} access (36 cases). Stone-free rate was 92. 3 %. Postoperative complications classified according to Clavien Dindo classification included bleeding requiring transfusion (3. 8 %), urinary leakage requiring ureteric stenting (5. 8 %), prolonged fever (7. 7 %), deep venous thrombosis (1. 9 %) [grade III in all] and urinary leakage requiring ureteric stenting (5. 8 %) [grade IIIa]. CONCLUSIONS: The modified supine position for percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a safe and effective option that offers several advantages with an excellent outcome. It can be performed safely for morbidly obese patients and those with cardiopulmonary compromise...|$|E
40|$|In the {{retrospective}} study we investigated the long-term outcome {{of patients who}} underwent endoscopic surgery of non superficial upper tract transitional cell carcinoma (UTTCC) and endoscopic surveillance. This management corresponds to the current standard treatment of non invasive bladder cancer. The standard operative procedure for UTTCC is the nephroureterectomy with partial cystectomy at the affected ureteral orifice. From May 1995 to July 2001 22 patients (20 pTa and 2 pT 1) with 24 renal units (RU) were treated by ureteroscopic holmium YAG:laser vaporisation of superficial UTTCC and underwent endoscopic surveillance. 2 patients had solitary kidneys or functionally solitary kidneys. 7 patients had solitary kidneys {{with a history of}} nephroureterectomy for UTTCC. 2 patients suffered from bilateral disease. Evaluation and therapy included <b>retrograde</b> <b>ureteropyelography,</b> semirigid and flexible ureteropyeloscopy, cytology of upper tract washings, ureterorenoscopic inspection and biopsy as well as ablation of tumours by holmium laser. The surveillance was performed ureteroscopically (4 to 6 weeks, if the primary tumour resection was not complete, every 3 months or every 6 months, if there was no recurrence in two consecutive follow-ups). A total of 186 ureteroscopys were performed, 107 of these requiring laser ablations of one or multiple tumours. 80 laser treatments had to be done because of recurrent or persistent UTTCC. Therapy related major complications were rare (3 of 107). Median follow up was 44 months (range 3 - 116). 10 RU (45. 5 %) remained tumor free. Recurrent tumors developed in two RU after a follow-up of 18 and 22 months. There were recurrent or persistent tumours in the most ureteroscopic follow-ups in 12 upper urinary tracts (50 %). Endoscopic surveillance and therapy of recurrences allowed for avoidance of haemodialysis in 6 and delay thereof in 2 patients. The mean duration of kidney preservation was five years. A total of 7 patients underwent nephroureterectomy during the follow up. 3 Patients suffering from concurrent bladder cancer died from transitional cell carcinoma. Kidney preservation by ureteroscopic therapy of UTTCC with closed follow up is possible in clinical routine provided the patient is compliant as ureterorenoscopy in regular intervals is essential in surveillance. Most of the patients had an upper tract recurrence. Thus {{only a fraction of the}} patients can be treated curatively. In carefully selected patients the laser ablation of UTTCC offers avoiding renal replacement therapy because of its potential of recurrence treatment. No worsening of prognosis was seen in those patients...|$|E
