50|$|An {{anesthetic}} (or anaesthetic) {{is a drug}} {{to prevent}} pain during surgery. A wide variety of drugs are used in modern anesthetic practice. Many are rarely used outside anesthesia, although others are used commonly by all disciplines. Anesthetics are categorized into two classes: general anesthetics, which cause a <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of consciousness, and local anesthetics, which cause a <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of sensation for a limited region of the body while maintaining consciousness. Combinations of anesthetics are sometimes used for their synergistic and additive therapeutic effects. Adverse effects, however, may also be increased.|$|R

40|$|The {{reversible}} electrical variations hitherto {{described for}} {{plants and animals}} consist in a <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of positive potential at a stimulated spot by which it becomes more negative. In this paper we describe changes which consist in a <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of negative potential at a stimulated spot whereby it becomes more positive. We suggest that this be called a positive variation. The stimulation was produced in all cases by pinching or bending the cell. This produced a compression wave which traveled along the cell, producing a negative variation at a spot which was positive and a positive variation at a spot which was negative (due to application of 0. 1 M KCl). The response produced by the compression wave differs in several respects from an ordinary propagated negative variation and may be termed a positive mechanical variation...|$|R

Growth losses were compared for different degrees of defoliation. The financial losses were calculated and compared with the cost of control operations, to estimate how severe the insect attack must be to justify chemical control. Sample plots in the provinces of Drente, Gelderland and Overijssel showed that <b>loss</b> of <b>increment</b> increased with degree of defoliation. <b>Losses</b> of <b>increment</b> in Japanese larch were less on richer loamy soils than on sandy soils. It was presumed that low vigour of Japanese larch and Scots pine, probably indicated by small annual increment of the tree for a few years before an insect attack, favours this attack, and thus defoliation. This would mean that the method of calculating the <b>loss</b> of <b>increment</b> was incorrect. Further research was greatly needed. <p/...|$|R
50|$|A general {{anaesthetic}} (or anesthetic, see spelling differences) is a {{drug that}} can bring about a <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of consciousness.

40|$|In this paper, the {{reversible}} and the irreversible loss {{in performance}} of direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) single cells induced by freeze/thaw cycling are determined and discussed. The <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> in performance {{is attributed to}} the decreased activity of electrocatalysts due to the strong adsorption of the intermediates from methanol electro-oxidation at subzero temperatures, while the irreversible loss in performance {{is due to the}} damage of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) structure. It is found that the reversible degradation of performance is dominant when the cell operated at low current densities with O- 2; the irreversible degradation is more obvious when the cell discharged at high current densities or operated with air. A method, applying a reverse current on the single cell, is put forward to recover the <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> in performance. By this method, the voltage of the single cell operated with O- 2 at 100 mA cm(- 2) drops only about 16 mV after experiencing 100 freeze/thaw cycles between- 10 and 60 degrees C.

40|$|Certain of {{the effects}} of the {{digitalis}} glycosides on the function of striated muscle resemble those resulting from an excess of potassium. As a result of studies on the action of ouabain on the energetics of contraction of the isolated frog’s sartorius muscle, Cattell (1) concluded that the characteristic changes “are due to the formation or liberation of some substance which readily diffuses from the muscle ” and “that these changes are consistent with those caused by the escape of potassium from the cell. ” The phenomenon with which we are here concerned is the <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of excitability in the frog’s sartorius muscle resulting from an excess of potassium, originally discovered by Sereni (2) and studied in detail by Duli#{ 232 }reand Horton (3) and by Solandt (4).

40|$|The {{deformation}} of nanocomposites containing graphene flakes with different numbers of layers {{has been investigated}} {{with the use of}} Raman spectroscopy. It has been found that there is a shift of the 2 D band to lower wavenumber and that the rate of band shift per unit strain tends to decrease as the number of graphene layers increases. It has been demonstrated that band broadening takes place during tensile deformation for mono- and bilayer graphene but that band narrowing occurs when the number of graphene layers is more than two. It is also found that the characteristic asymmetric shape of the 2 D Raman band for the graphene with three or more layers changes to a symmetrical shape above about 0. 4 % strain and that it reverts to an asymmetric shape on unloading. This change in Raman band shape and width has been interpreted as being due to a <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of Bernal stacking in the few-layer graphene during deformation. It has been shown that the elastic strain energy released from the unloading of the inner graphene layers in the few-layer material (~ 0. 2 meV/atom) is similar to the accepted value of the stacking fault energies of graphite and few layer graphene. It is further shown that this loss of Bernal stacking can be accommodated by the formation of arrays of partial dislocations and stacking faults on the basal plane. The effect of the <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of Bernal stacking upon the electronic structure of few-layer graphene and the possibility of using it to modify the electronic structure of few-layer graphene are discussed...|$|R

Complex astrocyte and vascular endothelial cell interactions that regulate BBB integrity may be disturbed in these disorders.

The ESR spectrum of Cu 2 + ions in hydrated resins is characteristic of the freely tumbling hexahydrated cation. On dehydration of the gel, the spectrum gradually broadens suggesting that dehydration occurs in a relatively disordered way. <b>Reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of ESR signal intensity is attributed to dipolar interactions between neighbouring Cu 2 + ions. In resins fully solvated with methanol, the ESR spectrum is characteristic of the unconstrained, fully solvated Cu 2 + ion and, again, on drying, loss of solvent occurs without the formation of any well-defined Cu 2 + centres.

The sequential failed cold starts are deliberately conducted {{as well as the}} start at small current density. Here the failed cold start means the cell voltage drops to or below zero within very short time during the start process. It is found that there are <b>reversible</b> performance <b>losses</b> for the sequential failed cold starts, while not obvious degradation and no recovery happen for the start at small current density. Using the thin film and agglomerate model, it is confirmed that {{this is due to the}} water blocking effect. Comparing the results from different start processes, a model with respect to the shifting of reactive region within the catalyst layer is applied to explain that the <b>reversible</b> performance <b>loss</b> is associated with the amount of the generated water or ice and the water location or distribution during cold start. The relationship of the cold start performance at high current density and the pore volume in the catalyst layer is also discussed. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

40|$|Mammary gland {{development}} is critically {{dependent on the}} interactions between the stromal and the epithelial compartments within the gland. These events are {{under the control of}} a complex interplay of circulating and locally acting hormones and growth factors. To analyze the temporal and quantitative contributions of stromal adipocytes, we took advantage of the FAT-ATTAC mice (apoptosis through triggered activation of caspase- 8), a model of inducible and <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of adipocytes. This loss can be achieved through the induced dimerization of a caspase- 8 fusion protein. In the context of female mice, we can achieve ablation of mammary adipocytes relatively selectively without affecting other fat pads. Under these conditions, we find that adipocytes are essential for the formation of the extended network of ducts in the mammary gland during puberty. Beyond their role in development, adipocytes are also essential to maintain the normal alveolar structures that develop during adulthood. Loss of adipose tissue initiated 2 weeks after birth triggers fewer duct branching points and fewer terminal end buds (TEBs) and also triggers changes in proliferation and apoptosis in the epithelium associated with the TEBs. The reduced developmental pace that adipocyte-ablated glands undergo is reversible, as the emergence of new local adipocytes, upon cessation of treatment, enables the ductal epithelium to resume growth. Conversely, loss of local adipocytes initiated at 7 weeks of age resulted in excessive lobulation, indicating that adipocytes are critically involved in maintaining proper architecture and functionality of the mammary epithelium. Collectively, using a unique model of inducible and <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of adipocytes, our observations suggest that adipocytes are required for proper development during puberty and for the maintenance of the ductal architecture in the adult mammary gland. close 151...|$|R

Medium conditioned by cells incubated with insulin for 24 hours retains sufficient biologically active insulin to produce an insulin response in fresh dexamethasone-treated cells. Readdition of insulin to insulin-treated cells, however, elicits no response, indicating that the cells are insensitive to the hormone.

40|$|Gastrointestinal {{dysfunction}} {{is common}} in diabetic patients. In genetic (nonobese diabetic) and toxin-elicited (streptozotocin) models of diabetes in mice, we demonstrate defects in gastric emptying and nonadrenergic, noncholinergic relaxation of pyloric muscle, which resemble defects in mice harboring a deletion of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase gene (nNOS). The diabetic mice manifest pronounced reduction in pyloric nNOS protein and mRNA. The decline of nNOS in diabetic mice does not result from loss of myenteric neurons. nNOS expression and pyloric function are restored to normal levels by insulin treatment. Thus diabetic gastropathy in mice reflects an insulin-sensitive <b>reversible</b> <b>loss</b> of nNOS. In diabetic animals, delayed gastric emptying can be reversed with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, sildenafil.
