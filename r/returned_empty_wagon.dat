It then became possible to send goods from any station (or siding) in Britain to any other station. In particular, any station in the South of England could receive goods from places in northern parts. Places in the South were also able to order coal from collieries in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire, {{as well as other}} coalfields, to be conveyed to destination by rail. Such traffic had to cross London from North to South. There was also a certain amount of traffic in the opposite direction, as well as <b>returned</b> <b>empty</b> coal <b>wagons.</b>|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the tight}} {{economic}} conditions facing the NSW coal mining industry {{at the time}} and the need to rationalise some of its operations, Coal & Allied decided it was more economical to ship the coal to port by road and on 28 August 1987 announced the planned closure of the Stockrington to Hexham line from 25 September 1987. The railway operated normally until 18 September when following a dispute between a loco crew and management, coal haulage ceased and only <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> were to be worked to Hexham for storage. The last coal was dumped at the coal preparation plant on 21 September and on 22 September No.25 cleared the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> from the preparation plant and then made two trips to Stockrington to work the remaining <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> to Hexham. However, on 24 September as part of the vigorous protest efforts by the railway employees, No.25 was hijacked and after spending a day at Doghole the loco was moved to Lenaghans Drive road bridge and a protest camp set up. However, {{due to a lack of}} support from their fellow unionists at the other Coal & Allied operations the protest ended with no effect on 15 October 1987.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{attendance}} {{of the demand}} for freight transport {{is related to the}} process of allocation of the wagons that in turn is associated with {{the way in which the}} decision is taken. The distribution of wagons to the shipment terminals depends on the planning as well as on movement of the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons.</b> In addition, the trips of the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> have the major financial impact on the railroad system. In such a way, an efficient mechanism of wagon distribution is vital to the railroads, because it provides important operational profits and of costs. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the problem related to the distribution of the load wagons and to develop a mathematical model that can propose an optimal scheduling of the wagons...|$|R
50|$|The Wootton bridge {{collapse}} {{occurred on}} 11 June 1861, when the rail {{bridge over the}} road between Leek Wootton and Hill Wootton in Warwickshire collapsed {{under the weight of}} a passing goods train on the line between Leamington Spa and Kenilworth owned by the London and North Western Railway Company. The train had passed over the bridge safely in the morning with a full load of coal, and was returning to Kenilworth with the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> at 7 am. The 30 ton locomotive fell through the deck of the bridge onto the road below, and the tender crashed into the cab, killing both driver and fireman instantly. Many of the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> behind were dragged into the gap to form a pile almost up to the height of nearby telegraph poles.|$|R
50|$|The <b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> {{would be}} winched off the cradle and run down onto a second {{weighbridge}} {{to calculate the}} tare and then run down a gradient of 1 in 70 to the empties siding. Local hydraulic capstans were included to rope-haul wagons {{to and from the}} cradle as necessary.The <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> would then be shunted to the sorting sidings.Two men could <b>empty</b> a <b>wagon</b> in one minute, one to run the wagon on and off the cradle, and another to operate the hydraulics.The resident engineer reported in 1890 that as much as 400 LT had been shipped in one hour from a single tip.In 1890 movable tipping hoists mounted on rails were installed so that coal could be loaded simultaneously into one hold from a fixed hoist and another hold from the movable hoist.The original tipping hoists were made by Tennant and Walker of Leeds.The design was a compromise between the demand for speed in loading and the cost of breakage of coal delivered into the holds from a height.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Study the {{possibility}} of using geometrically-force method to determine sections of high risk of derailment in railway stations at <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> movement. In the test program track diagnosing subject to longitudinal forces in the freight train effecting <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> is provided. Methodology. To this effect <b>empty</b> mineral <b>wagon</b> and thermal cistern were equipped with strain-gauge wheel sets, strain-gauge automatic coupler and other instruments, set in the freight train weighing 4500 t. Findings. In the course of this work it was ascertained that the geometric-force ethod gives possibility to receive additional information about the track condition from the position of empty cars stability against derailment. It is shown that some sections of high risk of derailment pieces of line does not discarded by traditional ways, based on an assessment of the geometric parameters of the way. Those track sections are identified by this method, which can not be evaluated by technical means, used currently on track measurement cars. Pieces of line with low parameters on empty cars stability against derailment are individual and they are determined not only by the sizes of deviations, but their form, a combination of different types of roughness, profile and defective elements of the permanent way. Originality. Geometric-force method should be considered as complementary to the existing technology assessment of the way on the geometrical parameters; its implementation will allow revealing the track section, dangerous for the motion of <b>empty</b> <b>wagons.</b> Practical value. For the geometrically-force method realization of assessment of the way in the railway network of JSC Â«Russian RailwaysÂ» it is proposed {{on the basis of the}} accumulated statistics and experimental data in accordance with wagons tests with a high center of gravity to develop specialized software for wagons through gauges to assess ways bygeometrically-force method that excludes the use in technology assessment of the additional freight wagon way with a strain-gauge wheel sets. ...|$|R
