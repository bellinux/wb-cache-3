5|$|<b>Relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom and the United States were {{strained}} {{during the}} inter-war {{years and the}} majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort. At the time, some members of the British upper class looked down on Americans with disdain and considered them socially inferior. In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} Denmark through Belgium on 4 April 1900 Edward was {{the victim}} of an {{attempted}} assassination, when fifteen-year-old Jean-Baptiste Sipido shot at him in protest over the Boer War. Sipido, though obviously guilty, was acquitted by a Belgian court because he was underage. The perceived laxity of the Belgian authorities, combined with British disgust at Belgian atrocities in the Congo, worsened the already poor <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom and the Continent. However, in the next ten years, Edward's affability and popularity, as well as his use of family connections, assisted Britain in building European alliances.|$|E

60|$|I, Abraham Lincoln, President of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States of America and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, do hereby {{proclaim}} {{and declare}} that hereafter, as heretofore, {{the war will}} be prosecuted for the object of practically restoring <b>the</b> constitutional <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{and each of the}} States and the people thereof in which States that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed.|$|R
5|$|The convoy {{had also}} been {{augmented}} by the United States government, in both cargo and shipping, as repayment for French financial, moral and military support during the American Revolution. In supporting the French Revolution in this way, the American government, urged especially by Ambassador Gouverneur Morris, was fulfilling its ten-year-old debt to France. Friendly <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and France did not long survive the Jay Treaty which came into effect in 1796; by 1798 the two nations would be engaged in the Quasi War.|$|E
5|$|The four-day {{whirlwind}} {{trip was}} launched on September 6, 1963, {{the same day}} as a National Security Council (NSC) meeting, and came in the wake of increasingly strained <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and South Vietnam. Civil unrest gripped South Vietnam as Buddhist demonstrations against the religious discrimination of President Ngô Đình Diệm's Catholic regime escalated. Following the raids on Buddhist pagodas on August 21 that left a death toll ranging up to a few hundred, the US authorized investigations into a possible coup through a cable to US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|$|E
5|$|During {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia, the United States engaged in both combative and {{economic}} conflict, particularly with Serbia, known {{at the time as}} the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (one of socialist Yugoslavia's successor states). The United States imposed sanctions and spearheaded a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999. During this period, another wave of Serbian emigration ensued, and many Serbian refugees moved to the United States. In the 2000s, diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and Yugoslavia were restored, but were changed when Montenegro seceded in 2006, after which Serbia was the successor state to continue relations previously held by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008, a move which the US recognized.|$|E

5|$|<b>Relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom and the Irish Free State {{had been}} {{strained}} since the appointment in 1932 of Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach (Prime Minister). The Anglo-Irish Trade War, {{sparked by the}} withholding of money that Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom, had caused economic losses on both sides, and the two nations were anxious for a settlement. The de Valera government also sought to remove the remaining ties between Ireland and the UK, such as ending the King's status as Irish Head of State. Chamberlain as Chancellor had taken a hard-line stance against concessions to the Irish, but he was persuaded that the strained ties were affecting relations with other Dominions, and sought a settlement with Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The {{trip was}} {{intended}} to soften the strong isolationist tendencies among the North American public {{with regard to the}} developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public. The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor, Edward VIII, was dispelled. They visited the 1939 New York World's Fair and stayed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House and at his private estate at Hyde Park, New York. A strong bond of friendship was forged between the King and Queen and the President during the tour, which had major significance in the <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.|$|E

25|$|Coca-Cola was {{introduced}} to China in 1927, and was very popular until 1949.
