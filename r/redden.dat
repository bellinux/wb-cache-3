40|$|We use the Balmer {{decrements}} of the broad-line regions (BLRs) and narrow-line regions (NLRs) {{of active}} galactic nuclei (AGNs) as <b>reddening</b> indicators {{to investigate the}} location of the dust for four samples of AGNs with reliable estimates of the NLR contribution to the Balmer lines. Intercomparison of the NLR and BLR Balmer decrements indicates that the <b>reddening</b> of the NLR sets a lower limit to the <b>reddening</b> of the BLR. Almost no objects have high NLR <b>reddening</b> but low BLR <b>reddening.</b> The <b>reddening</b> of the BLR is often substantially greater than the <b>reddening</b> of the NLR. The BLR <b>reddening</b> is correlated with the equivalent widths of [O III] lines and the intensity of the [O III] lines relative to broad Hβ. We find these relationships to be consistent with the predictions of a simple model where the additional dust <b>reddening</b> the BLR is interior to the NLR. We thus conclude that the dust causing the additional <b>reddening</b> of the accretion disc and BLR is mostly located at a smaller radius than the NLR.

40|$|Received / {{accepted}} Abstract. E(V−I) <b>reddening</b> {{values for}} 1123 {{locations in the}} bar region of the Large Magellanic Cloud are presented.

Eastern side of the bar is found to be more <b>reddened</b> when compared to the western side, with similar and relatively small values for differential <b>reddening</b> as {{in most parts of the}} bar. Increased <b>reddening</b> in the eastern end of the bar could be caused by a small fraction of the H I clouds in the line of sight. A high density of HI clouds located in the eastern end of the bar should have caused very high <b>reddening</b> in these regions, whereas only a relatively small increase in the <b>reddening</b> is estimated.

25|$|In astronomy, {{interstellar}} <b>reddening</b> is {{a phenomenon}} associated with interstellar extinction where the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from a radiation source changes characteristics from that which the object originally emitted. <b>Reddening</b> occurs due to the light scattering off dust and other matter in the interstellar medium. Interstellar <b>reddening</b> is a different phenomenon from redshift, which is the proportional frequency shifts of spectra without distortion. <b>Reddening</b> preferentially removes shorter wavelength photons from a radiated spectrum while leaving behind the longer wavelength photons (in the optical, light that is redder), leaving the spectroscopic lines unchanged.|$|R
40|$|We present {{measurements}} of dust <b>reddening</b> using {{the colors of}} stars with spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We measure <b>reddening</b> as {{the difference between the}} measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar parameters from the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline (Lee et al. 2008 a). We achieve uncertainties of 56, 34, 25, and 29 mmag in the colors u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z, per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the stellar type and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based <b>reddening</b> measurements confirm our earlier "blue tip" <b>reddening</b> measurements (Schlafly et al. 2010, S 10), finding <b>reddening</b> coefficients different by - 3 %, 1 %, 1 %, and 2 % in u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z from those found by the blue tip method, after removing a 4 % normalization difference.

40|$|A {{fraction}} of the heavily <b>reddened</b> quasars require a <b>reddening</b> curve which is even steeper {{than that of the}} Small Magellanic Cloud. In this paper, we thoroughly characterize the anomalously steep <b>reddening</b> law in quasars, via an exceptional example observed in IRAS 14026 + 4341. By comparing the observed spectrum to the quasar composite spectrum, we derive a <b>reddening</b> curve in the rest-frame wavelength range of 1200 Å [...] 10000 Å. It is featured with a steep rise at wavelengths shorter than 3000 Å, but no significant <b>reddening</b> at longer wavelengths. The absence of dust <b>reddening</b> in optical continuum is confirmed by the normal broad-line Balmer decrement (the Hα/Hβ ratio) in IRAS 14026 + 4341. The anomalous <b>reddening</b> curve can be satisfactorily reproduced by a dust model containing silicate grains in a power-law size distribution, dn(a) /da ∝ a^- 1. 4, truncated at a maximum size a_max= 70 nm. The unusual size distribution may be caused by the destruction of large "stardust" grains by quasar activities or a different dust formation mechanism (i. e., the in situ formation of dust grains in quasar outflows). It is also possible that the analogies of the dust grains observed toward the Galactic center is responsible for the steep <b>reddening</b> curve. In addition, we find that IRAS 14026 + 4341 is a weak emission-line quasar (i. e., PHL 1811 analogies) with heavy dust <b>reddening</b> and blueshifted broad absorption lines.

40|$|Using the "standard pair" {{technique}} of paring stars of almost nil and high extinction but otherwise of almost identical stellar parameters from the SDSS, and combing the SDSS, GALEX, 2 MASS and WISE photometry {{ranging from the}} far UV to the mid-IR, we have measured dust <b>reddening</b> in the FUV-NUV, NUV-u, u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z, z-J, J-H, H-Ks, Ks-W 1 and W 1 -W 2 colors for thousands of Galactic stars. The measurements, together with the E(B-V) values given by Schlegel et al. (1998), allow us to derive the observed, model-free <b>reddening</b> coefficients for those colors. The results are compared with previous measurements and the predictions {{of a variety of}} Galactic <b>reddening</b> laws. We find that 1) The dust <b>reddening</b> map of Schlegel et al. (1998) over-estimates E(B-V) by about 14 per cent, consistent with the recent work of Schlafly et al. (2010) and Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011); 2) All the new <b>reddening</b> coefficients, except those for NUV-u and u-g, prefer the R(V) = 3. 1 Fitzpatrick <b>reddening</b> law rather than the R(V) = 3. 1 CCM and O'Donnell (O'Donnell 1994) <b>reddening</b> laws. Using the Ks-band extinction coefficient predicted by the R(V) = 3. 1 Fitzpatrick law and the observed <b>reddening</b> coefficients, we have deduced new extinction coefficients for the FUV, NUV, u, g, r, i, z, J, H, W 1 and W 2 passbands. We recommend that the new <b>reddening</b> and extinction coefficients should be used in the future and an update of the Fitzpatrick <b>reddening</b> law in the UV is probably necessary. We stress however that the FUV- and NUV-band coefficients should be used with caution given their relatively large measurement uncertainties.

In their study, AG use four different techniques to measure the amount {{and structure of the}} extinction toward Taurus, and all four techniques agree very well. Thus we believe that the AG results are a truthful representation of the extinction in the region and can be used to test the reliability of the SFD <b>reddening</b> map. The results of our test show that the SFD all-sky <b>reddening</b> map, which is based on data from COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA, overestimates the <b>reddening</b> by a factor of 1. 3 to 1. 5 in regions of smooth extinction with A_V > 0. 5 mag. In some regions of steep extinction gradients the SFD map underestimates the <b>reddening</b> value, probably due to its low spatial resolution. We expect that the astronomical community will be using the SFD <b>reddening</b> map extensively.

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and <b>redden</b> with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist.

40|$|We aim {{to improve}} upon {{contemporary}} methods to estimate host-galaxy <b>reddening</b> of stripped-envelope (SE) supernovae (SNe). To this end the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I) SE SNe photometry data release, consisting of nearly three dozen objects, {{is used to}} identify a minimally <b>reddened</b> sub-sample for each traditionally defined spectroscopic sub-types (i. e, SNe~IIb, SNe~Ib, SNe~Ic). Inspection of the optical and near-infrared (NIR) colors and color evolution of the minimally <b>reddened</b> sub-samples reveals {{a high degree of}} homogeneity, particularly between 0 d to + 20 d relative to B-band maximum. This motivated the construction of intrinsic color-curve templates, which when compared to the colors of <b>reddened</b> SE SNe, yields an entire suite of optical and NIR color excess measurements. Comparison of optical/optical vs. optical/NIR color excess measurements indicates the majority of the CSP-I SE SNe suffer relatively low amounts of <b>reddening</b> and we find evidence for different R_(V) ^(host) values among different SE SN. Fitting the color excess measurements of the seven most <b>reddened</b> objects with the Fitzpatrick (1999) <b>reddening</b> law model provides robust estimates of the host visual-extinction A_(V) ^(host) and R_(V) ^(host). In the case of the SE SNe with relatively low amounts of <b>reddening,</b> a preferred value of R_(V) ^(host) is adopted for each sub-type, resulting in estimates of A_(V) ^(host) through Fitzpatrick (1999) <b>reddening</b> law model fits to the observed color excess measurements. Our analysis suggests SE SNe reside in galaxies characterized by a range of dust properties. We also find evidence SNe Ic are more likely to occur in regions characterized by larger R_(V) ^(host) values compared to SNe IIb/Ib and they also tend to suffer more extinction. These findings are consistent with work in the literature suggesting SNe Ic tend to occur in regions of on-going star formation. Comment: Abstract abridged to fit allowed limit.

5|$|In 2005, the Gemini and Keck telescopes {{obtained}} {{spectra of}} Haumea which showed strong crystalline water ice features {{similar to the}} surface of Pluto's moon Charon. This is peculiar, because crystalline ice forms at temperatures above 110 K, whereas Haumea's surface temperature is below 50 K, a temperature at which amorphous ice is formed. In addition, the structure of crystalline ice is unstable under the constant rain of cosmic rays and energetic particles from the Sun that strike trans-Neptunian objects. The timescale for the crystalline ice to revert to amorphous ice under this bombardment is on the order of ten million years, yet trans-Neptunian objects have been in their present cold-temperature locations for timescales of billions of years. Radiation damage should also <b>redden</b> and darken the surface of trans-Neptunian objects where the common surface materials of organic ices and tholin-like compounds are present, {{as is the case with}} Pluto.

The average 12 um flux density of our <b>reddened</b> quasars {{is similar to that}} of the recently discovered HyLIRG WISE 1814 + 3412 (z= 2. 452) at similar redshifts, with two of our <b>reddened</b> quasars also having comparable 22 um flux densities to this extreme HyLIRG. These optically faint, heavily <b>reddened</b> broad-line quasars are therefore among the most mid infrared luminous galaxies at z~ 2, now being discovered using WISE.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} a comprehensive HRD of early type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in the first step the reddenings of individual stars and the LMC <b>reddening</b> law have been investigated. 1942 LMC member stars with good UBVphotometries from the Bochum photometry data base have been first corrected individually for galactic foreground <b>reddening.</b> From stars with good spectral classification {{the slope of the}} LMC internal <b>reddening</b> line (EU-B/EB-V) was calculated for each spectral subclass between O 3 and A 4. A remarkable difference to the galactic <b>reddening</b> law was found. The slope of the <b>reddening</b> line first decreases for stars from O 3 to B 0, and then increases rapidly between B 0 and B 3 from similar to 0. 7 to similar to 1. 1. For later type stars it remains higher than for early type stars. This effect has important consequences for all extinction corrections. We checked this using different methods. Because no evidence for systematically wrong classifications was found, the differences in the <b>reddening</b> slopes must be caused by the ISM of the LMC itself. Four possible causes are considered...|$|R
