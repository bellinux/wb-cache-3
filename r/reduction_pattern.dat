Of particular interest in this light has been Russian, traditionally described as exhibiting two distinct phonological <b>reduction</b> <b>patterns,</b> differing both in degree and distribution. This study uses hyperarticulation to investigate the relationship between phonetic duration and reduction in Russian, concluding that these two <b>reduction</b> <b>patterns</b> differ not in degree, but in the level of representation at which they apply.

40|$|Bilaterally {{independent}} (mismatched) {{hearing aids}} cannot replicate the natural timing and level cues between ears, and hence, {{may result in}} negative consequences for localization and speech perception in spatially-separated noise performance. Five gain <b>reduction</b> <b>patterns</b> were {{used to evaluate the}} impact of bilaterally mismatched gain reduction schemes on localization and speech perception performance in noise, compared to an unaltered bilaterally linear time-invariant amplification scheme (reference scheme), in which audibility was optimized. The bilaterally mismatched gain reduction schemes were later matched (synchronized) between ears to explore the possibility of restoring the deteriorated performance due to the mismatched schemes. Sound quality and listening-effort ratings among different gain <b>reduction</b> <b>patterns</b> were assessed, as well as the relationship between self-reported localization ability in daily life and measured localization performance in a laboratory setting. Twenty-four bilateral hearing aid users were enrolled in this study and tested in a virtual environment with insert earphones. The results indicated that bilaterally mismatched gain reduction schemes had a negative impact on localization, compared to the reference scheme; whereas matching gain reduction schemes between ears improved the deteriorated localization performance. In contrast, the use of bilaterally mismatched gain reductions did not negatively impact the speech perception performance in noise. Matching the gain reduction scheme between ears actually resulted in reduced speech perception performance, compared to the mismatched gain reductions. Self-reported localization abilities were not found to be strongly related to the measured localization performance in this study. Finally, these five different gain <b>reduction</b> <b>patterns</b> did not result in significantly different overall sound quality ratings and listening-effort ratings for hearing aid users. However, the use of gain reductions (mismatched or matched) reduced the perceived noise intrusiveness, compared to the use of reference schemes. It is unclear why there was a discrepancy between the results of the localization and speech perception performance in the present study. It is likely that hearing-impaired listeners do not use binaural cues in the localization task {{in the same manner as}} in the speech perception task...|$|R

By using 14 toroidally distributed divertor probe arrays, which were positioned at radially inner side where the divertor flux concentrates in the inward-shifted magnetic axis configuration, {{it is found}} that Ne puffing leads to toroidally quasi-uniform reduction of divertor particle fluxes; whereas toroidally localized reductions were observed with N 2 puffing.

The thesis explores the changes in the expenditure <b>reduction</b> <b>pattern</b> during four years of the recent financial crisis in Thailand. The thesis finds that the budget allocation in Thailand follows the historical expenditure <b>reduction</b> <b>pattern</b> found by Norman L. Hicks. The defense budget bears a high burden from the fiscal budget reduction during the financial crisis as found in the Hicks' study. This budget allocation pattern creates short-term and long-term effects on the Thai military. The short-term effects mainly come from the real term reduction in the defense budget, while the long-term effects draw from the decline in defense budget as a proportion of the GNP and the central government budget, in addition to the decline in the GNP. These effects deteriorate the capability, readiness, and the modernization process of the Thai armed forces.

To recognize infants at risk of persistent overweight, we compared early-life factors {{of children with}} a longitudinal pattern of persistent overweight to children with a pattern of overweight in early but not in later childhood. Methods: In 3, 550 children participating in a birth cohort that started in 1996 / 1997 in the Netherlands, body mass index was repeatedly assessed until age 11 and dichotomized into with/without overweight. Latent class growth modeling was used to distinguish trajectories. Our analysis {{was focused on the}} comparison of early-life factors in children in a persistent overweight pattern with those in an overweight <b>reduction</b> <b>pattern</b> using multivariable log-binomial regression analyses. Results: Children (n = 133) in the persistent overweight pattern {{were more likely to have}} overweight parents [relative risk (RR) mother: 1. 85, 95 % CI: 1. 37 - 2. 49 : RRfather: 1. 75, 95 % CI: 1. 21 - 2. 55] than children in the overweight <b>reduction</b> <b>pattern</b> (n = 303).

40|$|Fe-MCM- 41 {{materials}} were prepared by different methods. The Fe was both {{incorporated into the}} structure and formed crystallites attached to the silica. High Fe content MCM- 41 (~ 16 wt%) with retention of mesoporosity and long-range order was achieved by a range of new synthetic methodologies: (i) by delaying the addition of Fe 3 +(aq) to the stirred synthesis gel by 2 h, (ii) by addition of Fe 3 + precursor as a freshlyprecipitated aqueous slurry, (iii) by exploiting a secondary synthesis with Si-MCM- 41 as SiO 2 source. For comparative purposes the MCM- 41 was also prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). Although all these synthesis methods preserved mesoporosity and long-range order of the SiO 2 matrix, the hydrothermally-fabricated Fe materials prepared via the secondary synthesis route has the most useful properties for exploitation as a catalyst, in terms of hydrothermal stability of the resulting support. Temperatureprogrammed reduction (TPR) studies revealed a three-peak <b>reduction</b> <b>pattern</b> for this material instead of the commonly observed two-peak <b>reduction</b> <b>pattern.</b> The three peaks showed variable intensity that related {{to the presence of}} two components: crystalline Fe 2 O 3 and Fe embedded in the SiO 2 matrix (on the basis of ESR studies).

40|$|We {{classify}} interacting topological insulators and superconductors with order-two crystal symmetries (reflection and twofold rotation), {{focusing on}} the case where interactions reduce the noninteracting classification. We find that the free-fermion Z_ 2 classifications are stable against quartic contact interactions, whereas the Z classifications reduce to Z_N, where N depends on the symmetry class and the dimension d. These results are derived using a quantum nonlinear σ model (QNLSM) that describes {{the effects of the}} quartic interactions on the boundary modes of the crystalline topological phases. We use Clifford algebra extensions to derive the target spaces of these QNLSMs in a unified way. The <b>reduction</b> <b>pattern</b> of the free-fermion classification then follows from {{the presence or absence of}} topological terms in the QNLSMs, which is determined by the homotopy group of the target spaces. We show that this derivation can be performed using either a complex fermion or a real Majorana representation of the crystalline topological phases and demonstrate that these two representations give consistent results. To illustrate the breakdown of the noninteracting classification we present examples of crystalline topological insulators and superconductors in dimensions one, two, and three, whose surfaces modes are unstable against interactions. For the three-dimensional example, we show that the <b>reduction</b> <b>pattern</b> obtained by the QNLSM method agrees with the one inferred from the stability analysis of the boundary modes using bosonization.

40|$|Three {{eye-tracking}} experiments tested whether native listeners recognized reduced Dutch words {{better after}} having {{heard the same}} reduced words, or different reduced words of the same reduction type and whether familiarization with one reduction type helps listeners to deal with another reduction type. In the exposure phase, a segmental reduction group was exposed to /b/-reductions (e. g., "minderij" instead of "binderij", 'book binder') and a syllabic reduction group was exposed to full-vowel deletions (e. g., "p'raat" instead of "paraat", 'ready'), while a control group did not hear any reductions. In the test phase, all three groups heard the same speaker producing reduced-/b/ and deleted-vowel words that were either repeated (Experiments 1 & 2) or new (Experiment 3), but that now appeared as targets in semantically neutral sentences. Word-specific learning effects were found for vowel-deletions but not for /b/-reductions. Generalization of learning to new words of the same reduction type occurred only if the exposure words showed a phonologically consistent <b>reduction</b> <b>pattern</b> (/b/-reductions).
