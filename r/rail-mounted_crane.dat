50|$|On 9 June, it was {{reported}} that a 1,000-tonne crane would be brought in by road from Carlisle to remove the derailed carriages on 10 June. The A85 at Falls of Cruachan was in effect on a bridge along the shore of Loch Awe and the engineers were looking at a number of methods to alleviate the problems with using such a large vehicle on the road. The carriage left overhanging the embankment was to be recovered by road, whilst the other was to be recovered by rail. A road crane had to be used as there was insufficient room available to use a <b>rail-mounted</b> <b>crane.</b> An option to use a helicopter to remove the carriages was ruled out due to the weight of the carriages at 35 tonnes each. If the crane was unable to recover the carriages, it was planned to winch them back onto the track and recover them by rail. The operation to recover the carriages was estimated to cost £100,000. On 11 June the crane removed the carriage that had fallen down the embankment.|$|E

40|$|Exchanges of {{switches}} is a {{time consuming}} and costly procedure that entails high risks for the contractor while the profit margin is low. The high cost is partly linked to the machine costs, where especially the cranes that lifts switchparts represent a major cost item. The cranes major drawback lies beyond the cost of these, in essence, the cranes can not perform any other activity than lifting, {{making it more difficult}} to reduce setup times. To reduce the cost of switch exchanges, this study intended to investigate the possibilities of using large construction machinery and, for the task specially adapted, a load distributing beam to lift the precast switch components. Construction machinery has historically been used to lift switches often without load distributing measures which can directly be contrary to the quality of deflection of the switch components, which the swedish transport administration regulations specify. Construction machinery can, unlike cranes, carry out other activities than just lifting where setup times are reduced and overall machine cost of the switch exchange should reduce. The study is thus designed to examine and clarify the conditions required for an alternative switch exchange method to be used. The conditions are based on the requirements that arise related to production, quality and contract aspects where the study also have included three traditionally utilized methods, gantry crane, <b>rail-mounted</b> <b>crane</b> and mobile crane. This is to enable to compare {{the pros and cons of}} the alternative method in comparison to the established switch exchange methods. The alternative method is also, along with the other switch exchange methods, tested against two real projects, the rebuilding of the meeting railyards Kaisepakte and Rensjön, with the intention to verify the study’s theoretically generated demand profiles. The study shows that the overall premise of using an alternative transmission shift method is based on the ability of the contractor to plan and prepare for using the method. Projects based on the swedish transport administration regulations and standards must create a good enough opportunity for the contractor to plan and prepare for the method. Which can be created by:• Continuity and sustainability of the client• Clearer quality requirements• Increased cooperation between client, contractor and construction planner• Focus on planningThe study of comparative analyzes also show that the switch exchange project have a tendency to change and comes with a high level of complexity, which makes it very difficult to argue that a single switch exchange method is fitted to meet the demands of all types of projects. Clear however is that the methods complement each other in regards to being able to master each other's weaknesses. The exception is the alternate switch exchange method and mobile cranes which impose similar requirements on the projects. Which could lead to the alternative method could be able to acquire the mobile cranes place as switch exchange method. The alternate switch exchange method's most obvious drawbacks are associated with:• Changes in the length of the switch parts• The presence of contact wire• The presence of slopes and ditches• Transport limitations to/from the siteValiderat; 20140924 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

5000|$|Work {{began on}} Meldon Viaduct in 1871. When it opened on 12 October 1874 {{it was part}} of the LSWR's routes to Plymouth and Bude via Okehampton. Originally it carried a single track, part of the Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR, but the track was doubled in 1878 when a steel viaduct of similar design was {{constructed}} next to it and the two were joined. [...] The construction of the second line was conducted whilst the original line remained open. In order to dispense with the need for high scaffolding, the trestles were erected by means of derricks mounted on the original structure. The trusses were constructed in a railway siding and lifted by means of two heavily-ballasted, <b>rail-mounted</b> <b>cranes</b> that were then pushed onto the original bridge and swung out into position by the cranes. Each truss could be thus installed within around two hours and thirty minutes, meaning that the work could be arranged around the railway timetable to avoid the need to close the line at any stage. The method, devised by engineer T Wrightson and supervised on site by W Jacomb, worked well and the new bridge was complete within 16 weeks of starting work. On 5 May 1931 a carpenter, F. Rook, was killed in an accident whilst replacing timber decking on the down line.|$|R
