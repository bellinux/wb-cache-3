40|$|Abstract − Coherent {{absolute}} distance interferometry {{is one of}} {{the most}} interesting techniques for length metrology. In frequency sweeping interferometry (FSI), measurements are made without ambiguity, by using a synthetic wavelengths resulting from a <b>frequency</b> <b>sweep.</b> Accuracy is mainly dependent on the capability to measure the synthetic wavelength, using a Fabry-Perot interferometer (FP) to count resonances as <b>frequency</b> <b>sweeps,</b> and therefore the number of detected synthetic fringes. For large ranges, the number of fringes dominates performance, leading to a linear decrease of the accuracy with range. By increasing the size of the interferometer reference arm, and measuring both the distance and the reference arm independently, it is possible to maintain small distance high accuracy measurements, even for much larger range. In the context of the ESA-PROBA 3 mission (coronagraph and demonstration of metrology for freeflying formation), we implemented a FSI sensor composed of a mode-hop free <b>frequency</b> <b>sweep</b> external cavity diode laser, a high finesse FP (to measure accurately the <b>frequency</b> <b>sweep</b> range) and a dual measurement system to enable the measurements at 150 m with an accuracy at the tens of micrometer level.

It is shown that the z motion is more forcefully excited by upsweep that by downsweep; thus at large amplitudes ions are more easily ejected to the trapping electrodes by upsweep and larger cyclotron orbits can be achieved by downsweep. This effect was confirmed by experiment and the results are favorably compared with the calculations. From these results it is concluded that downward sweeping is advantageous for ion detection and upward sweeping is preferable for ion ejection. The simulations clearly explain the effect of the direction of <b>frequency</b> <b>sweep</b> by visualizing the directions of the forces that ions experience immediately after the excitation of their cyclotron motion.

We demonstrate this using a long, randomized series of <b>frequency</b> <b>sweeps</b> (both upward and downward, by varying amounts) and analyzing intertrial adaptation effects. We show the point of constant frequency is shifted systematically towards the previous trial’s sweep direction (i. e., a <b>frequency</b> <b>sweep</b> aftereffect). Furthermore, the perception of glide direction is also independently influenced by the glide presented two trials previously. The aftereffect is frequency tuned, as exposure to a <b>frequency</b> <b>sweep</b> from a set centered on 1, 000 Hz does not influence a subsequent trial drawn from a set centered on 400 Hz. More generally, the rapidity of adaptation suggests the auditory system is constantly adapting and “tuning” itself to the most recent environmental conditions...|$|R
