25|$|The {{nuclear reactor}} {{is the heart}} of the station. In its central part, the reactor core's heat is {{generated}} by controlled nuclear fission. With this heat, a coolant is heated as it is pumped through the reactor and thereby removes the energy from the reactor. Heat from nuclear fission is used to <b>raise</b> <b>steam,</b> which runs through turbines, which in turn powers the electrical generators.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant. Instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam-generating boiler, the coal is gasified (see coal gasification) to create syngas, which is burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity (just like {{natural gas is}} burned in a turbine). Hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to <b>raise</b> <b>steam</b> in a {{heat recovery steam generator}} which powers a supplemental steam turbine. Thermal efficiencies of current IGCC power plants range from 39% to 42% (HHV basis) or ≈42–45% (LHV basis) for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies (Shell, GE Gasifier, CB). IGCC power plants outperform conventional pulverized coal-fueled plants in terms of pollutant emissions, and allow for relatively easy carbon capture.|$|E
25|$|When {{solid biomass}} {{is already in}} a {{suitable}} form (such as firewood), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or <b>raise</b> <b>steam.</b> When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from , which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce wood pellets, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with {{a broad range of}} input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.|$|E
25|$|Intelligence was {{received}} by the Admiralty {{in the form of}} intercepted radio signals that the German High Seas Fleet intended to put to sea on the morning of 30 May. At 5.0 pm on 30 May, Jellicoe was ordered to <b>raise</b> <b>steam,</b> and passed on the command to Beatty. At around 10 pm the battlecruisers left Rosyth to meet the Grand Fleet coming from Scapa Flow at a point in the North Sea some 100 miles from Denmark at 2.0 pm the following day. Such alerts had happened before, and it was not considered likely that a major fleet action was about to take place. The battlecruisers were ordered to travel to a point south of the meeting point, then turn north. Beatty arranged his ships with his own 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) in the most southerly position (sailing broadly east), with the 2nd BCS on a parallel course two miles north and the 5th BS five miles astern.|$|E

Sturdee ordered his ships to <b>raise</b> <b>steam</b> and pursue the Germans. His battlecruisers caught up and opened fire at 12:50; Spee decided that he could hold off the battlecruisers with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to allow the three light cruisers time to escape.

Vice-Admiral Maximilian von Spee, commander of the German squadron, had other plans and intended to destroy the radio station at Port Stanley on the morning of 8 December. The appearance of two German ships at 07:30 caught Sturdee's ships by surprise although they were driven off by [...] shells fired by the predreadnought battleship [...] when they came within range around 09:20. This gave time for Bristol to reassemble her engines and <b>raise</b> <b>steam.</b> As the ship was leaving harbour around 10:45, she received reports of German ships about [...] south and Sturdee ordered her to intercept and destroy them, together with the armed merchant cruiser [...] The British ships were able to capture two of the three German colliers and sank them after taking off their crews.|$|E

500|$|Aft of Arizona {{during the}} attack, Nevada was not moored {{alongside}} another battleship off Ford Island, and therefore {{was able to}} maneuver, unlike the other seven battleships present. The Officer of the Deck, Ensign Joe Taussig (son of the admiral of the same name), had earlier that morning ordered a second boiler lit off, planning to switch the power load from one boiler to the other around 0800. As Nevada's gunners opened fire and her engineers started to <b>raise</b> <b>steam,</b> a single [...] Type 91 Mod 2 torpedo exploded against Frame 41 about [...] above the keel at 0810. Seconds later, the same Kate torpedo bomber that dropped the torpedo was shot down by the Nevadas gunners. The torpedo bulkhead held, but leaking through joints caused flooding of port side compartments below the first platform deck between frames 30 and 43 {{and a list of}} 4–5°. Her damage control crew corrected the list by counter-flooding and Nevada got underway at 0840, her gunners already having shot down four planes. [...] Ensign Taussig's efficiency paid off, likely saving his ship, but he lost a leg in the attack.|$|E

500|$|The {{ships of}} the 20th Flotilla resumed minelaying {{operations}} on 15 June, {{although most of}} these {{over the next several}} months were defensive in nature. On the evening of 31 August 1940, Express, Esk, Icarus, Intrepid, and Ivanhoe departed Immingham to lay an offensive minefield off Texel, with cover provided by three destroyers of the 5th DF. At 23:07 it became clear that the ships of the 20th Flotilla had entered a German minefield when Express struck a mine abreast 'B' gun, losing her entire bow up to the bridge. The detonation killed 4 officers and 54 ratings; one officer and 7 crewmen were later rescued by the Germans. Esk and Ivanhoe, the closest ships to Express, closed to render assistance, while the other two destroyers turned hard [...] to starboard and retraced their route to exit the minefield, according to standing orders. Five minutes after the first mine detonated, Esks bow struck a mine and she came to a stop. Five minutes later Ivanhoe struck another mine that badly damaged her bow. At about 23:20, Esk struck another mine amidships that detonated her magazines. By 01:40, Express had managed to <b>raise</b> <b>steam</b> again and steamed astern to minimise the pressure of the water on her shored-up bulkheads.|$|E
500|$|Repairs at Sheerness {{lasted until}} 28 August {{and she was}} {{converted}} back into a minelayer at Immingham from 28–31 August as she was transferred back to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla. That night, she sailed with Intrepid, Icarus, Esk and Express to lay a minefield off the Dutch coast, north of Texel. Express hit a mine in a newly-laid German field that night and had her bow blown off. Ivanhoe closed to assist her and struck another mine shortly afterwards. The explosion knocked out her power for several hours, but the ship was able to <b>raise</b> <b>steam</b> by 01:45 on 1 September. She reached a speed of [...] while steaming backwards to lessen the stress on her damaged bow. However, about 04:00, either her propellers fell off or her propeller shafts fractured, and she lost all speed. Around 08:00, four motor torpedo boats arrived; three of these loaded all but 37 men of the ship's crew while the fourth stayed with the destroyer to recover the remaining crewmen. Ivanhoe continued to take on water and started to list. Early in the afternoon, she lost all power to her pumps and the captain ordered the ship abandoned after opening her valves to speed her sinking. Shortly afterwards, Ivanhoe was discovered and damaged by a German aircraft, but still did not sink. She had to be scuttled by a torpedo fired by the destroyer [...] later in the afternoon. The ship quickly sank afterwards at position [...]|$|E

It was clear to Spee that his ships could not outrun the battlecruisers and that the only hope for any of his ships to survive was to scatter. So he turned his two armoured cruisers around to buy time by engaging the battlecruisers and ordered his three light cruisers to disperse at 13:20.|$|E
