40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the reader to}} Chinaâ€™s Southern Song dynasty (1127 - 1279), and specifically the diplomat, court official, and poet Fan Chengda (1127 - 1279). During his years in government bureaucracy Fan Chengda traveled widely throughout the Southern Song Empire. During his travels he wrote several travel diaries, encyclopedias, and geographical treatises, in addition to thousands of extant travel poems. This paper investigates two of his works in particular: the Canluan lu and the Guihai yuheng zhi (both circa 1171 - 1174), written during his travels to Guilin, in the far South of the empire. Canluan lu, or the <b>Register</b> of <b>Mounting</b> a Simurgh is a travel diary of his trip to Guilin, and Guihai yuheng zhi is a geographical encyclopedia of Guilin and its surroundings. Comparative analysis of the two texts shows that in an apparent attempt to validate his self-image as an ideal Song scholar-official, Fan Chengda appropriated historical descriptions of Guilin from past scholars. His in-text statements {{as well as his}} descriptive style suggest that Fan Chengda wished to identify and commune with scholars from other eras of Chinese dynastic history. This is significant because the cultural landscape he describes became officialized knowledge in the Song court: characterizations of Guilin in the sixteenth century, as well as a common Chinese phrase about Guilin being the most beautiful place on Earth, can be traced to Fan Chengda...|$|R
5000|$|Despite their {{historic}} designation, the Barker and I.O.O.F.

40|$|A net-changing {{device for}} use with the Lowestoft {{multipurpose}} sampler is described. The unit consists of four nets mounted on stainless steel rods which are spring loaded and slide between stainless steel runners. The nets are held by metal "fingers " when not fishing, and by operating an electric motor they can be released instantaneously to the fishing posi-tion. Water enters the net through a standard nose cone via a trumpet-insert of fibreglass. The amount of water filtered is registered by an electric flowmeter mounted in the nose cone, and the depth at which the sample is taken is recorded by a pressure transducer. Nets can be selected by depressing a switch on the control unit, and the flow, depth and number of the net fishing <b>register</b> on meters <b>mounted</b> in the same unit.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} {{knowledge and}} perceptions about tuberculosis in agropastoral communities in Northern Tanzania. Study Design: This was a cross sectional study on habits and attitudes to tuberculosis. Methods: The {{study was conducted}} between June 2011 and May 2012. We enrolled tuberculosis patients <b>registered</b> at <b>Mount</b> Meru Hospital in Arusha municipal, Enduleni Hospital in Ngorongoro district, and Haydom Lutheran Hospital in Mbulu district. In addition we selected for comparison some of their household relatives and individuals from the neighborhood. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire. Knowledge about tuberculosis was assessed by questions concerning causes, symptoms, modes of transmission and prevention and treatment. Key variables for assessment of perception on tuberculosis included: individuals considered most at risk, and misconceptions. Results: We recruited 164 respondents of whom 25 % were confirmed tuberculosis patients, 41. 5 % relatives of the patients and 33. 5 % neighbors. Females constituted 48. 8 % of all respondents. Of all the participants, {{only two of the}} neighbors had never heard about tuberculosis in their life time. Even though 99 % had heard about tuberculosis, specific knowledge on causes, prevention and treatment was poor. A total of 67. 7 % thought that transmission of tuberculosis occurs during sexual intercourse. Respondents thought that risk from tuberculosis was higher among adults (68. 9 %), alcohol users (39. 6 %), smoking (26. 8 %), consumption of raw animal products (6. 1 %) and childhood (23. 2 %). Conclusion: Our study shows that study participants had heard about tuberculosis but specific knowledge was low. Misconceptions surrounding causes, transmission, prevention and treatment of the disease were common. Selection of appropriate channels for public health education and awareness programmes targeting knowledge about prevention and control of tuberculosis in agropastoral communities may improve this situation. </p...|$|R
5000|$|According to legend, {{the apostle}} and martyr Saint Andrew, {{the patron saint}} of Scotland, was crucified on an X-shaped cross at Patras (Patrae) in Achaea. Use of the {{familiar}} iconography of his martyrdom, showing the apostle bound to an X-shaped cross, first appears in the Kingdom of Scotland in 1180 during the reign of William I. This image was again depicted on seals used during the late 13th century; including on one particular example used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew which does not depict his image, namely the saltire, or crux decussata (from the Latin crux, 'cross', and decussis, 'having the shape of the Roman numeral X'), has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. The earliest reference to the Saint Andrew's Cross as a flag {{is to be found in}} the Vienna Book of Hours, [...] 1503, where a white saltire is depicted with a red background. In the case of Scotland, use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century, with the first certain illustration of a flag depicting such appearing in Sir David Lyndsay of the <b>Mount's</b> <b>Register</b> of Scottish Arms, [...] 1542.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} of buildings {{is becoming more}} critical, evidenced {{by the fact that}} building rating schemes and minimum efficiencies are now referenced in section J of the Building Code of Australia (BCA), and it would be reasonable to assume these requirements will be expanded in due course. This project aims to investigate micro climate air conditioning as an alternative to conditioning the entire space in order to provide a more efficient system to be implemented in typical office workspaces. Conventional air conditioning systems typically are based on supplying conditioned air at low velocity from ceiling <b>mounted</b> <b>registers.</b> The basis for a micro climate system is to provide low air quantities at a higher velocity and slightly higher temperature locally at the workstation level. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computer programs provide a predictive tool to simulate the resultant thermal output from an air conditioning system. The effectiveness of a micro climate system was tested in a typical open plan office workstation. Phoenics CFD software was used to provide results on the expected thermal gradients in the space which was then compared against the data compiled from two data loggers located both at the workstation and the ceiling level. Reasonable correlations between the CFD analysis and the data loggers output were achieved. A number of assumptions were made in order to develop the CFD model, which appear to have been substantiated particularly for the summer conditions. A number of variables were changed to improve the performance of the system; some of these were immediately implemented with favourable results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low cost GIT based data collection {{technology that is}} similar and an input to the ROad Maintenance Data Acquisition System (ROMDAS). It is composed of a vehicle, two digital video cameras, 2 GPS receivers and a notebook computer. Two different camcorders used for comparison purposes (one real color {{and the other a}} modified consumer camera to <b>register</b> infrared) are <b>mounted</b> {{at the front of the}} vehicle using a homemade gyro mounting. The GPS receivers are placed at the dash board of the vehicle. The notebook computer and GPS receivers are configured to record the position of the vehicle as it moves. The GPS log files maintain recordings of the latitude, longitude, time, speed and altitude of the vehicle position, as the researcher annotates a map document in the ArcGIS 9. 3 software with location referencing details and various road attributes. This data collection technology is aimed at exposing the potential of Geographic Information Technologies (GITs) in performing inventory of the road condition. The captured data may be useful for a variety of applications relevant to road inventory and maintenance. It is basically recommended for preliminary road maintenance diagnosis for which in depth road analysis may proceed for the affected road sections. With this technology, it is possible to map road marks and other architecture along the road and provide a map immediately by the end of the survey. In conclusion, data mining of the spatial video databases to facilitate routine and periodic maintenance decisions and the possibility to modify consumer cameras for research purposes is recommended...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the project, we {{investigated}} the local response of the coastal ocean ecosystems (changes in chlorophyll, concentration and chlorophyll, fluorescence quantum yield) to physical forcing by developing and deploying Autonomous Drifting Ocean Stations (ADOS) within several mesoscale features along the U. S. west coast. Also, we compared the temporal and spatial variability <b>registered</b> by sensors <b>mounted</b> in the drifters to that registered by the sensors mounted in the satellites in order to assess the scales of variability that are not resolved by the ocean color satellite. The second part of the project used the existing WOCE SVP Surface Lagrangian drifters to track individual water parcels through time. The individual drifter tracks were used to generate multivariate time series by interpolating/extracting the biological and physical data fields retrieved by remote sensors (ocean color, SST, wind speed and direction, wind stress curl, and sea level topography). The individual time series of the physical data (AVHRR, TOPEX, NCEP) were analyzed against the ocean color (SeaWiFS) time-series to determine the time scale of biological response to the physical forcing. The results from this part of the research is being used to compare the decorrelation scales of chlorophyll from a Lagrangian and Eulerian framework. The results from both parts of this research augmented the necessary time series data needed to investigate the interactions between the ocean mesoscale features, wind, and the biogeochemical processes. Using the historical Lagrangian data sets, we have completed a comparison of the decorrelation scales in both the Eulerian and Lagrangian reference frame for the SeaWiFS data set. We are continuing to investigate how these results might be used in objective mapping efforts...|$|R
