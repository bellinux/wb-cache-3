Departed HMS Maidstone {{where we were}} billetted, and de-bussed at {{northern}} end of Lepper street. Very large explosion as we moved down Lepper St towards New Lodge Road. I was on left flank, close to houses, very uncomfortable every time we passed {{one of the many}} narrow alleys leading off the road, seemed like ideal hiding place for attackers. When we reached New Lodge Road a lot of rioting going on, initially we cordoned NLR off, stones, bottles incoming in large quantities, also nail bombs (multiple as I recall, not just one as is often reported).Together with 4/5 others sent across NLR to cordon off Duncairn Parade. Whilst standing there, an overweight guy in white shirt and dark jacket came around corner of tower block on our left (part of Artillery flats), took aim with pistol and fired off several shots. We found this highly amusing and started laughing at his attempt to frighten us with a starting pistol. He looked somewhat surprised and ran back behind the flats. Some time later that night we were pulled back and started to move back up Lepper street. I don't recall if we were in the much discussed “box formation” but we were certainly arrayed across the road. Not far from the junction with Spamount street someone opened up from behind us with automatic fire. This time I was on the right flank. I felt a blow to my <b>RH</b> <b>side,</b> could see sparks coming off the cobble stones and wall to my right and decided to get the f! out of it, so ran around the corner to the right and into Spamount street.With the passage of time I forget exactly who was hit, Geordie of course, John Finch was hit in the abdomen, Pete Fishbourne (think that was his name) was hit in the backside. My recollection is that the newspapers reported 5 or 6 but that probably included Bob Reding. Heinz Pizarek (sic) found a spent round {{in the back of his}} webbing belt when he got back to HMS Maidstone.|$|E
40|$|We present {{electrical}} resistivity and specific heat measurements of alloys on the <b>Rh</b> rich <b>side</b> of the phase {{diagram of the}} Ce(Rh 1 -xPdx) (2) Si- 2 system. We compare these results with those obtained at intermediate and low Rh concentrations. The analysis of the concentration and temperature dependence of the entropy and of the scaling behaviour of C-et(T) and rho(T) clearly confirm a separation of the magnetic phase diagram into two regions: the region x {{less than or equal}} to 0. 3, showing a concentration independent characteristic temperature for the 4 f-electrons with T- 0 approximate to 45 K, while for x > 0. 3, T- 0 decreases to T- 0 (x = 1) approximate to 15 K. At low Pd- content, T-N decreases very rapidly from T-N = 36 K in pure CeRh 2 Si 2 to T-N = 18 K at x = 0. 1. With higher Pd concentration T-N stabilizes at T-N approximate to 15 K whereas the magnitude of the anomalies in C-et(T) and in the susceptibility around T- N are further reduced and disappear at x approximate to 0. 3. This differs from the behavior found on the Pd-rich side, where T-N decreases continuously to zero with increasing Rh content. The pronounced differences observed between both phase boundaries and the drastic effect of doping on the <b>Rh</b> rich <b>side</b> suggest an itinerant character in CeRh 2 Si- 2, in contrast with the localized character of CePd 2 Si 2. Further evidence for the itinerant character of CeRh 2 Si 2 is given by the rho(T) dependence observed for x {{less than or equal to}} 0. 3, which scales with rho(T) of the prototype itinerant compound YCo 2...|$|R

40|$|Rh 17 S 15 has {{recently}} {{been shown to be}} a strongly correlated superconductor with a transition temperature of 5. 4 K. In order {{to understand the nature of}} strong correlations we study the effect of substitution of some of the Rh and S atoms by other elements such as Fe, Pd, Ir and Ni on the <b>Rh</b> <b>side</b> and Se on the S side in this work. We find that while substitution of Ir and Se lower the transition temperature considerably, that of Fe, Pd and Ni destroy superconductivity down to 1. 5 K. The resistivity data in these doped samples show a minimum which is presumably disorder induced. A reduction of Tc is always accompanied by a reduction of electron correlations as deduced from heat capacity and magnetization data. Interestingly, the Fe doped sample shows some possible antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures. Comment: Published in Journal of Physics Condensed Matte...|$|E
40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ECI 2 D+LPI:GBE:PAFNational audienceHeterogeneous {{catalysis}} is {{ubiquitous in}} refining and chemical industries as it enables {{the formation of}} desirable products with minimal energy consumption. Since catalysis is a surface process, (metal) nanoparticles (NPs) often constitute the catalyst active phase, which is stabilized by a high-surface-area support and possibly promoted by a second metal. In this work, we have designed AuRh NPs supported on rutile TiO 2 nanorods as model catalysts for several reactions involving hydrogen. A simple colloidal co-reduction method using NaBH 4 and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) generates 3 nm-sized bimetallic NPs. [1] However, unlike their Au and Rh counterparts, the AuRh colloids are instable in solution, as monitored in situ by dynamic light scattering and liquid-phase TEM. [2] Thus, once formed the NPs must be readily immobilized on the support {{in order to avoid}} their further growth. The AuRh/TiO 2 catalysts present synergistic nanoalloying effects in all the investigated processes: stronger oxidation resistance of Rh in air,[1] stronger sulfidation resistance of Rh during tetralin hydrogenation in the presence of H 2 S,[1] higher selectivity to oxygen-free products in the hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol,[3] and higher performance in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. [2] The structures of the colloids and their evolutions after immobilization and thermal treatments in a hydrogen atmosphere relevant to the catalytic reactions have been investigated by aberration-corrected STEM, EDX, UV-Vis, CO-FTIR, XPS and XRD. Heating the catalysts to 350 °C eliminates the PVA and leads to the segregation of Au and Rh within the particles: the NPs adopt a Janus configuration with the <b>Rh</b> <b>side</b> in contact with the titania support. [1, 4] Further heating to 700 °C leads to NP coalescence and formation of “Au ball-Rh cup” ~ 10 nm-sized particles. [4] DFT calculations on unsupported and supported clusters show that the observed restructuring is driven by the strong Au-Rh segregation tendency, the lower surface energy of Au with respect to Rh, and the stronger Rh-TiO 2 bonding with respect to Au-TiO 2.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{example in the}} {{two-dimensional}} space-time where the products of current operators are defined in a strict sense and yet the associative law is violated. In a previous note 1) (hereafter referred to as KY) we {{have shown that the}} vector currents fail to satisfy the associative law of multiplication, and that the seeming violation of the Jacobi identity 2) is a consequence of neglecting this situation. There arises, however, a criticism 3) based on the improper character of the current operators: Since their products are not defined at all in the strict mathematical sense, it is meaningless to speak about any associative law. Nevertheless, we want to assert that the difficulty of defing the products in KY does not essentially concern the conclusion, because the breakdown of the associative law seems to come from other sources. This assertion can be cor-roborated by the following example, in the two-dimensional space-time, where the difficulty does not appear and yet the associative law is found to be violated.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{considerable}} {{progress in the}} understanding of anomalous transport, many ques-tions and issues raised in the early papers in this field of research are still of interest today. In this Section we will briefly discuss some of these issues. In particular the role of the concept of correlation functions in the search for modifications of the conventional diffu-sion equations and for scaling laws, in order to describe non-classical diffusion. Turbulent diffusion can also be viewed within the context of correlation functions. A direct relationship between the diffusion coefficient and the autocorrelation function of the velocity was introduced by Taylor [1]. Actually, he introduced a new ”tool ” for the analysis of diffusion processes. Following the ideas of Einstein and Langevin, Taylor in-troduced a stochastic equation for the motion of a Lagrangian test particle in a random field. Consider the equation for the trajectory of a fluid parcel in a turbulent velocity field u(x, t), dx dt = u(x, t). (1) Since the velocity on the right hand <b>side</b> (<b>rhs)</b> depends on the trajectory x(t), (1) is highly nonlinear! Suppose we follow a particle along its Lagrangian trajectory. It is obvious that the La-grangian velocity v(x 0, t) is equal to the Eulerian field value u(x, t) if the particle trajec-tory x(t) which starts at x 0 passes through the point x at time t, i. e., v(x 0, t) = u(x(t), t) ...|$|R
