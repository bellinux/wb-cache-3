5|$|Augustin Pyramus de Candolle {{was born}} on 4 February 1778 in Geneva, Switzerland, to Augustin de Candolle, a former official, and his wife, Louise Eléonore Brière. His family descended {{from one of the}} ancient {{families}} of Provence in France, but relocated to Geneva {{at the end of the}} 16th century to escape <b>religious</b> <b>persecution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Persecution of Zoroastrians is the <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> inflicted {{upon the}} {{followers}} of the Zoroastrian faith. The persecution of Zoroastrians occurred throughout the religion's history. The discrimination and harassment began {{in the form of}} sparse violence and forced conversions. Muslims are recorded to have destroyed fire temples. Zoroastrians living under Muslim rule were required to pay a tax called Jizya.|$|E
5|$|England under Henry IV {{was also}} looking {{to develop a}} silk industry, but no {{opportunity}} arose until the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the 1680s, when {{hundreds of thousands of}} French Huguenots, many of whom were skilled weavers and experts in sericulture, began immigrating to England to escape <b>religious</b> <b>persecution.</b> Some areas, including Spitalfields saw many high-quality silk workshops spring up, their products distinct from continental silk largely by the colors used. Nonetheless, the British climate prevented England's domestic silk trade from becoming globally dominant.|$|E

5|$|Fleeing <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> and {{political}} turmoil in Britain, the Priestleys {{emigrated to the}} United States in 1794 seeking a peaceful life. Hoping to avoid the political troubles that had plagued them in Britain and the problems of urban life they saw in the United States, the Priestleys built a house in rural Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, political disputes and family troubles dogged Priestley during {{the last ten years}} of his life.|$|E
5|$|Various biographers have {{proposed}} that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, {{and he may have}} wanted to be sure he was correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.|$|E
5|$|Ethnocentrism, tribalism, <b>religious</b> <b>persecution,</b> and prebendalism have {{affected}} Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960. Kin-selective altruism {{has made its}} way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests. Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, Fr. Antonio Mateo, the Vicar of Tayabas, became {{suspicious}} of the cofradías monthly masses and fees, thus Fr. Manuel Sancho stopped holding Masses for the cofradía. Mateo and Sancho then accused the cofradía of conducting heretical activities. Due to <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> and {{the increasing number of}} its members, Pule decided to have the cofradía recognized by the colonial government and the Roman Catholic Church. He first sought recognition and authorization from the Bishop of Camarines but his request was denied. Not discouraged, he then sought the approval of the Real Audiencia but he was also ignored.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Desha {{was born}} to Robert and Eleanor (Wheeler) Desha in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, on December 9, 1768. He was of part French Huguenot ancestry, and his {{ancestors}} had fled from France to Pennsylvania after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which had largely protected the Huguenots from <b>religious</b> <b>persecution.</b> He obtained a limited education in the state's rural schools. In July 1781, Desha's family relocated to Fayette County, Kentucky, and the following year, they settled {{in what was then}} known as Cumberland district near the present-day city of Gallatin, Tennessee. Desha's younger brother, Robert, would later represent Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Many fire temples, {{with their}} four axial arch openings, were usually turned into mosques simply by setting a mihrab (prayer niche) {{on the place}} of the arch nearest to qibla (the {{direction}} of Mecca). Zoroastrian temples converted into mosques in such a manner could be found in Bukhara, as well as in and near Istakhr and other Persian cities. Urban areas where Arab governors made their quarters were most vulnerable to such <b>religious</b> <b>persecution,</b> great fire temples were turned into mosques, and the citizens were forced to conform or flee. Many libraries were burnt and much cultural heritage was lost.|$|E

5|$|Plymouth Colony {{was founded}} {{by a group of}} English Puritans who later {{came to be known as}} the Pilgrims. The core group (roughly 40% of the adults and 56% of the family groupings) were part of a {{congregation}} led by William Bradford. They began to feel the pressures of <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> while still in the English village of Scrooby, near East Retford, Nottinghamshire. In 1607, Archbishop Tobias Matthew raided homes and imprisoned several members of the congregation. The congregation left England in 1609 and emigrated to the Netherlands, settling first in Amsterdam and then in Leiden.|$|E
5|$|Sir Francis and {{his wife}} were Protestants. In 1556 they went to Frankfurt in Germany to escape <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> under Queen Mary I, taking five of their {{children}} with them. It is unknown whether Lettice was among them, and she may have passed the next few years in the household of Princess Elizabeth with whom the family had a close relationship since the mid-1540s. They returned to England in January 1559, two months after Elizabeth I's succession. Francis Knollys was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household; Lady Knollys became a senior Lady of the Bedchamber, and her daughter Lettice a Maid of the Privy Chamber.|$|E
5|$|The book {{became an}} {{important}} element in the creation and propagation of the so-called Black Legend – the tradition of describing the Spanish empire as exceptionally morally corrupt and violent. It was republished several times by groups that were critical of the Spanish realm for political or religious reasons. The first edition in translation was published in Dutch in 1578, during the <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> of Dutch Protestants by the Spanish crown, followed by editions in French (1578), English (1583), and German (1599) – all countries where religious wars were raging. The first edition published in Spain after Las Casas's death appeared in Barcelona during the Catalan Revolt of 1646. The book was banned by the Aragonese inquisition in 1659.|$|E

5|$|In February 313, Constantine {{met with}} Licinius in Milan, where they {{developed}} the Edict of Milan. The edict stated that Christians {{should be allowed}} to follow the faith without oppression. This removed penalties for professing Christianity, under which many had been martyred previously, and returned confiscated Church property. The edict protected from <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> not only Christians but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose. A similar edict had been issued in 311 by Galerius, then senior emperor of the Tetrarchy; Galerius' edict granted Christians the right to practise their religion but did not restore any property to them. The Edict of Milan included several clauses which stated that all confiscated churches would be returned as well as other provisions for previously persecuted Christians.|$|E
5|$|Saffron {{made its}} way to the New World when {{thousands}} of Alsatian, German, and Swiss Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to Americain a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany. Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold.|$|E
5|$|In 1216, after {{requesting}} Muhammad II of Khwarazm not to aid Kuchlug, Genghis Khan dispatched general Jebe {{with two}} tumens (20,000 soldiers) {{to deal with}} the Qara Khitai threat, while sending Subutai with another two tumens on a simultaneous campaign against the Merkits. The two armies traveled alongside each other through the Altai and Tarbagatai Mountains until arriving at Almaliq. At that point, Subutai turned southwest, destroying the Merkits and protecting Jebe's flank against any sudden attacks from Khwarazm. Jebe relieved Almaliq, then moved south of Lake Balkash into the lands of the Qara Khitai, where he besieged the capital of Balasagun. There, Jebe defeated an army of 30,000 troops and Kuchlug fled to Kashgar. Taking advantage of the unrest fomenting under Kuchlug's rule, Jebe gained support from the Muslim populace by announcing that Kuchlug's policy of <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> had ended. When Jebe's army arrived at Kashgar in 1217, the populace revolted and turned on Kuchlug, forcing him to flee for his life. Jebe pursued Kuchlug across the Pamir Mountains into Badakhshan in modern Afghanistan. According to Ata-Malik Juvayni, a group of hunters caught Kuchlug and handed him over to the Mongols, who promptly beheaded him.|$|E

5|$|In Kaga, a {{civil war}} had broken out between Togashi Masachika and Kochiyo Masachika {{for control of the}} {{position}} of shugo over the province. Kochiyo was victorious against his brother and drove him out of Kaga. When the Ōnin War began in 1467, Masachika sided with the Hosokawa clan, while Kochiyo sided with the Yamana. Kochiyo also patronized Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival of the Hongan-ji school of which Rennyo was head. Masachika, seeking to reclaim his land, reached out to the Ikkō-ikki and asked for their support. In exchange, he promised to end their <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> and lift them out of poverty. The priests in Yoshizaki agreed to aid Masachika, and Rennyo, though alarmed by the rebellious attitude of the rebels, tacitly rendered his support as well. Asakura Toshikage, the ruler of Echizen and ally of the Hosokawa, also lent his support. Kochiyo was defeated, and Masachika restored to power.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{identify}} themselves as adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, Cao Đài or Roman Catholicism. Vietnamese Buddhists are mainly found among impoverished communities living in the Tonle Sap or the rural parts of Cambodia. As Vietnamese Buddhists derive their religious doctrines and beliefs from Chinese folk religion, they participate in religious rituals organised by Chinese Cambodians during festive seasons. Vietnamese communities that have settled down in Cambodia have adopted Khmer Theravada Buddhist practices to some extent. Vietnamese adherents of Roman Catholicism consist of descendants of refugees that fled the <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> {{during the reign of}} Tự Đức. They are split between city dwellers based in Phnom Penh and fishing communities that are based in Tonle Sap. Vietnamese Catholics make up about 90% of Cambodia's Roman Catholic community, and in the 1960s they had about 65,000 adherents in the country. Most of the Vietnamese Catholics were either deported to Vietnam or killed in March 1970, and it was only in 1990 that the Catholic church was allowed to re-establish itself in Cambodia. In 2005, there were about 25,000 Catholics in the country.|$|E
5|$|England's first {{permanent}} {{settlement in}} the Americas was founded in 1607 in Jamestown, led by Captain John Smith and managed by the Virginia Company. Bermuda was settled and claimed by England {{as a result of}} the 1609 shipwreck of the Virginia Company's flagship, and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed Somers Isles Company. The Virginia Company's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the crown, thereby founding the Colony of Virginia. The London and Bristol Company was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful. In 1620, Plymouth was founded as a haven for Puritan religious separatists, later known as the Pilgrims. Fleeing from <b>religious</b> <b>persecution</b> would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous trans-Atlantic voyage: Maryland was founded as a haven for Roman Catholics(1634), Rhode Island(1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut(1639) for Congregationalists. The Province of Carolina was founded in 1663. With the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664, England gained control of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, renaming it New York. This was formalised in negotiations following the Second Anglo-Dutch War, in exchange for Suriname. In 1681, the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn. The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates.|$|E
25|$|Buddhism flourished {{under the}} Indo-Greek and Greco-Bactrian kings, {{and it has}} been {{suggested}} that their invasion of India was intended to show their support for the Mauryan empire and to protect the Buddhist faith from the alleged <b>religious</b> <b>persecutions</b> of the Shungas (18573 BC).|$|R
50|$|France intervened {{several times}} in China, {{together}} with other Western powers, to expand Western influence there.
