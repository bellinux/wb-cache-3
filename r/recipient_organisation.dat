40|$|Networking as a {{means to}} achieve policy {{learning}} and the spreading of good practice across public service organizations is a feature of the UK. This paper examines the Beacon Council Scheme, established by central government to reward excellence in service delivery and to disseminate good practice across local authority organizations. The Scheme is interesting as a network for learning and change for several reasons: it is a national scheme, it is high profile and is being extended, and it is the only part of local government modernisation to date based on supporting "best practice". Using data from a national survey (n= 314) and 72 interviews from 12 case studies, this paper examines three research questions. First, how much networking and learning takes place at Beacon Council events. Second, to what extent has this learning led to implementation in local authorities. Third, what are the enablers and barriers of inter-organizational learning and change. The paper demonstrates that the Beacon Scheme is relatively successful in sharing good practice and encouraging networking. The identification of enablers and barriers indicates the need to focus upon the originating organisation (the preparation, planning and expertise of the Beacon Council and its dissemination strategy) but also the <b>recipient</b> <b>organisation</b> (the attending authorities) as well as the processes taking place between organizations...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines internationalisation {{of small}} and medium sized enterprises. There has been a journey to achieve this. The research has started as an action research as Teaching Company Scheme Associate. This {{has been done in}} two research cycles, which investigated factors for successful internationalisation of a small and medium sized UK manufacturing enterprise. This has revealed that successful internationalisation requires good technology and knowledge transfer to the new operations. The action research is followed by a survey that has been conducted within UK manufacturing companies. The data collected was analysed under three models: entry mode selection, role of factory and level of internationalisation. The first two models explain two major aspects of internationalisation decision. The last is showing what makes successful internationalising small and medium sized companies. These models provided several important results. The small and medium sized enterprise internationalisation is harder to achieve because most of these organisations do not have experience in technology and knowledge transfer. The success of internationalisation depends on the success of the transfer. This is achieved through employee ownership of the new knowledge. There are many factors affecting this result such as the network relationships such as trust, control and commitment and cognitive distance between two organisations. The last {{is a product of the}} difference between prior knowledge and the required level of knowledge. The entry mode and role of factory are decided through these factors while the level of internationalisation can only be explained by absorptive capacity of the <b>recipient</b> <b>organisation</b> and the technology transfer ability of the host organisation...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the high}} {{interest}} and {{the surge of}} research on knowledge transfer in the past decade, {{it is surprising that}} most of the existing studies have not presented a framework that could provide a satisfactory explanation for how knowledge is transferred from one unit or one organisation to another and how it is remained within the recipient unit or the <b>recipient</b> <b>organisation.</b> Such unclear and vaguely explained concepts and frameworks for knowledge transfer have become a major limitation of the research in this area. In order to fill the knowledge gap, this study aims to build a more comprehensive knowledge transfer framework that covers the key concepts of both knowledge transfer and learning, including the related social mechanisms and cognitive factors generally involved in the dynamic process of knowledge transfer. It particularly explores how knowledge transfer actually occurs in the real-life international joint ventures and investigates factors affecting the transfer process, in a hope that the findings would offer the creation of new concepts and essential guidance on knowledge transfer that can be generalised to other cases where the same phenomenon exists. This research employs a qualitative methodological approach to enrich the developed theoretical framework for knowledge transfer. A multiple-case study methodology, with a replication procedure, is used since it can provide both in- depth insights and compelling evidence. The cases selected include two Cambodian-based IJVs with the same Thai parent. Both cases are operating in the healthcare business, which {{is considered one of the}} most knowledge-intensive industries. The data for this study is collected through multiple methods of data collection, including in-depth interviews, documentation; and direct observation. The main findings of this study show general support for the developed framework and proposed propositions. They suggest that foreign parent's knowledge is transferred to the IJVs through the interaction between the sources and the recipients of knowledge. In addition, such transferred knowledge is shared in the organizational through a prolonged social interaction between direct recipients and other organisational members and is eventually institutionalised in the organisation if the organisational members continuously utilise the transferred knowledge. Moreover, the findings also reveal that the characteristics of knowledge, actors, and context can have an effect on the different phases of knowledge transfer.

40|$|The {{survival}} of organisations, especially SMEs, depends, {{to the greatest}} extent, on those who supply them with the required material input. This is because if the supplier fails to deliver the right materials {{at the right time}} and place, and at the right price, then the <b>recipient</b> <b>organisation</b> is bound to fail in its obligations to satisfy the needs of its customers, and to stay in business. Hence, the task of choosing a supplier(s) from a list of vendors, that an organisation will trust with its very existence, is not an easy one. This project investigated how purchasing personnel in organisations solve the problem of vendor selection. The investigation went further to ascertain whether an Expert Systems model could be developed and used as a plausible solution to the problem. An extensive literature review indicated that very scanty research has been conducted in the area of Expert Systems for Vendor Selection, whereas many research theories in expert systems and in purchasing and supply management chain, respectively, had been reported. A survey questionnaire was designed and circulated to people in the industries who actually perform the vendor selection tasks. Analysis of the collected data confirmed the various factors which are considered during the selection process, and established the order in which those factors are ranked. Five of the factors, namely, Production Methods Used, Vendors Financial Background, Manufacturing Capacity, Size of Vendor Organisations, and Suppliers Position in the Industry; appeared to have similar patterns in the way organisations ranked them. These patterns suggested that the bigger the organisation, the more importantly they regarded the above factors. Further investigations revealed that respondents agreed that the most important factors were: Product Quality, Product Price and Delivery Date. The most apparent pattern was observed for the Vendors Financial Background. This generated curiosity which led to the design and development of a prototype expert system for assessing the financial profile of a potential supplier(s). This prototype was called ESfNS. It determines whether a prospective supplier(s) has good financial background or not. ESNS was tested by the potential users who then confirmed that expert systems have great prospects and commercial viability in the domain for solving vendor selection problems...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between profit-making corporations and the not-for-profit sector within Australia. The broad field of corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is discussed, narrowing to the activity of corporate philanthropy and corporate social investment. The latter is defined as being philanthropy with strategic intent, {{in order to build}} capacity within the <b>recipient</b> <b>organisation</b> which in most cases will produce beneficial outcomes for the donor as well (Tracey, 2003). The title of this study has used the term ‘philanthropic contract’ (Broadbent, 2001; Kouzmin, 2007) to describe {{the relationship between}} commercial organisations and charitable ones and the unwritten societal expectation, that the corporate sector will support the work of members of the not-for-profit sector. This study also uses the term ‘social capital’ (Putnam, 1995) to describe one of the principle areas of benefit for companies who participate. The aspect {{of the relationship between the}} two sectors that formed the focus of this study is defined as being the interaction between the two that involves financial contributions and those of goods and services as well as expertise, information and influence flowing from profit-making companies to not-for-profit organisations. The direction of the research is to advance toward an understanding of why corporations engage in this practice and toward a conclusion as to whether corporate social investing is a mutually beneficial exchange. Finally, the study highlights examples of engagement processes, and advice from those participating. The inclusion of these in the study is designed to provide valuable learning for other corporations, and not-for-profit organisations, contemplating entering into their own philanthropic partnerships. Through ten qualitative interviews this inquiry investigated the attitudes toward this relationship of various stakeholders including the management of not-for-profit organisations, representatives of relevant associations and social commentators. It became apparent that the previously well-publicised opposition to publicly listed companies supporting the not-for-profit sector, proffered by organisations such as the Australian Shareholders’ Association, had largely evaporated. Case studies involving five profit-making corporations, operating within Australia, were then undertaken and the views of their senior management sought as regards their motivations, aims, and outcomes. Overwhelmingly their experiences were positive for the corporation, the organisations they were funding, and the members of the community that the recipients were in turn supporting. Corporate benefits reported included increased ability to attract quality staff, enhanced ability to retain staff, significant development for staff that actively participated, improved corporate culture and the building of social capital leading to enhanced reputation which supported the corporations licence to operate, future objectives and long term sustainability. It is hoped that these insights along with the advice offered up by those individuals and organisations that participated in the study will benefit others and promote greater participation in corporate philanthropy and social investment within Australia. vi...|$|E
40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) has a {{long history}} of {{capacity}} building in geological surveys and energy/mines ministries and departments in the developing world and post conflict situations. In recent research involving business and training needs analysis (BTNA), the relationships between such public sector bodies, their stakeholders, and large aid donors, has been studied in detail, particularly in countries of central Asia, southeast Asia and the Pacific (Stephenson et al. 2002, Stephenson 2003, Stephenson & Penn 2003). The methodology and aims of this analysis are presented here as a guide for BGS personnel that may be working in a training capacity overseas or who might be writing a bid or proposal for training in developing or post conflict countries. This is followed by a discussion of the wider context of capacity building in which this work is carried out. The purpose of business analysis is to understand the business of the organisation and its relationship with its external stakeholders. Data are collected internally by researching relevant literature including business plans, corporate organograms, training plans, mission statements and job descriptions, and by interview with senior managers. External data are gathered by discussing the organisation with a representative sample of its clients, through a series of structured interviews. Appendices 1 and 2 present questionnaires that may be adapted for use in business analysis. Training needs analysis takes stock of the current skills and knowledge of employees and places it against the required skills and knowledge, gained from the business analysis. Data are collected in the form of staff lists, job descriptions, employment histories, training records and information from staff appraisal. Structured interviews are also conducted with all staff. Appendices 3 and 4 present questionnaires that may be adapted for use in training needs analysis. A typical BTNA 'solution' will comprise a training plan that will solve present skills shortage problems in line with business need. This is likely to focus as much on transferable skills, such as information technology and writing/presentation, as on science. It will also probably contain a 'sustainable training system', which is installed to ensure that all training activities are undertaken as part of a cycle of action, review and modification to allow continual adjustment of training to the changing business ofthe organisation. Business and training needs analysis takes place in a wider context of capacity building which is often funded by donor and lending organisations like the World Bank, DFID and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The influence of such organisations is often not as good as it might be, partly because aid of this kind tends to be a compromise between what the <b>recipient</b> <b>organisation</b> needs and what the aid donor wants to give, and partly because the integration and management of large aid projects is often not done primarily with the recipient organisation's needs in mind. In such cases a sound understanding of the aid donors' agendas and projects is needed, and strategies must be developed to mitigate and develop these in line with the needs of the organisation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{countries}} of the British Commonwealth, including Australia and the United Kingdom, vest in coroners the power to issue recommendations for protecting public health and safety. Little is known about whether and how organisations that receive recommendations act on them. Concerns that recommendations are frequently ignored prompted the government of Victoria, Australia, to introduce a requirement in 2008 compelling organisations that receive recommendations to provide a written statement of action. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of organisations that received recommendations from Victorian coroners over a 33 -month period. Using an online survey, we asked representatives of "recipient organisations" what action (if any) their organisations took, and what factors influenced their decision. We also probed views {{of the quality of}} the recommendations and the mandatory response regime in general. Responses were analysed at the recommendation- and recipient organisation-level by calculating counts and proportions and using chi-square analyses to test for sub-group differences. RESULTS: Ninety of 153 <b>recipient</b> <b>organisations</b> surveyed responded (59 % response rate); they received 164 recommendations (mean[*]=[*] 1. 9; range, 1 - 7) from 74 cases. A total of 37 % (60 / 164) of the recommendations were accepted and implemented, 27 % (45 / 164) were rejected, and for 36 % (59 / 164) the recommended action was "supplanted" (i. e., action had already been taken). In nearly half of rejected recommendations (18 / 45), <b>recipient</b> <b>organisations</b> indicated implementation was not logistically viable. In half of supplanted recommendations, an internal investigation had prompted the action. Three quarters (67 / 90) of <b>recipient</b> <b>organisations</b> believed the introduction of a mandatory response regime was a good idea, but fewer regarded the recommendations they received as appropriate (52 / 90) or likely to be effective in preventing death and injury (45 / 90). CONCLUSIONS: Only a third of coroners' recommendations were implemented by the organisations to which they were directed. In drawing policy lessons, it is important to separate recommendations that were rejected from those in which action had already been taken. Rejected recommendations raise questions about the quality of the recommendations, the reasonableness of the organisation's response, or both. Supplanted recommendations focus attention on the adequacy of consultation between coroners and affected organisations and the length of time it takes for recommendations to be issued.

40|$|The {{trend to}} affluence in Australia is noteworthy. There are more Australian millionaires {{than ever before}} and {{the rate at which}} Australians are joining this group is one of the fastest in the world, with average assets held now worth US$ 4. 1 m, nudging the world’s average of US$ 4. 8 m (Merrill Lynch and Capgemini 2005). This is {{positive}} news for the community sector because the Giving Australia household survey indicates that Australia’s affluent are more likely give to community causes than those on lower incomes {{and are more likely to}} give more (PMCBP 2005). This trend is reflected in analyses of tax deductions claimed for charitable giving (McGregor-Lowndes and Marsden 2006). This paper presents the findings of qualitative research conducted as part of the Giving Australia project describing why affluent donors give - or don’t - to community causes. Findings from eight focus groups and eight in-depth interviews with affluent individuals suggest that giving by the affluent at lower levels may be linked to a sense of identity and responsibility within social groups, as well as the perceived worthiness of both the cause and <b>recipient</b> <b>organisations.</b> In contrast, major donor behaviour appeared to be linked to passion and personal commitment to social change. A range of barriers were also indicated such as a need for privacy and concerns about the capacity of community organisations. Overall, the study’s findings add to the understanding of giving behaviour by the affluent in Australia and confirm US findings that motivations for affluent donors are complex (for example, Boris 1987; Prince and File 1994; Schervish 2005; Johnson 2005) ...|$|R
40|$|International {{development}} assistance from richer to poorer (“developing”) economies accounts for major flows of capital, human resources and technical assistance. While the net direction of these flows remains {{a topic of}} hot debate, {{there have been several}} barriers identified to the efficient use of aid within developing countries, many of which revolve around difficulties with achieving “good governance ” in recipient countries (World Bank, 2004). Donor agencies have consequently become increasingly interested in facilitating good governance in the aid <b>recipient</b> <b>organisations</b> they work with. However, Feachem (2004) in his capacity as Director of the Global Fund, has noted that it is now becoming increasingly obvious that good governance is also an issue on the “supply side”: competing interests and agencies within the United Nations and multilateral aid system; between different donor governments; and between a plethora of non-governmental organisations, is producing inefficiencies and a lack of coordinated activity. Without making organisational learning a feature of the aid system, the notion of capacity development is, we believe, reminiscent of Sisyphus, destined to battle the same obstacles time and again. Capacity development is by definition contingent on organisational learning. While we recognise that there may be no singular “type ” of learning that can claim precedence over others, we wish to focus in some detail on the learning that is required to make projects work through people. Beyond the economic, technical and political resources needed to get things done, it is people who are the intended beneficiaries, and it is people whose interaction with the systems of aid we have, and again the people representing them, that need to be understood. At the foundation of these Human dynamics is motivation, and in particular motives toward social equity. Learning “how ” those motives work – including when they unexpectedly backfire – is crucial for developing capacity...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of Web sites {{that can be}} accessed and used regardless of an individual?s disability is critical. One barrier to improved accessibility of Web sites relates to the gap between Web authors? technical knowledge of Web accessibility guidelines and a broader understanding of the challenges facing disabled people when interacting with Web sites. This thesis describes the development and evaluation of a Web accessibility auditing methodology with the dual aims of accurately identifying accessibility barriers present in a Web site, and presenting the audit findings and recommended actions {{in a way that}} informs, educates and engenders an improved understanding of accessibility amongst the audience. The methodology was piloted amongst a sample of Web sites, validated against other published accessibility evaluation methodologies, and adopted for subsequent audits carried out on a commercial basis. The impact on <b>recipient</b> <b>organisations</b> and individuals of a sample of 14 commercially commissioned audits was then evaluated. Audit recipients were surveyed, and each Web site audited evaluated to identify any changes to accessibility, and the presence of evidence of changes or improvements to accessibility strategy. Strong indications were found that the audits had a positive impact both on individuals and on the commissioning organisations. The audits were identified as having a particularly positive educational and motivational impact on recipients who did not identify themselves as having expertise in Web accessibility. There was also evidence that the design approach promoted by the audits had been adopted and applied by some of the commissioning organisations. The majority of respondents cited the recommendations for improvement as the most valuable feature of the audit. This illustrates a tension between the {{importance of}} presenting specific recommendations for actions and providing richer narrative accounts of evaluation stages to encourage a more holistic appreciation of accessibility. The particular benefits of the study are found in the identification of evidence of impact of commercially-commissioned Web accessibility audits {{over a period of time}} to recipients of varying characteristics. A number of areas for further investigation have been identified, focusing on investigating the potential value of the accessibility audit in providing more ?experiential? evaluation stages.

The author shows how development INGOs have globalised, in terms of both the formation of international confederations and the collaboration of multiple INGOs in global coalitions.

40|$|Background Knowledge {{mobilisation}} {{in healthcare}} organisations is often carried out through relatively short-term projects dependent on limited funding, {{which raises concerns}} about the long-term sustainability of implementation and improvement. It is becoming increasingly recognised that the translation of research evidence into practice has to be supported by developing the internal capacity of healthcare organisations to engage with and apply research. This process can be supported by external knowledge mobilisation initiatives represented, for instance, by professional associations, collaborative research partnerships and implementation networks. This conceptual paper uses empirical and theoretical literature on organisational learning and dynamic capabilities to enhance our understanding of intentional capacity building for knowledge mobilisation in healthcare organisations. Discussion The discussion is structured around the following three themes: (1) defining and classifying capacity building for knowledge mobilisation; (2) mechanisms of capability development in organisational context; and (3) individual, group and organisational levels of capability development. Capacity building {{is presented as a}} practice-based process of developing multiple skills, or capabilities, belonging to different knowledge domains and levels of complexity. It requires an integration of acquisitive learning, through which healthcare organisations acquire knowledge and skills from knowledge mobilisation experts, and experience-based learning, through which healthcare organisations adapt, absorb and modify their knowledge and capabilities through repeated practice. Although the starting point for capability development may be individual-, team- or organisation-centred, facilitation of the transitions between individual, group and organisational levels of learning within healthcare organisations will be needed. Summary Any initiative designed to build capacity for knowledge mobilisation should consider the subsequent trajectory of newly developed knowledge and skills within the <b>recipient</b> healthcare <b>organisations.</b> The analysis leads to four principles underpinning a practice-based approach to developing multilevel knowledge mobilisation capabilities: (1) moving from `building¿ capacity from scratch towards `developing¿ capacity of healthcare organisations; (2) moving from passive involvement in formal education and training towards active, continuous participation in knowledge mobilisation practices; (3) moving from lower-order, project-specific capabilities towards higher-order, generic capabilities allowing healthcare organisations to adapt to change, absorb new knowledge and innovate; and (4) moving from single-level to multilevel capability development involving transitions between individual, group and organisational learning...|$|R
40|$|Total Quality Management (TQM) {{has become}} a {{frequently}} used term in discussions concerning quality. The international and national competitive environment is {{in a process of}} constant change by the globalisation of markets and the increased interdependence of economic agents. This process of change has brought increased demands on the organisations’ competitiveness and the customers have gained {{a central role in the}} organisations’ focus. TQM is considered to be an important management philosophy, which sustains the organisations in their efforts to obtain satisfied customers. However, there exist extensive numbers of examples of failed or badly performed implementation processes of TQM. The relatively frequent occurrence of failed or badly performed implementation processes is a problematic phenomenon, which negatively affects organisations, irrespective of size, in their development towards business excellence and ultimately survival in a competitive environment. The use of TQM among many Western organisations has been relatively high during the 1990 s, but diversity among researchers exists regarding the actual benefits of TQM. The issue regarding the relationship between successful TQM implementation and financial performance, when considering the incentives for the large organisational change a TQM implementation implies, is important. The role and contribution, which small organisations make to the economy, has become widely recognised. As all organisations, regardless of size and financial status, are involved in the quality revolution, issues concerning the quality development of small organisations are of major importance. This thesis presents results from two different research projects, described in five appended papers. The first project concerns the relationship between TQM implementation and financial performance within a Swedish context. The results, obtained by studying Swedish quality award <b>recipients,</b> indicate that <b>organisations</b> that have successfully implemented TQM perform better than the general mass of organisations, during a period following the award acknowledgment. The second project concerns implementation and use of TQM in small organisations. In this project, two multiple-case studies have been conducted in order to describe experiences from implementing and working with TQM. These multiple-case studies have been conducted by studying quality award <b>recipients</b> among small <b>organisations.</b> The analysis of these organisations indicates that some of the core values of TQM, which are often described as the basis of the concept, are more adequate than others when initiating the quality development work. These core values were leadership, everybody’s commitment and customer focus. The results also point out how small TQM organisations organise their quality activities and what their actual quality related work constitutes. In addition, the studies also visualise the importance of committed management and co-workers in order to accomplish the substantial organisational change that is necessary in order to implement TQM. Important areas for facilitating the development of commitment among the involved actors in the change process are described. Furthermore, the problems related to the work with the core value process orientation were a distinct feature of the studied organisations. These problems were mainly due to the knowledge situation in the organisations. The experiences from the successful implementation processes emerge in an overarching tentative implementation model consisting of three phases. Godkänd; 2003; 20061108 (haneit...|$|R
40|$|Background Performance-based fi nancing {{can be used}} {{by global}} health funding {{agencies}} to improve programme performance and thus value for money. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was one of the fi rst global-health funders to deploy a performance-based fi nancing system. However, its complex, multistep system for calculating and paying on grant ratings has several components that are subjective and discretionary. We aimed to test the association between grant ratings and disbursements, an indication {{of the extent to which}} incentives for performance are transmitted to grant recipients. Methods We obtained publicly available data for 508 Global Fund grants from 2003 to 2012 with performance ratings and corresponding disbursements, merged with other datasets that contained data for relevant country characteristics. We used regression analysis to identify predictors of grant disbursements in phase 2 (typically the latter 3 of 5 years of a grant), using two dependent variables: whether a grant had any phase- 2 disbursements, and the phase- 2 disbursement amount. In a separate analysis, we also investigated the predictors of grant performance ratings. Findings Grant performance rating in phase 1 was positively associated with having any disbursements in phase 2, but no association was seen between phase- 1 ratings and phase- 2 disbursement amounts. Further more, performance ratings are not replicable by external observers, both because subjective and discretionary decisions are made in the generation of performance measures and because the underlying data are not available. Interpretation The Global Fund’s present performance-based funding system does not adequately convey incentives for performance to <b>recipients,</b> and the <b>organisation</b> should redesign this system to explicitly link a portion of the funds to a simple performance measure in health coverage or outcomes, measured independently and robustly.

40|$|Programme (UNDP) {{completed}} {{the first phase}} of the national Development Cooperation Report (DCR I) in May 1999. This phase highlighted the need for more in-depth analysis of methodologies in collecting, analysing and managing information on aid to South Africa. The UNDP produces Development Co-operation Reports (DCRs) in its countries of operation on an annual basis. These reports attempt to catalogue and analyse the total flows of Official Development Assistance (ODA) coming into the <b>recipient</b> country. International <b>Organisation</b> Development South Africa (IODSA) was asked to investigate and compare a sample of UNDP DCRs and make recommendations relevant to the South African process for carrying out Phase Two of its own report (DCR II). In particular, this study is expected to: ♦ Identify trends and commonalities between the UNDP process and DCR II ♦ Critique the recommendations and conclusions of the UNDP DCRs, particularly relating to impact assessment ♦ Make points of relevance to the DCR II process and analysis This report appraises a sample of DCRs, and comments on their content and methodologies in relation to the South African DCR II process. As the study will show, there is a consistent approach throughout the DCRs. However, some reports are particularly quoted to give ideas and examples in helping formulating thinking around the scope and format of DCR II. 1. 1 KEY OBJECTIVES OF DCR II The key objectives of the South Africa DCR II are as follows: ♦ To achieve greater South African control and ownership of ODA ♦ To enhance the institutional arrangements for effective ODA management and co-ordination (including a framework to ensure dynamic alignment of ODA with the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and sector specific objectives). Notably this must ensure that: • There is a clear definition of roles and responsibilities of departments within government • That there is a clear structural relationship between the Department o...|$|R
