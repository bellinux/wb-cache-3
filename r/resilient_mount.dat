40|$|ABSTRACTThis {{paper has}} been focused on {{developing}} a new hybrid mount for shipboard equipment used in naval surface ships and submarines. While the hybrid mount studied in our previous research was 100 kg-class series-type mount, the new hybrid mount has been designed as an inertia-type mount capable of supporting a static of 500 kg. The proposed mount consists of a commercial rubber <b>resilient</b> <b>mount,</b> a piezostack actuator and an inertial mass. The piezostack actuator connected with the inertial mass generates actively the control force. The performances of the proposed mount with a newly designed specific controller have been evaluated in accordance with US military specifications and compared with the passive mount. An isolation system consisting of four proposed mounts and auxiliary devices has been also tested. Through a series of experimental tests, it has been confirmed that the proposed mount provides better performance than the US Navy's standard passive mounts...|$|E
40|$|A novel self-sensing tunable {{vibration}} absorber (SSTVA) is developed for active absorption of vibrations in vibrating structures. The SSTVA {{consists of a}} piezoelectric ceramic-magnetostrictive composite sensoriactuator suspended in a mounting frame by two flexible beams connected to the axial ends of the sensoriactuator. The sensoriactuator serves to produce an axial force for tuning of the natural frequency of the SSTVA, to gather the signals associated with structural vibrations {{and to provide a}} lumped damped mass for the SSTVA. By monitoring the sensoriactuator output voltage while adjusting its input magnetic field (or electric current), the natural frequency of the SSTVA is tuned to the targeted resonance frequency of a structure. In this paper, the working principle, design prototype and operating performance of a 62. 5 Hz SSTVA are reported. A high tunability of the natural frequency of 20 % and a good sensing capability of vibrations comparable to a commercial accelerometer are obtained, together with a high absorbability of vibrations of ∼ 4 dB in a steel-plate-neoprene <b>resilient</b> <b>mount</b> structure.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{describes}} the original method proposed by authors that provides decreasing of the dynamic loading of tractor transmission by means of change of the reactive element torsional stiffness. One of the most loaded elements in tracked vehicles is the final drive unit which is loaded by high dynamic modes. The tractor Chetra 6 C- 315 has an epicyclic final drive with a stopped ring gear. Authors propose use of a strictly <b>resilient</b> <b>mount</b> of the ring gear instead of a rigid connection. To analyze efficiency of the proposed method, a 3 D-model of transmission {{was created in the}} “Universal Mechanism” software. Also, the model of a caterpillar mover was created in the same software for analysis of influence on transmission loads of the complex of kinematic and dynamic factors impacting on the forming of torque on driving sprockets. This article presents results of modeling of loading processes in transmission elements with the elastic coupling and without it during the longitudinal motion at various speeds and in turns with various radii. The results show that element dynamic load at high loading dynamic modes decreases by 20 - 30 % in case the coupling is installed...|$|E

40|$|Many {{engineering}} applications requires {{for the use}} of <b>resilient</b> <b>mounts</b> {{whose main}} scope is to decouple the vibration flow from the source to the receiving structure. In most of the cases, the provided design characteristics of these components are limited to the static stiffness and no information on the their dynamic behavior is provided. This represents a drawback while optimizing the <b>resilient</b> <b>mounting</b> of large vibrating machinery where every knowledge of the dynamics of the vibration paths plays an important role. In the years, to improve isolation performance of the mounts, air springs, instead of the full rubber mounts, have been adopted. These consists of a rubber sleeve, with appropriate endings, filled up with air at the appropriate pressure. Again the manufacturers do not provide much of the information, the engineers would need to use those devices at their best. In this work the authors describe the testing machine that has been builded at the LVA to derive the force vs frequency vs pressure plots of a set of commercial air spring. The machine can measure the forces both above and below the device, allowing to determine, directly, in three directions, the transmissibility as function of the frequency and of the applied pressure. The preload acting on the spring, as well as the internal pressure, can also be modified allowing for a more accurate system description. The characteristics curves derived for the air-spring in such a way, will be used within a simple SDOF AVC system. The performances of this solution will be compared with the performance of an analogous system using only the commonly available static deflection value.

On {{the basis of}} these considerations the two most promising concepts were selected. Refined analysis and preliminary design work was conducted on these two concepts. The selected concepts were required to fit within the combustor chamber dimensions of the reference engine. This is achieved by using a dump diffuser discharging into a plenum chamber between the compressor discharge and the turbine inlet, with the combustors overlaying the prediffuser and the rear of the compressor.

40|$|Increasing {{levels of}} low-frequency {{environmental}} noise {{have led to}} an increased need for appropriate mitigation in building construction. Windows are a common pathway for low-frequency sound transmission due to their light weight and low damping. In the work described in this thesis, the use of stiffening elements to decrease low-frequency noise transmission through lightweight panels was explored. The effect of elastic mounting as a possible contributor to low-frequency noise transmission was also considered. A finite element model allowing for both panel stiffening from clamping {{and the addition of}} variable-stiffness beams within the panel was constructed. The model allows for variable positioning of such elements as part of a stiffened panel configuration. Several double-panel configurations, representing double-pane windows typically seen in energy-efficient constructions were also tested with various clamped-stiffening elements. The change in panel vibration was also gauged {{through the use of a}} Rayleigh-Ritz model that allowed for construction of the modes of vibration of stiffened panels. In addition to the FEM and Rayleigh-Ritz models, experimental sound transmission loss testing of panels with variable edge stiffness was performed to verify the character of the predictions seen in the models. The results show that low-frequency sound below 150 Hz can be reduced by several dB through careful use of stiffening elements, and that <b>resilient</b> <b>mounting</b> can contribute to low-frequency sound transmission through windows. ...|$|R

The requirements which govern {{the design of the}} tail rotor are: strength, power efficiency, low weight, avoidance of vibrations and additional noise, and easy controllability. The design of the tail rotor is expressed by the main design parameters: diameter, tip speed, solidity, number of blades. Length of machine, ground clearence and weight considerations will all favour the small antitorque rotor. Avoidance of resonance frequencies may affect the choice of tip speed. This maximum is assumed to be equal to twice the thrust for compensation of maximum rotor torque. Normally this will cover the criterion of avoidance of tip stall in forward flight. The number of blades may be chosen {{from the point of view}} of vibration.

In the last decades various methods for the experimental study of vibrations have been developed in the aerospace and automotive fields, like transfer path analysis and modal testing. The first section of this paper describes the potentialities and the limits of these methods, when a small appliance (maximum size 300 mm) has to be tested in an industrial environment.

Most high speed vessels are fitted with powerful high speed engines which are installed in confined spacesa nd, as a consequencec, ausea n extremely high level of noise and vibration. Often structure-borne sound power is transmitted to a sound carrying structure from a source via a number of contact points. In turn, the noise and vibration are propagated in the structure and could possibly cause an undesired noise radiation. In this study, a model for predicting power flow based on the mobility theory has been addressed. The unique parts of the study include {{the establishment of the}} relationship of mobility functions with respect to four-pole parameters and the dynamic stiffness coefficients of a coupled machine/mount/foundation system. Also expressions to represent the sound input power, the output power and the transmitted power in relation to mobility functions are clarified. From a detailed analysis of relevant literature, it is shown that no validated models for predicting the propagation of structure-bome noise within the intermediate frequency range of 125 Hz to lkHz exist. As a consequence, a new numerical stress wave model has been developed to bridge this knowledge gap. This innovative approach extends the earlier works of Cremer, Heckl and Ungar in the field of stress wave propagation. Finally, a novel holistic model has been developed to line up the transmission, propagation and radiation predictions of a machine induced noise and vibration in ship's structure to take in account the fluid-structure interaction effect. A number of experiment measurements have been performed to validate the established models. From the comparisons, the prediction models are shown to be credible with an accuracy higher than 95 per cent.
