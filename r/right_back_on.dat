25|$|After a Bengals punt, Chandler {{gave the}} Chargers good field {{position}} with a 7-yard {{return to the}} 45-yard line.

But the Bengals stormed <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> a drive set up by David Verser's 40-yard kickoff to the 46-yard line. Faced with third down and 7 inside the red zone later in the drive, Anderson kept the drive going with a 16-yard completion to Isaac Curtis on the Chargers 1-yard line, and fullback Pete Johnson scored a touchdown run on the next play, giving them a 17–7 lead.|$|E

This time the Browns defense stepped up, sacking Elway twice and forcing Denver's first punt of the game. After that, Kosar's 24-yard completion to Slaughter set up a 45-yard field goal attempt by Bahr, but he sent it wide right as time expired in the half.|$|E

She went <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> high-mindedness. Did she thereby betray it? ...|$|E
