Table 5 in the Appendix displays detailed results, including the factor loadings (averaged across the ten plausible values). The factor analysis yields a well-defined first factor that loads positively on all six measures of internal heterogeneity. Loadings for the within-group <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> of adults with intermediate and high levels of qualification fall between 0.8 and 0.9. Loadings are somewhat lower for the less-educated group, albeit still quite high at 0.539 and 0.617 for literacy and numeracy skills, respectively.

New equations and <b>residual</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> (RSDs) were determined {{in a sample of}} healthy subjects. Tm,CO and Qc values were measured in 117 (72 females, 45 males) nonsmoking healthy subjects. The carbon monoxide transfer factor (TL,CO) was determined when the volunteer was breathing room air and subsequently, when the volunteer was breathing 100 % oxygen. From these data, Tm,CO and Qc values were calculated. The females' TL,CO was 3. 15 mmol(.) min(- 1.) kPa(- 1) lower than the males', apparently caused by lower female lung volume. Tm,CO and Qc were lower in females, but correction for lung volume eliminated this difference. Qc reference equations for females and males, respectively, are 4. 375 x 10 (- 2) - 1. 085 x 10 (- 2) x height and 4. 455 x 10 (- 2) - 1. 085 x 10 (- 2) x height (RSD for both sexes: 2. 544 x 10 (- 3)).

The mean <b>residuals</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> were computed at periods of 1, 2, 5, 7, and 10  s. The mean residuals are computed for each group of data from the logarithmic differences between the observed values and those predicted using the GMPEs for the ARS and AVRS described above. Positive values indicate underprediction (i.e., the observed values are larger than the predictions), on average, over the range of analysis, while negative values indicate the opposite. Similarly, the <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> are computed from the logarithmic differences of the observed and predicted values as root-mean-square residuals in each group of data.|$|R

It differs from other impedance systems which use surface electrodes in that the subjects stand bare-footed on a metal sole-plate which incorporates the electrodes, hence impedance is measured through the legs and lower trunk. In 104 men and 101 women (16 - 78 years and BMI 16 - 41 kg/m 2) the mean bias in body-fat mass measured using the Tanita body-fat analyser was 0. 8 (2 SD 7. 9) kg relative to a four-compartment model. This is comparable to the other prediction techniques tested (conventional tetrapolar impedance - 1. 3 (2 SD 6. 9) kg, skinfold thicknesses 0. 3 (2 SD 7. 4) kg, and BMI-based formulas - 0. 2 (2 SD 9. 0) kg and - 0. 6 (2 SD 8. 5) kg), but the agreement was poorer than for 'reference' methods to measure body fat (density 0. 2 (2 SD 3. 7) kg, total body water - 0. 9 (2 SD 3. 4) kg and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 0. 1 (2 SD 5. 0) kg). The present paper also describes the derivation of a new prediction equation for the calculation of body composition from the Tanita body-fat analyser. The equation incorporates sex, age, and a log-transformation of height, weight and the measured impedance to predict body fat measured by a four-compartment model. This approach is recommended in the derivation of other prediction equations in body composition analysis. Using this novel prediction equation the <b>residual</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> were 4. 8 % for men and 3. 3 % for women.

All three brisket sites were poor predictors of side fat weight and side fat percentage. The other four sites were of approximately equal accuracy in predicting side fat percentage, with <b>residual</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> of: M. biceps femoris, 2. 81 %; sacral crest, 3. 07 %; 10 th rib, 3. 12 %; and 12 th rib, 2. 81 %.
