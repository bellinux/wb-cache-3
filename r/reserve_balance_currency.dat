The BEAC has created a framework of longer-term savings funds but due to low remuneration and other factors usage has remained limited. The paper also argues that regional savings in the form of reserve accumulation must be sufficient to ensure the stability of the common currency. While the current level of common foreign reserves may now be appropriate, maintaining an adequate level calls for a link between country-specific savings decisions and the setting of a regional reserve target. Strengthening and diversifying reserve management will also be desirable, a process the BEAC has embarked upon.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that uncompensated <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> act like a tax on banks and that banks as a result expend scarce resources to avoid holding them. The Fed itself has historically supported legislation to enable it to pay interest on <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> (e. g., Kohn 2003), as have economists (e. g., Goodfriend 2002), both for reasons of economic efficiency and to improve the implementation of monetary policy. The traditional argument against interest payment has been that it would reduce the Fed’s earnings that are subsequently {{turned over to the}} Treasury (Feinman 1993 b; Abernathy 2003). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate the implications of paying interest on <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> on the daily operations of both the Fed and the Treasury. While the arguments here—for different reasons—generally are in favor of enabling the Fed to pay interest on <b>reserve</b> <b>balances,</b> more important than the actual payment of such interest is the perspective gained when considering in detail the operations of both in an environment where <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> earn interest...|$|R

The quantity of <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> circulating, or the relative size of the Fed's operations, is also unrelated to its influence on other interest rates.

40|$|With {{the use of}} nontraditional policy tools, {{the level}} of <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> has risen {{significantly}} in the United States since 2007. Before the financial crisis, <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> were roughly $ 20 billion whereas the level has risen well past $ 1 trillion. The effect of <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> in simple macroeconomic models often comes through the money multiplier, affecting the money supply {{and the amount of}} bank lending in the economy. Most models currently used for macroeconomic policy analysis, however, either exclude money or model money demand as entirely endogenous, thus precluding any causal role for reserves and money. Nevertheless, some academic research and many textbooks continue to use the money multiplier concept in discussions of money. We explore the institutional structure of the transmission mechanism beginning with open market operations through to money and loans. We then undertake empirical analysis of the relationship among <b>reserve</b> <b>balances,</b> money, and bank lending. We use aggregate as well as bank-level data in a VAR framework and document that the mechanism does not work through the standard multiplier model or the bank lending channel. In particular, if the level of <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> is expected {{to have an impact on}} the economy, it seems unlikely that a standard multiplier story will explain the effect.

40|$|To {{combat the}} {{financial}} crisis that intensified {{in the fall of}} 2008, the Federal Reserve injected a substantial amount of liquidity into the banking system. The resulting increase in <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> exerted downward price pressure in the federal funds market, and the effective federal funds rate began to deviate from the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee. In response, the Federal Reserve revised its operational framework for implementing monetary policy and began to pay interest on <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> in an attempt to provide a floor for the federal funds rate. Nevertheless, following the policy change, the effective federal funds rate remained below not only the target but also the rate paid on <b>reserve</b> <b>balances.</b> We develop a model to explain this phenomenon and use data from the federal funds market to evaluate it empirically.

40|$|Sometime in mid September 2008, the Federal Reserve began {{creating}} {{money at}} an amazingly rapid pace. For the week ending September 10, {{banks and other}} depository institutions held $ 8 billion in deposits at the Fed. By the week ending December 31, 2008, they held $ 848 billion. Such deposits are commonly called “reserve balances. ” They are the key component—along with currency—of base money or central bank money which the Federal Reserve is responsible for controlling. Hence, the Fed had increased the supply of <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> by 100 -fold {{in a very short}} period of time. Although the reasons for the unprecedented increase are complex, it is important to try to understand them and explain them as simply as possible. To do so one must delve into the details of the Federal <b>Reserve’s</b> <b>balance</b> sheet and sort out the forces likely to shift the supply and demand for <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> in a financial crisis. In this paper I use a series of graphs to show what happened to the major items on the balance sheet during this period and then identify the key factors underlying the increase in <b>reserve</b> <b>balances.</b> I show that the increase came about as a direct result of the Fed’s decision to purchase securities and make loans to certain sectors and institutions.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{the level of}} {{required}} balances held by depository institutions in the United States has declined dramatically. The decline in <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> has fueled a debate {{over the role of}} reserve requirements. On the one hand, proponents of reserve requirements argue that low <b>reserve</b> <b>balances</b> may complicate monetary policy operations and increase short-term interest rate volatility. On the other hand, critics of reserve requirements argue that lower reserve requirements remove a distortionary tax on depository institutions and need not complicate monetary policy operations.; In this article, the authors examine how three countries - Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand conduct monetary policy without using reserve requirements. The experience of these three countries provides insight into the linkages between the payments system and monetary policy and into the connection between reserve requirements and interest rate volatility.

40|$|This paper {{expands the}} {{discussion}} about future <b>balancing</b> <b>reserve</b> provision to the long-term perspective of 2050. Most pathways for a transformation towards a decarbonized electricity sector rely on very high shares of fluctuating renewables. This {{can be a challenge}} for the provision of <b>balancing</b> <b>reserves,</b> although their influence on the balancing cost is unclear. Apart from the transformation of the generation portfolio, various technical and regulatory developments within the balancing framework might further influence balancing costs: i) dynamic dimensioning of <b>balancing</b> <b>reserves,</b> ii) provision by fluctuating renewables or new (battery) storage technologies, and iii) exchange of <b>balancing</b> <b>reserves</b> between <b>balancing</b> zones. The first part of this paper discusses and transforms these developments into quantitative scenario definitions. The second part applies these scenarios to dynELMOD (dynamic Electricity Model), an investment model of the European electricity system that is extended to include <b>balancing</b> <b>reserve</b> provision. In contrast to other models applied in most papers on <b>balancing</b> <b>reserves,</b> this model is capable of evaluating the interdependencies between developments in <b>balancing</b> <b>reserve</b> provision and high shares of fluctuating renewables jointly. The results show that <b>balancing</b> <b>reserve</b> cost can be kept at current levels for a renewable electricity system until 2050, when using a dynamic reserve sizing horizon. Apart from the sizing horizon, storage capacity withholding duration and additional balancing demand from RES are the main driver of balancing costs. Renewables participation in balancing provision is mainly important for negative reserves, while storages play an important role for the provision of positive reserves. However, only on very few occasions, additional storage investments are required for <b>balancing</b> <b>reserve</b> provision, as most of the time sufficient storage capacities are available in the electricity system...|$|R
