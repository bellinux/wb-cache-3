25|$|Civil {{partnerships}} must be solemnised by an authorised marriage officer. Government officials (primarily magistrates and Home Affairs civil servants) who {{are appointed}} as marriage officers under the Marriage Act are also automatically appointed to solemnise civil partnerships. <b>Religious</b> <b>marriage</b> officers may not solemnise civil partnerships. (They may, however, solemnise marriages under the Civil Union Act.)

25|$|Isabella did {{not leave}} Portugal for another eight weeks. Her father had a fleet and trousseau {{prepared}} and on 19 October 1429, with a flotilla of about 20 ships, Isabella—accompanied by almost 2000 Portuguese—left Portugal forever. After an eleven-week journey when the fleet was beset by storms, causing the loss of several ships and much of her bridal trousseau, the convoy reached Sluys on 25 December 1429. The Duchess disembarked the following day where she and Philip celebrated their formal <b>religious</b> <b>marriage</b> two weeks later, on 7 January 1430.|$|E
25|$|Israeli matrimonial law {{is still}} {{based on the}} Millet system {{employed}} in the Ottoman Empire, which was not modified during the British Mandate and remains in force. Marriages in each religious community are {{under the jurisdiction of}} its own religious authority. Israeli couples who for any reason are unable or unwilling to contract a <b>religious</b> <b>marriage</b> often opt to get married in neighboring Cyprus, given that civil, interfaith and same-sex marriages entered into abroad are recognised by the Israeli state. Republic of Cyprus is ranked as the first or second destination for Israeli civil wedding, alongside Prague.|$|E
25|$|From 1828 to 1829, Leopold had a several-months long {{affair with}} the actress Caroline Bauer, who bore a {{striking}} resemblance to Charlotte. Caroline was a cousin of his advisor Christian Friedrich Freiherr von Stockmar. She came to England with her mother and took up residence at Longwood House, a few miles from Claremont House. But, by mid-1829, the liaison was over, and the actress and her mother returned to Berlin. Many years later, in memoirs published after her death, she declared that she and Leopold had engaged in a morganatic marriage and that he had bestowed upon her the title of Countess Montgomery. He would have broken this marriage when the possibility arose that he could become King of Greece. The son of Freiherr von Stockmar denied that these events ever happened, and indeed no records have been found of a civil or <b>religious</b> <b>marriage</b> with the actress.|$|E
25|$|After 2004 many {{of these}} {{statistics}} were discontinued.

Similarly, statistics of <b>religious</b> <b>marriages</b> only give separate figures for the two largest denominations, Roman Catholics and Anglicans.|$|R

25|$|According to the Nazi family value attitude, {{the husband}} was {{regarded}} {{the head of}} a family. Thus people living in a mixed marriage were treated differently according to the sex of the Aryan spouse and according to the religious affiliation of the children, their being or not being enrolled with a Jewish congregation. Nazi-termed mixed marriages were often not interfaith marriages, because in many cases the classification of one spouse as non-Aryan was only due to her or his grandparents being enrolled with a Jewish congregation or else classified as non-Aryan. In many cases both spouses had a common faith, either because the parents had already converted or because at marrying one spouse converted to the religion of the second (marital conversion). Traditionally the wife used to be the convert. However, in urban areas and after 1900, actual interfaith marriages occurred more often, with interfaith marriages legally allowed in some states of the German Confederation since 1847, and generally since 1875, when civil marriage became an obligatory prerequisite for any <b>religious</b> <b>marriage</b> ceremony throughout the united Germany.|$|E
25|$|Government {{marriage}} {{officers who}} have an objection of conscience to solemnising same-sex marriages may note this objection in writing to the Minister of Home Affairs, {{and if they do}} so they cannot be compelled to solemnise same-sex marriages. (This provision does not apply to <b>religious</b> <b>marriage</b> officers because they are in any case not obliged to solemnise a marriage that would violate the doctrines of their religion.) Several constitutional scholars have argued that this provision is unconstitutional, representing as it does state-sanctioned discrimination in violation of the right to equality. In September 2016, almost a decade after same-sex marriage was legalized in South Africa, the Department of Home Affairs released a list of marriage offices across the country that are willing to solemnise same-sex marriages. According to the list, of the 409 marriage offices only 117 (or 28.6%) are willing to do so. In Gauteng, 17 out of 57 offices said they would conduct same-sex marriages, 10 out of 59 in the Eastern Cape, 5 out of 28 in the Free State, 10 out of 58 in Mpumalanga, 16 out of 61 in Limpopo, 10 out of 34 in the Western Cape, 9 out of 22 in the Northern Cape, 29 out of 68 in KwaZulu-Natal and 10 out of 22 in North West. Following its release, Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba said the list {{was just one of the}} strategies that the Department had undertaken to resolve the issue, which include increasing sensitisation of Home Affairs officials and ensuring that LGBT people are treated respectfully and according to policies and laws by staff.|$|E
500|$|Mölders' {{supporters}} {{challenged the}} ruling, {{and pointed out}} that Mölders had been posted to Spain well after the bombing of Guernica. They pointed to his equivocal political attitude towards National Socialism and his unequivocal moral commitment to Catholicism. Not only {{did he have a}} Catholic <b>religious</b> <b>marriage</b> ceremony but Klawitter, regarded by the Third Reich as politically [...] "unreliable," [...] had performed the ceremony. Despite petitions from politicians and high-ranking active and retired servicemen, among them Horst Seehofer, Günther Rall and Jörg Kuebart, the Office for Military History (MGFA) noted that Mölders' membership in the Bund Neudeutschland did not provide sufficient evidence of his having been critical of the regime, but rather showed the contrary and [...] concluded that it was questionable whether Mölders had distanced himself enough from National Socialism before his death in 1941. [...] Consequently, the decision remained in force.|$|E
50|$|In many countries, {{there is}} a {{division}} between the civil and <b>religious</b> aspects of <b>marriages,</b> and often one realm does not recognize the acts of the other. In Australia and New Zealand, {{there has been a}} long tradition of recognising civil and <b>religious</b> <b>marriages</b> as equal before the law. The same legal procedures were (and are) required by clergy, state officials and independent civil celebrants.|$|R

500|$|Princess Alice met {{and fell}} in love with Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark (known as Andrea within the family), the fourth son of King George I and Queen Olga of Greece, while in London for King Edward VII's {{coronation}} in 1902. They married in a civil ceremony on 6 October 1903 at Darmstadt. The following day, there were two <b>religious</b> <b>marriage</b> ceremonies; one Lutheran in the Evangelical Castle Church, and one Greek Orthodox in the Russian Chapel on the Mathildenhöhe. She adopted the style of her husband, becoming [...] "Princess Andrew". The bride and groom were closely related to the ruling houses of the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, Denmark, and Greece; their wedding was one of the great gatherings of the descendants of Queen Victoria and Christian IX of Denmark held before World War I.|$|E

Only authorised (registered) marriage celebrants have the authority to perform marriages in Australia.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{early church}} members defined {{polygamy}} as [...] "celestial" [...] marriage, but [...] "celestial" [...] marriage now refers to marriages sealed in the temple.
