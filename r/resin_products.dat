In 1930, Distillers formed the British Industrial Solvents for production of acids and other solvents from industrial alcohol. In 1933, it formed Gyproc Products which was sold to British Plaster Board in 1944. In 1937, Distillers acquired British <b>Resin</b> <b>Products.</b> In 1939, it acquired a controlling stake in Commercial Solvents and 50% interest in BX Plastics, which full control was acquired in 1961.

5000|$|After 1890, the {{construction}} of railway tracks opened up the country. The forges closed down one by one but sawmills and distilleries of <b>resin</b> <b>products</b> multiplied.The renewal of Landes, desired by the Emperor Napoleon III, {{the arrival of the}} trains of the Mediterranean Railway Companies (from 1907 up to 1960), the trend of bathing in the sea inspired by the Empress Eugenie and the benefits of the sea air on the health of those with tuberculosis all aided in the rapid expansion of the seaside resort of Mimizan-Plage (first called Mimizan-les-Bains). The town is graced with a sea-bathing establishment constructed out of wood. This drew a number of tourists and contributed to the fame of Mimizan.One of the events to mark this period was the passage of a caravan named by the journalist and writer Maurice Martin and driven by Maurice Vignau and Alphonse Bacon. It traveled around Landes from Arcachon to trace a route for automobiles toward Biarritz. Maurice Martin was in awe of the beauty of the countryside (sky, ocean, forest) and would during a banquet on 20 March 1905 baptize the place [...] "La Côte d’Argent" [...] (The Silver Coast).|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{liquefaction}} {{with organic}} solvents {{is a unique}} thermochemical conversion process for biomass utilizations. It combines the useful functional groups from both biomass and organic solvents used in liquefaction, thus obtaining a large variety of polymers. This review {{is focused on the}} <b>resin</b> <b>products</b> synthesized from organic solvent liquefied biomass, including phenolic, polyurethane, epoxy, polyesters, etc. Many biomass species, such as wood, corn stover, waste paper, and wood bark, have been investigated as the feedstocks for liquefied biomass-based <b>resin</b> <b>products.</b> Phenol liquefied biomass was studied the most mainly based on expectation to utilize the aromatic structures of lignin in biomass as the substitute for phenol in phenolic resin synthesis. Further condensation reaction of phenol liquefied biomass with formaldehyde to synthesize novolac or resol phenolic resins was proven to be an efficient route to convert the un-reacted phenol from liquefaction to resins and improve the physical mechanical properties of the resulting resins. Except for phenolic resins, most other polymers from liquefied biomass were synthesized based on the utilization of hydroxyl groups in liquefied biomass. Polyhydric alcohols liquefied biomass was used as polyols to synthesize polyurethanes, epoxy, and polyesters. To achieve comparable mechanical strength of resulting <b>resin</b> <b>products,</b> the common liquefaction solvent to biomass ratio was 3 / 1, which indicates a biomass substitution around 25 % to petroleum raw materials. A few cases could reach 50 % substitution with biomass pretreatment before liquefaction. Three main concerns with the liquefied biomass-based resins were their relatively higher viscosities, highly hydrophilic characters, and relatively lower cross-linking density in cured resins.
