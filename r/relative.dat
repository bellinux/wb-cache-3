5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and <b>relative.</b> In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. <b>Relative</b> files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A <b>relative</b> record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. <b>Relative</b> files also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Relatives</b> play a {{vital role}} in caring for {{patients}} with severe mental illness but receive inadequate support from psychiatric services. Evidence suggests that although intensive case management is directed primarily at patients, <b>relatives</b> may benefit a's well. This study examined whether <b>relatives</b> of patients who were receiving intensive case management had more contact with mental health professionals than <b>relatives</b> of patients who were receiving standard case management. It also examined whether <b>relatives</b> of patients receiving intensive case management appraised caregiving less negatively and experienced less psychological distress than <b>relatives</b> of patients receiving standard case management. Methods: The sample was drawn from the pool of patients participating in the UK 700 randomized controlled trial of intensive case management. Prospective data on contact between case managers and the <b>relatives</b> of 146 patients were collected over a two-year period. At a two-year follow-up assessment, <b>relatives</b> of 116 patients were. interviewed with the Experience of Caregiving Inventory and the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire. Results: Considerably more <b>relatives</b> of patients receiving intensive case management had contact with a case manager during the study period than <b>relatives</b> of patients receiving standard case management (70 percent compared with 45 percent).

40|$|SUMMARY-Two {{groups of}} pedigrees were compared, one {{pertaining}} to cancer patients with family histories of neoplasms {{other than those}} of the breast (controls), and the other to breast cancer patients with family histories of breast cancer. First-degree <b>relatives</b> of breast cancer patients, excluding the affected <b>relatives</b> who led to ascertainment of these patients, manifested a twofold to threefold higher breast cancer frequency than control <b>relatives,</b> a type of finding observed in past studies. The risks increased from 1. 8 - 3. 1 for <b>relatives</b> of patients with premenopausal diagnoses compared with control <b>relatives,</b> but no increase in risk was observed for <b>relatives</b> of patients with postmenopausal diagnosis. When the disease in the patient was bilateral, the risk for their <b>relatives</b> was fivefold in excess of controls, and if both premenopausal and bilateral, the risk was ninefold. The risks for <b>relatives</b> of patients with unilateral disease, whether premenopausal or postmenopausal, ranged from 1. 2 - 1. 8, only slightly higher than control values. <b>Relatives</b> of bilateral patients manifested a ninefold higher risk o...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The illness {{perceptions}} of the <b>relatives</b> of patients with functional neurological symptom disorders (FNSDs) and their relation to the illness {{perceptions of}} the patients have been little studied. We aimed to compare illness perceptions of <b>relatives</b> of patients with FNSDs with those held by patients themselves. We used control pairs with neurological diseases (NDs) to examine the specificity of the findings to FNSDs. Material and methods: Patients with FNSDs (functional limb weakness and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures) and patients with NDs causing limb weakness and epilepsy, {{as well as their}} <b>relatives,</b> completed adapted versions of the Illness Perception Questionnaire - Revised (IPQ-R). Results: We included 112 pairs of patients with FNSDs and their <b>relatives</b> and 60 pairs of patients with NDs and their <b>relatives.</b> <b>Relatives</b> of patients with FNSDs were more likely to endorse psychological explanations and, in particular, stress as causal factors than patients with FNSDs (p. <. 001). <b>Relatives</b> of patients with FNSDs were also more pessimistic about the expected duration of the disorder and perceived a greater emotional impact compared with patients themselves (p. <. 001). However, the latter two differences between patients and <b>relatives</b> were also found in pairs of patients with NDs and their <b>relatives.</b> Conclusion: The main difference in illness perceptions between <b>relatives</b> and patients that appeared specific to FNSDs was a tendency for <b>relatives</b> to see psychological factors as more relevant compared with patients. Some other differences were observed between pairs of patients with FNSDs and their <b>relatives,</b> but the same differences were also seen in pairs of patients with NDs and their <b>relatives.</b> These other differences were, therefore, not specific to FNSDs. Discussion about possibly relevant psychological factors with patients suffering from FNSDs may be helped by including <b>relatives...</b>|$|R

Aims This study presents the views of <b>relatives</b> on how to design a supported self-management intervention for <b>relatives.</b> Method Four focus groups were carried out and <b>relatives</b> were asked for {{their views on the}} content, format, support required, likely barriers and potential impact on the outcome of a self-management toolkit. Results <b>Relatives</b> were generally very positive about the development of a toolkit. <b>Relatives</b> had clear ideas about the design, emphasising particularly that it needs to be comprehensive, modular, supported and able to translate general information into the specific detail they require for their family member. Many of the ideas informed the development of <b>Relatives</b> Education And Coping Toolkit. Some suggestions, such as multiple modes of delivery, earlier access to the toolkit in primary care and peer support from other <b>relatives,</b> were not possible in this study but should be considered for future development.
