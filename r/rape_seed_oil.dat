40|$|This Licentiate thesis {{deals with}} {{small-scale}} extraction of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> {{and the use}} of this oil in an Elsbett engine tractor. Small-scale extraction of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> was studied in practical tests in the laboratory at Ultuna, Uppsala. The influence of the speed of the press screw, nozzle size and nozzle performance, the distance between the press screw and the press chamber head, the ambient temperature, and preheating of the seed with air was studied. At Sjösa farm a small plant for on-farm extraction of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> was built. The processing of three bigger batches of oil seed was studied. Data of interest were registered in an operating log. Capacity and oil extraction efficiency were studied. A tractor with an Elsbett engine was operated at Sjösa farm on the processed <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> Data of interest were registered in an operating log and with an automatic data collection system. The data obtained on the farm were used to conduct an energy analysis. The oil press has higher capacity with bigger nozzles and higher screw speeds. However, the amount of oil extracted from each seed increased if the nozzles were smaller and/or the press screw speed was lower. Nozzles with a long press nozzle channel gave a more solid meal. It was important that the temperature in the press chamber head reached a temperature of about 70 °C. The optimum seed moisture content (wet basis) was 7 - 8 per cent. Preheating with air usually improved the capacity, but there is a risk of over-drying so it must be done with care. Preheated seed involves a risk of getting too high levels of phosphorus in the oil. On the farm, the simplest way of cleaning the oil is settling. This can be done in three series-coupled sedimentation tanks. If the ambient temperature is + 20 °C and the settling height is 0. 6 m, about 18 days are needed for the settling. A tractor with an Elsbett engine can be operated almost {{in the same way as}} a conventional tractor. The differences are <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> fuel, separate starting fuel, more frequent fuel filter exchange, electrical heating of the fuel system and about 10 per cent higher fuel consumption. Problems may occur when the <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> stiffens at - 15 °C. To obtain a good energy balance it is important to have a high yield and low moisture contents. It is important also to have uses for the meal and straw. Direct seeding also improves the energy balance. The main conclusion of the project is that a system involving <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and the Elsbett engine works well technically. The system is not, however, competitive as there are cheap fossil fuels on the market, and the Elsbett engine has not yet entered serial production. In addition, the supply of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> in Sweden is limited, and the oil produced could be used for better purposes than as vehicle fuel...|$|E

It is believed that biodiesel is a carbon-neutral solution, since the combustion of biodiesel generates {{the same amount of}} greenhouse gases (GHGs) as those which have been absorbed by plants [2]. Petroleum diesel, produced from fossil fuel that stocks carbon for millions of years, is generally not recyclable. In Hong Kong, biodiesel is made from a multi-feedstock that includes waste cooling oil, grease waste, palm fatty acid and animal fat.

40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>seed</b> {{production}} {{has an important}} role in human nutrition and industry. Success in oil plant cultivation is related to seed production with high viability and rapid germination, because these seeds rapidly loose their viability by fats oxidation. Thus, in this work we studied the effects of ascorbic acid, pyridoxine and hydrogen peroxide solutions on germination quantitative traits, catalase activity, protein and malondialdehyde content of three old <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> (sunflower, <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> and safflower). The results showed that ascorbic acid and pyridoxine stimulated significantly the sunflower and <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> germination. These vitamins, however, didn't have any effect on safflower germination. Hydrogen peroxide strongly increased safflower germination. Ascorbic acid and pyridoxine decreased catalase activity in sunflower and <b>rape</b> <b>seed,</b> whereas hydrogen peroxide increased it. Ascorbic acid and pyridoxine prevented protein degradation and lipid peroxidation in germinated seeds. Consequently, we understand that ascorbic acid and pyridoxine can increase sunflower and <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> germination and stimulate rate of growth. Also safflower germination increased due to germination inhibitor oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. In conclusion, this report shows that <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> treated with ascorbic acid, pyridoxine and hydrogen peroxide remarkably increase the capacity of germination. We suggest that treatments with such substances can improve the old <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> germination during storage...|$|R

40|$|Feed for {{rainbow trout}} {{aquaculture}} {{has traditionally been}} based on marine resources such as fish meal and fish oil. Because of a shortage of marine resources {{as well as the}} growing production of farmed fish, the feed industry has been forced to partially exchange fish meal protein with proteins derived from plants, like soy bean meal. This has been shown to affect the salmonid intestinal mucosa, and in addition, plant-based dietary proteins have been associated with changes in disease susceptibility in salmon and {{it has been suggested that}} these special diet types weakens the immune status of the fish. One major cause for losses in Danish freshwater fish farms is the fry disease rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS), caused by the bacterium Flavobacterium psychrophilum, and experiences of the fish farmers suggest that the diet type is an important factor for disease development. Enteric redmouth disease caused by Yersinia ruckeri is also an economically important disease which causes problems in rainbow trout fry as well as larger fish. Rainbow trout were fed from first-feeding with five different diets; diet A with marine fish oil (conventional fry diet), diet B (an organic version of A), diet C with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (like B but with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> exchanging marine fish oil), diet C with pea protein (like B but added pea protein) and diet E with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and pea protein.

Before and after infection, samples were taken from internal organs including the intestine for traditional bacteriology and only intestinal samples for next generation sequencing. The cumulative mortalities among the diet groups did not differ between groups in either of the two infection trials, suggesting that the diets did not have different effects on the immune status of the fish, when it comes to survival after infection, meaning that plant content did not seem to weaken the immune status of the rainbow trout fry.

40|$|In the {{cultivation}} of rape, the <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> must {{be regarded as a}} important factor as well as the seed yield. This studies aimed to research the basic materials in relation to cultivating technic and breeding for the increase of oil production, and were concerned with the ecological changes of the <b>oil</b> formation in <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> under various conditions during seed development. I. Relation of oil formation to the morphological development of seed under several condition (1) In autumn <b>seeded</b> <b>rape,</b> <b>oil</b> formation was accelerated especially in later half period during seed development, and continued untill 55 days after flowering when dry weight of seed reached maximum. Iodine value and refractive index of <b>oil</b> decreased as <b>seed</b> matured. (2) The flowering period continued for about a month in autumn <b>seeded</b> <b>rape,</b> and therefore, as flowering was later, the rate of development of pod, seed and embryo and of oil formation became more rapidly. But <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> was lower in later flowering. It was confirmed that iodine value of <b>oil</b> decreased as <b>seed</b> matured. (3) In spring <b>seeded</b> <b>rape</b> at the high land, the rate of <b>seed</b> development and <b>oil</b> formation was extremly promoted because of high temperature even at the early stage of seed development. But the seed harvested had very low oil. Iodine value of oil, which was very low at the earliest stage of the oil formation, increased rapidly until the middle stage, and then decreased gradually. (4) It was clarified that <b>oil</b> formation in <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> was closely combined with the development of seed, especially of embryo or cotyledon in which oil was synthesized and accumulated. The difference in the change of iodine value between autumn and spring <b>seeded</b> <b>rapes</b> was discussed. It was suggested that percent constitution of each fatty acid during oil formation was both influenced by the environmental and hereditable factors. II. Influence of natural environmental conditions on the <b>oil</b> formation of <b>seed</b> (1) It was confirmed experimentally that high temperature during seed development decreased the yield and <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed.</b> (2) When 50 % of the natural sun light was shaded during <b>seed</b> development, <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> decreased about 10 %. Shading from 30 to 15 days before maturation most profoundly effected on the oil content and yield of seed. (3) Excessive soil moisture decreased both the oil content and yield of seed. Under dry condition of soil, oil content was not lower than under moderate condition, but seed yield decreaced remarkably. (4) Year variation of <b>oil</b> content in <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> was evident in similar variety at similar station. Relationship between this variation and weather condition of each year was discussed. Relatively low temperature, much sunshine and moderate precipitation during seed development may be favourable both for the high yield and the high <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed.</b> III. Influence of cultivating conditions on the <b>oil</b> formation of <b>seed</b> (1) <b>Oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> was low on the area of high soil productivity, and was high on the area of low soil productivity. There {{was no significant difference in}} oil content between areas where soil productivity was shown to be uniform. It was considerable that available nitrogen was rich in such high productive soil. (2) With the increase of nitrogen application, seed yield increased and <b>oil</b> content of <b>seed</b> decreased. In this case, increased application of potassium fertilizer with nitrogen did not decreased the oil content.
