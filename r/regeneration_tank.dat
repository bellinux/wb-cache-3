5000|$|Some early {{attempts}} at creating cyborgs resulted in individuals with severe psychological problems. Since they are [...] "indestructible" [...] {{they are allowed}} to wander the world on specific missions for the Company. One, called Abdiel, services the <b>regeneration</b> <b>tank</b> repositories where many immortals are kept. Abdiel is unable to retain new memories, and lives in a perpetual Now. Another, encountered by Kalugin in 19th century California, calls himself Courier, and performs that exact job for the Company. He cannot stay too long in one place because his short-term memory malfunctions and causes fits of rage. Later Kalugin encounters Nicoletta, a female Defective on a mission to [...] "take care of mortals", just before a worldwide pandemic reaches his location.|$|E
50|$|Reilly Tyne {{is the son}} of Ben Reilly (Spider-Man's clone) and Elizabeth Tyne. Before {{he reached}} his teens, his {{inherited}} powers began to manifest but brought with them clonal degeneration. Kaine, the degenerated first clone of Peter Parker, found him, and placed him within a <b>regeneration</b> <b>tank</b> to slow the process. Kaine's efforts were for two goals: to resurrect Daredevil, who had previously died saving Kaine, and to heal Tyne. Kaine summoned the demon Zarathos, which attempted to possess Tyne, but he was saved by the soul of Daredevil, who drove out Zarathos, although both Daredevil's soul and a piece of the demon remained within Tyne, and he was left with a demonic appearance and certain demonic abilities. Through meditation and concentration, Tyne eventually learned to project a human appearance, but he now looked to be in his twenties, almost twice his actual age. Following in both of Daredevil's paths, he studied law and became an attorney, while taking on a costume bearing a resemblance to Daredevil's and using his demonic abilities to fight crime as Darkdevil. He apparently has access to at least some of Daredevil's memories, since he knows Spider-Man's secret identity.|$|E
50|$|However, {{recently}} a <b>tank</b> <b>regeneration</b> movement initiated by communities and non-governmental organisations (NGO) has arisen. Today, {{there are approximately}} 120,000 small-scale tanks, irrigating about 41,200 kmÂ² in semi-arid areas of India. This constitutes about {{one third of the}} total irrigated land in South India.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{identifies the}} roles and responsibilities of the project team members and identifies the project scope, schedule, and cost reporting activities for a maintenance activity to remove and dispose of three inactive liquid low-level radioactive waste (LLLW) system tanks and to isolate and fill one LLLW tank with grout. Tanks 3001 -B, 3004 -B, and T- 30 are located in concrete vaults and tank 3013 is buried directly in the soil. The maintenance project consists of cutting the existing pipes attached to the tanks; capping the piping to be left in place; removing the tanks and filling the vaults with grout for tanks 3001 -B, 3004 -B, and T- 30; and filling tank 3013 with grout. Because the LLLW line serving tank 3001 -B will be needed for discharging the 3001 canal demineralizer back flush and <b>regeneration</b> waste to <b>tank</b> WC- 19, tank 3001 -B will be replaced with a section of piping...|$|R
