En ambos experimentos, el filtrado procedente de la quinta extracción mostró una disminución en el contenido de polifenoles de 7650 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> – 1 a 3610 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> – 1 en el alpechín obtenido mediante el sistema tradicional y de 3852 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> – 1 a 1351 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> – 1 en el alpechín del sistema continuo. La demanda química de oxígeno del alpechín del sistema tradicional disminuyó de 110200 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> – 1 a 52400 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> – 1 en y de 41600 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> – 1 a 2300 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> – 1 en el procedente del sistema continuo. Una proporción en peso 5 : 1 de alpechín: Azolla fue la óptima tanto para la reducción de los polifenoles como para la de la DQO. La eficiencia del tratamiento biológico con alfalfa se comparó con la obtenida con Azolla. Los resultados indicaron que el tratamiento con alfalfa no dio lugar a la reducción de los polifenoles ni de la DQO. </font...|$|R

In the second experiment, nodal segments were placed on MS medium, plus vitamins, sucrose (15 g L - 1), agar (6. 5 g L - 1) and IAA (0 and 0. 01 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> - 1) in combination with KIN, TDZ or ZEA at 0, 0. 64, 1. 25, 2. 50, 5. 0, 10. 0 and 20. 0 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> - 1. The combinations of NAA and BAP inhibited shoot-bud growth and maintenance of the apical dominance. High TDZ concentrations induced prolific shoot formation with {{the greatest number of}} axillary shoots, although with indefinite morphology in many cases. The combination of 0. 01 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> - 1 IAA and 5. 0 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> - 1 TDZ induced the most intense axillary shoot proliferation in SL, whereas 2. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> - 1 TDZ and 0. 01 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> - 1 IAA, combined with 1. 25 mL - 1 TDZ, were most effective for adventitious shoot-bud differentiation.

40|$|Yarrowia lipolytica is a {{suitable}} microbial platform to convert low-value hydrophobic substrates into microbial oils {{and other important}} metabolites. In this work, this yeast species was used to simultaneously synthetize ex novo lipids and produce citric acid and lipase from animal fat (pork lard) adding higher value to the low-cost fatty substrate. The effect of pH, lard concentration, arabic gum concentration and oxygen mass transfer rate (OTR) on lipids accumulation on Y. lipolytica batch cultures was assessed by an experimental design based on Taguchi method. OTR {{was by far the}} most influential parameter in the <b>range</b> of 96 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> 1 h 1 to 480 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> 1 h 1. A bio-modification of initial lipidic substrate was observed and, depending on the nutritional and operational conditions, specialty lipids with specific composition and high added-value were obtained. The unsaturated-to-saturated fatty acids ratio of these microbial lipids is higher than in initial substrate, which indicates that they are more suitable than animal fat for food additives. Moreover, the simultaneous induction of lipase and citric acid by Y. lipolytica growing in animal fat demonstrate that a biorefinery approach may be designed based on animal fat raw material.
