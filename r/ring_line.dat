5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} plans {{involving a}} rapid transit circle line in Oslo, connecting the newly built hospital Rikshospitalet {{with the rest}} of the city. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. In the local newspaper Aftenposten Aften there was a debate on whether there should be a <b>ring</b> <b>line</b> from Berg along the National Road 150 towards Gaustad over Rikshospitalet, or whether the Ullevål Hageby Line should be extended from John Colletts plass to Rikshospitalet, thereby creating a correspondence with the Sognsvann Line at the new station Forskningsparken. In the first plans, Berg was meant to be a station on the new <b>ring</b> <b>line.</b> This plan was discarded since local residents feared noise pollution and destroyed lawns. Even though Berg was not made a station on the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line,</b> noise shields were put up along the Sognsvann Line.|$|E
5|$|Lørensvingen, {{built in}} 2016, {{connected}} the Ring and Grorud Line. It splits from the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line</b> south of Sinsen, and run part in tunnel and part at-grade until it {{connects to the}} Grorud Line west of Økern. In the tunnel section the new station, Løren, was built. The day section runs parallel to part of the mainline Alnabru–Grefsen Line. The line allows metro trains to run directly from the Grorud Line to the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line,</b> and thus pass {{from east to west}} without passing through the packed Common Tunnel. It was part of the political compromise Oslo Package 3, completed by 2016.|$|E
5|$|North of Ullevål stadion, {{just before}} {{reaching}} Berg, the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line</b> with services 3 and 4 branches off. The <b>Ring</b> <b>Line</b> serves three stations, Nydalen, Storo and Sinsen {{before reaching the}} Grorud Line. From Berg to Tåsen, the line runs parallel to the motorway Ring 3. North of Berg, the Sognsvann Line mainly serves residential areas, including student dormitories at Sogn and Kringsjå. The Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and the National Archival Services of Norway is served by Sognsvann Station. The station also serves the recreational area Nordmarka and the lake Sognsvann.|$|E
50|$|Until the 28 May 2006, {{the line}} ran from Spindlersfeld to Gesundbrunnen. The line was {{shortened}} to Südkreuz to allow frequency {{improvements to the}} S41 and S42 <b>ring</b> <b>lines.</b> The line was shortened on December 11, 2011 to Hermannstraße and contains now 7 stations.|$|R

5|$|Nydalen is a {{rapid transit}} {{station on the}} <b>Ring</b> <b>Line</b> of the Oslo Metro. It is located at Nydalen in the Nordre Aker borough of Oslo, Norway. The station opened on 20 August 2003, {{as part of the}} first section of the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line</b> to Storo. The station is served by lines 4, 5 and 6 of the metro, as well as several local bus services. Artistic effort was put into the {{construction}} of the station, and the escalators were built into the Tunnel of Light exhibition. Close by the station is the BI Norwegian Business School (BI) campus and several large working places.|$|E
5|$|Sinsen is a {{rapid transit}} {{station on the}} <b>Ring</b> <b>Line</b> of the Oslo Metro. It is located at Sinsen in the Sagene borough of Oslo, Norway. Next to the station is the tram station Sinsenkrysset, that {{has been part of}} the Sinsen Line of the Oslo Tramway since 1939. The station opened on 20 August 2006, as part of the first section of the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line.</b> The station is served by line 6 of the metro, as well as several local bus services. Sinsen is a mixed {{residential}} and commercial area.|$|E
5|$|A report {{published}} by the city in 2007 declared the line a success and stated that all goals for the line had been exceeded. A {{survey conducted by the}} city in 2003 and 2007 showed that the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line</b> {{had a significant impact on}} the use of public transport in the area. Total public transport usage increased from 28 to 45%; use for commuting increased from 35 to 61%. At the Norwegian School of Management (BI), 85% of the students used public transport. The <b>Ring</b> <b>Line</b> reduced the estimated number of daily car trips by 10,000, and generated 11,000 more daily public transport trips. In 2007, daily passenger numbers at the stations were 8420 for Nydalen, 3630 for Storo and 2300 at Sinsen. The line allowed travel time from the Nydalen and Storo to the city centre to be halved, and travel time from Nydalen to the city center is faster by metro than by taxi.|$|E
40|$|Setting {{expansion}} of 4 phosphate-bonded investments was measured under 3 different conditions: a hygroscopic condition, a condition using a <b>ring</b> <b>lined</b> {{with a wet}} liner and a condition using a <b>ring</b> <b>lined</b> with a dry liner. Accuracy of castings of a Ni-Cr alloy made {{in each of the}} 4 investments in <b>rings</b> <b>lined</b> with a wet liner was measured. One investment exhibited negative potential for hygroscopic expansion. Expansion of all investments in wet-lined rings was not significantly different from their expansion under the hygroscopic condition. There {{was no significant difference in}} setting expansion between the investments when a wet liner was used. Significant differences in accuracy existed between castings produced in the different investments using a wet liner. The correlation between the setting {{expansion of}} the investments using a wet liner and the accuracy of castings produced using a wet liner was not high and was not significant. Comparison between investments with regard to their ability to produce accurate castings in terms of mould expansion by measurement of setting expansion is of no value...|$|R
50|$|Until the 28th of May 2006, {{the line}} ran from Königs Wusterhausen to Gesundbrunnen. The line was {{shortened}} to Westend to allow frequency {{improvements to the}} S41 and S42 <b>ring</b> <b>lines.</b> The shortened line contains 23 stations.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Line 11 was {{originally}} designed as an L-shaped line from Wanliu to Dahongmen, which {{together with the}} L-shaped Line 10, form a subway <b>ring</b> route. After <b>Line</b> 10 Phase II took over the entire <b>ring</b> route, <b>Line</b> 11 was displaced.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} {{plans to}} connect the Sognsvann Line to the Grorud Line with a new <b>Ring</b> <b>Line.</b> The company also considered building the ring {{as part of the}} tramway, and have combined operation with both tram and metro on the Sognsvann Line. This was later discarded, despite the higher investment costs with a metro, since the tramway would give higher operating costs and longer travel time. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It became clear that Berg would not be served by the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line.</b> Many neighbors to the Sognsvann Line complained about the proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line.|$|E
5|$|Line 5 {{operates}} the entire ring with a 15-minute headway. From east to west, trains on line 5 enter the common tunnel from the Grorud Line {{then make a}} full clockwise circle around the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line,</b> including a second pass of the common tunnel, before proceeding {{to the end of}} the Sognsvann Line.|$|E
5|$|Oslo {{maintains}} a street tram system with six lines, of which two are suburban lines. The street trams operate mostly within {{the borders of}} the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line,</b> providing a frequent service in the city centre, with lower average speeds but with more stops. There are major transfer points to the tramway at Majorstuen, Jernbanetorget, Jar, Storo and Forskningsparken.|$|E

5|$|The Sognsvann Line {{is served}} by lines 4 and 5 of the Oslo Metro. Half of line 5 trains operate {{the full length of}} the Sognsvann Line, while line 4 and {{the other half of the}} line 5 trains branch off after Ullevål stadion and serve the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line.</b> All {{services}} operate with a fifteen-minute headway, except during late evenings and weekend mornings. This gives the stations Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion an average five-minute headway to the city center and all stations in the Common Tunnel, and an average ten-minute headway to Nydalen and Storo. On the east side of the city, Line 5 connects with the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line,</b> and makes a full loop before it leaves Oslo on the Grorud Line. Line 4 connects with the Lambertseter Line. Travel time from Stortinget to Sognsvann is 18 minutes. The Oslo Metro is operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter.|$|E
5|$|The {{freight traffic}} {{to the central}} market at Alexanderplatz was carried by seven special trains per day, of which four ran at night, two {{during the day and}} one in the evening.

A few days later, on 24 October 1940, the extension to Makartplatz followed, and on 10 November 1940, the line was further extended, to Salzburg Hauptbahnhof. On 16 February 1942, the <b>ring</b> <b>lines</b> M and L (Maxglan-Lehen-Hauptbahnhof-Zentrum-Maxglan) came into operation.

The Grorud Line is planned {{be connected to the}} <b>Ring</b> <b>Line</b> via the Løren Line, allowing trains to run directly from Grorud to the Ring via a station at Løren. An extension has been proposed for the Furuset Line to Lørenskog, which would give stations at Visperud, Lørenskog Centre and a new terminus at Akershus University Hospital (Ahus). The travel time from Ahus to Jernbanetorget would be 27 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 1998, {{there was}} local {{political}} debate about how Rikshospitalet, that {{was moving to}} Gaustad, should be served by public transport. The state wanted to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway to the new hospital, while many local politicians {{wanted to use the}} rapid transit. Since the <b>Ring</b> <b>Line</b> would increase traffic on the Songsvann Line, moving the line was considered to better serve the hospital. In 1998, an agreement was reached whereby the light rail line would be built, and a new station for transfer from the metro would open at Forskningsparken.|$|E

40|$|As metro systems {{become more}} {{extensive}} they also become more complex, {{an analysis of}} the network shape and structure can be of substantive help for planners at early design stages to effectively evaluate multiple alternatives. This study compares the design scenarios of adding a typical circular <b>ring</b> metro <b>line</b> versus a novel alternative using two overlapping ellipse metro <b>line</b> <b>rings.</b> Ring metro <b>lines</b> {{have been found to be}} an important factor in network topology and the improvement of metro system network efficiency and reliability. A <b>ring</b> metro <b>line</b> can improve the connectivity and directness of a metro system network and thus improve transit by reducing mean travel time. A highly concentrated and dense central core surrounded by remote residential neighbourhoods, a monocentric city, would make circumferential travel less effective than in larger polycentric city with several sub-regional centres. Using Shanghai metro system 2017 as baseline, we consider the novel morphological alternative scenario of two overlapping ellipses and compare its relative performance to the more traditional <b>ring</b> metro <b>line,</b> by using graph theoretical topological and Euclidean centrality measures, otherwise known as’ closeness’ or ‘accessibility’ or ‘all to all’ mean distance. The comparison between the two scenarios shows that the two overlapping ellipse scenario is better at minimizing mean Topological distance, Mean Euclidean distance is well-correlated to actual travel time, The two-ellipse scenario leads to a reduction of 8 % of network mean topological distance, while a simple ring reduces it only by 0. 13 %...|$|R
