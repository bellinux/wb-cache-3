5|$|During {{this period}} Argentina's economy {{continued}} to grow, on average, but {{more slowly than}} {{the world as a}} whole or than its neighbours, Brazil and Chile. A suggested cause is that a multitude of frequently changed regulations, at times extended to ridiculous specifics (such as a 1947 decree setting prices and menus for restaurants), choked economic activity. The long-term effect was to create pervasive disregard for the law, which Argentines came to view as a hindrance to earning a living rather than an aid to enforcing legitimate property rights. The combination of industrial protectionism, <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> from the agrarian to the industrial sector, and growing state intervention in the economy sparked an inflationary process. By 1950, Argentina's GDP per capita accounted just nearly half of the United States.|$|E

We decompose the overall tax system {{in order to}} evaluate the contribution of rate, allowances, deductions, exemptions and credits. The structure given in Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, is applied to gross household incomes in 2002 (low growth year) and 2005 (high growth year). Our findings reveal that the reforms laid down in this Ordinance resulted in a greater <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>incomes.</b> The redistributive effect increases as we move from 2002 to 2005 tax assessment. Deductions for salaried tax payers contribute the most towards progressivity. This is different from countries with advanced taxation systems relying mainly on allowances followed by tax rate and exemptions. I...|$|R

2500|$|Hayek {{disapproved of}} the notion of 'social justice'. [...] He {{compared}} the market to a game in which 'there is no point in calling the outcome just or unjust' and argued that 'social justice is an empty phrase with no determinable content'; likewise [...] "the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question as to whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just has no meaning". He generally regarded government <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> or capital as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom: [...] "the principle of distributive justice, once introduced, would not be fulfilled until the whole of society was organized in accordance with it. This would produce a kind of society which in all essential respects would be the opposite of a free society." ...|$|E
2500|$|Healey was {{appointed}} Shadow Chancellor in April 1972 after Roy Jenkins resigned {{in a row}} over the European Economic Community (Common Market). At the Labour Party conference on 1 October 1973, he said, [...] "I warn you {{that there are going}} to be howls of anguish from those rich enough to pay over 75% on their last slice of earnings". In a speech in Lincoln on 18 February 1974, Healey went further, promising he would [...] "squeeze property speculators until the pips squeak." [...] He alleged that Lord Carrington, the Conservative Secretary of State for Energy, had made £10m profit from selling agricultural land at prices 30 to 60 times as high as it would command as farming land. When accused by colleagues including Eric Heffer of putting Labour's chances of winning the next election in jeopardy through his tax proposals, Healey said the party and the country must face the consequences of Labour's policy of the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> and wealth; [...] "That is what our policy is, the party must face the realities of it".|$|E
2500|$|Social {{spending}} was dramatically increased, particularly for housing, education, and health, while {{a major effort}} was made to redistribute wealth to poorer Chileans. As a result of new initiatives in nutrition and health, together with higher wages, many poorer Chileans were able to feed themselves and clothe themselves better than they had been able to before. Public access to the social security system was increased, while state benefits such as family allowances were raised significantly. The <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> enabled wage and salary earners to increase their share of national income from 51.6% (the annual average between 1965 and 1970) to 65% while family consumption increased by 12.9% {{in the first year of}} the Allende Government. In addition, while the average annual increase in personal spending had been 4.8% in the period 1965–70, it reached 11.9% in 1971. During the first two years of Allende’s presidency, state expenditure on health rose from around 2% to nearly 3.5% of GDP. According to Jennifer E. Pribble, this new spending [...] "was reflected not only in public health campaigns, but also in the construction of health infrastructure". Small programs targeted at women were also experimented with, such as cooperative laundries and communal food preparation, together with an expansion of child-care facilities.|$|E

But in actuality, poorer or smaller combatants often end up improving their position relative to richer or larger ones. This is the paradox of power.

2500|$|In {{each year}} since 1982, OASDI tax receipts, {{interest}} payments and other income have exceeded benefit payments and other expenditures, for example {{by more than}} $150 billion in 2004. As the [...] "baby boomers" [...] {{move out of the}} work force and into retirement, however, expenses will come to exceed tax receipts and then, after several more years, will exceed all OASDI trust income, including interest. At that point the system will begin drawing on its trust fund Treasury Notes, and will continue to pay benefits at the current levels until the Trust Fund is exhausted. In 2013, the OASDI retirement insurance fund collected $731.1 billion and spent $645.5 billion; the disability program (DI) collected $109.1 billion and spent $140.3 billion; Medicare (HI) collected $243.0 and spent $266.8 billion and Supplementary Medical Insurance, SMI, collected $293.9 billion and spent $307.4 billion. In 2013 all Social Security programs except the retirement trust fund (OASDI) spent more than they brought in and relied on significant withdrawals from their respective trust funds to pay their bills. The retirement (OASDI) trust fund of $2,541 billion is expected to be emptied by 2033 by one estimate as new retirees become eligible to join. The disability (DI) trust fund's $153.9 billion will be exhausted by 2018; the Medicare (HI) trust fund of $244.2 billion will be exhausted by 2023 and the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund will be exhausted by 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continues—even sooner if they increase. The total [...] "Social Security" [...] expenditures in 2013 were $1,360 billion dollars, which was 8.4% of the $16,200 billion GNP (2013) and 37.0% of the federal expenditures of $3,684 billion (including a $971.0 billion deficit). All other parts of the Social Security program: medicare (HI), disability (DI) and Supplemental Medical (SMI) trust funds are already drawing down their trust funds and are projected to go into deficit in about 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continue. As the trust funds are exhausted either benefits will have to be cut, fraud minimized or taxes increased. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, upward <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> is responsible for about 43% of the projected Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years.|$|E

60|$|Now {{it needs}} no Christ to {{convince}} anybody today that {{our system of}} distribution is wildly and monstrously wrong. We have million-dollar babies {{side by side with}} paupers worn out by a long life of unremitted drudgery. One person in every five dies in a workhouse, a public hospital, or a madhouse. In cities like London the proportion is very nearly one in two. Naturally so outrageous a distribution has to be effected by violence pure and simple. If you demur, you are sold up. If you resist the selling up you are bludgeoned and imprisoned, the process being euphemistically called the maintenance of law and order. Iniquity can go no further. By this time nobody who knows the figures of the distribution defends them. The most bigoted British Conservative hesitates to say that his king should be much poorer than Mr. Rockefeller, or to proclaim the moral superiority of prostitution to needlework on the ground that it pays better.

The policies worked in the 1950s precisely because the real income growth was there to support them.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of convergence and divergence in Spain over the period 1965 - 1995. We analyse {{the evolution of the}} per capita income distribution across Spanish provinces and estimate the effects on this evolution of factors such as private, human and public capital, and an industrialisation index. We show that after a period of absolute convergence over the 1960 s and early 1970 s, the provinces polarised (club convergence) during the 1980 s. This polarisation process preceded a period of divergence among clubs, which began to appear during the 1990 s. By estimating counterfactual densities, we show that private capital accumulation and education at graduate level can account for a relevant fraction of the actual dispersion and polarisation <b>of</b> <b>incomes.</b> We also find that public capital has reduced inequalities, especially in recent years, through <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> rather than by increasing productivity.

Hence, the corollary question concerns the conditions under which democracy is sustainable.
