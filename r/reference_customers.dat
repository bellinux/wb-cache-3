40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{phenomenon}} of <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> marketing in a business tobusiness (B to B) context. Although <b>customer</b> <b>references</b> are generally considered an important marketing and sales tool, the academic literature has paid surprisingly {{little attention to the}} phenomenon. The study suggests that <b>customer</b> <b>references</b> could be viewed as important marketing assets for industrial suppliers, and the ability to build, manage and leverage <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> portfolios systematically constitutes a relevant marketing capability. The role of <b>customer</b> <b>references</b> is examined {{in the context of the}} industrial suppliers' shift towards a solution and project orientation and in the light of the on going changes in the project business. Suppliers in several industry sectors are undergoing a change from traditional equipment manufacturing towards project and solution oriented business. It is argued in this thesis that the high complexity, the project oriented nature and the intangible service elements that characterise many contemporary B to B offerings further increase the role of <b>customer</b> <b>references.</b> The study proposes three mechanisms of <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> marketing: status transfer, validation through testimonials and the demonstration of experience and prior performance. The study was conducted in the context of Finnish B to B process technology and information technology companies. The empirical data comprises 38 interviews with managers of four case companies, 165 <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> descriptions gathered from six case companies' Web sites, as well as company internal material. The findings from the case studies show that <b>customer</b> <b>references</b> have various external and internal functions that contribute to the growth and performance of B to B firms. Externally, <b>customer</b> <b>references</b> bring status transfer effects from reputable customers, concretise and demonstrate complex solutions, and provide indirect evidence of experience, previous performance, technological functionality and delivered customer value. They can also be leveraged internally to facilitate organisational learning and training, advance offering development, and motivate personnel. Major reference projects create new business opportunities and can be used as a vehicle for strategic change. The findings of the study shed light on the on going changing orientations in the project business environment, increase understanding of the variety of ways in which <b>customer</b> <b>references</b> can be deployed as marketing assets, and provide a framework of the relevant tasks and activities related to building, managing and leveraging a firm's <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> portfolio. The findings contribute to the industrial marketing research, to the literature on marketing assets and capabilities and to the literature on projects and solutions. The proposed functions and mechanisms of <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> marketing bring a more thorough and structured understanding about the essence and characteristics of the phenomenon and give a wide ranging view of the role of <b>customer</b> <b>references</b> as marketing assets for B to B firms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} how <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> of new ventures contribute to initiation of customer relationships. In particular {{the relationship between the}} new venture and its initial reference customer will be investigated. This relationship will be investigated within a network approach and {{from the perspective of the}} new venture. The idea that <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> play an important part in business marketing is generally taken for granted; yet there is limited reported academic research on the phenomenon. Prior research has focused on their use, effectiveness and reference activities (Salminen and Moller, 2006); internal learning from <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> (Ruokolainen, 2004; Ruokolainen, 2005; Ruokolainen and Mäkelä, 2007; Ruokolainen, 2008) and contextual factors that influence the benefits of the reference customer (Aarikka-Stenroos and Makkonen, 2014). Limited research however has been devoted to how the nature of the relationship between the new venture and the reference customer influence further initiation processes. This thesis will contribute to this gap by investigating the nature of the reference customer relationships with the new ventures, to understand how these <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> contribute in initiation processes and to understand how the initial reference customer relationship is connected with the further customer relationship pattern of new ventures. Three research questions are designed to contribute to the purpose of the master thesis. The first research question examines the nature relationship between the new venture and the reference customer with the aim of understanding understands how this initial reference customer has contributed to further customer relationships. The second research question aims to understand how <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> contribute to the initiation of customer relationships. This research question incorporate aspects such as actor and industry characteristics, as well as the nature of the product. The final research is concerned with the new venture s customer relationship pattern and how the initial reference customer influences this. Combined, these research questions will contrite to understanding how <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> of new ventures contribute to initiation of customer relationships. The thesis is carried out by two different sets of data. The first set is the literature review developed and presented by Husefest (2015), which presents relevant theory as well as a conceptual framework that capture the relevant phenomenon. The second set is the empirical data collection gathered through semi-structured interviews. The interviews were held in Spring 2016 by the author of this thesis. The interviewees were representatives from the new ventures, either through the role as the CEO or the Sales Director. The case interviews were selected based on four criteria. The results of the analysis provide a foundation for understanding the factors that influence the reference customer and the customer development of new ventures. The thesis has found that the initial <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> often are established within the new ventures network, based on either professional or social ties. The nature of the relationship is closely connected to the whether the relationship is initiated based on social or professional relations as well as the nature of the product. Relationships based on social ties are found to include products with low risks connected to implementation, and there is a larger degree of a personal layer to the relation. Relationships with are higher risks connected to implementation of the product view the personal relations as less important. These are still characterized by a high degree of commitment and trust due to interdependence and the need to being long-term customers. The contribution of the <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> are closely connected to the industry of which they operate and the nature of the product, and the potential customers are concerned with elements due to these aspects. The thesis has also found a strong connection to the initial reference customer and further customer relationships. New venture recreates a reference customer strategy based on the experiences from the entry market when entering a new market. Thee experiences are strongly connected with their initial reference customer. In conclusion, the initial reference customer relationship is important for both acquiring a potential new customer, but just as much for the strategic customer acquisition strategy of the new venture. The thesis provides several implications for the new ventures. The main implication lies in the new venture s initial network, whether they are connected with actors with potential opportunities for the new venture. It is suggested that new ventures devote time to develop their social as well as professional network in order to easier recognize opportunities. New ventures are also suggested to devote energy to learn as much as possible about sales processes and industry knowledge, as well as internal capabilities such as sales arguments and customer needs within the initial reference customer relationship. The study does however show that there is room for improvements within the theoretical area of the phenomenon, and recommend that further research continue to add to the research on <b>reference</b> <b>customers.</b> Particularly the author recommends that the research is investigated through the perspective on the reference customer and/or the next potential customers in addition to the new venture, in order to understand their perspective and perception on the phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{technology}} adoption/diffusion model {{is widely used}} {{as a framework for}} explaining and predicting the adoption of innovations attention for the specific circumstances under which innovators adopt radical new products from new technology ventures is scant and represents a gap in the literature. At the earliest stage of development of an innovation, product categorization may still be open for discussion, technical and social norms still absent, and the survival of the new technology venture may be uncertain. As a result, innovator-customers face the difficult and rather lonely task of evaluating a fuzzy innovation and innovation context. Based on these observations we aim to extend adoption theory to better fit this early stage of market diffusion by developing a framework that explains the role of <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> and opinion leaders in innovator customers' adoption process. Drawing on a socio-cognitive perspective of the marketplace and organizational ecology we explain the mechanisms at work and use information seeking theory to develop propositions for future testing.

40|$|Aim: The first {{customer}} {{is important because}} that it’s {{in many cases the}} only objective evidence that your product or service works in real life and that someone is willing to pay for it. The first {{customer is}} your first reference.   The aim of this study is to: Investigate how 7 start-up companies in the ICT-business developed reference. Establishing recommendations on what to focus on when creating <b>reference</b> <b>customers.</b> Present complementary recommendations for start-up companies regarding important factors, besides those investigated against the theory, which have been discovered to be important when building a successful company.   Method: The method in this study is a combination of a case study and cross-sectional study with qualitative data. The questions in the interviews were predefined and complemented with open ended questions according to the answers on the pre-defined questions. The data collected, the answers, were written down, summarized and analyzed regarding whether they did or did not support the theoretical statements investigated. A theoretical statement could be supported or not supported, partially or strongly   Result & Conclusions: The access to a professional network and good social skills are most important when establishing the first reference. Business skills can be developed during the process but the recommendation is to acquire or secure them as soon as possible. How to achieve the desired states has also been concluded.   Suggestions for future research: The largest limitation is the sample size of the data. Less than 10 companies were interviewed and some of the suggested statements can’t be significantly either confirmed or deferred. The study was also limited to one round of interviews. A study, with two rounds of interviews and a larger set of companies interviewed is suggested for further research. An extended study could also cover companies that didn’t survive the IT crash of 2000 and investigate if the suggested parameters and strategies were present and deployed or implemented.       Contribution of the thesis: The investigation has verified the importance of networks, customer type (brand name) and social capital when establishing a reference. It has also showed that the skills needed to develop a business doesn’t need to be present when company is established since it can be acquired and secured during the development of the first reference. It has also contributed with a set of recommendation for entrepreneurs in general not only regarding the establishment of <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> where the most important recommendation is to build and maintain the personal and professional networks...|$|E
