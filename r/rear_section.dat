5|$|Several species coined in genera {{other than}} Allosaurus are also now {{thought to be}} synonymous with A. fragilis. Labrosaurus ferox was named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a {{prominent}} gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is recognized as most likely a specimen of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|The combi model, the 747-200M, {{could carry}} freight in the <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> {{of the main}} deck via a side cargo door. A {{removable}} partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front. The -200M could carry up to 238 passengers in a three-class configuration with cargo carried on the main deck. The model was {{also known as the}} 747-200 Combi. As on the -100, a stretched upper deck (SUD) modification was later offered. A total of 10 converted 747-200s were operated by KLM. Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) also had two aircraft converted.|$|E
5|$|The tank used in {{the film}} is a {{modified}} M5A1 Stuart. It was purchased from the government of Peru about twelve years prior to filming and had already been used in several films. Among numerous modifications made for Tank Girl, the tank's 37mm anti-tank gun {{was covered with a}} modified flag pole to give the appearance of a 105mm gun. An entire 1969 Cadillac Eldorado was added onto the tank, with the <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> welded at the back and the fender welded to the front.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> are the Kuroshoin (Inner Audience Chamber) and Shiroshoin (Shogun's living quarters).|$|R
50|$|The GMT800 {{introduced}} a three section frame system, {{which could be}} mixed and matched depending on the wheelbase, GVWR, and body type fitted to the platform, rather than a single piece long frame. The front section was hydroformed. The middle and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> were roll formed or stamped, depending on application. This gives greater flexibility to the platform. A total of four front modules, seven midsections, and four <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> were created to mix and match for nearly 40 different truck configurations.|$|R

5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1943, Mutsu was moored at Hashirajima {{when the}} {{magazine}} of her No. 3 turret exploded at 12:13, cutting {{the ship in}} half. The forward section capsized almost immediately, but the <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> remained afloat until the early morning of the next day. Nearby ships were able to rescue 353 survivors from the 1,474 crew members and visitors aboard Mutsu, meaning that 1,121 men {{were killed in the}} explosion. To avert the potential damage to morale from the loss of a battleship, Mutsus loss was declared a state secret. To further prevent rumors from spreading, many survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

50|$|In 1922 a new {{staircase}} {{was added}} between {{the front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> of the building, and the toilet block was reworked in 1924 to replace the original earth closets with water closets.|$|R
50|$|The ubosot (buddhist temple) and vihara (monastery) {{have their}} <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> {{extended}} through the gallery. The satellite stupas of varied structural forms and contemporary {{with the main}} stupa are lined up outside the gallery.|$|R
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny, the <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> of the centipede. As with Williams, The Human Centipede was Yennie's {{first major}} film role. Yennie {{was one of}} several actresses to {{audition}} for the role, as the producers searched for an actress who would have good on-screen chemistry with Williams. Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair shared an apartment in the Netherlands during filming. Yennie auditioned to Ilona Six, sister of Tom Six and the film's producer, and did not meet Tom Six, who had viewed tapes of her reading, until fitting for the centipede special effects in the Netherlands. Yennie was drawn to the role by the humanity throughout the story, referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation. She also said the story was so realistic it scared her.|$|E
5|$|Brumfield {{arrived by}} {{helicopter}} {{on the morning}} of 8 November, just as A Company was preparing to depart from its night location at 08:00. With contact now seeming unlikely to the Australians, Healy was instructed to move to a rendezvous from which the battalion would be extracted back to Bien Hoa the following day. A Company subsequently set out on a compass bearing which would take them across the northern edge of the Gang Toi plateau. By 10:30 the Australians moved out in single file but had not gone far before a lone Viet Cong scout was observed shadowing them; he was subsequently shot and killed by the <b>rear</b> <b>section.</b> Crossing a creek line the Australians uncovered a company-sized camp of dugouts and trenches, before being fired upon at 15:40 by a single Viet Cong soldier who then fled. A Company halted briefly, and at this time two Viet Cong approached their position, before being killed by 1 Platoon.|$|E

50|$|The former Cooktown Hospital is {{constructed}} in timber. It has a two-storeyed front section facing west to May Street {{and a long}} single- storeyed wing attached at the rear and supported on steel stumps. The relationships of the front and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> are not original.|$|R
5|$|Opposite the Bill Struth Main Stand is the Sandy Jardine Stand {{formerly}} known as the Govan Stand. It is a two-tier stand, similar in style to the two end stands, which was completed in 1981. To the rear of the Govan Stand is the Argyle House extension, completed in 1990, which provides executive boxes, hospitality areas and office space. The Bar 72 area was added to the <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> of the Govan Stand in 2006. The Copland Road Stand, at the east end of the stadium, was completed in 1979 and now accommodates just over 8,000 fans. It is traditionally the 'Rangers end' of the ground and the team normally chooses to attack that end {{in the second half of}} matches. The western Broomloan Road Stand, which was completed in 1980, is identical to the opposite end. Although constructed as separate structures, the three stands have been linked since the mid-1990s, when two additional areas of seating were added to the corner areas. All of the stands are designed using the 'goalpost' structure, in which a large portal frame supports perpendicular beams on which roof cladding is secured. A Rangers Megastore is located in the corner between the Copland Road and Govan Stands.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Kronan began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English shipwright Francis Sheldon frequently came {{in conflict with}} the admiralty over the project. The navy administrators complained that he was unduly delaying the project and was spending too much time on his own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the slipway turned out to be too small and the <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily mended and that the problem was that the timber had been left to dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged on for several years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.|$|E
25|$|AMC {{used the}} Hornet {{as the basis}} for its AMC Gremlin, which {{consisted}} of the front half of the two-door Hornet's body and a truncated <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> with a window hatchback.|$|E

25|$|A {{derivative}} of the 104 coupé {{with a slightly}} longer <b>rear</b> <b>section,</b> the Talbot Samba was launched in 1981, following Peugeot's acquisition of Chrysler Europe (and its Talbot marque) in 1978. A cabriolet version of the Samba was developed. Production lasted until 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{baseline}} LoADS {{design was}} a single-stage missile consisting of three stacked conical sections; a pointed conical nose-cone, a slightly flared cylinder through the midsection forming {{the majority of}} the missile body, and a flared <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> surrounding the rocket nozzles. It was very similar to the upper stage of the Sprint missile, although lacking the Sprint's small aerodynamic fins.|$|E

25|$|It was {{considered}} to be sturdy and very manoeuvrable for a glider. The design of the Horsa adopted a high-wing cantilever monoplane configuration, being equipped with wooden wings and a wooden semi-monocoque fuselage. The fuselage was built in three sections bolted together, the front section held the pilot's compartment and main freight loading door, the middle section was accommodation for troops or freight, the <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> supported the tail unit.|$|E
