50|$|Disease and Disorders: NUMT {{insertion}} {{into the}} genome can be problematic. Transposition of NUMTs into genome {{has also been}} associated with human diseases. De novo integration of NUMT pseudogenes into the nuclear genome has an adverse effect in some cases, promoting various disorders and aging. MtDNA integration into coding genes in the germline cells has dramatic consequences for embryo development and, in many cases, is lethal. Few NUMT pseudogenes associated with diseases are found within exons or at the exon-intron boundaries of human genes. For example, the patients with mucolipidosis syndrome inherit a mutation caused by insertion of a 93bp fragment of mitochondrial ND5 into exon 2 of the R403C mucolipin gene. This is the first case of a heritable disorder due to the NUMT insert. Despite the small treatment group, Stem Cell transplant found to be effective and lysosomal enzyme levels seemed to normalize after transplant {{in at least one}} case. The Pallister-Hall syndrome, a developmental disorder, in another example, where a functional disorder of a key developmental gene results from a de novo insertion of a 72bp mtDNA fragment into GLI3 exon 14 in chromosome 7, which results in central and postaxial polydactyly, bifid epiglottis, imperforate anus, renal abnormalities including cystic malformations, <b>renal</b> <b>hypoplasia,</b> ectopic ureteral implantation, and pulmonary segmentation anomalies such as bilateral bilobed lungs. A splice site mutation in the human gene for plasma factor VII that causes severe plasma factor VII deficiency, bleeding disease, results from a 251-bp NUMT insertion. As the last known example, a 36-bp insertion in exon 9 of the USH1C gene associated with Usher syndrome type IC is the NUMT. No certain curse has yet found for Usher syndrome, however, a current clinical study on 18 volunteers is taking place to determine the influence of UshStat both in a short and a long-term period. This study has been started in September 2013 and is estimated to be done by October 2023.|$|E

40|$|No {{evidence}} forAT 2 Rgene derangement {{in human}} urinary tract anomalies. BackgroundIt has been recently found that mice, especially males, with a disrupted angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT 2 R) gene, {{which is located}} on the X-chromosome, often have a range of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including <b>renal</b> <b>hypoplasia,</b> and that Caucasian male patients with ureteropelvic junction stenosis (UPJ) and multicystic dysplastic kidneys frequently have A-G transition in intron 1 of the AT 2 R gene. We have previously found that <b>renal</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> is remarkably predominant in Japanese boys. MethodsWe investigated sex ratios for the frequency of each CAKUT. The frequency of the A-G transition between the controls and 66 Japanese boys with CAKUT were compared. There was <b>renal</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> in 16, UPJ in 17, vesicoureteral in 20, and other anomalies in 13. We also investigated whether any mutations in AT 2 R genes were detectable in patients with <b>renal</b> <b>hypoplasia.</b> ResultsIn contrast to mice with a disruption of the AT 2 R gene, the male-to-female ratios in human patients proved to be considerably variable: 16 for <b>renal</b> <b>hypoplasia,</b> 2. 1 for UPJ, 0. 8 for vesicoureteral, and 1. 2 for others. The frequency of the A-G transition was not different between the control population and the patients with CAKUT [31 of 102 (30 %) vs. 23 of 66 (35 %), respectively]. A sequencing study disclosed no mutations in nine boys with <b>renal</b> <b>hypoplasia.</b> ConclusionsThese findings indicate that the AT 2 R gene may not {{play a major role in}} the development of <b>renal</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> and other CAKUT in humans, at least in the Japanese population...|$|E

40|$|The {{renin-angiotensin system}} (RAS), a key {{regulator}} {{of the blood}} pressure and fluid/electrolyte homeostasis, also plays {{a critical role in}} kidney development. All the components of the RAS are expressed in the developing metanephros.

40|$|Renal hypodysplasia (RHD) is a {{heterogeneous}} condition encompassing {{a spectrum of}} kidney development defects including <b>renal</b> agenesis, <b>hypoplasia,</b> and (cystic) dysplasia. Heterozygous mutations of several genes {{have been identified as}} genetic causes of RHD with various severity. However, these genes and mutations are not associated with bilateral renal agenesis, except for RET mutations, which could be involved in a few cases. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to total absence of kidney development thus remain largely elusive. By using a whole-exome sequencing approach in families with several fetuses with bilateral renal agenesis, we identified recessive mutations in the integrin α 8 -encoding gene ITGA 8 in two families. Itga 8 homozygous knockout in mice is known to result in absence of kidney development. We provide evidence of a damaging effect of the human ITGA 8 mutations. These results demonstrate that mutations of ITGA 8 are a genetic cause of bilateral renal agenesis and that, at least in some cases, bilateral renal agenesis is an autosomal-recessive disease...|$|R

40|$|Congenital nephron number ranges {{widely in}} the human population. Suboptimal nephron number may be {{associated}} with increased risk for essential hypertension and susceptibility to renal injury, but the factors that set nephron number during kidney development are unknown. In renal-coloboma syndrome, <b>renal</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> and reduced nephron number are due to heterozygous mutations of the PAX 2 gene. This study tested for an association between a common haplotype of the PAX 2 gene and subtle <b>renal</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> in normal newborns. A PAX 2 haplotype was identified to occur in 18. 5 % of the newborn cohort, which was significantly associated with a 10 % reduction in newborn kidney volume adjusted for body surface area.

40|$|Branching {{morphogenesis}} in {{the developing}} mammalian kidney involves growth and branching of the ureteric bud (UB), leading to formation of its daughter collecting ducts, calyces, pelvis and ureters. Even subtle defects in the efficiency and/or accuracy of this process have profound effects on the ultimate development of the kidney and result in congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding a number of genes known to regulate UB development and emphasizes an emerging role for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in renal branching morphogenesis. Mutations in the genes encoding components of the RAS in mice cause <b>renal</b> papillary <b>hypoplasia,</b> hydronephrosis, and urinary concentrating defect. These findings imply that UB-derived epithelia are targets for angiotensin (ANG) II actions during metanephric kidney development. Here, it is proposed that papillary hypoplasia in RAS-deficient mice is secondary to an intrinsic defect {{in the development of}} the renal medulla. This hypothesis is based on the following observations: (a) UB and surrounding stroma express angiotensinogen (AGT) and ANG II AT 1 receptors in vivo; (b) ANG II stimulates UB cell process extension, branching and cord formation in collagen gel cultures in vitro; and (c) AT 1 blockade inhibits ANG II-induced UB cell branching. It is further postulated that ANG II is a novel stroma-derived factor involved in stroma/UB cross-talk which regulates UB branching morphogenesis...|$|R
