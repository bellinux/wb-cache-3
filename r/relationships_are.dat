5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts {{strain on}} marriages and other romantic relationships, {{which in turn}} has {{important}} implications for quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> protective.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Vainio {{consumed}} {{more and more}} alcohol. In the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo. He often carried a hip flask in case {{he ran out of}} something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> considered to be one reason for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{characters}} became common {{enough that}} Diana Wynne Jones' The Tough Guide To Fantasyland contains an entry on gay mages as a fantasy cliché. Such characters {{are found in}} Mercedes Lackey's works, such as the Lambda award-winning The Last Herald Mage trilogy (1989), in which the protagonists are gay and have magical powers. Their <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> {{an integral part of}} the story, which takes places in the fictional country of Valdemar.

40|$|Establishing {{supplier}} <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> {{becoming more}} important than ever, but maintaining effective <b>relationships</b> <b>is</b> increasingly difficult due to the pressures on business-to-business relations. In Japan, business-to-business <b>relationships</b> have <b>been</b> quite stable and close in the hotel sector.

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2008, Nina Rønsted and colleagues analysed the DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase region, in the first molecular analysis of the section Malvanthera. They found F.rubiginosa to be most closely related to the rainforest species F.watkinsiana and two rock-growing (lithophytic) species of arid northern Australia (F.atricha and F.brachypoda). They classified these species in a new series Rubiginosae in the subsection Platypodeae. <b>Relationships</b> <b>are</b> unclear and it is uncertain into which direction the group radiated (into rainforest or into arid Australia).|$|E
5|$|Many {{risk factors}} and {{protective}} factors have been proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When epidemiological studies {{have been carried out}} in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the more}} unusual <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> those between certain anemones (such as Adamsia, Calliactis and Neoaiptasia) and hermit crabs or snails, and Bundeopsis or Triactis anemones and Lybia boxing crabs. In the former, the anemones live on the shell of the hermit crab or snail. In the latter, the small anemones are carried in the claws of the boxing crab.|$|E
50|$|Good's own price: The basic demand <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> between {{potential}} {{prices of}} a good and the quantities that would be purchased at those prices. Generally the <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> negative meaning that an increase in price will induce {{a decrease in the}} quantity demanded. This negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> embodied in the downward slope of the consumer demand curve. The assumption of a negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> reasonable and intuitive. If the price of a new novel is high, a person might decide to borrow the book from the public library rather than buy it.|$|R

5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus.

However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different methods of analysis are not always consistent and could not be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E
5|$|Argentodites is a {{possible}} multituberculate mammal from the Cretaceous of Argentina. The single species, Argentodites coloniensis, is known from a single blade-like fourth lower premolar (p4) from the La Colonia Formation, which is mostly or entirely Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The p4 is 4.15mm long and bears eight cusps on its upper margin and long associated ridges on both sides. The enamel consists of prisms that are completely or partly surrounded by a sheath and that are on average 6.57m apart. Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, who described and named the fossil in 2007, regarded it as a multituberculate, perhaps a cimolodontan—and thus, {{a member of a}} mostly Laurasian (northern) group and an immigrant to Argentina from North America—on the basis of the shape of the tooth and features of its enamel. In 2009, however, two teams argued that Argentodites may in fact be close to or identical with Ferugliotherium, a member of the small Gondwanan (southern) group Gondwanatheria; although their <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> disputed, gondwanatheres may themselves be multituberculates.|$|E
5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
30|$|A {{negative}} <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> expected {{between the}} economies of non-debt taxes and the debt ratio. This <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> verified by several empirical studies such as those developed by: Titman and Wessels (1988), Ozkan (2001), Chen (2004) and N. Delcoure (2006). Several investments have led to savings of taxes and savings generated by debtedness. A negative <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> expected between this variable and the levels of indebtedness.|$|R
50|$|The <b>relationship</b> can <b>be</b> {{analyzed}} through techniques {{developed for}} the analysis of interpersonal ties. The form of the <b>relationship</b> may <b>be</b> explicit (or implicit) and internal (or external) to an institution in both perception and reality.

The strength of the <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> quantifiable through a relative percentage from 0% (weak) to 100% (strong) and a degree of separation (for example, 1 degree of separation means the trust <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> direct, see Six degrees of separation).|$|R

5|$|Because male-female <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> {{inherently}} unequal in her society, Wollstonecraft endeavours {{to formulate}} {{a new kind of}} friendship in The Wrongs of Woman: motherhood and sisterhood. It is Maria's pathetic story regarding the kidnapping of her child that first interests Jemima in her plight. The novel fragments also suggest that the tale might not end with a marriage, but rather with {{the creation of a new}} kind of family, one constituted by two mothers for Maria's child. With Jemima's rescue of Maria, Wollstonecraft appears to reject the traditional romantic plot and invent a new one, necessitated by the failure of society to grant women their natural rights.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, {{as a pair}} of {{gay male}} ambassador-spies attempt to {{infiltrate}} and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men. In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling of the evolution of public perception of same sex relationships that the <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews.|$|E
5|$|Family <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> {{a common}} type of {{connection}} between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs, reflecting the importance of procreation in Egyptian religious thought. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent {{the creation of new}} life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun, Mut, and Khonsu at Thebes, were assembled into family triads. Genealogical connections like these are changeable, in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief. Hathor, as a fertility goddess, could act as mother to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in other circumstances she was the sun god's daughter.|$|E

40|$|The {{joint control}} of rate of key pecking in pigeons by stimulus-reinforcer and response-reinforcer <b>relationships</b> <b>was</b> {{studied in the}} context of a two-component {{multiple}} schedule of reinforcement. Food presentation was always associated with one component and extinction with the other. The stimulus-reinforcer <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> manipulated by varying the relative durations of the two components. In the food-presentation component, a fixed rate of reinforcement, independent of rate of responding, was generated by a schedule referred to as “T*”. One aspect of the response-reinforcer <b>relationship,</b> contiguity, <b>was</b> manipulated by varying the percentage of delayed reinforcers. With the multiple T* extinction schedule, stimulus-reinforcer and response-reinforcer <b>relationships</b> could <b>be</b> varied independently of one another. Rate of key pecking was sensitive to manipulations of both relationships. However, significant differential effects due to either the stimulus-reinforcer or response-reinforcer <b>relationship</b> <b>were</b> obtained only when the other <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> weak: stimulus-reinforcer and response-reinforcer relationships interacted in the joint control of responding...|$|R
5|$|In 1993, Géraldine Veron and François Catzeflis {{published}} a DNA hybridization study {{suggesting that the}} fossa was {{more closely related to}} mongooses (family Herpestidae) than to cats or civets. However, in 1995, Veron's morphological study once again grouped it with Felidae. In 2003, molecular phylogenetic studies using nuclear and mitochondrial genes by Anne Yoder and colleagues showed that all native Malagasy carnivorans share a common ancestry that excludes other carnivores (meaning they form a clade, making them monophyletic) and are most closely related to Asian and African Herpestidae. To reflect these relationships, all Malagasy carnivorans are now placed in a single family, Eupleridae. Within Eupleridae, the fossa is placed in the subfamily Euplerinae along with the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and Malagasy civet, but its exact <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> poorly resolved.|$|E
5|$|LGBT rights activists, {{human rights}} activists, {{and other critics}} stated that the broad and vague wording of the law, which was {{characterized}} as a ban on gay propaganda by the media, made {{it a crime to}} publicly make statements or distribute materials in support of LGBT rights, hold pride parades or similar demonstrations, state that gay <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> equal to heterosexual relationships, or according to Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president Chad Griffin, even display LGBT symbols such as the rainbow flag or kiss a same-sex partner in public. The first arrest made under the law involved a person who publicly protested with a sign containing a pro-LGBT message.|$|E
5|$|Michael Moorcock {{was one of}} {{the first}} scifi authors to depict {{positive}} portrayals of homosexual, lesbian and bisexual relationships and sex in his novels.

Lesbian <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> also known in matrilineal societies in Ghana among the Akan people. In Lesotho, females engage in what is commonly considered sexual behavior to the Western world: they kiss, sleep together, rub genitals, participate in cunnilingus, and maintain their relationships with other females vigilantly. Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires a penis, however, they do not consider their behavior sexual, nor label themselves lesbians.|$|E
5|$|Since {{birds are}} highly visible and common animals, humans {{have had a}} {{relationship}} with them since the dawn of man. Sometimes, these <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana. Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities. Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an aviation hazard. Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds).|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The ability to share gaze with another individual {{is an important}} skill in establishing reference. The ability to identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development {{and the ability to}} take part in normal <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> also influenced by joint attention abilities.
