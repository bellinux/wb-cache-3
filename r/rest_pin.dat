50|$|A gatra {{consists}} of a sequence of four beats (keteg), which are filled with notes (or <b>rests,</b> <b>pin)</b> from the balungan. In general, the second and fourth beats of a gatra are stronger than the first and third, and the final note of a gatra, called the seleh, dominates the gatra. In other words, the gatras are like Western measures in reverse, with the strongest beat at the end. Important colotomic instruments, most notably the gong ageng, are played on that final beat. If the final beat in a gatra is a rest, the seleh is the last note played. It is not uncommon in gamelan repertoire to find entire gatras of rests. Note that the actual length of {{time it takes to}} play a gatra varies from less than a second to nearly a minute, depending on the tempo (laya) and the irama.|$|R

Remarkably, however, {{a substantial portion}} of IDPs undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to their cognate partners. Structural flexibility and binding plasticity enable IDPs to interact with a broad range of partners. However, the broader network properties that could provide additional insights into the functional role of IDPs are not known. Here, we report the first comprehensive survey of network properties of IDP-induced sub-networks in multiple species from yeast to human. Our results show that IDPs exhibit greater-than-expected modularity and are connected {{to the rest of the}} protein interaction network (PIN) via proteins that exhibit the highest betweenness centrality and connect to fewer-than-expected IDP communities, suggesting that they form critical communication links from IDP modules to the <b>rest</b> of the <b>PIN.</b> Moreover, we found that IDPs are enriched at the top level of regulatory hierarchy.

40|$|In this fluid {{dynamics}} video we show capillary rise experiments with diethyl ether in short tubes. The height of each short tube {{is less than}} the maximum height the liquid can achieve, and therefore the liquid reaches the top of the tube while still rising. Over a narrow range of heights, the ether bulges out {{from the top of the}} tube and spreads onto the external wall. Description The rise of diethyl ether (density 710 kg/m 3, dynamic viscosity 0. 22 mPa ·s, and surface tension 16. 6 mN/m) under normal gravity in 0. 8 to 1. 0 mm diameter cylindrical capillary tubes is oscillatory due to its low viscosity and therefore delayed development of the viscous boundary layer[1]. The liquid achieves a maximum height of 13. 5 mm in a 0. 8 mm diameter tube that is 16 mm high. When the same experiment is performed in a tube that is only 4. 7 mm high, the rising liquid reaches the top of the tube, the meniscus inverts, and a bulge of liquid forms and wets the outer surface. As ether spreads down the outer surface, the ether inside the capillary tube retreats downward and then oscillates vertically. After inverting several times, the meniscus comes to a <b>rest,</b> <b>pinned</b> at the top of the tube. External wetting occurs when the kinetic energy of the liquid exceeds a reference surface energy. In this case, a reasonable choice is the surface energy of a spherical drop that has the same radius as the capillary tube. If the kinetic energy is too low, the liquid bulges outward, does not spread, and returns into the tube and oscillates. The kinetic energy is insufficient when the height of the liquid column or the rise speed is too low. We show that 1 a...|$|R

[...] The third method relied on a length of chain or cord attached to the ring near the [...] "terminals" [...] (which in pseudo-penannular brooches do not actually terminate), which was used to secure the pin by tying it down, perhaps with a small pin at the end, which was also put through the cloth. [...] The Tara Brooch was probably fastened in this way. In some cases the pin was fitted with a bolt or rivet to make it removable. [...] A further complication is that in some pseudo-penannular brooches the pin is fixed to lie in front of the ring, as in the Londesborough Brooch (below), but in others it crosses through the ring, starting with the head end in front of the ring, but the middle of the pin behind the ring by the point where it crosses at the other side; the Tara Brooch has been displayed set up in both ways.

5000|$|In 1967 Hydranautics, now Bardex Corporation, designed, patented, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} the first shiplift using chain instead of wire rope. These Shiplifts differ distinctly {{in the use}} of hydraulic Chain Jacks and Stud Link Anchor Chain to lift commercial ships, naval vessels and submarines. [...] The five distinct advantages to the Bardex Chain Jack Shiplift are: 1) Chain is inherently less susceptible to corrosion and bending fatigue as any chain corrosion is visible on the outside surfaces as opposed to wire rope. For this reason, Lloyd’s shipping register requires 20% of wire ropes to be removed and destructively tested each year with all wire ropes to be replaced every 5-10 years. Lloyd’s does not stipulate any specific duty life limitations for chains which have been known to last for over 20 years in operation.2) Traditional wire rope shiplift systems rely on synchronous motors powering the winches. These motors cause a large power demand on the system when started. Hydraulic systems start at no load so there is no excessive inrush current demand.3) The use of dual chains for redundancy in lieu of a single wire rope at each hoist provides extra safety and reliability.4) Use of chain allows incremental mechanical synchronization of the entire lift operation. The chain links are made to very tight fabrication tolerances so that after each jacking stroke, the platform is set down on the next set of chain links and the level has been “reset”. Wire rope hoist by comparison can become cumulatively unsynchronized over the duration of a lift requiring the operation to stop and be adjusted.4) At all times the shiplift and the vessel are mechanically held by chain <b>resting</b> on support <b>pins</b> not relying on a braking system. 5) Holding the rigid shiplift platform at the correct elevation for Transfer Operations is a locked mechanical function as the chain is pinned in position without the deflection inherent in wire rope systems. A Bardex Shiplift has never dropped a vessel.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{substantial}} interest in HFE gene variants as putative risk factors in neurodegenerative {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer disease (AD). Previous studies in cell models have shown the H 63 D HFE variant to result in increased cellular iron, oxidative stress, glutamate dyshomeostasis, {{and an increase in}} tau phosphorylation; all processes thought to contribute to AD pathology. Pin 1 is a prolyl-peptidyl cis/trans isomerase that can regulate the dephosphorylation of the amyloid and tau proteins. Hyperphosphorylation of these later proteins is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and Pin 1 levels are reportedly decreased in AD brains. Because of the relationship between Pin 1 loss of function by oxidative stress and the increase in oxidative stress in cells with the H 63 D polymorphism it was logical to interrogate a relationship between Pin 1 and HFE status. To test our hypothesis that H 63 D HFE would be associated with less Pin 1 activity, we utilized stably transfected human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cell lines expressing the different HFE polymorphisms. Under <b>resting</b> conditions, total <b>Pin</b> 1 levels were unchanged between the wild type and H 63 D HFE cells, yet there was a significant increase in phosphorylation of Pin 1 at its serine 16 residue suggesting a loss of Pin 1 activity in H 63 D variant cells. To evaluate whether cellular iron status could influence Pin 1, we treated the WT HFE cells with exogenous iron and found that Pin 1 phosphorylation increased with increasing levels of iron. Iron exposure to H 63 D variant cells did not impact Pin 1 phosphorylation beyond that already seen suggesting a ceiling effect. Because HFE H 63 D cells have been shown to have more oxidative stress, the cells were treated with the antioxidant Trolox which resulted in a decrease in Pin 1 phosphorylation in H 63 D cells with no change in WT HFE cells. In a mouse model carrying the mouse equivalent of the H 63 D allele, there was an increase in the phosphorylation status of Pin 1 providing in vivo evidence for our findings in the cell culture model. Thus, we have shown another cellular mechanism that HFE polymorphisms influence; further supporting their role as neurodegenerative disease modifiers...|$|R
40|$|An {{electronic}} instrument {{has been developed}} as a prototype of a portable crane-load contact sensor. Such a sensor could be helpful in an application in which the load rests on a base in a horizontal position determined by vertical alignment pins (see Figure 1). If the crane is not positioned to lift the load precisely vertically, then the load {{can be expected to}} swing once it has been lifted clear of the pins. If the load is especially heavy, large, and/or fragile, it could hurt workers and/or damage itself and nearby objects. By indicating whether the load remains in contact with the pins when it has been lifted a fraction of the length of the pins, the crane-load contact sensor helps the crane operator determine whether it is safe to lift the load clear of the pins: If there is contact, then the load is resting against the sides of the pins and, hence, it may not be safe to lift; if contact is occasionally broken, then the load is probably not <b>resting</b> against the <b>pins,</b> so it should be safe to lift. It is assumed that the load and base, or at least the pins and the surfaces of the alignment holes in the load, are electrically conductive, so the instrument can use electrical contact to indicate mechanical contact. However, DC resistance cannot be used as an indicator of contact for the following reasons: The load and the base are both electrically grounded through cables (the load is grounded through the lifting cable of the crane) to prevent discharge of static electricity. In other words, the DC resistance between the load and the pins is always low, as though they were always in direct contact. Therefore, instead of DC resistance, the instrument utilizes the AC electrical impedance between the pins and the load. The signal frequency used in the measurement is high enough (. 1 MHz) that the impedance contributed by the cables and the electrical ground network of the building in which the crane and the base are situated is significantly greater than the contact impedance between the pins and the load. The instrument includes a signal generator and voltage-measuring circuitry, and is connected to the load and the base as shown in Figure 2. The output of the signal generator (typically having amplitude of the order of a volt) is applied to the load via a 50 -resistor, and the voltage between the load and the pins is measured. When the load and the pins are not in contact, the impedance between them is relatively high, causing the measured voltage to exceed a threshold value. When the load and the pins are in contact, the impedance between them falls to a much lower value, causing the voltage to fall below the threshold value. The voltage-measuring circuitry turns on a red light-emitting diode (LED) to indicate the lower-voltage/ contact condition. Whenever the contact has been broken and the non-contact/higher-voltage condition has lasted for more than 2 ms, the voltage-measuring circuitry indicates this condition by blinking a green LED...|$|R
