In this article, the authors present an analytical framework for evaluating the competitive effects of patent settlements, including those involving <b>reverse</b> <b>payments,</b> and demonstrate that these settlements can benefit consumers. Thus, the authors conclude that while continued scrutiny of such settlements is important, broad brush treatments are inappropriate and only a more individualized evaluation can correctly determine the competitive effects of a particular settlement agreement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Bitcoin is a {{disruptive}} new crypto-currency {{based on}} a de-centralized open-source protocol which has been gradually gaining mo-mentum. Perhaps {{the most important question}} that will affect Bitcoin’s success, is whether or not {{it will be able to}} scale to support the high volume of transactions required from a global currency system. We in-vestigate the implications of having a higher transaction throughput on Bitcoin’s security against double-spend attacks. We show that at high throughput, substantially weaker attackers are able to <b>reverse</b> <b>payments</b> they have made, even well after they were considered accepted by re-cipients. We address this security concern through the GHOST rule, a modification to the way Bitcoin nodes construct and re-organize the block chain, Bitcoin’s core distributed data-structure. GHOST has been adopted and a variant of it has been implemented as part of the Ethereum project, a second generation distributed applications platform. ...|$|R

Although narrowing the range of possible outcomes by rejecting the legal rules at the extremes and opting for a rule of reason middle ground, the opinion failed {{to grapple with the}} most challenging issues of regulatory policy raised by pharmaceutical patent settlements. In particular, it failed to clearly delineate the social costs of permitting and disallowing patent settlements, avoided grappling with the crucial issues of patent validity and infringement, and erroneously focused on “reverse payments” as a distinctive antitrust problem when equally or more anticompetitive settlements can be crafted without <b>reverse</b> <b>payments.</b> Although Actavis is a frustrating opinion, it is perhaps too much to expect judges to solve the patent settlements challenge.

40|$|The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, {{better known}} as the Hatch-Waxman Act, is {{intended}} to lower the average price paid by consumers for prescription drugs. The Hatch-Waxman Act attempts to do so by simplifying the application process for generic drug manufacturers, allowing generic drug applications to circumvent the lengthy FDA testing and approval process that brand-name manufacturers must undergo. Though the Hatch-Waxman Act has successfully created a clear path to the market for generic drugs, it contains loopholes that allow brand name and generic companies to engage in practices aimed at maximizing monopoly profits, effectively depriving consumers of a generic option. Some of these practices include: <b>reverse</b> <b>payments,</b> citizen petitions, product hopping, and the misclassification of drugs. This Note argues that pharmaceutical companies have engaged in some of these practices and that the Hatch-Waxman Act must be amended to prevent these companies from continuing to circumvent the true intention of the Act...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>payment</b> {{settlements}} have [...] "the {{potential for}} genuine {{adverse effects on}} competition." [...] By paying a settlement that keeps its generic competitors out of the market, the patentee can set a price that's above the market level with its monopoly. With the profit it obtains from this monopoly, the patentee splits it with its original challenger and the consumer loses out {{in the form of}} higher drug prices due to a non-competitive market. In addition, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, only the first generic filer gains the coveted 180-day exclusive right to sell the generic brand of a drug. All subsequent filers do not get this right and must also be subjected to the same 30-month waiting period before FDA approval in paragraph IV litigation. As a result, a <b>reverse</b> <b>payment</b> settlement gets rid of the first and presumably most motivated competitor from the patentee's market.|$|E
5000|$|The anticompetitive {{consequences}} of <b>reverse</b> <b>payment</b> settlements {{will at least}} sometimes be unjustifiable. The majority recognized that there are situations in which settlements are justified in a patent dispute (e.g. saving litigation expenses, exchanging of services, etc.), {{but this does not}} warrant dismissing the FTC's complaint. If the settlement has legitimate reasons, then the antitrust defendant can prove it in court.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the passage}} of the Hatch-Waxman Act (the Act) in 1984, patent {{litigation}} in the pharmaceutical industry has generated a troubling breed of settlement agreements wherein the payment goes from patentee plaintiffs to allegedly infringing defendants, resulting in anticompetitive effects. The provisions of the Act, though intended to promote innovation and lower drug prices while expediting infringement litigation, tend to incentivize <b>reverse</b> <b>payments,</b> or pay-for-delay settlements. The settlements are often challenged by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and by private parties for violation of antitrust law. Thus, pay-for-delay settlements illustrate a tension between patent law and antitrust law. Since the adoption of the Act, courts have struggled to harmonize the two bodies of law with regard to pay-for-delay settlements, as evidenced by the widely divergent rulings on the legality of these settlements among regional circuit courts. In December 2012, the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari to review Federal Trade Commission v. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., an Eleventh Circuit case favoring the pharmaceutical companies, and should enunciate the proper legal standard to apply to pay-for-delay settlements...|$|R

40|$|When generic drugs seek FDA approval, the {{pharmaceutical}} company files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), {{in which the}} generic company establishes bioequivalence to its usually patented counterpart. The ANDA filer must also certify that, {{to the best of}} the filer 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge, the generic will not infringe on a current patent-holder 2 ̆ 7 s rights. This can be done by showing (1) no patent on the product exists, (2) the patent is expired, (3) the patent will expire by the time the generic is marketed, or (4) the ANDA filer believes the patent is invalid - called a Paragraph IV certification. A Paragraph IV certification usually results in a patent challenge. Recently, these challenges have been settled when the large, patent-holding company pays a large sum to the ANDA filer, and in many cases lets the ANDA filer enter the market prior to patent expiration. The result is delayed generic market entry and higher drug prices for everyone. The proposed Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, currently pending in Congress, will attempt to make these 2 ̆ 2 <b>reverse</b> <b>payments</b> 2 ̆ 2 illegal...|$|R

5000|$|... ● Alan Morrison, in the SCOTUS Blog, {{considers}} how {{one should}} litigate a reverse-payments case, {{based on the}} Court's opinion. Since not all <b>reverse</b> <b>payments</b> are anticompetitive, Morrison says, [...] "A company with a very solid patent, but {{with the knowledge that}} there is always a chance it may be struck down and with the realization that even winning a patent case costs lots of money, may be willing to make a modest payment to gain several years of peace and profits." [...] so the problem is [...] "separating the wheat from the chaff." [...] The Supreme Court in Actavis says [...] "the antitrust laws forbid only those payments that are [...] "large and unjustified.'&#8239;" [...] But what does that mean, Morrison asks, and tries to answer:First, what is the baseline or even the universe against which large is to be measured? Annual gross revenues or net profits of the pioneer and/or the generic would be convenient yardsticks. But most companies have many products, with different sales and profit ratios, and so the company-wide figures are likely to be an inappropriate measure of what is too large. Moreover, in all these deals, the non-compete lasts only so long, and so the open period has to be somehow taken into account.|$|R
40|$|Pay-for-delay” settlements, {{also known}} as <b>reverse</b> <b>payments,</b> arise when a generic {{manufacturer}} pursues FDA approval of a generic version of a brand-name drug. If a patent protects the brand-name drug, the generic manufacturer has the option of contesting {{the validity of the}} patent or arguing that its product does not infringe the patent covering the brand-name drug. If the generic manufacturer prevails on either of these claims, the FDA will approve its generic version for sale. Approval of a generic version of a brand-name drug reduces the profitability of the brand-name drug by forcing the brand-name manufacturer to price its product competitively. Thus, under a typical pay-for-delay arrangement, the brand-name manufacturer avoids the risk of competition by paying the generic manufacturer to keep its product off the market, often {{for the remainder of the}} brand-name drug’s patent term. The FTC estimates that this practice costs consumers billions of dollars in the form of increased prescription drug prices. In June of 2013, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in FTC v. Actavis, Inc, which addressed whether this type of arrangement violates federal antitrust law. In Actavis, the Court held that pay-fordelay settlements should be scrutnized under rule of reason antitrust analysis to determine whether a particular settlement unreasonably diminishes competition. This Note argues that the Actavis holding will not effectively address anticompetitive settlements in the pharmaceutical industry, and proposes a regulatory solution to the problem of payfor- delay settlements...|$|R
40|$|A {{tidal wave}} of high drug prices has {{recently}} crashed across the U. S. economy. One of the primary culprits has been the increase in agreements by which brand-name drug manufacturers and generic firms have settled patent litigation. The framework for such agreements has been the Hatch-Waxman Act, which Congress enacted in 1984. One of the Act 2 ̆ 7 s goals was to provide incentives for generics to challenge brand-name patents. But brand firms have recently paid generics {{millions of dollars to}} drop their lawsuits and refrain from entering the market. These reverse-payment settlements threaten significant harm. Courts nonetheless have recently blessed them, explaining that the agreements reduce costs, increase innovation, and are reasonable based on the presumption of validity accorded to patents. Although scholars and the Federal Trade Commission have voiced strong arguments against courts 2 ̆ 7 leniency, these have fallen on judicial deaf ears. In this Article, I apply the framework that the Supreme Court articulated in Verizon Communications v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, which underscored the importance in antitrust analysis of a regulatory regime addressing the challenged activity. In particulart, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides Congress 2 ̆ 7 s views on innovation and competition in the drug industry, freeing courts from the thorny task of reconciling the patent and antitrust laws. Unfortunately, mechanisms that Congress employed to encourage patent challenges-such as an exclusivity period for the first generic to challenge validity-have been twisted into barriers preventing competition. Antitrust can {{play a central role in}} resuscitating the drafters 2 ̆ 7 intentions and promoting competition. Given the Act 2 ̆ 7 s clear purpose to promote patent challenges, as well as the parties 2 ̆ 7 aligned incentives and the severe anticompetitive potential of <b>reverse</b> <b>payments,</b> courts should treat such settlements as presumptively illegal. If the parties can demonstrate that the payments represent a reasonable assessment of litigation success, then they can rebut this presumption. If not, courts should conclude that the agreements violate the antitrust laws...|$|R

In effect, this limits patent owners' scope of power in holding their monopolies. In addition, as a result, using reverse-payment settlements to resolve patent disputes now carries a greater risk of coming under litigation, and being ruled as infringing of antitrust laws.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, the appeals court ruled, courts cannot require parties to litigate further in order to avoid antitrust liability.|$|E

25|$|The Payment Systems and Netting Act 1998 {{gives the}} board power {{in areas of}} the law that were {{previously}} uncertain.

This was later changed, when cheques were deemed void if the bankrupt institution doesn't have the funds to back them up, after the Cheques Act 1986 was amended in 1998. The Trade Practices Act 1974 generally does not allow competitors to make cooperative agreements, but if the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is permitted to make exceptions for competitors making agreements among themselves.
