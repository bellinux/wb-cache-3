In the application of the method of remove in SPSS software, multiple linear regressions between normal <b>reference</b> <b>value</b> of Chinese standards bicarbonate and geographical factors, one regression equation is inferred:y= 21. 84 + 0. 151 5 x- 0. 000 830 0 x 5 ± 1. 040 3. In the above equation, y is normal <b>reference</b> <b>value</b> of Chinese standards bicarbonate (mmol/L), x 3 is Average annual temperature (℃),x 5 is Annual precipitation (mm), 1. 0403 is the value of the residual standard deviations. 1288 observation points of normal <b>reference</b> <b>value</b> of Chinese standards bicarbonate have been calculated in China by using this equation.

40|$|The {{transient}} {{response of the}} distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) is very important while compensating rapidly varying unbalanced and nonlinear loads.

The consultation process produced controversy regarding the inclusion and modeling of indirect land use change effects. After the CARB's ruling, among other criticisms, representatives of the ethanol industry complained that the standard overstated the negative environmental effects of corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of indirect effects of land-use changes as an unfair penalty to home-made corn ethanol because deforestation in the developing world had been tied to US ethanol production. The emissions standard for 2011 for LCFS meant that Midwest corn ethanol would not meet the California standard unless current carbon intensity is reduced.|$|E
