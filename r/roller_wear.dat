40|$|AbstractThe {{forming process}} is nonlinear, {{and it is}} {{difficult}} to clearly understand forming mechanism and deformation law of workpiece during forming process. In addition, the disturbances such as inhomogeneous material of workpiece, high temperature, <b>roller</b> <b>wear,</b> etc., often occur during forming. These disturbances cause the inaccuracy of the pulley geometric shape and reduction of the product quality. To handle this challenge, first a 3 D-FE simulation was executed to investigate the deformation behavior of workpiece and to find the forming parameters. In the next step, a self-optimizing strategy was developed as a control system to improve the product quality. This self-optimizing approach is being practiced in the real forming machine system for validating the efficiency of the proposed strategy...|$|E

40|$|A field-based {{study was}} {{performed}} to broaden our knowledge of operational efficiency losses associated with the neglect of the proper maintenance of the delimbing and feeding mechanisms of a harvester. The post-harvest assessments of industrial round-wood (IRW) processing damage, fuel consumption and productivity were examined in clearcutting operations. Observations were made of seven combinations of wear levels of feed rollers (A—heavy, B—medium, C and C’—without wear) and sharpening states of delimbing knives (1 —incorrect, 2 —correct), depending {{on the degree of}} feed <b>roller</b> <b>wear</b> and matching of angles of knife blades to the technical requirements. The processing defects of IRW were broken down into unprocessed branches, bark stripping, and damage caused by feed roller spikes. The results were then compared with the effective quality requirements, and the IRW losses in terms of the reject rates (RR) were determined {{in the context of the}} technical condition. The most frequent damage was by unprocessed branches. The harvester with correctly sharpened knives produced the minimum RR (4 % of pine, 6 % of spruce and 6 % birch logs). The quality of IRW harvested under B 1 and C 1 resulted in 6 %, 6 % and 8 %. A 1 turned out to be the lowest (12 %, 10 % and 8 %). Improvement in the maintenance of delimbing knives can reduce the RR of IRW by 5 %. Timely restoration of worn-out rollers can increase productivity by 2 % and reduce fuel consumption by 5 %...|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} done to support NASA's James Webb Space Telescope that is {{equipped}} with a Near Infrared Camera and Spectrograph and Micro Shutter Assembly (MSA). A MSA mechanism's qualification test in cryogenic vacuum at 30 deg K for 96 K cycles resulted in <b>roller</b> <b>wear</b> and formation of some debris. Lab tests in vacuum were conducted at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) to understand the wear of Ti 6 Al 4 V mated with 440 F steel rollers. Misalignment angle was found to have the most significant effect on debris formation. At misalignment angle of 1. 4 deg, significant amount of wear debris were formed within 50, 000 cycles. Very few wear particles were found for a zero misalignment angle, and the total wear was small even after 367, 000 cycles. The mode of wear in all the tests was attributed to adhesion, which was clearly evident from video records as well as the plate-like amalgamated debris material from both rollers. The adhesive wear rate was found to be approximately proportional to the misalignment angle. The wear is a two-way phenomenon, and the mixing of both roller materials in wear debris was confirmed by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and EDX spectra. While there was a net loss of mass from the steel rollers, XRF and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectra showed peaks of Ti on steel rollers, and peaks of Fe on Ti rollers. These results are useful for designers in terms of maintaining appropriate tolerances to avoid misalignment of rolling elements and the resulting severe wea...|$|E

Test rollers made of super-carburizing steel MAC 14 and conventional carburizing steel SCM 415 were plasma-super-carburized under different carburizing conditions. The contact fatigue tests were carried out for these plasma-super-carburized rollers. The effects of case depths on the contact fatigue strength of these rollers were determined. The effect of shot-peening on the contact fatigue strength was also examined by carrying out contact fatigue tests for shot-peened <b>rollers.</b> The <b>wear</b> tests were also carried out and then the wear characteristics of test rollers were determined.
