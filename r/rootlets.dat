40|$|Peat and net carbon {{accumulation}} {{rates in}} two sub-arctic peat plateaus of west-central Canada {{have been studied}} through geochemical analyses and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating. The peatland sites started to develop around 6600 - 5900 cal. yr BP and the peat plateau stages are characterized by Sphagnum fuscum peat alternating with <b>rootlet</b> layers. The long-term peat and net carbon accumulation rates for both profiles are 0. 30 - 0. 31 mm/yr and 12. 5 - 12. 7 gC/m** 2 /yr, respectively. These values reflect very slow peat accumulation (0. 04 - 0. 09 mm/yr) and net carbon accumulation (3. 7 - 5. 2 gC/m** 2 /yr) in the top <b>rootlet</b> layers. Extensive AMS radiocarbon dating of one profile shows that accumulation rates are variable depending on peat plateau stage. Peat accumulation rates are up to six times higher and net carbon accumulation rates up to four times higher in S. fuscum than in <b>rootlet</b> stages. Local fires represented by charcoal remains {{in some of the}} <b>rootlet</b> layers result in very low accumulation rates. High C/N ratios throughout most of the peat profiles suggest low degrees of decomposition due to stable permafrost conditions. Hence, original peat accretion has remained largely unaltered, except in the initial stages of peatland development when permafrost was not yet present...|$|R
40|$|Euplotes eurystomus bears 8 rows of single, non-motile simple cilia, 18 ventral cirri, and {{a row of}} adoral membranelles. Each cirrus {{contains}} 40 - 120 cilia {{in tight}} hexagonal packing, and each membranelle consists of 3 rows of 10 - 40 cilia; the component cilia adhere together in life, but no means of adhesion, other than small protuberances of the ciliary membrane, has been seen. The kinetosomes of compound organelles, but not of the simple cilia, are associated with <b>rootlet</b> fibres. The kinetosomes of the component cilia of compound organelles are linked together at two levels by characteristic arrays of fibres. Single <b>rootlet</b> microtubules (about 20 mfi in diameter) interconnect individual kinetosomes of adjacent membranelles, but the <b>rootlet</b> microtubules arising from cirri are found as bundles, each of which corresponds {{to one of the}} fibres seen in the light microscope. The bundles of microtubules of most cirri arise at dense bars {{near the edge of the}} cirrus base, and terminate at or near the pellicle, without inter-connecting cirri directly or indirectly. The <b>rootlet</b> microtubules of the anal cirri run the length of the base of the cirrus near the inner end of the kinetosomes and join into large bundles; these run anteriorly to join with each other and attach to the distal end of the membranelle row. The anal cirri and the adoral zone of membranelles form one structurally united part of the loco-motor apparatus...|$|R
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.ericifolia has proteoid roots—roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral <b>rootlets</b> that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a lignotuber, and so is killed by fire and regenerates from seed.|$|E

40|$|Amoebae of Naegleria fowleri nN 68 became {{elongated}} flagellated cells 150 to 180 min after subculture to non-nutrient buffer. N. fowleri NF 69 did {{not become}} elongated or flagellated under these conditions. Electron microscopic examination of N. fowleri confirmed {{that it is a}} typical eucaryotic protist with a distinct nuclear envelope and prominent nucleolus, numerous vacuoles and cytoplasmic inclusions, pleomorphic mitochondria, and some rough endoplasmic reticulum. During incubation in non-nutrient buffer, both strains lost ultraviolet-absorbing material to the medium, and the number of vacuoles decreased. In strain nN 68, basal bodies, a <b>rootlet,</b> and flagella are formed quickly after an initial lag of 90 min. Initially, the <b>rootlet</b> is not associated with the nucleus but they become associated subsequent at the leading end of the elongated cell. In elongated cells, the <b>rootlet</b> lies in a furrow or groove extending the length of the nucleus. Flagella of N. fowleri nN 68 exhibit the typical 9 + 2 arrangement of filaments and are surrounded by a sheath which is continuous with the plasma membrane.

40|$|Phytochemical {{analysis}} of the methanolic extract of Xylocarpus granatum Koen indicated the presence of carbohydrates, saponins, tannins and flavonoid types of compounds. Alkaloids and glycosides {{were found to be}} absent from the extract. The primary methanolic extract exhibited a potent growth inhibitory effect. Inhibition of both the <b>rootlet</b> and shoot showed a dosedependent response. The residual methanolic extract also has a growth inhibitory effect. Bothmethanolic extracts have a greater inhibitory effect on <b>rootlet</b> growth than shoot growth. The residual methanolic extract has a lesser inhibitory effect than the primary methanolic extract. Removal of the non-polar compounds (by n-hexane and chloroform) from the primary methanolic extract reduced the inhibitory activity on both the <b>rootlet</b> and shoot growth, which suggests that the non-polar fractions may contain growth inhibitory principles. The primary extract demonstrated antibacterial activity against the gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis and the gram negative bacteria Proteus vulgaris. The primary methanolic extract was found to be inactive against Escherichia coli andPseudomonas aeruginosa. The primary methanolic extract was more active against grampositive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria. The residual methanolic extract was also found to be inactive against all the tested microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|Red clover and alfalfa were inoculated with Pratylenchus penetrans {{and grown}} in an Alberry sandy loam soil to which {{potassium}} (K⁺) was added at seeding at 0, 41. 5, 83, and 166 μg/g. In one experiment with alfalfa, additional K⁺ was added after each forage cut to replace {{that which was}} removed. Nematode populations were not consistently affected by K⁺ fertilization. Nematode infection stunted red clover and alfalfa and resulted in lower yields at all K⁺ levels, except for alfalfa at the lowest K⁺ level. Nematode infection {{had no effect on}} taproot yields. However, it resulted in lower <b>rootlet</b> yields from red clover at all K⁺ levels, lower <b>rootlet</b> yields from alfalfa only at the highest K⁺ level in one experiment, and lower <b>rootlet</b> yields at all but the lowest K⁺ level in a second experiment, potassium fertilization enhanced yield of red clover and alfalfa. Yield increases were smaller from increased K⁺ fertilization in nematode-infested soil than in noninfested soil. Pralylenchus penetrans had little effect on the K⁺ content of red clover or alfalfa.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of post-tetanic potentiation {{has been studied}} in the cat spinal cord with particular reference to polysynaptic responses. Following tetanization of dorsal roots, these reflexes show an increased response, as {{measured in terms of}} their voltage-time area, with a predominant change in the earlier reflex pathways. Both of these changes in the reflex discharge have a time course of 15 to 25 seconds. Post-tetanic potentiation is also observed in response to stimulation of a dorsal <b>rootlet</b> following tetanization of another <b>rootlet</b> in the same or in a neighboring segment. This effect can be explained by post-tetanic changes in the terminals of secondary, and possibly higher order, internuncial cells, essentially similar to those changes in the primary afferent terminals which give rise to potentiation of the monosynaptic reflex...|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{breeding}} biology of the black catbird. Its breeding season appears to run from spring through summer; nest building was observed in Belize in early May, and small young were found in a nest in Mexico in mid-August. The nest, an open cup of twigs lined with <b>rootlets</b> and other fine material, is placed low in a dense bush or small tree. The female lays two greenish-blue eggs. However, details of nest-building, incubation times, parental care, fledging periods and number of broods are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed {{breeding}} season begins in February and reaches an apex between March and May; however, new fledglings {{have been recorded}} as late as August. Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall. Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations, the cholla being favored. Other potential nesting sites range from mesquite, prickly pear or yucca to the occasional oak and pine trees. The nest is generally a deep cup but can be flat with a depression for the eggs. The outer layer consists of thorny twigs while the inner layer includes smooth sticks, roots, coarse and fine grasses, <b>rootlets</b> or hair.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Within each {{tapering}} stereocilium of the cochlea of {{the alligator}} lizard is {{a bundle of}} actin filaments with> 3, 000 filaments near the tip and only 18 - 29 filaments at the base where the bundle enters into the cuticular plate; there the filaments splay out as if {{on the surface of}} a cone, forming the <b>rootlet.</b> Decoration of the hair cells with subfragment 1 of myosin reveals that all the filaments in the stereocilia, including those that extend into the cuticular plate forming the <b>rootlet,</b> have unidirectional polarity, with the arrowheads pointing towards the cell center. The rest of the cuticular plate is composed of actin filaments that show random polarity, and numerous fine, 30 A filaments that connect the <b>rootlet</b> filaments to each other, to the cuticular plate, and to the membrane. A careful examination of the packing of the actin filaments in the stereocilia by thin section and by optical diffraction reveals that the filaments are packed in a paracrystalline array with the crossover points of all the actin helices in near-perfect register. In transverse sections, the actin filaments are not hexagonally packed but, rather, are arranged in scalloped rows that present a festooned profile. We demonstrated that this profile {{is a product of the}} crossbridges by examining serial sections, sections of different thicknesses, and the same stereocilium at two different cutting angles.

5|$|Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, {{including}} B.aemula, have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral <b>rootlets</b> that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. A study of six wallum species, including B.aemula, found they have adapted to very low levels of phosphorus and are highly sensitive to increased levels of the element, leading to phosphorus toxicity. Some evidence suggests they are efficient at using potassium, and sensitive to calcium toxicity as well. A field study on North Stradbroke Island noted increased root growth in autumn (around April), but that overall root growth was more constant than other species looked at, possibly because its deeper roots had more regular access to groundwater.|$|E
5|$|Suillus brevipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, and {{it develops}} a close symbiotic {{association with the}} roots of various tree species, especially pine. The underground mycelia form a sheath around the tree <b>rootlets,</b> and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the cortical cells of the root, forming ectomycorrhizae. In this way, the fungus can supply the tree with minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially lodgepole and ponderosa pine. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus {{has been shown to}} form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, lodgepole, loblolly, eastern white, patula, pond, radiata, and red pines. In vitro mycorrhizal associations formed with non-pine species include Pacific madrone, bearberry, western larch, Sitka spruce, and coast Douglas-fir. Fungal growth is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the heavy metals cadmium (350ppm), lead (200ppm), and nickel (20ppm).|$|E
40|$|Karafs Kouhi (Kelussia odoratissima M.) {{is one of}} the {{important}} medicinal plants of umbelliferae family and native of Zagros Mountains range, which is endangered due to illegal harvests. In order to accelerate breaking the seed dormancy of this plant, a factorial experiment based on completely randomized design with four replications, was carried in Faculty of Agriculture, Shahrekord University. The seeds of Karafs Kouhi from Saraghaseyed ecotype were treated under three time periods (25, 50, 75 and 100 days after planting), combination of enzylaminopurine (BAP) (concentrations of 0, 0. 75 and 1. 5 mg/L) and gibberellic acid (GA 3) (concentrations of 0, 250 and 500 mg/L) and application methods of these growth regulators (soaking seeds in the growth regulators and use of growth regulators directly on the medium). In this experiment, germination percentage, <b>rootlet</b> length and hypocotyl length were studied. The results indicated that 100 days after planting significantly (P≥ 0. 01) showed the highest rates in the three studied traits. In this treatment, the germination percentage was 86. 94 %, <b>rootlet</b> length was 9. 43 cm and hypocotyl length was 11. 64 cm. Moreover, the interaction of the factors was not significant for all the traits. The best combination to increase germination percent, <b>rootlet</b> length and germination rate, was 0. 75 mg/L BAP, 500 mg/L GA 3 and direct use of growth regulators.

40|$|The Lower Maastrichtian of Fumanya and {{neighbouring}} localities of the Vallcebre syncline (Eastern Pyrenees, Catalonia) {{provide the}} first taphonomic {{evidence for the}} hypothesis that cheirolepidiacean conifers were significant precursors of Maastrichtian Pyrenean coal. Most Frenelopsis-rich lignite beds do not bear <b>rootlet</b> marks, suggesting that the original peat was detrital. Sedimentological and taphonomic evidence indicates deposition {{in the margins of}} a lagoon after the transport of the cheirolepidiacean remains by flotation. The same parautochtonous assemblage includes complete impressions Sabalites longirhachis leaves and large impressions of logs attributed to the same palm trees. Other parautochthonous or allochthonous plant megaremains include extremely rare cycadalean and monocot leaves and abundant minute angiosperm seeds. <b>Rootlet</b> marks associated with thin lignite beds occur at the top of some charophyte limestones. The charophyte association, dominated by in situ accumulation of Peckichara and Microchara gyrogonites, suggests that these limestones were deposited in shallow, freshwater lakes and that the corresponding peat mires were limnic rather than paralic in nature. The botanical affinity of plant remains associated with these root-bearing lignites is uncertain. Palynological analysis showed abundant bisaccates, with less abundant fern spores and freshwater algal oospores. Locally, the abundant <b>rootlet</b> marks were associated with large brush-like rooting structures attributed to Sabalites longirhachis palms.
