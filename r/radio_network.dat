40|$|We {{consider}} <b>radio</b> <b>networks</b> modeled {{as directed}} graphs. In ad hoc <b>radio</b> <b>networks,</b> every node knows only its own label and a linear bound {{on the size}} of the network but is unaware of the topology of the network, or even of its own neighborhood. The fastest currently known deterministic broadcasting algorithm working for arbitrary n-node ad hoc <b>radio</b> <b>networks,</b> has running time O(n log 2 n). Our main result is a broadcasting algorithm working in time O(n log n log D) for arbitrary n-node ad hoc <b>radio</b> <b>networks</b> of eccentricity D. The best currently known lower bound on broadcasting time in ad hoc <b>radio</b> <b>networks</b> is Ω(n log D), hence our algorithm is the first to shrink the gap between bounds on broadcasting time in <b>radio</b> <b>networks</b> of arbitrary eccentricity to a logarithmic factor. We also show a broadcasting algorithm working in time O(n log D) for complete layered n-node ad hoc <b>radio</b> <b>networks</b> of eccentricity D. The latter complexity is optimal...|$|R

5|$|The {{building}} was first operated as the Christchurch studio for Television New Zealand (TVNZ), who displayed their logo on the building. Shows such as What Now, After School, Simon Barnett's quiz show Face the Music and later The Son of a Gunn Show were filmed {{in the tower}} block. TVNZ vacated the building in late 1998 following a decision to move all of their Christchurch-produced shows to Wellington. In the late 1990s, Telstra New Zealand, the telecommunications company of Telstra in New Zealand, owned the naming rights to the building. After Clear Communications was acquired in December 2001 to form TelstraClear, the Clear logo was prominently displayed on the building. The building's naming rights were sold to The <b>Radio</b> <b>Network</b> and it was renamed to <b>Radio</b> <b>Network</b> House during the ownership of Nor West Arch No.4 Ltd. At the time of demolition the logo of Newstalk ZB, a subsidiary of The <b>Radio</b> <b>Network,</b> was displayed on the building.|$|E
5|$|On 30 August 2011, CERA added <b>Radio</b> <b>Network</b> House to {{the list}} of {{buildings}} to be demolished. On 17 July 2012, the local Canterbury newspaper The Press reported that implosion of <b>Radio</b> <b>Network</b> House had been approved by CERA. The same day, a press conference was held, where representatives of the demolition companies involved and of CERA addressed the media. The main contractor for the demolition was Naylor Love, who engaged Ceres New Zealand for the implosion. Ceres in turn partnered with Controlled Demolition, Inc., an American company based in Phoenix, Maryland, that has a track record of 9,000 implosions and is considered a world leader in the field. The implosion of <b>Radio</b> <b>Network</b> House was a test case, as the technique had not been applied in New Zealand before, and there are still many more tall buildings to be demolished in Christchurch. The implosion was challenging for Controlled Demolition, Inc., as New Zealand buildings are designed to withstand earthquake loading and thus have much more reinforcing in them than the buildings they usually deal with.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>networks</b> {{that employ}} the {{dispersed}} spectrum utilization as spectrum access method are called dispersed spectrum cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>networks.</b> In this paper, we derive the effective transport capacity of adhoc dispersed spectrum cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>networks</b> {{in which the}} nodes are distributed in three dimensional (3 D) configurations. The analysis is performed considering a cubic grid distribution for the node configuration and inter-node interference (INI). Numerical results are provided to show the effects of node distribution, fading, and modulation on the effective transport capacity of adhoc dispersed spectrum cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

40|$|This brief {{focuses on}} the use of {{full-duplex}} radio in cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>networks,</b> presenting a novel spectrum sharing protocol that allows the secondary users to simultaneously sense and access the vacant spectrum. This protocol, called “Listen-and-talk” (LAT), is evaluated by both mathematical analysis and computer simulations in comparison with other existing protocols, including the listen-before-talk protocol. In addition to LAT-based signal processing and resource allocation, the brief discusses techniques such as spectrum sensing and dynamic spectrum access. The brief proposes LAT as a suitable access scheme for cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>networks,</b> which can support the quality-of-service requirements of these high priority applications. Fundamental theories and key techniques of cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>networks</b> are also covered. Listen and Talk: Full-duplex Cognitive <b>Radio</b> <b>Networks</b> is designed for researchers, developers, and professionals involved in cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>networks.</b> Advanced-level students studying signal processing or simulations will also find the content helpful since it moves beyond traditional cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>networks</b> into future applications for the technology...|$|R
