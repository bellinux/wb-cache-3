50|$|In the First World War Douglas Cook {{served in}} Gallipoli, Egypt and France. In France {{he lost the}} sight of his right eye in 1916. He spent some time in England to recuperate. During that time he visited some {{beautiful}} gardens, especially the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. After returning to New Zealand in 1917 (with a plant of both the <b>red</b> and variegated <b>cabbage</b> <b>tree,</b> that Arthur William Hill of Kew gave him) he started creating his own park.Now that he had learned to admire the beauty of trees, he started planting on a large scale. For instance in 1920 about 2,500 trees and shrubs were ordered for the garden. Bulbs and perennials were ordered too, including tulips, hyacinths, lilies and gladioli.|$|R

In 1877, <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Tree</b> Swamp residents successfully lobbied to have the road's name changed to Kingsland Road.

40|$|To {{determine}} anti-inflammatory {{effects of}} pigments from <b>red</b> <b>cabbage,</b> <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> (Brassica oleracea L. var.) juice was prepared, characterized by UV-vis absorption spectra, partially purified by Sephadex LH- 20 column, analyzed by HPLC, and administered to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated murine splenocyte cultures. The {{study showed that}} <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice (RC) exhibited anti-inflammatory effects against LPS-induced inflammation of splenocytes via increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) - 10 and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 6 secretions. The maximum absorption peaks of RC and its heated products, but not activated charcoal-adsorbed products, appeared at 280 nm with a small shoulder around 310 - 330 nm while there existed a minor peak at 560 nm (range from 480 to 630 nm), reflecting <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice included phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. The lyophilized powder of chromatographic fractions F 2, F 3, and F 4 through Sephadex LH- 20 column were rich in phenolics (5. 9 +/- 0. 2 %, 4. 4 +/- 0. 0 %, and 3. 9 +/- 0. 0 %, respectively) and flavonoids (1. 8 +/- 0. 3 %, 1. 8 +/- 0. 3 %, and 1. 1 +/- 0. 3 %, respectively). The results suggest that anti-inflammatory pigment compounds in <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice were heat stable. Further analysis of chromatograms from H PLC suggests malvidin glycosides including malvidin 3 -glucoside (oenin), malvidin 5 -glucoside and malvidin 3, 5 -diglucoside in <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice could inhibit IL- 6 secretion of LPS-stimulated splenocytes.
