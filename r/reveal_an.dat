5|$|NGC 6543 {{is a high}} {{northern}} declination deep-sky {{object and}} is near the apparent position of the North Ecliptic Pole. It has the combined magnitude of 8.1, with high surface brightness. Its small bright inner nebula subtends an average of 16.1 arcsec, with the outer prominent condensations about 25 arcsec. Deep images <b>reveal</b> <b>an</b> extended halo about 300 arcsec or 5 arcmin across, that was once ejected by the central progenitor star during its red giant phase.|$|E
5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may <b>reveal</b> <b>an</b> obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|Gunnery Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews) is {{the squad}} {{leader of the}} Colonial Marines sent to {{investigate}} LV-426. During the first incursion into the atmospheric processor, he enforces Gorman's orders not to use pulse rifle and smartgun ammunition. Shortly after finding a surviving, cocooned colonist whose chest bursts to <b>reveal</b> <b>an</b> Alien, Apone grabs a flamethrower from Frost to incinerate it. In the subsequent Alien attack, he is captured alive. Hudson later states that the life sign computer readouts indicate that Apone was not killed in the attack; presumably impregnated by an Alien, he died when the atmosphere processor exploded or from an Alien gestating in his body.|$|E

5|$|High-resolution {{images of}} Io {{acquired}} when Io is experiencing an eclipse <b>reveal</b> <b>an</b> aurora-like glow. As on Earth, {{this is due}} to particle radiation hitting the atmosphere, though in this case the charged particles come from Jupiter's magnetic field rather than the solar wind. Aurorae usually occur near the magnetic poles of planets, but Io's are brightest near its equator. Io lacks an intrinsic magnetic field of its own; therefore, electrons traveling along Jupiter's magnetic field near Io directly impact Io's atmosphere. More electrons collide with its atmosphere, producing the brightest aurora, where the field lines are tangent to Io (i.e. near the equator), because the column of gas they pass through is longest there. Aurorae associated with these tangent points on Io are observed to rock with the changing orientation of Jupiter's tilted magnetic dipole. Fainter aurora from oxygen atoms along the limb of Io (the red glows in the image at right), and sodium atoms on Io's night-side (the green glows in the same image) have also been observed.|$|E
5|$|Rena Mero {{returned}} to the WWF, which {{is now known as}} World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on the April 3, 2003 episode of SmackDown!, reprising her role as Sable. Sable continued portraying a villainess and spent several months in a storyline with new Playboy covergirl Torrie Wilson. During their angle, the evil Sable followed Wilson down to her matches, talked with her backstage, and on one occasion, she left Wilson in a tag match alone to fend for herself. Sable eventually challenged Wilson to a showdown bikini contest at Judgment Day. After Sable got the bigger applause, Wilson removed her chaddi to <b>reveal</b> <b>an</b> even smaller bikini underneath, and Special Guest Referee Tazz declared Wilson the winner. After the match, Wilson went up to Sable and kissed her before exiting the ring. Sable then had an altercation with the guest judge Tazz, dumping water on him on the following edition of SmackDown!, as a means of gaining revenge for declaring Wilson the winner.|$|E

The performance was included in a set of multiple songs off of Killer Love, and was sung in order to celebrate the shopping centre's opening. Scherzinger began her performance with a fringed leather coat in red and black, the colours of the Westfield logo, a cutaway black bodycon dress and purple platform heels which she whipped off to <b>reveal</b> <b>an</b> even racier outfit underneath.

5|$|The brain-like surface folds {{and mature}} olive-brown gleba are {{characteristic}} of Calvatia craniiformis, but younger puffballs {{that have not yet}} developed these characteristics may be difficult to identify to species. Another edible puffball, C.cyathiformis (lilac puffball) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple-brown when mature. Calvatia fragilis is smaller and pink or purple mature gleba. C.bicolor is a smaller, rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C.craniiformis, but the former species has more coarsely ornamented spores, and lacks a distinct subgleba. Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C.craniiformis, but unlike the latter it develops a cavernous opening to <b>reveal</b> <b>an</b> olive-brown gleba, and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads.|$|E
5|$|The {{microstructure}} of Gobioolithus eggshell has {{not been}} thoroughly studied, and heavy recrystallization of most specimens {{makes it difficult to}} examine the eggshell structure or pore system. The eggshell consists of two (or possibly three) structural layers. The inner layer, called the mammillary layer, is about half the thickness of the outer, or continuous, layer. On the outside, many specimens have a recrystallized outer layer. This could simply due to diagenesis or it could be a true external zone, which is a third layer present in most bird eggs but is rare in non-avian dinosaurs. However, a few specimens are unaffected by recrystallization. These do not have a third layer, but this does not {{rule out the possibility that}} the eggshell originally had a three layers since the external layer can easily separate from the rest of the eggshell. These specimens also <b>reveal</b> <b>an</b> angusticanaliculate pore system, which means that the pores have a low density, and are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E

Spears is then dropped {{into the back of a}} Ducati 999, driven by a shirtless male (Tyson Beckford) in a futuristic Paris, that was compared to the 1982 film Blade Runner. She wears a tight black catsuit and sports red hair, inspired by the character of Sydney Bristow from television series Alias. They pass a woman and lift up her dress, a homage to the iconic Marilyn Monroe scene in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch. They also pass two women frolicking in a store window.|$|E

During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause trouble, making Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again. Unfortunately Becky and Steve are refused the right to adopt because her estranged half-sister Kylie gave a bad reference and the fact that Social Services feel that it is too soon after her miscarriages. She confronts Kylie, but the sisters eventually reconcile and Becky helps Kylie reclaim custody of her son, Max. Becky becomes very attached to Max, whilst Kylie becomes more irresponsible. Kylie announces plans to move to Cyprus with her new boyfriend and Becky begs her to reconsider, so Kylie offers to sell Max to her and Steve for Â£20,000, which they agree to. On the night of the tram crash, Kylie returns and demands more money, so Becky steals Â£5,000 from the ruins of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop, to pay Kylie off.
