5000|$|UPS Freight is the Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) {{trucking}} {{division of}} UPS. UPS acquired on August 8, 2005, Overnite Transportation (and its subsidiary Motor Cargo) for $1.25 billion. On April 28, 2006, Overnite Transportation officially became UPS Ground Freight, Inc. The logos {{on the doors}} of the Overnite tractors were covered with signs showing the operator as UPS Freight. UPS Freight soon changed the color scheme of the tractors from blue and grey to UPS brown on the bottom, with a gold line {{near the center of the}} tractor and gray for the upper color. All new vehicles purchased by UPS Freight LTL come painted in these colors as the older Overnite equipment is replaced, while the new tractors for the truckload division (Former Overnite Transportation [...] - [...] Special Services Division) are solid white with the UPS shield on the <b>roof</b> <b>fairing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a TGV Atlantique {{are already}} quite good, and improvements were few. It {{was decided that}} 325 would have a [...] "front" [...] and [...] "rear" [...] for the high-speed runs, to simplify the modifications. Usually a TGV trainset is symmetric and reversible, but 325's two power cars, 24049 and 24050, were defined as leading and trailing units, respectively. On the roof of lead unit 24049, the pantographs were removed and the <b>roof</b> <b>fairing</b> extended over the opening; the same was done to the 1500 V DC pantograph on trailing unit 24050. Only one pantograph was to be used at high speed: the stock Faiveley GPU unit remaining on unit 24050. As in normal TGV running, the lead unit was to be fed power from the trailing unit through the roof line running {{the length of the}} train. Further improvements, such as rubber membranes covering the gaps between the trailers, and a rear spoiler on the trailing unit were considered, but abandoned.|$|E
40|$|Constant rise in fuel {{price in}} recent times has caused {{manufacturers}} of heavy commercial vehicles (HCV) to turn to efficient aerodynamic design of trucks, wagons, tractors as well as trailers. The comparative analysis in this study compares the coefficient of drag of the following four aerodynamic configurations of a tractor-trailer combination: 1. Semi-trailer with no devices. 2. Semi-trailer with cab <b>roof</b> <b>fairing.</b> 3. Semi-trailer with the proposed rolling pin device. 4. Semi-trailer with the proposed rolling pin device and the cab <b>roof</b> <b>fairing.</b> The overall coefficient of drag for the tractor-trailer combination for the above four configurations is computed and compared along with that of individual critical surfaces to analyse the effect of two major drag-reducing devices, the cab <b>roof</b> <b>fairing</b> and the momentum injection rolling pin. The pressure distribution in the flow field around the vehicle is studied to understand the flow mechanisms involved in the reduction in overall drag...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{reduce the}} {{aerodynamic}} drag coefficient of a heavy-duty commercial truck made in China, the aerodynamic characteristics of models with additional devices are researched by adopting numerical simulation {{and taking a}} certain made-in-china truck model as research object. The mechanism {{and the effect of}} reduction of drag coefficient are analyzed and the optimization of model is gained based on contrast to the drag coefficient of base model. The results indicate that the drag coefficient descends in the most degree after <b>roof</b> <b>fairing</b> of cab is applied and the shape of <b>roof</b> <b>fairing</b> has a great influence on drag. The grille and separator can reduce drag coefficient. The research results can reduce the drag coefficients and provide the theoretical references for energy conservation and emission reduction of heavy-duty trucks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aerodynamic {{consideration}} {{is very important}} in design and manufacturing of vehicles. The motion of the vehicle takes place through a large mass of either stationary air or air in motion. The air exerts force on the auto vehicle. The force exerted by air on a moving auto vehicle has two components. (1) Drag force (2). Lift force. This paper present the optimization of aerodynamic drag force induced in heavy duty trucks. As heavy duty trucks have large frontal area, they have to face large resistance of air (drag). Generally automotive manufacturers provide <b>roof</b> <b>fairing</b> for making the flow of wind past by the body streamlined. This paper suggests the optimized angle to reduce the aerodynamic drag force which increases the fuel economy...|$|E
50|$|Since 2006, Gallimaufry {{has been}} {{presenting}} concert versions of classic {{shows on the}} sands of Main Beach in Laguna. These concerts are free {{to the public and}} feature a full orchestra. The first in this series was South Pacific, followed by Carousel and Guys and Dolls. The most recent production was a series of songs from Fiddler on the <b>Roof,</b> My <b>Fair</b> Lady and Chicago.|$|R

60|$|The {{arrangements}} for supping and {{spending the night}} made rapid progress, and {{under the influence of}} fire and animal heat--for the dogs were taken in beside them--the igloe became comfortably warm; yet the snow-walls did not melt, or become moist, the intense cold without being sufficient to counteract and protect them from the heat within. The <b>fair</b> <b>roof,</b> however, soon became very dingy, and the odour of melted fat rather powerful. But Arctic travellers are proof against such trifles.|$|R
50|$|The {{comedy in}} The Nanny was {{formulated}} with many running gags, which contributed heavily {{to the success}} of the series. Much of this formula was character-based, with all major characters possessing a specific trait or quirks that provided a source of parody for other characters. The conflicting elements of each character's own comedy were often played off against one another (Fran and Maxwell, Niles and C.C., Maggie and Brighton). Occasionally the characters would break the fourth wall and comment on the situations themselves, or Fran would comment to the audience or look into the camera. Other running gags are the many references to Beatles songs and the musicals Fiddler on the <b>Roof</b> and My <b>Fair</b> Lady. Most of the humor Fran uses is aimed toward a Jewish audience. She makes references to Yiddish words and teaches the Sheffield children to be stereotypical Jews (to never pay retail price, to go after men like doctors, etc.) Much of this humor is featured in scenes including her mother Sylvia.|$|R
25|$|Because it {{was unusually}} {{low to the}} playing field, the air-inflated dome {{occasionally}} figured into game action. Major League Baseball had specific ground rules for the Metrodome. Any ball which struck the Dome roof, or objects hanging from it, remained in play; if it landed in foul territory it became a foul ball, if it landed in fair territory it became a fair ball. Any ball which became caught in the <b>roof</b> over <b>fair</b> ground was a ground rule double. That has only happened three times in its history – Dave Kingman for the Oakland Athletics on May 4, 1984, University of Minnesota Gophers player George Behr and Corey Koskie in 2004. The speakers, being closer to the playing surface, were hit more frequently, especially the speakers in foul ground near the infield, which were typically hit several times a season, which posed an extra challenge to infielders trying to catch them. However, beginning with the 2005 season, the ground rules for Twins games were changed such that any batted ball that struck a speaker in foul territory would automatically be called a foul ball, {{regardless of whether or}} not it was caught. The dome's roof color made it close to impossible to catch balls without taking the eye off the ball. As a result, fielders frequently lost balls in the roof. An example of this is seen in a home run derby put on by a softball entertainment crew prior to a Twins game. Taken at field level, the balls generally tended to be lost in the roof. The roof was high enough that it has never been a concern for events other than baseball.|$|R
50|$|During one of {{the last}} {{productions}} each summer season, survey forms are handed out to audience members. On this survey, audience members are asked to select their top seven choices from a long list of show titles. The choices change each year, depending on which titles are available and what shows have not been produced for a number of years. The survey results contribute to (though are just one of many determining factors in deciding) show choices for upcoming seasons. In the past, The Muny chiefly operated on a five-year cycle in which a title could not be produced again until five seasons had passed. Over the past two decades, Fiddler on the <b>Roof,</b> Annie, My <b>Fair</b> Lady, 42nd Street, West Side Story and The Wizard of Oz have been the most popular titles, each receiving four productions since 1990. The 2012 Muny season was announced in October 2011, a significant shift from the typical Muny practice of officially announcing the upcoming summer season in the preceding January or February of the same year.|$|R
40|$|In 2003 I {{enrolled}} in a master’s degree program in arts administration. In addition to such classes as exhibition planning, appraisals, and computer applications, we had two sweeping modern art surveys, which took us from the birth of impressionism in the 1860 s to emerging artists of the 21 st century. For one end term project, we each had to design a complete hypothetical exhibition, from mission statement to budget to invitation card to gallery space. The only restriction was {{that we had to}} demonstrate on paper that we could actually pull it off. At that time, I had recently seen a kimono in a catalogue from the Honolulu Academy of Arts for an exhibition of early 20 th century Japanese art entitled Taisho Chic that had all the characteristics of a work by Miró, one of the artists in the program’s survey. 1 Codes et Constellations Dans L'Amour D'Une Femme, dated 19412 is an actual Miró. Without a catalogue raisoné, {{it is not possible to}} say that the kimono is an exact copy of a Miró, but it is evident the textile artist who created this design was consciously copying Miró’s style. At the time, modern art prices were going through the <b>roof,</b> and art <b>fairs</b> had begun showing the occasional modern art kimono at elegant prices, so based on those connections, I decided t...|$|R
