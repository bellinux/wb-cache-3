40|$|BACKGROUND: Airborne {{nanoparticles}} from vehicle emissions {{have been}} associated with adverse effects in people with pulmonary and cardiovascular disease, and toxicologic studies have shown that nanoparticles can be more hazardous than their larger-scale counterparts. <b>Recirculating</b> <b>air</b> filtration in automobiles and houses may provide a low-cost solution to reducing exposures in many cases, thus reducing possible health risks. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effectiveness of <b>recirculating</b> <b>air</b> filtration on reducing exposure to incidental and intentionally produced airborne nanoparticles under two scenarios: while driving in traffic, and while generating nanomaterials using gas-phase synthesis. METHODS: We tested the <b>recirculating</b> <b>air</b> filtration in two commercial vehicles when driving in traffic, as well as in a nonventilation room with a nanoparticle generator, simulating a nanomaterial production facility. We also measured the time-resolved aerosol size distribution during the incar recirculation to investigate how <b>recirculating</b> <b>air</b> filtration affects particles of different sizes. We developed a recirculation model to describe the aerosol concentration change during recirculation. RESULTS: The use of inexpensive, low-efficiency filters in recirculation systems is shown to reduce nanoparticle concentrations to below levels found in a typical office within 3 min while driving through heavy traffic, and within 20 min in a simulated nanomaterial production facility. CONCLUSIONS: Development and application of this technology could lead to significant reductions in airborne nanoparticle exposure, reducing possible risks to health and providing solutions for generating nanomaterials safely...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} for an air-mixing plenum is {{the mixing of}} return air (or extract air) with fresh air to provide a supply air mixture for onward distribution to the building or area which the ventilation system is serving.

5000|$|Cabin {{pressurization}} is {{a process}} in which conditioned air is pumped into the cabin of an aircraft or spacecraft, {{in order to create a}} safe and comfortable environment for passengers and crew flying at high altitudes. For aircraft, this air is usually bled off from the gas turbine engines at the compressor stage, and for spacecraft, it is carried in high-pressure, often cryogenic tanks. The air is cooled, humidified, and mixed with <b>recirculated</b> <b>air</b> if necessary, before it is distributed to the cabin by one or more environmental control systems.

Most systems will use motorized dampers to control the air mixing, and controlled by the building management system (BMS), or controls system.

5000|$|Chilled beam {{systems are}} not a panacea. Additional {{ductwork}} {{may be needed to}} meet minimum outdoor air requirements. Both types of chilled beam systems are less effective at heating than cooling, and supplementary heating systems are often needed. Chilled beam systems cannot be used alone in buildings where the ceilings are higher than 2.7 m, because the air will not properly circulate. A forced-air circulation system must be employed in such cases. If the water temperature is too low or humidity is high, condensation on the beam can occur—leading to a problem known as [...] "internal rain." [...] (In some cases, drier outside air can be mixed with the wetter inside air to reduced interior humidity levels while maintaining system performance.) Chilled beam {{systems are not}} recommended for areas with high humidity (such as theaters, gymnasiums, or cafeterias). Because they are less effective at cooling, passive chilled beam systems are generally ill-suited for semi-tropical and tropical climates. Hospitals generally cannot use chilled beam systems because of restrictions on using <b>recirculated</b> <b>air.</b> Chilled beam systems are also known to cause noticeable air circulation which can make some people uncomfortable. (Passive air deflection devices can help disrupt these air patterns, alleviating the problem.)

40|$|Tunnels {{serve as}} {{enclosed}} particle loaded environments where mostly stagnant and stable abiotic conditions prevail throughout the year. In-vehicle exposure to ultra-fine particles (UFP) is therefore significant while driving through long tunnels. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess exposure to UFP while driving a car through a 3. 4 km long highway tunnel system in Austria and to calculate the associated lung deposition. On board a mobile Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS, Grimm model 5403) was used to monitor the particle number concentration in the size range of 5. 5 nm to 350 nm. The influence of various air ventilation settings inside the passenger cabin of the car was investigated in terms of UFP concentrations. These ventilation settings and hence the associated particle concentrations inside the cabin were used in the lung deposition model IDEAL to determine their fate in the lung. To examine a real life situation, this heavily frequented highway tunnel system was chosen to serve as a particle laden environment. The data were obtained over several days throughout the year to analyze the effect of traffic mix on the resulting particle regime. Our study revealed a decrease of in-cabin air pollution by up to 88 % while using <b>recirculating</b> <b>air</b> (RA) settings in combination with the air-conditioning system. This mode of operation in comparison to plain tunnel air (TA) reduced the corresponding lung deposition by up to 95 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>recirculated</b> <b>air</b> in mechanically ventilated buildings causes symptoms {{commonly referred to as}} the sick building syndrome and perceptions of poor indoor air quality. METHODS. A blinded, four-period crossover trial was carried out in two identical buildings, contrasting 70 % return air (index phase) with 0 % of return air (reference phase). Each period lasted 1 work-week. The study population comprised 75 workers who had reported symptoms related to the work environment or perceptions of poor indoor air quality. Participants reported their ratings of symptoms, their perceptions, and related information in a daily diary. The outcome criteria included aggregative symptom scores for mucosal irritation, skin reaction, allergic reaction, and general symptoms formed of ratings of component symptoms. Perceptions of unpleasant odor, stuffiness, or dustiness were additional outcome criteria. RESULTS. All 75 participants returned their diaries. For no symptoms did the scores differ between the two phases more than could be expected by chance. Mean rating of unpleasant odor was significantly smaller during the index phase, but mean ratings of dustiness and stuffiness did not differ materially between the two phases. CONCLUSIONS.
