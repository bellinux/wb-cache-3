25|$|The <b>rockoon</b> (a {{portmanteau}} of rocket and balloon) was a {{solid fuel}} rocket that, rather than being immediately lit while on the ground, was first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon. Then, once separated from the balloon at its maximum height, the rocket was automatically ignited. This achieved a higher altitude, since the rocket {{did not have to}} move through the lower thicker air layers that would have required much more chemical fuel.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} its secrecy, many of the project's {{balloons}} carried instruments for open scientific research. [...] For example, from January 20, 1953, [...] until February 4, 1953, with Winzen Research, Inc, the project launched 13 flights at Pyote Air Force Base in Texas. [...] Several of these carried packages for cosmic ray research, {{one of which was}} designated as [...] "ballast". [...] These were Skyhook flights, which is the generic term used by the Office of Naval Research to designate balloon flights whose primary objectives were scientific, rather than military. [...] Some milestones of more than 1500 Skyhook flights are: the first Skyhook launch (1947), the first shipboard launch (1949), the <b>Rockoon</b> program (1952), the tetroon record flight of September 1956, Stratoscope (1957 - 1971), and Skyhook Churchill (1959 - 1976).|$|E

50|$|The first {{hydrogen}} bomb test, code-named Ivy Mike, occurred in late 1952 {{as part of}} Operation Ivy; it vaporized the islet of Elugelab. This test included B-17 Flying Fortress drones to fly through the radioactive cloud to test onboard samples. B-17 mother ships controlled the drones while flying within visual distance of them. In all 16 to 20 B-17s took part in this operation, of which half were controlling aircraft and half were drones. To examine the explosion clouds of the nuclear bombs in 1957/58 several rockets (mostly from <b>rockoons)</b> were launched. One USAF airman was lost at sea during the tests.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1956, Colonial served as a {{floating}} laboratory in experiments with balloon-launched rockets (<b>rockoons).</b> The Naval Research Laboratory's Operation San Diego High had the objective of studying x-rays and Lyman-alpha UV radiation produced in the upper atmosphere by solar flares. For ten days in July, from a location 350 miles southeast of San Diego, each morning a balloon carrying an instrumented Deacon rocket was launched from the helicopter deck of Colonial. The destroyer Perkins (DD-877) would pursue the balloon as it drifted downwind. Observatories watching the sun from New Mexico, Tokyo, San Francisco, and Mexico City would notify the scientists aboard Colonial {{as soon as a}} flare was observed. They in turn would signal Perkins to launch the rocket — through the balloon — up to the ionosphere. The operation had extensive coverage in the April 1957 issue of the National Geographic Magazine, with a journalist and a photographer on the ship.|$|R
5000|$|This {{experiment}} was extensively planned prior to launch. Initial Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) proposals {{for the project}} included conical satellite bodies; this eliminated {{the need for a}} separate fairing and ejection mechanisms, and their associated weight and failure modes. Radio tracking would gather data and establish a position. Early in the program, optical tracking (with a Baker-Nunn camera network and human spotters) was added. A panel of scientists proposed changing the design to spheres, at least twenty inches in diameter and hopefully thirty. A sphere would have a constant optical reflection, and constant coefficient of drag, based on size alone, while a cone would have properties that varied with its orientation. James Van Allen of the University of Iowa proposed a cylindrical satellite based on his work with <b>rockoons,</b> which became Explorer 1, the first American satellite. The Naval Research Laboratory finally accepted a sphere with a 6.4-inch diameter as a [...] "test vehicle", with a diameter of twenty inches set for the follow-on satellites. The weight savings, from reduced size as well as decreased instrumentation in the early satellites, was considered to be acceptable.|$|R
50|$|The first manned plastic balloon flight under ONR {{contract}} {{took place}} in 1949. Project <b>Rockoon,</b> in 1952, featured a Skyhook balloon that released small Deacon rockets at about 70000 ft above arctic waters.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rockoon</b> was {{accompanied}} by a special limited single edition CD-5. It included an edited version of the title track, the bonus track [...] "Oriental Haze" [...] featuring Linda Spa and an interview with Edgar Froese.|$|E

5000|$|The project's {{design was}} a rocket-powered {{spacecraft}} to be air-launched from a helium balloon {{at an altitude}} of about 21 km (65,000 ft). [...] The project scope included design and construction of both the spacecraft and the launching balloon. The chosen design can be described as a manned <b>rockoon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One {{prototype}} of a balloon launch platform {{has been made}} by JP Aerospace as [...] "Project Tandem", although {{it has not been}} used as a rocket launch vehicle.

50|$|In 1953 the Rockoons {{and their}} science {{payloads}} fired off Newfoundland detected {{the first hint}} of radiation belts surrounding Earth. The low-cost <b>Rockoon</b> technique was later used by the Office of Naval Research and The University of Iowa research groups in 1953-55 and 1957, from ships at sea between Boston and Thule, Greenland.|$|E
50|$|James Van Allen {{from the}} State University of Iowa with his group, {{were the first}} to use {{vehicles}} with sensors to study electron fluxes precipitating in the atmosphere With <b>rockoon</b> rockets. The rockets would reach a maximum height of 50 km The soft radiation detected was later named after Van Allen in 1957.|$|E
50|$|Haas was a Romanian carrier rocket, {{which was}} {{developed}} by ARCA {{as part of the}} ELE programme. It was designed to be air-launched from a high-altitude balloon, similar to the American <b>Rockoon</b> experiments of the 1950s. Prior to the development of Haas, ARCA had already launched two Stabilo rockets from balloons. It is fueled by hydrogen peroxide and bitumen.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea of a}} balloon-launched rocket - a <b>rockoon</b> - is not new, but {{is rarely}} practiced. The {{incentives}} for air-based launch are that the altitude the balloons reach are in the near space region - which is above 99% of the atmosphere - thus resulting in significantly less atmospheric drag, requiring far less rocket fuel.|$|E
5000|$|The Pencil Rocket was {{at first}} {{launched}} horizontally, but as it increased gradually in size, the experiment in the city outskirts was deemed too dangerous and the launch site was moved to Michikawa beach in Akita Prefecture. Following the pencil rocket, the larger Baby Rocket was developed which finally reached an altitude of 6 km. After the Baby Rocket, two rocket projects were carried out: a <b>rockoon</b> type rocket launched from a balloon and a ground-launched rocket. The development of the <b>rockoon</b> {{turned out to be}} difficult and was eventually stalled. Among the ground-launched rocket type, the altitude reached by the Kappa rocket gradually increased. This rocket was also used for weather observation and participated in the data collection of the 1958 International Geophysical Year. Due to non-existent development funds at the time, the rockets were handmade and the tracking radar was operated manually. The production relied on trial and error which brought forth many types of rockets.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rockoon</b> is the forty-fourth album {{released}} by Tangerine Dream. The album {{was started in}} March 1991 and completed January 1992, making it the longest production ever in the band's history. The album was nominated in the USA for the [...] "Best New Age Album 1992" [...] Grammy and reached the Top Ten in Billboard New Age charts and the Top Twenty in Billboard Jazz charts.|$|E
50|$|A <b>rockoon</b> (from rocket and balloon) is a {{solid fuel}} {{sounding}} rocket that, rather than being immediately lit while on the ground, is first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon, then separated from the balloon and ignited. This allows the rocket to achieve a higher altitude, as the rocket {{does not have to}} move under power through the lower and thicker layers of the atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|Non-rocket spacelaunch {{refers to}} {{concepts}} for launch into space where {{some or all}} of the needed speed and altitude are provided by something other than rockets, or by other than expendable rockets. A number of alternatives to expendable rockets have been proposed. [...] In some systems such as skyhook, rocket sled launch, <b>rockoon</b> and air launch, a rocket would be part, but only part of the system used to reach orbit.|$|E
50|$|The area is of {{interest}} for military surveillance purposes, scientific study, {{as well as to}} commercial interests for communications, and tourism. Craft that fly in near space include high-altitude balloons, non-rigid airships, rockoons, sounding rockets, and the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The region has been {{of interest}} to space travel. Early attempts used a craft known as a <b>rockoon</b> to reach extreme altitudes and orbit. These are still used today for sounding rockets.|$|E
50|$|The {{first attempt}} of the Deacon <b>Rockoon</b> on Aug 21 1952 06:25 GMT from the Arctic Ocean 80.1 N x 68.5 W was a failure. However, success came on Aug 9 1953 in the Atlantic Ocean, Launch Site 11 Launch Point 10 74.38 N x 71.93 W, at 05:54 GMT. Quickly {{followed}} by another success on Aug 30 1953 20:46 GMT at Atlantic Ocean Launch Site 11 Launch Point 13 53.13 N, 54.75 W.|$|E
50|$|While a {{graduate}} student during the late 1950s, Mr. Ludwig, in collaboration with Prof. James A. Van Allen, established {{one of the first}} spacecraft instrumentation laboratories, with its special techniques, equipment, and performance requirements. He was principal developer of the cosmic ray and radiation belt instruments for <b>Rockoon</b> and the successfully launched Explorers, I, III, IV, VII and, in some cases, their spacecraft structures and subsystems. The space based instruments were all transistor, a first.|$|E
