5|$|García Márquez also {{originally}} {{wrote his}} Eréndira {{as a third}} screenplay. However, this version was lost and replaced by the novella. Nonetheless, he worked on <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> script in collaboration with Ruy Guerra and the film was released in Mexico in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Harlan {{complained to}} Goebbels {{that all the}} {{characters}} were negative; to this, Goebbels retorted that Harlan would not turn down the role of Richard III {{just because he was}} a negative character. However, Goebbels acceded to Harlan's insistence on <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> script and Harlan spent from November 1939 to March 1940 revising the script although he kept much of what Metzger and Möller had written.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{originally}} did {{not want}} to direct another Batman film. Warner Bros. developed a script with Sam Hamm which had the Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure. Burton agreed to return after they granted him more creative control and replaced Hamm with Daniel Waters. Wesley Strick did an uncredited rewrite, removing Harvey Dent and Robin and <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> climax. Annette Bening was originally cast as Catwoman but became pregnant and was replaced with Pfeiffer. Filming began in June 1991 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{accounts}} of ancient versions were rewritten by distinguished scholars, who were leaders in their several departments. The early part of Volume I was enriched from the admirable book on “Greek and Latin Palaeography”, by Edward Maunde Thompson. Many corrections suggested by eminent scholars were introduced in different places throughout the book. H. J. White <b>rewrote</b> <b>the</b> chapter on Latin versions. G. H. Gwilliam, editor of the Peshitta, helped to improve the passages on the Peshitta and the Curetonian Version. H. Deane made an additions {{to the treatment of}} the Harkleian Version. A. C. Headlam made a revision of the long chapter on the Egyptian versions; F. C. Conybeare, <b>rewrote</b> <b>the</b> sections on the Armenian and Georgian versions; Margoliouth <b>rewrote</b> <b>the</b> sections on the Arabic and Ethiopic versions; J. M. Bebb <b>rewrote</b> <b>the</b> section on the Slavonic version; James W. Bright <b>rewrote</b> <b>the</b> section on the Anglo-Saxon Version.|$|R

5|$|Des McAnuff {{replaced}} Mann as director, and filming was {{rescheduled to}} December 1994. Screenwriter Horovitz was busy playwrighting in Europe, so McAnuff and producer Marvin Worth were constantly <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> script in July 1994. The budget {{was estimated at}} $20 million. McAnuff stepped down as director {{and was replaced by}} Dennis Hopper. Hopper was a close friend with Dean and co-starred with the actor in both Rebel Without a Cause and Giant. Hopper met with DiCaprio for the lead role, but the director eventually dropped out of the film. By May 1995, DiCaprio was still the top candidate to portray Dean with Milčo Mančevski in discussions to direct the film.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, 1978, Paramount {{assembled}} the largest press conference {{held at the}} studio since Cecil B. DeMille announced he was making The Ten Commandments. Eisner announced that Academy-Award winning director Robert Wise would direct a film adaptation of the television series, titled Star Trek—The Motion Picture. Wise had only seen a few Star Trek episodes, so Paramount gave him about a dozen to watch. The budget was projected at $15million. Dennis Clark (Comes a Horseman) was invited to rewrite the script and to include Spock, but he disliked Roddenberry, who demanded sole credit. Livingston returned as writer, and although he also found Roddenberry unreasonable, Wise and Katzenberg convinced him to continue <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> script throughout production.|$|E
5|$|Stiller {{had a few}} minor {{roles in}} the early 1990s, in films such as Stella, Highway to Hell and in a cameo, The Nutt House. In 1992, Stiller was {{approached}} to direct the film Reality Bites, based on a script by Helen Childress. Stiller devoted {{the next year and}} a half to <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> script with Childress, fundraising and recruiting cast members for the film. It was eventually released in early 1994, directed by Stiller and featuring him as a co-star. The film was produced by Danny DeVito, who would later direct Stiller's 2003 film Duplex and produce his 2004 film Along Came Polly. Reality Bites debuted as the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend and received mixed reviews.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Riven, Atrus equips the player with a trap book—a snare that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book—and his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the present situation; Atrus cannot explain in depth as he is engaged in <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> descriptive book of Riven, {{in an attempt to}} slow its deterioration. The player must enter the Age with no way of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned lest he use it to escape Riven. Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus holds out the link book that will transport the player to Riven.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1967, Peckinpah was <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> {{screenplay}} and preparing for the production. The principal photography was shot entirely on location in Mexico, most notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen (deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila) and on the Rio Nazas. Peckinpah's epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and America's growing frustration with the Vietnam War and what he {{perceived to be the}} utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but as well the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in Major Dundee, including slow motion action sequences (inspired by Akira Kurosawa's work in Seven Samurai (1954)), characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in The Wild Bunch.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, Jeff Wadlow {{was hired}} to write and direct a film {{adaptation}} of the X-Men spin-off comic-book series X-Force, with Lauren Shuler Donner attached to produce. Mark Millar, the creative consultant for 20th Century Fox's Marvel Comics based films, stated that the film will feature five characters as protagonists. After the release of Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds said that Deadpool would appear in the film. By May 2016, Simon Kinberg {{was in the process}} of <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> script. In February 2017, Joe Carnahan had signed on as director, as well as to be co-writer with Reynolds. By September of the same year, the studio moved on hiring Drew Goddard to write and direct, while Kinberg, Reynolds and Donner will produce the film. The following month, Brolin stated that production will begin at some point during 2018.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} pitched to several studios, {{and the only}} {{interested}} studio was Focus Features, who wanted to film it in Canada. After the studio attempted to have the film be centered on the character Richard Hoover, and Arndt disagreed, he was fired and replaced by another writer. The new writer added several scenes, including Richard's confrontation with the character who dismisses his motivational technique business. A corporate change brought in a new studio head and Arndt was rehired when the new writer left after four weeks of <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> script. After two years of pre-production, Focus Features dropped the film in August 2004. Marc Turtletaub paid $400,000 to Focus Features to buy back {{the rights to the}} film and for development costs. He also paid for the $8million budget, allowing Little Miss Sunshine to then be filmed.|$|E
5|$|Universal Pictures {{reported}} that it greenlit American Gangster with a budget of $80million, which escalated to $93million, with $10million for development costs and $3million for the delay of the production start date. Sources close to the director insist that the budget was $93million from the beginning. The studio also sought for American Gangster to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company General Electric received tax credits in New York City, so production {{was moved to the}} city. The move, however, inflated the budget to $98million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as Ray Liotta and John C. Reilly in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> script during the preproduction process. The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Resident Evil 1.5, with which Mikami planned {{to end the}} series, was criticized by {{supervisor}} Yoshiki Okamoto, who {{found it to be}} too conclusive to allow for future installments. Instead, Okamoto proposed the creation of a fictional universe that would turn Resident Evil into a metaseries– similar to the Gundam and James Bond franchises– in which self-contained stories with common elements could be told. During a period in which the team made no progress <b>rewriting</b> <b>the</b> scenario, Okamoto was introduced to professional screenwriter Noboru Sugimura, who was enthusiastic about the first game's story. Sugimura was initially consulted on a trial basis, but Okamoto was impressed by the ease with which the writer came up with solutions to the problems that plagued the script, and soon asked him to compose the entire scenario for Resident Evil 2. One fundamental modification to the story was the reworking of Elza Walker into Claire Redfield, in order to introduce a connection to the plot of the first game. To fulfill Capcom's sales plan of two million copies, director Kamiya tried to attract new customers with a more ostentatious and Hollywood-like story presentation. As Okamoto did not want to simply enforce the new direction, he had Sugimura discuss the plot revisions with Mikami and the development staff. The planners redesigned the game from the ground up to fit the changes, and the programmers and other remaining members of the team were sent to work on Resident Evil Director's Cut, which was shipped with a playable preview disc of the new Resident Evil 2 version in order to promote the sequel and to apologize to the players for its belated release.|$|E
