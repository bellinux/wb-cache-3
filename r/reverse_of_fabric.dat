2500|$|The Tears Dress, {{a slender}} pale blue evening gown printed with a Dalí design of trompe l'oeil rips and tears, worn with a thigh-length veil with [...] "real" [...] tears {{carefully}} cut out and lined in pink and magenta, {{was part of}} the February 1938 Circus Collection. The print was intended to give the illusion of torn animal flesh, the tears printed to represent fur on the <b>reverse</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fabric</b> and suggest that the dress was made of animal pelts turned inside out. Figures in ripped, skin-tight clothing suggesting flayed flesh appeared in three of Dalí's 1936 paintings, one of which, Necrophiliac Springtime, was owned by Schiaparelli; the other two are The Dream Places A Hand on a Man's Shoulder and Three Young Surrealist Women Holding in Their Arms the Skins of an Orchestra. Richard Martin saw the Tears Dress as a memento mori produced in response to the Spanish Civil War and the spread of Fascism, declaring that to [...] "tear the dress is to deny its customary decorum and utility, and to question the matter of concealment and revelation in the garment." [...] He noted that even if the tears in the dress were mere ornament like slashing, the real tears on the veil negated this, offering visual disagreements between reality and pretence.|$|R
5000|$|Stitch-Bonding is {{a special}} form of warp {{knitting}} [...] and is commonly used {{for the production of}} composite materials and technical textiles. As a method of production, stitch-bonding is efficient, {{and is one of the}} most modern ways to create reinforced textiles and composite materials [...] for industrial use. The advantages of the stitch-bonding process includes its high productivity rate and the scope it offers for functional design of textiles, such as fiber-reinforced plastics. [...] Stitch-bonding involves layers <b>of</b> threads and <b>fabric</b> being joined together with a knitting thread, which creates a layered structure called a multi-ply. [...] This is created through a warp-knitting thread system, which is fixed on the <b>reverse</b> side <b>of</b> the <b>fabric</b> with a sinker loop, and a weft thread layer. [...] A needle with the warp thread passes through the material, which requires the warp and knitting threads to be moving both parallel and perpendicular to the vertical/warp direction of the stitch-bonding machine. [...] Stitch-bonded fabrics are currently being used in such fields as wind energy generation and aviation. [...] Research is currently being conducted into the usage and benefits <b>of</b> stitch-bonded <b>fabrics</b> as a way to reinforce concrete. Fabrics produced with this process offer the potential of using “sensitive fiber materials such as glass and carbon with only little damage, non-crimp fiber orientation and variable distance between threads”.|$|R
