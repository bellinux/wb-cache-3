40|$|Broadband shock-associated {{noise is}} an {{important}} component of the overall noise generated by modern airplanes. In this study, sound generated by the weakly nonlinear interaction between linear instability waves and the shock-cell structure in supersonic jets is investigated numerically in order to gain insight into the broadband shock-noise problem. The model formulation decomposes the overall flow into a mean flow, linear instability waves, the shock-cell structure and shock-noise. The mean flow is obtained by solving RANS equations with a k − model. Locally parallel stability equations are solved for the shock structure, and linear parabolized stability equations are solved for the instability waves. Then, source terms representing the instability wave/shock-cell interaction are assembled and the inhomogeneous linearized Euler equations are solved for the shock-noise. Three cases are considered, a cold under-expanded Mj = 1. 22 jet, a hot under-expanded Mj = 1. 22 jet, and a cold over-expanded Mj = 1. 36 jet.

40|$|International audienceRolling {{noise is}} the major {{contribution}} to train pass-by noise. Array processing provides noise maps of the source location on the train. The rolling noise contribution is located around the wheels at 2 kHz on those maps and the rail is not well identified as a source, whereas models, like TWINS, estimate that its acoustical contribution {{can be in the}} same order of magnitude as the wheel contribution in the medium frequency range (1000 Hz). Flexion wave causes the rail to radiate in privileged direction due to fluid structure interaction. Beamforming processing identifies this acoustical radiation only under particular conditions, which is an explanation to the underestimation of the rail radiation on the global noise map of the train. This article presents a simple radiation model of the rail and the simulation result provided from beamforming processing to localize the theoretical <b>radiation</b> <b>angle.</b> An experimentation is performed using the classical 2 D adapted for train pass-by source localisation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{aerodynamic}} noise of a thin rigid annulus (referred {{to as the}} ring here) placed in the mixing layer of a subsonic circular jet is investigated in the paper, both theoretically and experimentally. From the experimental point of view, the jet-ring configuration is understood as an axisymmetric alternative to more usual ones involving a rectangular aerofoil held between parallel side plates, dedicated {{to the study of}} the noise due to the impingement of upstream turbulence. The main advantages of the circular geometry are a minimum background noise, the absence of tip effects and more specifically the account for all <b>radiation</b> <b>angles</b> from the surface in the far-field acoustic signature. The circular set-up is well suited for the study of pure broadband interaction noise only if the flow remains free of self-sustained oscillations. This is ensured by keeping a sufficient interaction distance between the nozzle and the ring, and by shaping serrations on the nozzle lip. From the theoretical point of view, an analytical model is derived as a straightforward extension of existing formulations. The induced unsteady lift forces on the ring are first inferred from a linearized unsteady aerodynamic theory and the far field is calculated in a second step by a radiation integral. This relates the far-field acoustic pressure power spectral density (PSD) to the two-wavenumber spectrum of the radial turbulent velocity at the ring location, by means of an aeroacoustic transfer function. The latter is shown asymptotically identical to the one detailed in the Appendix for a rectangular aerofoil, in the limit of relatively high frequencies. The analytical acoustic predictions are found to agree well with the measurements over an extended frequency range, provided that the model is fed with turbulent velocity input data measured by a hot-wire probe. Indirectly, this agreement validates the transfer function for a rectangular aerofoil at oblique <b>radiation</b> <b>angles,</b> which is not achievable in a set-up involving side plates and a rectangular nozzle...|$|R

Here the control of the propagation and radiation of SPs on silver nanowires is investigated. By covering an Al 2 O 3 layer onto a silver nanowire to change the local dielectric environment, the wave vector of the propagating SPs is increased. Thus, the radiation direction of SPs into the substrate is changed accord-ing to the phase matching condition, which is experimentally shown by Fourier imaging method. The <b>radiation</b> <b>angle</b> is sen-sitively dependent on the Al 2 O 3 thickness. By depositing 1 nm Al 2 O 3, the increase of the <b>radiation</b> <b>angle</b> can be close to 1 de-gree.
