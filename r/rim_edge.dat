The inner walls are simple slopes that run down to the relatively level and featureless floor.|$|E
50|$|This is a well-eroded crater formation, with {{a rounded}} and uneven <b>rim</b> <b>edge.</b> The {{satellite}} crater Paraskevopoulos H lies across the eastern rim, {{and the smaller}} Paraskevopoulos E {{is located in the}} northeastern part of the interior floor. The <b>rim</b> <b>edge</b> is better defined along the northern and southern edges, and is nearly worn away along the west. The surviving interior floor is relatively level and featureless, with only a pair of small craterlets along the northwestern and southeastern edges.|$|E
50|$|The crater {{inner walls}} have worn terraces, with low <b>rim</b> <b>edges</b> at the {{northern}} and southern extremes.

50|$|This is a {{worn and}} eroded crater {{formation}} that has {{still managed to}} retain much of its original shape. The remains of a small crater lie across the southern floor and inner wall of Smoluchowski, protruding outwards slightly into Poczobutt. A smaller crater lies along the inner wall of the southwestern rim, and a small craterlet lies across the north-northwestern <b>rim</b> <b>edge.</b> Along the surface connecting Smoluchowski with Paneth is an elongated depression in the surface that overlies the <b>rim</b> <b>edge</b> and inner wall of Smoluchowski. There is also a narrow groove in the surface near that site running from east to west.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to the new}} {{environmental}} regulations for fuel quality, refineries need to process cleaner fuel. This requires an improvement in performance of hydrotreating catalysts. Improvements in catalyst activity require knowledge {{of the relationships between}} catalyst morphology and activity. Molybdenum sulfide, the generally agreed catalysts that give the best performance in hydrocracking and hydrotreating was investigated for its morphology effects on hydrotreating reactions. Three types of MoS 2 catalysts with different morphology were studied. They are crystalline MoS 2, exfoliated MoS 2 and MoS 2 derived from a precursor, molybdenum naphthenate. Exfoliated MoS 2 with minimal long range order, with much higher <b>rim</b> <b>edges</b> has shown relative higher hydrogenation activity. Generally, results of MoS 2 catalyst activities in hydrogenation, hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation and hydrideoxy¬gena¬tion are in agreement with the rim-edge model...|$|R

40|$|A novel widehand dual-cavity-hacked circularly {{polarized}} (CP) crossed dipole antenna {{is presented in}} this letter. The exciter of the antenna comprises two classical orthogonal straight dipoles for a simple design. Dual-cavity structure is employed to achieve unidirectional radiation and improve the broadside gain. In particular, the <b>rim</b> <b>edges</b> of the cavity act as secondary radiators, which contribute to significantly enhance the overall CP performance of the antenna. The final design with an overall size of 0. 57 lambda(0), X 0. 57 lambda(0),, X 0. 24 lambda(0) where lambda(0) is the free -space wavelength at the lowest CP operating frequency of 2. 0 CHzb yields a measured 10 dB impedance bandwidth (BW) of 79. 4 % and 3 dB axial -ratio BW of 66. 7 %. The proposed antenna exhibits right-handed circular polarization with a maximum broadside gain of about 9. 7 Mlle...|$|R

50|$|The rim of Van Gent is {{slightly}} distorted from a circle {{due to the}} craters with which it has formed.

50|$|The <b>rim</b> or <b>edge</b> of {{a crater}} {{is the part}} that extends above {{the height of the}} local surface, usually in a {{circular}} or elliptical pattern. In a more specific sense, the rim may refer to the circular or elliptical edge that represents the uppermost tip of this raised portion. If there is no raised portion, the rim simply refers to the inside edge of the curve where the flat surface meets the curve of the crater bottom.|$|R

40|$|A crater-detection {{algorithm}} {{has been}} conceived to enable automation of what, heretofore, have been manual processes for utilizing images of craters on a celestial body as landmarks for navigating a spacecraft flying near or landing on that body. The images are acquired by an electronic camera aboard the spacecraft, then digitized, then processed by the algorithm, which consists mainly {{of the following}} steps: 1. Edges in an image detected {{and placed in a}} database. 2. Crater <b>rim</b> <b>edges</b> are selected from the edge database. 3. Edges that belong to the same crater are grouped together. 4. An ellipse is fitted to each group of crater edges. 5. Ellipses are refined directly in the image domain to reduce errors introduced in the detection of edges and fitting of ellipses. 6. The quality of each detected crater is evaluated. It is planned to utilize this algorithm as the basis of a computer program for automated, real-time, onboard processing of crater-image data. Experimental studies have led to the conclusion that this algorithm is capable of a detection rate > 93 percent, a false-alarm rate < 5 percent, a geometric error < 0. 5 pixel, and a position error < 0. 3 pixel...|$|R
