25|$|The University of Calgary Board of Governors {{chose to}} launch a medical school in the late 1960s, with the first {{tangible}} building to house this endeavor being the Health Sciences Building, which opened in 1972. The Health Sciences Building shared a site with the Foothills Medical Centre some distance south of the Main Campus. This site {{became known as the}} Health Sciences Campus, with subsequent additions being the Heritage Medical Building (opened 1987), the Health <b>Research</b> <b>Innovation</b> Centre and the Teaching, Research and Wellness building.|$|E

Buildings of note on the HSC include the fourteen story Medical Research Tower and the ten-story University Hospital.Construction is finished for a recently opened, downtown Louisville Cardiovascular <b>Research</b> <b>Innovation</b> Institute building to be directed by a researcher, Stuart Williams from the University of Arizona; and an eight-story, $70 million biomedical research building.

The facility is dedicated to health research and boasts state-of-the-art laboratories for top researchers, including several Canada Research Chairs. The facility is named in honour of a gift in 2010 of $28 million from the Li Ka Shing (Canada) Foundation that helped establish the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology ($25M) and a joint PhD program ($3M) between the university's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry and Shantou University Medical College in China.

Located in Kansas City, Missouri, UMKC {{is one of four}} system campuses that collectively constitute the University of Missouri. UMKC is spread across multiple locales; the main Volker Campus, home to the majority of university operations, is located in Kansas City's Rockhill neighborhood, east of the Country Club Plaza, and adjacent to both the Stowers Institute for Medical Research and the world-renowned Linda Hall Library. In 2017 the University, in collaboration with Truman Medical Center, Children's Mercy Hospital, the Missouri Health Department, the Jackson County Medical Examiners Office, and the Missouri Department of Mental Health Behavioral Medicine, formed the UMKC Health Sciences District on Hospital Hill. This district is a first-in-the-nation partnership between local and state governments, the university, and these nationally recognized healthcare faculties, designed to promote collaboration in <b>research,</b> <b>innovation,</b> education, grant funding, and community outreach, for the advancement of health and wellness in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area. Also in 2017, the university announced plans to expand its metropolitan identity with the construction of a downtown Campus for the Arts, located near the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts. The university's enrollment as of 2015 exceeded more than 16,600 students.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the possible applications {{of different types}} of experiment methods in <b>innovation</b> <b>research.</b> The paper argues that the experiment as a research method has been a largely missed opportunity in <b>innovation</b> <b>research,</b> in particular for creating applicable knowledge for businesses and organisations in the shape of new innovation tools and methods. The paper applies an analytically based limitation of the experiment method which includes an array of both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The use of experiments for such purposes is illustrated through a comparative study of four experiments concerning open innovation in service businesses and organisations. The case studies show how different experiment methods provide new opportunities for <b>innovation</b> <b>research</b> and how they can create new and applicable knowledge about open innovation. Thus the paper argues for applying experiments as an addition to other <b>research</b> methods in <b>innovation</b> <b>research.</b> Experiments <b>Innovation</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>research</b> Open <b>innovation</b> Services...|$|R

2500|$|The university's push {{to create}} various institutes {{has led to}} greater funding and an {{increase}} in the number of researchers in multiple fields. ASU Knowledge Enterprise Development (KED) advances <b>research,</b> <b>innovation,</b> strategic partnerships, entrepreneurship, economic development and international development. KED is led by Sethuraman Panchanathan. KED supports several interdisciplinary research institutes and initiatives: Institute for Humanities Research, NewSpace Initiative, Biodesign Institute, Institute for the Science of Teaching and Learning, Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability, Institute for Social Science Research, LightWorks, McCain Institute for International Leadership, Decision Theater Network, Flexible Electronics and Display Center, Complex Adaptive Systems @ ASU, Global Security Initiative. Other notable and famed institutes at ASU are: The Institute of Human Origins, L. William Seidman Research Institute (W. P. Carey School of Business), Learning Sciences Institute, Herberger Research Institute, and the Hispanic Research Center. Much of the research conducted at ASU is considered cutting edge with its focus on interdisciplinarity. The Biodesign Institute for instance, conducts research on issues such as biomedical and healthcare outcomes as part of a collaboration with Mayo Clinic to diagnose and treat rare diseases, including cancer. Biodesign Institute researchers have also developed various techniques for reading and detecting biosignatures which expanded in 2006 with an $18million grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The institute also is heavily involved in sustainability research, primarily through reuse of CO2 via biological feedback and various biomasses (e.g. algae) to synthesize clean biofuels. Heliae is a Biodesign Institute spin-off and much of its business centers on algal-derived, high value products. Furthermore, the institute is heavily involved in security research including technology that can detect biological and chemical changes in the air and water. The university has received more than $30million in funding from the Department of Defense for adapting this technology for use in detecting the presence of biological and chemical weapons. Research conducted at the Biodesign Institute by ASU professor Charles Arntzen made possible the production of Ebola antibodies in specially modified tobacco plants that researchers at Mapp Biopharmaceutical used to create the Ebola therapeutic ZMapp. The treatment is credited with saving the lives of two aid workers. For his work, Arntzen was named the No. 1 honoree among Fast Company's annual [...] "100 Most Creative People in Business" [...] 2015 awards.|$|E
