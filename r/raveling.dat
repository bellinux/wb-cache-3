500|$|For {{a person}} to be {{inducted}} to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor, they must have made [...] "significant contributions to the game of basketball". Of the inaugural Hall of Fame class of 1959, seven individuals were inducted as contributors, including James Naismith, the inventor of basketball.

500|$|After Wimp Sanderson {{was forced}} out as coach of Alabama in 1992, Amaker was under {{consideration}} to replace him. In 1993, he was the leading candidate to assume the head coaching job at Northwestern when Bill Foster stepped aside to serve as interim athletic director, but at age 27, he declined the job when it was offered, noting that he had only been married one year and saying [...] "It boiled down to us looking at {{a situation where we}} were extremely flattered, but a situation that wasn't right for us now." [...] That summer Amaker was one of two college basketball members of the 10-man selection committee for the United States Olympic Team. In 1994, he was on the short list to replace Kevin O'Neill, who left Marquette for a job at Tennessee. In 1995, USC was in negotiations to hire Amaker to replace interim coach Charlie Parker, who replaced George <b>Raveling</b> following a car accident. The reason his negotiations with USC failed was compensation since Amaker was both a Duke assistant coach and earned an additional $100,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) through a summer youth day camp. That summer, Duke promoted Amaker from assistant basketball coach to associate head coach. Krzyzewski returned to coaching in October 1995. USC went on to hire Parker, who did not last a full season as head coach. In 1996, Amaker was rumored to be on the short list to replace interim coach Steve Lavin at UCLA in 1997. When the Northwestern job opened up again in 1997, he was not under consideration because athletic director Rick Taylor sought a candidate with Division I head coaching postseason experience.|$|E
2500|$|As King waved {{goodbye to}} the audience, he handed George <b>Raveling</b> the {{original}} typewritten [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech. <b>Raveling,</b> an All-American Villanova Wildcats college basketball player, had volunteered {{as a security guard}} for the event and was on the podium with King at that moment. In 2013, <b>Raveling</b> still had custody of the original copy, for which he had been offered $3,000,000, but he has said he does not intend to sell it.|$|E

Citing the automobile accident and planned lengthy rehabilitation, he retired as head coach of USC {{at the age of}} 57 on November 15.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Washington {{entertained the}} ladies with {{accounts}} {{of her life}} at home. She said that in her house there were always sixteen spinning wheels at work. She showed them two morning dresses which {{had been made in}} her house from <b>ravelings</b> of old satin chair covers. But Mrs. Washington was not at all averse to cheerfulness and good company, and in that year there were many dances and parties in Morristown, which kept the place quite gay.|$|R
25|$|All her carpets {{were cut}} into blankets. All wool {{mattresses}} were ripped up and their contents spun into yarn for soldiers' socks. Even {{the hair of}} rabbits killed on the plantation was saved, and, when combined with a little wool and the <b>ravelings</b> of old black silk scraps, made a gray yarn, of which officers' gloves were knitted. All of the lead from her houses —even the lead pipes from an elaborate system of waterworks on her plantation— was sent to be melted into bullets. Before {{the end of the}} war, all her horses had gone into the army.|$|R

6000|$|As for the burlesques themselves, {{they were}} nothing, the {{performers}} personally everything. M. Offenbach had opened Lemprière's Dictionary {{to the authors}} with [...] "La Belle Hélène," [...] and there, was commonly a flimsy <b>raveling</b> of parodied myth, that held together the different dances and songs, though sometimes it was a novel or an opera burlesqued; {{but there was always}} a song and always a dance for each lady, song and dance being equally slangy, and depending for their effect mainly upon the natural or simulated personal charms of the performer.|$|E
