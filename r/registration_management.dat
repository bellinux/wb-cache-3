40|$|Several {{influential}} industry {{reports have}} pointed out that a decline in construction quality and productivity could be attributed to the performance of subcontractors who are entrusted to complete the actual works, yet subcontractor performance appraisal is a much neglected subject in construction. To facilitate subcontractor <b>registration,</b> <b>management</b> and/or selection, an equitable and reliable subcontractor performance appraisal would be indispensable. Being regarded as a reliable and practical means for performance evaluation, the balanced scorecard should have a high potential for improving the quality subcontractor appraisal decisions. This paper discusses the issues in developing a balanced scorecard model for subcontractor performance appraisal. The current practice of appraising subcontractor performance begin is first outlined. It is then followed by introducing the research methodology. The structure of the balanced scorecard model for subcontractor performance appraisal is proposed. Finally, a prototype Internet-based model for appraising subcontractors based on the balanced scorecard concept is presented. The initial results indicate {{that it is possible to}} establish a balanced scorecard model to formalise the subcontractor performance appraisal decisions. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|A clear {{understanding}} of the concept of “place” is important in virtually every aspect of daily activity, with uses and requirements ranging from the simple to the complex. Yet the meaning or designation of a place to one group (community) could be the same or more commonly very different to another community. To handle these representations a conceptual framework has been designed for the description of Place Identifiers (PIs). Although similar framework concepts exist, they require each community to follow a specific, rigid identifier scheme which in turn guarantees uniqueness across all communities. However the Place Identifier (PI) framework defines a simple and more free-form structure which allows each community to easily make use of their own identifiers, thus retaining uniqueness within their respective community, yet facilitating representations of common places between communities. The Place Identifier framework consists of a series of models which define services for the <b>registration,</b> <b>management,</b> conversion, discovery and exchange of Place Identifiers. These framework models and services have been submitted to ISO/ TC 211 for consideration as a new work item for standardization.

40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{addresses}} {{a new system}} for collaborative vocational training of employees within industrial networks. The system should enable the industrial companies ' employees, especially in SMEs, to collaborate time and cost-effectively on different training issues. The system includes a collaborative platform built following the Collaborative Reference Architecture for advanced service platforms for Collaborative Working Environments (CWE). The key layers of the platform are: Core Collaborative Services layer, orchestration layer and Content/Context Specific Collaborative Service layer. The Core Collaborative Services include services for e. g. (human) resource discovery (discovery of trainers and/or partners for collaborative learning etc.), knowledge provision (provision of eLearning resources), selection of optimal communication services within virtual classroom (e. g. chat rooms, video meetings), learning group composition, collaboration traceability etc. These services are complemented with classical eLearning functionalities such as user <b>registration,</b> <b>management</b> of courses and contents etc. The higher Content/Context Specific Service layer combines different Core Collaborative Services and content specific solutions (e. g. specific learning objects, specific knowledge etc.). The system is currently applied for the vocational training program on methods for introduction of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in networked SMEs in the recycling domain...|$|E
40|$|To come to well-grounded conclusions, spatial, {{semantic}} {{and administrative}} data {{need to be}} handled simultaneously in archaeology. This data integration is still not fully accomplished today due to the increasing time-pressure imposed by the capitalistic market and the maladjustment of GIS to archaeological data. Furthermore, exchanging and integrating archaeological data is hampered by the diverse organization- or project-specific databases. The reuse of archaeological data is consequently very limited, although valuable information is likely to result from it. Therefore, an archaeological geodata infrastructure that allows for the integration of spatial, semantic and administrative data {{will contribute to the}} data management, analysis, reuse and exchange. This paper demonstrates that the flexible Archaeological DAta Model (ADAM) can form the basis for an archaeology-specific geodata infrastructure by means of two case studies. The first case, SeArch project, focusses on the integration of different data sources and a user-friendly WebGIS and management tool for marine archaeological heritage. The second case concerns the design of an archaeological infrastructure useful for <b>registration,</b> <b>management</b> and analysis of urban excavations. By implementing the points for improvement and ideas for extension indicated by the potential end-users, the value of the application for both management and research will even increase...|$|E

40|$|Mobile IPv 6 came as an {{extensively}} acknowledged {{technology to}} support mobility in networks. Home agents {{are in charge}} for the registration of mobile devices and act as a key entity for the tunneling of data packets to the corresponding registered mobile nodes. A single home agent has an administrative control over the critical tasks including home agent <b>registration</b> <b>management,</b> maintenance of cache data and tunneling of data packets to the mobile nodes that are away from their home networks and so on. However in this approach, home agent act as the sole failure point, which {{gave rise to the}} placement of multiple home agents to overcome this issue. The load balancing mechanism for multiple home agent deployment faces the problem of improper load sharing, signaling overhead and synchronization issues. Moreover, failure detection and recovery mechanism is inefficient in nature. It experiences a significant delay in tunneling of data packets and suffers from disconnection making it incompetent for the use in real time applications. Hence, this paper investigates and analyzes the various load balancing mechanisms of mobile IPv 6. In addition, it presents the comparative study of the failure detection and recovery mechanism of existing methods. Finally, it concludes that future work can be extended in the domain of distributed active load sharing mechanism and proactive failure detection...|$|E

It is expected that several diverse devices to invade by 2020. Depending on different application domains, IoT applications require devices, sensors, middlewares, networks and other enabling technologies to be integrated e. g., the high-level central control of IoT applications can be deployed on the cloud while others are running close to the "edge", forming a unified, scalable and feasible system. One of the important integration aspects in IoT ecosystem is discovering devices and sensors based on a particular context regardless of their heterogeneity. In this thesis, we propose Context-Aware Discovery Service for Internet of Things (CADsIoT) that deals with devices and sensors installed in IoT environments, streamlining the process of <b>registration,</b> <b>management</b> and dynamic discovery of devices based on contextual information. CADsIoT allows device and sensor registration, attaching them with particular context and leverage subscription features to enable dynamic discovery based on the attached context. Additionally, real-time notifications are triggered when new devices are discovered. For the validation of our concept, we discuss the requirements and a descriptive motivation scenario, which {{is followed by a}} discussion of the prototypical implementation.

40|$|Handoff latency {{results in}} packet losses and severe End-to-End TCP {{performance}} degradation as TCP, perceiving these losses as congestion, causes source throttling or retransmission. In order to mitigate these effects, various Mobile IP(v 6) extensions {{have been designed}} to augment the base Mobile IP with hierarchical <b>registration</b> <b>management,</b> address pre-fetching and local retransmission mechanisms. While these methods have reduced the impact of losses on TCP goodput and improved handoff latency, no comparative studies have been done regarding the relative performance amongst them. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluated the impact of layer- 3 handoff latency on End-to-End TCP for various Mobile IP(v 6) extensions. Five such frameworks are compared with the base Mobile IPv 6 framework, namely, i) Hierarchical Mobile IPv 6, ii) Hierarchical Mobile IPv 6 with Fast-handover, iii) (Flat) Mobile IPv 6 with Fast-handover, iv) Simultaneous Bindings, and v) Seamless handoff architecture for Mobile IP (S-MIP). We propose an evaluation model examining the effect of linear and ping-pong movement on handoff latency and TCP goodput, for all above frameworks. Our results show that S-MIP performs best under both ping-pong and linear movements during a handoff, with latency comparable to a layer- 2 (access layer) handoff. All other frameworks suffer from packet losses and performance degradation of some sort. We also proposed an optimization for S-MIP which improves the performance by further eliminating the possibility of packets out of order, caused by the local packet forwarding mechanisms of S-MIP...|$|E
