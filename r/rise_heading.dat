5000|$|However, {{under its}} new leader, Fine Gael staged a {{recovery}} in local and European elections held on 11 June 2004, becoming the largest Irish {{party in the}} European Parliament by winning 5 seats (compared to just 4 seats for the ruling Fianna Fáil party), while it came within 9 seats of becoming the largest party in local government. The recovery for Fine Gael was complete when it gained 20 seats at the 2007 general election. The party entered into an electoral alliance with the Labour Party in Mullingar during 2005, the [...] "Alliance For Change". This election, however, did not bring Fine Gael back into power. In the local elections of 2009, Fine Gael surpassed Fiannna Fáil, gaining over 40 seats and bringing the total up to 340 compared to Fianna Fáil's 180. At European level, Fine Gael is the largest party and won the Dublin South by-election with George Lee sweeping to victory with over 54% of the vote and just missing out on a seat in Dublin Central with Paschal Donohoe, although Lee later resigned from his position after only nine months due to having [...] "virtually no influence or input" [...] into shaping Fine Gael's economic policies.In 2010, opinion polls had Labour ahead of Fine Gael with Fianna Fáil's collapse in the votes not transferring to Fine Gael. Deputy Leader Richard Bruton along with nine of the Fine Gael Front Bench challenged Enda Kenny for the leadership. In a bitter battle, Enda Kenny won the confidence vote {{of the party and}} set about healing the wounds. He reappointed Richard Bruton to the Front Bench along with bringing Michael Noonan back into the Front Bench as Spokesman on Finance. The arrival of the IMF to bail out the country's finances in November of that year saw Fianna Fáil implode. Fine Gael, with strong performances from Noonan and his team of deputies, saw Fine Gael support <b>rise</b> <b>heading</b> into the general election which was called in February 2011. Many believed Enda Kenny had a terrific campaign and the question was now whether Fine Gael could get an overall majority. When the votes were counted Fine Gael fell short with an historic seat total of 76 seats and 36.1% of the vote, becoming the largest party in the Dáil for the first time. The Fianna Fáil vote collapsed to 17.4% and 20 seats in the Dáil, compared to 41.6% and 77 seats at the previous general election. A new government was formed with the Labour Party under the leadership of Enda Kenny as Taoiseach. He had led the party from the abyss to the greatest victory in their history and now had the largest party in the state.|$|E

The extension, which features a convolution integral of the background head, is closed form for linear trends. A sensitivity study suggests that a <b>rising</b> background <b>head</b> can diminish the head changes associated with a slug-out test and underestimate k if it is ignored, as does falling background trend with a slug-in test.

40|$|The {{interest}} of the average student of history lies {{not so much in}} the actions of the crowd as in the figures who have <b>risen</b> <b>head</b> and shoulders above their times and have in many cases given them names. It is perhaps also this inclination which gives to all great historians their decided partialities without which there would be no spice or savour in their perusal. Such an individual was Caius Julius Caesar. The vehemence of denunc:_ation accorded him by Oman is counterbalanced by the laudatory idolization of Mommsen. In fact, so evident is this trait even in the original sources for the life of Caesar that the neophyte of history finds great difficulty, but incidentally great interest in establishinghis own point of view.
