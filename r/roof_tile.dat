The Old Mangalore Port is a fishing port located at Bunder in Mangalore, where {{a large number of}} mechanised boats anchor. The traffic at this port was 122,000 tonnes during the years 2003–04. Fishing is a traditional occupation, and the products are exported to the surrounding regions. Mangalorean firms have a major presence in the tile, beedi, coffee, and cashew nut industry, although the tile industry has declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque tile factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> manufacturing factories. The Ullal suburb of Mangalore produces hosiery and coir yarns, while beedi rolling is an important source of revenue to many in the city.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship of}} certain red ceramic <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> properties to <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> biodeterioration. The following properties were studied: apparent porosity, roughness, and {{the presence or absence}} of two types of coatings. The effect of apparent porosity was studied by varying the peak firing temperature of a standard industrial red ceramic <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> composition and by preparing several clay mixtures, of different chemical and mineralogical composition, that were fired at various peak temperatures. The effect of <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> roughness was determined by either polishing or sanding fired standard red <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles.</b> A waterproof ceramic glaze coating and a photocatalytic coating were formulated to analyse the effect of the presence of different types of coatings. <b>Roofing</b> <b>tile</b> bioreceptivity was evaluated with a method developed in a previous study using the cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp, which enabled <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> resistance to microbial colonization to be determined. As expected, bioreceptivity rose as apparent porosity (measured as water absorption) increased, enabling possible water retention, which favours biological growth. Similarly, greater roughness encouraged micro-organism adhesion and 2 raised bioreceptivity. It was found that, after prolonged exposure periods (several months) under very favourable conditions for biological colonization, <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> coated with the waterproof ceramic glaze were colonized. However, glazed standard red <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> covered with a TiO 2 photocatalytic coating exhibited practically no biological growth under the test conditions used, even after long exposure times, owing to the chemical-physical effect of the TiO 2 -based coating...|$|R

Despite its name, it is unlikely that it had a religious function. Nearly a third of the mostly 14th- to 16th-century pottery found within the larger and earlier of the two rooms was imported from the continent, suggesting significant international trade at this time.|$|E
500|$|Understanding {{that the}} gates were too narrow for his army to exit {{in an orderly}} fashion, Pyrrhus ordered Helenus to tear down part of the wall and to be {{prepared}} to fend off any enemy counter-attacks against the retreating troops. However, the instructions brought by the messenger were unclear and instead of organising the retreat, Helenus advanced {{with the rest of the}} army into Argos. With the majority of his troops streaming in through the gates, Pyrrhus' line of retreat was blocked off. The disorder was exacerbated when Pyrrhus' largest elephant fell and blocked the gateway and another elephant started running amok after his mahout was felled. [...] The weight of the enemy's assault pushed Pyrrhus and his troops from the agora and compelled them to fight in the narrow street leading to the Diamperes Gate. In the fighting which ensued, Pyrrhus was wounded by a spear wielded by an Argive. As Pyrrhus turned to strike down his assailant, he was hit on the head by a <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> thrown by his attacker's mother. Pyrrhus was either killed by the force of the tile's impact or, alternately, having fallen dazed from his horse he was decapitated by one of Antigonus' Macedonian soldiers, Zopyrus. Pyrrhus' head was brought by Halcyoneus to Antigonus, who expressed dismay when he saw it and upbraided his son for acting in such a barbarous manner. Upon Pyrrhus' death, Epiriote resistance crumbled and Antigonus accepted the surrender of Helenus, giving him Pyrrhus' body for burial.|$|E

2500|$|Death is {{inevitable}} and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact {{in order to live}} passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, [...] "I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend." [...] This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. [...] We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, now, is going to decide which life was easier, whether it was the [...] life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death? ...|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
