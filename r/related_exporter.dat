This paper tests the impact of exogenous domestic accessibility variation on export. By employing a transaction-level customs database, empirical results find benefited exporters (use rail freight) increase the export value to Central Asia by around 30 % compared with exporters use other freight modes, and exporters use rail freight but enjoy limited speeded-up mileage. The speed-up effect is due to mixed channels: net export creation, export diversion in freight modes and exporters. Increase in export value of <b>related</b> <b>exporters</b> is exerted by export expansion of existing exporters but not entry of new exporters. This paper also finds exports of medium value products benefit most from speed-up, which are more sensitive to shipping efficiency than low and high value products. Overall, speed-up effect on regional development of Xinjiang is two-fold. It weakens the function of Xinjiang as the hub, but promotes its export in other international markets by better accessibility to coast...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{an organizational}} behavior paradigm {{which states that}} strategies adopted by entrepreneurs influence {{the growth of a}} firm. Drawing upon international literature, it is assumed that attributes <b>related</b> to <b>exporters</b> are closer to those of the so-called best practice. The efforts of the government in improving the business environment and making it more investment-friendly are also acknowledged. Furthermore, it investigates the difference between exporters and non-exporters in terms of entrepreneurial orientation, decision-making style, and strategies...|$|R

40|$|In {{almost the}} last decade, rattan {{industrial}} cluster in Cirebon Region {{that has been}} known as the biggest rattan industrial cluster in Indonesia deals with so many problems such as decreasing number of raw materials supply and low price of the product. To overcome these problems, based on the theoretical perspective (Schmitz, 1990, Van Djik and Sverrisson, 2003), identification of the linkages pattern of the industrial activity would be important as the preliminary analysis to help the cluster. Therefore, this article shows the existing profile of the linkages pattern in the rattan industrial cluster in Cirebon. The horizontal linkages tend to develop as the infrequent intensity and reclusive cooperation between firms. On results, the quality of cooperation between firms and subcontractors within cluster are superficial. Moreover, there is no equal position among <b>related</b> players (<b>exporters,</b> suppliers, and buyers). In conclusion, for building a better self sufficiency of the rattan industrial cluster, all related players should increase the quality of linkages by developing long-term and mutual linkages in every activity in the cluster...|$|R

In this hypothetical case {{study the effects of}} Iran’s accession to WTO on four different groups including flower producers, flower exporters, flower importers, and flower distributors have been evaluated. In order to test the hypotheses of the research; one-sample t-test was used. The results indicated that Iran’s accession to WTO would increase direct foreign investment, competitive strength of flower <b>exporters,</b> <b>related</b> job opportunities, number of modern greenhouses, foreign exchange earnings, area under flower cultivation, and number of international flower distributor companies in Iran’s flower industry. The results also showed that Iran’s accession to WTO would not increase the annual amount of flower imports to Iran and would not decrease the size of Iranian flowers domestic market and the price of flower production’s raw materials...|$|R
40|$|An idea {{widely shared}} among {{international}} business scholars, economists and geographers is that geographic, cultural and psychic distance to market affects firm internationalisation {{in a number}} of ways. However, evidence for this broad proposition remains inconclusive. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of four separate hypotheses pertaining to the location of markets, the sequence of market entry, the rate of international expansion, and the relationship between sequentially-linked markets. In contrast with previous studies, the analysis is based on a large sample of non-repetitive foreign market entries (n= 1132) made by diverse exporters in dissimilar locations within a single country (China). Market entry data thus exhibit substantial variation on the constructs of interest. The results reveal virtually no support for three traditional hypotheses linking distance to market with the sequence of markets entered and the rate of foreign expansion. This study challenges the long-held notion that there is a simple link between distance and market entry sequence. However, this study provides arguably the first demonstration of the "near-market effect" in the context of low-risk entry modes such as exporting. Specifically, the results show that consecutive export locations tend to be culturally <b>related</b> suggesting that <b>exporters</b> are able to transfer learning between similar markets.

40|$|Copper is an {{important}} trace element for many organisms, but toxic at elevatedconcentrations. This thesis covered three issues of copper homeostasis in Corynebacteriumglutamicum, a Gram-positive soil bacterium serving as a model organism in microbial biotechnology. The first subject aimed at the structure determination of the sensor kinase CopS. CopS is amembrane-bound histidine kinase with two transmembrane helices {{and part of the}} two-componentsignal transduction system CopSR, which is required for sensing elevated copper concentrations andactivating transcription of a set of genes involved in the copper stress response. It is assumed thatCopS senses the extracellular copper concentration via a very short extracytoplasmic domain locatedbetween the two transmembrane helices. Two different approaches were pursued for CopS structureelucidation. On the one hand, the complete CopS protein was overproduced in Escherichia coli,purified and crystallized. However, the crystals showed inner asymmetry and therefore could not beused for X-ray structure determination. On the other hand, attempts were made to apply solid-stateNMR for structure determination. As the complete CopS was too large for this approach, a series of 14 C-terminally shortened CopS derivatives were constructed and tested with respect tooverproduction and purification. One of the variants turned out to be suitable for further analysis,termed NGHMCopS 206. The methods for overproduction, purification, and reconstitution intoproteoliposomes of this derivative were carefully optimized to achieve the maximal protein yield. The solid-state NMR measurement of the resulting proteoliposomes showed that the mobility of thesample was too high and only the amino acids of the two transmembrane helices were detectable. The second subject of this thesis dealt with the definition of the copper starvation stimulonof C. glutamicum. For this purpose, a transcriptome comparison was performed with wild-type cellscultivated under copper starvation and copper sufficiency. Of the 46 genes with a more than 2 -foldaltered mRNA level (p-value ≤ 0. 05) under copper starvation, 25 and 21 genes showed increased anddecreased expression, respectively. The cydABDC genes encoding cytochrome bd oxidase and afunctionally <b>related</b> ABC-type <b>exporter</b> showed the strongest increased mRNA levels, whereas thectaE-qcrAB genes encoding subunits of the cytochrome bc 1 -aa 3 supercomplex showed decreasedmRNA levels. This indicated a switch from a copper-dependent to a copper-independent terminaloxidase...|$|R

Distinct from ruminants, small herbivores typically {{have a simple}} stomach but an enlarged cecum to harbor symbiotic microbes; however, knowledge of this specialized gut structure and characteristics of its microbial contents is limited. Here, we used leaf-eating flying squirrels as a model to explore functional characteristics of the cecal microbiota adapted to a high-fiber, toxin-rich diet. Specifically, environmental conditions across gut regions were evaluated by measuring mass, pH, feed particle size, and metabolomes. Then, parallel metagenomes and metatranscriptomes were used to detect microbial functions corresponding to the cecal environment. Based on metabolomic profiles, > 600 phytochemical compounds were detected, although many were present only in the foregut and probably degraded or transformed by gut microbes in the hindgut. Based on metagenomic (DNA) and metatranscriptomic (RNA) profiles, taxonomic compositions of the cecal microbiota were dominated by bacteria of the Firmicutes taxa; they contained major gene functions related to degradation and fermentation of leaf-derived compounds. Based on functional compositions, genes <b>related</b> to multidrug <b>exporters</b> were rich in microbial genomes, whereas genes involved in nutrient importers were rich in microbial transcriptomes. In addition, genes encoding chemotaxis-associated components and glycoside hydrolases specific for plant beta-glycosidic linkages were abundant in both DNA and RNA. This exploratory study provides findings which may help to form molecular-based hypotheses regarding functional contributions of symbiotic gut microbiota in small herbivores with folivorous dietary habits...|$|R
40|$|The {{contemporary}} business finance {{have a lot}} of modalities of involving in {{the international}} market with different options. Twenty years ago, financial aspects and insurance of export transactions especially in international practice have been successfully solved by application of forfeiting model. The forfeiting is a medium-term transaction mainly which basic subject is right to buy claim with maturity from 6 to 60 months, and mainly related to drafts. In essence, this transaction mean the purchase of securities in order to cover claims with maturity in future related to delivery of goods and services, mainly of export character without the owner's right to demand payment. The right to claim is based both on a draft (which is the most frequent subject of forfeiting because of its simple form and long tradition) and on any other financial instrument. As a rule, the exporter is owner and seller of claim. He accept the draft as a cover for payment of exported goods or services in order to speed-up the collection, and transferring the risk of collection on forfeiter (any person buying a securities without the owner's right to demand payment from previous owner). As a compensation, he receive the reduced value of security and providing a necessary liquid assets immediately in that way. Buying a securities without the owner's right to demand payment from previous owner (exporter), the forfeiter accept all risks from <b>exporter</b> <b>related</b> to the collection in certain transaction...|$|R
40|$|Agrobacterium radiobacter K 84, used {{worldwide}} to biocontrol {{crown gall disease}} {{caused by}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens, produces an antiagrobacterial compound called agrocin 84. We report the nucleotide sequence of pAgK 84, a 44. 42 -kb plasmid coding for production of this disubstituted adenine nucleotide antibiotic. pAgK 84 encodes 36 ORFs, 17 of which (agn) code for synthesis of or immunity to agrocin 84. Two genes, agnB 2 and agnA, encode aminoacyl tRNA synthetase homologues. We {{have shown that the}} toxic moiety of agrocin 84 inhibits cellular leucyl-tRNA synthetases and AgnB 2, which confers immunity to the antibiotic, is a resistant form of this enzyme. AgnA, a truncated homologue of asparaginyl tRNA synthetase could catalyze the phosphoramidate bond between a precursor of the methyl pentanamide side group and the nucleotide. We propose previously undescribed chemistry, catalyzed by AgnB 1, to generate the precursor necessary for this phosphoramidate linkage. AgnC 7 is related to ribonucleotide reductases and could generate the 3 ′-deoxyarabinose moiety of the nucleoside. Bioinformatics suggest that agnC 3, agnC 4, and agnC 6 contribute to maturation of the methyl pentanamide, whereas agnC 2 may produce the glucofuranose side group bound to the adenine ring. AgnG is <b>related</b> to bacterial <b>exporters.</b> An agnG mutant accumulated agrocin 84 intracellularly but did not export the antibiotic. pAgK 84 is transmissible and encodes genes for conjugative DNA processing but lacks a type IV secretion system, suggesting that pAgK 84 transfers by mobilization. By sequence analysis, the deletion engineered into pAgK 1026 removed the oriT and essential tra genes, confirming the enhanced environmental safety of this modified form of pAgK 84...|$|R
