25|$|The {{emphasis}} on exporting commodities rather than manufactures underpinned {{a significant increase}} in Australia's terms of trade during the rise in commodity prices since 2000. However, due to a colonial heritage a lot of companies operating in Australia are foreign-owned and as a result, Australia has had persistent current account deficits for over 60 years despite periods of positive net merchandise exports; given the net income outlay between Australia and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> always negative.

25|$|In trade terms, the Australian {{economy has}} had {{persistently}} large current account deficits (CADs) {{for more than}} 50 years. One single factor that undermines balance of payments is Australia's narrow export base, making it highly sensitive to the volatility of global primary product prices. In addition, due to a colonial heritage {{a lot of companies}} operating in Australia are foreign-owned and as a result, Australia's net income outlay between it and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> always negative; this results in persistent current account deficits even during times of positive net merchandise exports.|$|E
25|$|The gap {{caused by}} the digital divide in China is {{beginning}} to close. The percentage of the Chinese population using the internet has been increasing dramatically each year. In the year 2000 only 1.7 percent of the Chinese population were internet users. By 2010 that percentage had increased to 31.6 percent of the population. This data shows that the gap separating China and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> closing. However, the digital divide among Chinese citizens remains strong. Many Chinese citizens {{are faced with the}} issues of the digital divide because of their income, education, or location. While China has made great strides in improving the country's communication infrastructure as well as narrowing the overall digital divide, there remains a divide between urban and rural areas of the country. This divide between rural and urban, developed and under developed, is illustrated in the lack of ICTs between the western (i.e., Xinjiang province) and eastern (i.e., Jiangsu province) parts of the country.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of Tribunal were {{generally}} positive, though to lesser amounts {{than was the}} case for Morrowind. Aggregate scoring sites gave the game generally favourable scores: Metacritic, a score of 80; GameRankings, a score of 82. Most critics commented on the greater linearity of the experience, combined with a reduction in the total size of the play area, giving the changes mixed reviews. GameSpot reported sullenly on the change: [...] "it's somewhat surprising that the Tribunal expansion confines your adventures to the relatively small setting of the municipality Mournhold," [...] and that, in light of this change, [...] "Tribunal doesn't have many of the features that made Morrowind so appealing." [...] IGN stated that although [...] "you'll rarely lose sight of what you're doing or why," [...] a fact that may make the game more [...] "comprehensible" [...] for some players, [...] "the lack of interaction with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> pretty depressing." [...] RPGamer, by contrast, was unequivocally positive about the change: [...] "Bethesda ... neatly sidesteps two of the most difficult atmospheric flaws of Morrowind—the constant sense of emptiness, and the bland outdoor landscapes—by having the story take place entirely within the city of Mournhold .... This smaller, tighter playing field ensures that every minor detail can and does get attention." ...|$|E

Along with his dog, a neophyte thief, and a princess, Lucas fulfills a prophecy of a [...] "chosen one" [...] pulling Needles from the earth to wake a sleeping dragon and determine {{the fate of the}} world. The game features a lighthearted plot, with characters such as [...] "partying ghosts" [...] and [...] "talking rope snakes". Mother 3 is a single-player, simple role-playing video game played with two buttons: one for starting conversations and checking adjacent objects, and another for running. The game updates the turn-based, Dragon Quest-style battle system with a [...] "rhythm-action mechanic", which lets the player take additional turns to attack the enemy by chaining together up to sixteen taps in time with the background music. Apart from this, the battle system and [...] "rolling HP meter" [...] (where health ticks down like an odometer such that players can outrun the meter to heal before dying) are similar to EarthBound.|$|E

2500|$|... "New Reform", {{both in the}} United States and in Britain and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>is</b> {{characterized}} by larger affinity to traditional forms and diminished emphasis on harmonizing them with prevalent beliefs. Concurrently, it is also more inclusive and accommodating, even towards beliefs that are officially rejected by Reform theologians, sometimes allowing alternative differing rites for each congregation to choose from. Thus, prayerbooks from the mid–20th Century onwards incorporated more Hebrew, and restored such elements as blessing on phylacteries. More profound changes included restoration of the Gevorot benediction in the 2007 Mishkan T'filah, with the optional [...] "give life to all/revive the dead" [...] formula. The CCAR stated this passage did not reflect a belief in Resurrection, but Jewish heritage. On the other extreme, the 1975 Gates of Prayer substituted [...] "the Eternal One" [...] for [...] "God" [...] in the English translation (though not in the original), a measure that was condemned by several Reform rabbis as a step toward religious humanism.|$|E
2500|$|One {{consequence}} of employer-based coverage (as opposed to single-payer or government-funded via individual taxes) is that employers facing increasing healthcare costs offset the expense by either paying relatively less or hiring fewer workers. Since health insurance benefits paid by employers are not treated as income to employees, the government foregoes a sizable amount of tax revenue each year. This subsidy or tax expenditure was estimated by CBO at $281 billion in 2017.
