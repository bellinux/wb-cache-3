5|$|On 16 October 2010, Diarra was {{involved}} in a controversial dispute, which resulted in the player being banned from playing league football for six matches. After receiving a yellow card booking from referee Wilfriend Bien in the team's 1–0 win over Auxerre, Diarra responded by pushing the referee with both hands. He was immediately shown a red card and dismissed from the match. After walking off the field, Diarra turned back, walked over to Bien and apologized for the confrontation. After the match, Diarra apologized again for the incident. He was supported by his former coach Laurent Blanc who stated that Diarra made a simple mistake that he immediately regretted as soon as he <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did. Diarra was initially suspended for three matches, however, following a November tribunal by the Ligue de Football Professionnel, his suspension was upgraded to six matches. Diarra returned to the team on 27 November playing only the first half in the team's 1–1 draw with Lille.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the tension}} between the two men during the production, when Price saw the movie the {{following}} year, he admitted that he finally understood what Reeves had been after and wrote the young director a ten-page letter praising the film. Reeves wrote Price back, [...] "I knew you would think so." [...] Years after Reeves's death, Price said, [...] "...I <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted was a low-key, very laid-back, menacing performance. He did get it, but I was fighting him almost every step of the way. Had I known what he wanted, I would have cooperated." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryszard Siwiec ( [...] ; 7 March 1909 — 12 September 1968) was a Polish {{accountant}} and former Home Army resistance member {{who was the}} first person to commit suicide by self-immolation in protest against the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Although his act was captured by a motion picture camera, Polish press omitted any mention of the incident, which was successfully suppressed by the authorities. Siwiec prepared his plan alone, and few people <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> tried to achieve with his sacrifice. His story remained mostly forgotten until the fall of communism, when it was first recounted in a documentary film by Polish director Maciej Drygas. Since then, Siwiec has been posthumously awarded a number of Czech, Slovak, and Polish honors and decorations.|$|E
500|$|Hawks's {{first film}} The Road to Glory {{was based on}} a 35-page {{treatment}} that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are lost films. The film starred May McAvoy as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend Rockliffe Fellowes and her father Ford Sterling, with Leslie Fenton playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, [...] "It didn't have any fun in it. It was pretty bad. I don't think anybody enjoyed it except a few critics." [...] Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done wrong when Sol Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "Look, you've shown you can make a picture, but for God's sake, go out and make entertainment." ...|$|E

2500|$|His most {{prominent}} appearance came in [...] "Auto-Berserk" [...] alongside Inferno. After {{a battle with}} the Decepticons ended with Red Alert being damaged by one of Rumble's missiles, the Autobot became paranoid that Inferno {{and the others were}} out to get him. Red Alert deserted and teamed up with Starscream (who had been abandoned by the Decepticons on the battlefield and decided to take revenge on Megatron) to steal an Autobot device called the Negavator. The conspirators succeeded in sneaking in the secret bunker where the Negavator was placed. But then the alarm system had snapped into action, and the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, appeared in the bunker just in the moment when the two chums tried to move the weapon away. But the Decepticons, headed by Megatron, arrived there, too. Megatron demanded Starscream to hand over the Negavator to him, and the latter agreed hastily, with the purpose of avoiding his leader's wrath. But Red Alert refused to give up the weapon, and the recent allies began to fight. After a blast in the abdomen by Starscream's Null Ray cured his paranoia glitch, Red Alert <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done and destroyed the Negavator, setting fire to the cavern they were in - and a guilty Inferno rushed into the fire to save Red Alert's life. After this, Red Alert realized who his true friends were.|$|E
