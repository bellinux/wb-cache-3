Civil Engineering students designed and manufactured pumps, then tested them to investigate head-discharge relationships. In this project, students in a junior-level introductory fluid mechanics class worked in teams to design and build simple <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> <b>pumps.</b> The project was assigned {{in the middle of}} a 15 -week semester, and spanned a period of about five weeks. Students had to determine pump discharge as a function of piston size, stroke length, and speed of operation. Based upon specific design constraints, students had to select a particular motor to use with their pump. Students then worked in the machine shop, fabricating the pumps from stock materials. Completed pumps were then tested in a competition between teams to determine maximum discharge and pressure head. This project enabled students to apply basic fluid mechanics principles early on in their fluids-related coursework by designing and building working pumps. The early exposure to all elements of design, testing, and evaluation aided student understanding of the basic concepts of fluid mechanics, and familiarized students with design and fabrication techniques...|$|R

40|$|For delivery, dosing and {{pressure}} control of fluids in mobile and stationary applications electromagnetically operated piston pumps are an established solution. The volume per stroke is exactly {{defined by the}} geometry. Nevertheless cavitation, more likely with the new fuel blends containing {{a high proportion of}} ethanol / 1 /, deteriorates the dosing precision of the liquid portion. One important criterion of precise metering is the transport of the liquids through the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> without transferring bubbles. Especially, pumping in the range of vapour pressure of gasoline fuels implies challenges for precision. The objective of this work is revealing potential sources of reduced cavitation by optimising the design. For doing so, optical investigations have been applied. In addition to this, cavitation can be diminished controlling the piston’s travel externally. The second important item covers pumping of degenerated fluids even without negative effects on the pump’s performance. Up to now, wide, inefficient gaps or high force surplus are necessary. A new helix-design / 2 / has been investigated and built up {{in order to reduce the}} described effort. The effects coming with the helix allow a permanent rinsing of the stressed surfaces, leading to lubrication and lower temperature loads.

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} of water-based <b>reciprocating</b> triplex <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> {{was conducted to}} propose a low cost solution for the substitution of the traditional oil hydraulics to water hydraulics. Triplex pumps used in this investigation as the water hydraulics require continuous pumping.

Thus, an evaluation of the triplex pump using a simple simulation process that focuses on the volumetric efficiency has been conducted in order to understand its ability in energy-efficient system. In this paper, the results of a simulated study of a positive displacement triplex <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> are presented.

40|$|Key words:sucker rods;crack;non-metallic inclusions;segregation; Stress corrosion; {{fracture}} Abstract: Multiple {{types of}} analysis and examinations {{are applied to}} analyze the causes of rupture for a sucker rod made of 20 CrMo alloy. Based on the results from macro- and micro-fracture analysis, chemical composition analysis, mechanics test and metallographic examination, the generation of cracks {{can be attributed to}} the irregularity and impurity in the coating of sucker rod; the stress fatigue from pulling and pressing and the stress corrosion. There is severe banded segregation, non-metal impurity and un-dissolved ferrite in the interior of the rod, meanwhile the poor heat treatment causes the property differences between the surface and core structures of the rod, thus reduces the overall properties of fatigue- and corrosion-resistance. Stress corrosion makes pits from cracks; the expansion of such corrosion pits reduces the size of effective loading area; and the failure to endure service load due to the reduction of loading area finally causes sudden rupture of the rod. This analysis is on the causes of rupture for a sucker rod made of 20 CrMo alloy, and the analysis is trusted by the Quality Supervision Test center of an oilfield in China. A sucker rod is used in the oil industry to join together the surface and down-hole components of a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> installed in an oil well; when counting top-down, it is the very first among...|$|E

However, for a certain numher of applications neither the traditional engineering approach for characterising rheological problems [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] nor the Bingham approach [12], [13], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] in ihe case of pumping performance may be considered more than just a first approximation for mix pumpabiliiy detemination as it has been shown by some authors [13], [19]. They had shown also the need of exploring in deep how rheological parameters behaves under real on site pumping condiiions [4], [6], [7] as suitabiliiy of the mix depends mainly on the trihology of the steel/concrete interface and on the pumping process parameters [7], [20]. The final aim 0 f present authors research [20] is the development 0 f a simple, affordable, and easy to apply pumping rheometer for allowing mix design [21]. On the other hand. a second goal is to provide a real time method for controlling "on line" the concrete pumping process [12], [20] for a given pumpable mix which will allow: 1) to regulate concrete flow according to actual mix properties. 2) an accurate determination of the pumped volume on real time [20] and 3) to implement an online quality control tool.

Increased kinetic Kill Vehicles (KV) capabilities (higher. v and acceleration capability) will especially be needed for boost phase engagements where a lower mass KV DACS enables smaller overall interceptors. To increase KV performance while reducing the total DACS dry mass ( 0. 8 and a vehicle propulsion dry mass of {approx} 3 kg. Our current approach uses the non-toxic propellants 90 % hydrogen peroxide and kerosene. This approach enables faster development at lower costs due to the ease of handling.

40|$|<b>Reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> piezohydraulic <b>pumps</b> were {{developed}} originally under the Smart Wing Phase II program (Lynch) and later under the CHAP program (CSA, Kinetic Ceramics). These pumps focused on 10 cm scale stack actuators operating below resonance and, more recently, at resonance. A survey of commercially available linear actuators indicates that obtaining power density and specific power greater than electromagnetic linear actuators requires driving the stacks at frequencies greater than 1 KHz at high fields. In {{the case of}} 10 cm scale actuators the power supply signal conditioning becomes large and heavy and the soft PZT stack actuators generate {{a lot of heat}} due to internal losses. Reciprocation frequencies can be increased and material losses significantly decreased through use of millimeter scale single crystal stack actuators. We are presently targeting the design of pumps that utilize stacks at the 1 - 10 mm length scale and run at reciprocating frequencies of 20 kHz or greater. This offers significant advantages over current approaches including eliminating audible noise and significantly increasing the power density and specific power of the system (including electronics). The pump currently under development will comprise an LC resonant drive of a resonant crystal and head mass operating against a resonant fluid column. Each of these resonant systems are high Q and together should produce a single high Q second order system...|$|R

Because a liquid can conform to an irregular chamber volume, the surface {{area to volume ratio}} in the gas chamber can be maximized using a liquid piston.
