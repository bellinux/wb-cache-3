40|$|It {{is shown}} that retroreflectorized {{materials}} are excellent {{for increasing the}} visibility of obstacles and therefore that they can increase traffic safety. There is {{a great variety of}} <b>reflectorized</b> material available, and therefore a reasonable selection can be made for any application. There are, however, gaps in information about <b>reflectorized</b> materials. Due to this and also due to technical developments in the design and the fabrication of <b>reflectorized</b> materials, it often happens that very different specifications are formulated for similar applications. Also many of the (legal) specifications are much lower than can be obtained with the modern materials available now. It is therefore concluded: (1) to make functional specifications for the retroreflectorized materials for the different applications; (2) to classify retroflective materials in order {{to see if there are}} suitable materials for all applications; (3) to develop materials for application areas for which no materials are available at the moment; and (4) to make international accepted specifications for the light reflecting characteristics of retroflectors and <b>reflectorized</b> materials...|$|E

Solutions for the problem of photographing the plates are also given. A number of requirements are not given in this report. These are of a technical nature and relate to resistance to impact. bending. vibration. corrosion and the effects of petrol. And also the requirements regarding adhesion of the reflectorizing coating and securing of the plates. An interim report on a number of findings from the investigations was completed in May 1968. These findings were elucidated for government authorities during laboratory and road demonstrations. arranged at SWOV's request by the Institute for Perception RVO-TNO (Visuology Department).

40|$|Pavement markers are pre-manufactured, <b>reflectorized</b> {{devices that}} provide {{positive}} in-roadway delineation at night, especially during inclement weather and {{in areas where}} roadway alignment variations dictate guidance that cannot be achieved by pavement markings and roadside delineation alone.

TYPES OF PAVEMENT MARKERS Pavement markers are composed of a base material that is designed to resist impacts from traffic and to provide an adherent surface securing the marker to the roadway. Some agencies use a series of hard, non-reflectorized raised markers to form a line where overhead lighting is available. Other agencies require that all pavement markers be <b>reflectorized.</b> The retroreflective surface can either be reflective sheeting or a prismatic reflector.

40|$|Two {{independent}} studies, each employing 12 subjects {{sitting in}} a stationary car on an unused airport runway with low beams on, were conducted to determine the distance at which a shape coded, reflector-ized warning plate can be recognized at night {{as a function of}} target brightness. Recognition distances were recorded for a balanced combi-nation of 15 experimental conditions consisting of 3 different spe-cific intensity levels of target brightness (high 1080 cd/fc/sq ft at. 2 degrees observation angle and- 4 degrees entrance angle; medium 305 cd/fc/sq ft and low 105 cd/fc/sq ft) and 5 different shapes of equal area (18 square inches) targets (rectangle, circle, square, triangle, octagon). Study 1 used a car heading angle of 10 degrees to the right while Study 2 used a car heading angle of- 3 degrees to the left. Results of these studies indicated that increasing target brightness had either no effect or only a small effect on target recognition dis-tance, and the triangle (the object with the longest sides) was recog-nized at the largest distance and with the fewest errors. Targets were also recognized further away at the 10 degree car heading angle (less beam illumination) than at the- 3 degree car heading angle (near maximum beam illumination).

40|$|Interior spaces, such as conference rooms, require {{multiple}} {{forms of}} lighting to meet different task needs. Linear fluorescent lamp fixtures commonly produce the general ambient light, and <b>reflectorized</b> halogen lamp fixtures produce the directional lighting. Current lighting practice uses multiple light source technologies and fixtures {{to achieve the}} required illumination for the various tasks. However, many light fixtures can create an unappealing architectural design, especially in a small space, and multiple light source technologies can cause maintenance difficulties. The ideal scenario would be to create one fixture with a single type of light source that could meet a variety of lighting needs. The size, potential energy savings, and reduced maintenance benefits of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) make them attractive for use in general illumination applications. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was to investigate whether a light fixture could be designed with white LEDs to provide different beam distributions. A commercially available ray tracing package was utilized to model, analyze, and optimize light fixture concepts created using LEDs and light guides. The fixtures were optimized for light output distribution and efficiency. While a rectangular-shaped light guide with simple diffused reflective surfaces provided the necessary cosine beam distribution, a more sophisticated surface treatment was required on the light extracting surface of the light guide to create the batwing beam distributions. The surface finish structures were in the form of micro-prism arrays. By switching LED arrays on and off to different light guides, variou...|$|E

One severe, often fatal, type of accident occurs when mobile equipment operators fail to see other workers and, as a result, hit them. This occurs largely because of the poor visibility in the mines. This study, consisting of two experiments, investigates the use of retroreflective material to increase worker conspicuity, as measured by both detection and form recognition accuracy scores. A one-fifth scale simulation of the perceptual task was created using dolls dressed as miners. In Experiment I, 12 participants viewed four dolls each wearing a different amount of 400 rep retroreflective material. Four configurations were used: Cap Only, reflective tape on the helmet; Armbands, tape on helmet, belt, and upper arms; Zebra Shirt, tape on the upper body (front and back), helmet and upper arms; and Full Suit, tape on helmet and entire body. In Experiment II, 9 participants viewed the Cap Only and Armbands, as in Experiment I, and a Belt Only configuration in which only the helmet and belt were <b>reflectorized.</b> Participants in both experiments viewed each doll in three body positions: Crawling Away, Kneeling to the Side, and Crawling to the Side at each of three Locations in the visual field: 10 ??, 25 ??, and 45 ?? to the line-of-sight.

The results of the simulations showed a handsome potential savings, over several standard glazing types, for selective transmitters of both the fixed and switchable variety. Fixed transmitters were also excellent performers,several configurations offering savings often only slightly lower than the highest savings attained in the switchable group. The switchable transmitter group contained glazings which produced the lowest annual loads. The primary reductions were made in cooling loads without dramatic increases in lighting loads, but heating savings, resulting primarily from glazing materials of high thermal resistance, proved to be significant in cold climates. by William A.
