40|$|Abstract. —Flight {{initiation}} distance (FID) is {{the distance}} to which a predator is permitted to approach before the prey initiates flight behavior. This can be influenced by factors including predator density and distance to cover. We measured flight initiation distances in two populations of Western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis), one in a rural and one in an urban environment. Lizards at the <b>rural</b> site initiated <b>flight</b> at significantly longer distances than those at the urban site. These results support the prediction that lizard behavior can be influenced by differences in human exposure and predator recognition in their environments. Lizards develop tolerance to humans in urban areas {{in order to maximize}} fitness by reserving energy and utilizing resources for longer periods of time. The findings from this study demonstrate that researchers should be aware of differences in human exposure between populations of study animals and should choose study sites appropriately when designing FID studies...|$|R
40|$|Escape {{strategies}} of animals are economic decisions, expected to vary {{as a function}} of both intrinsic (e. g., performance ability) and extrinsic factors (e. g., level of threat and microhabitat). Anthropogenic disturbance, especially urbanization, changes a range of environmental factors including habitat characteristics and predation risk. As a consequence of differences in microhabitat structure and repeated exposure to anthropogenic disturbance, we hypothesize that animals in urban environments will be less risk averse than those in rural environments. Here, we examined the importance of extrinsic and intrinsic factors to understand the escape {{strategies of}} Psammophilus dorsalis across an urban-rural gradient. First, urban lizards used lower perches and chose refuges that were closer to their perches compared to <b>rural</b> lizards. <b>Flight</b> initiation distance (FID) of urban lizards in the field was shorter than that of rural lizards, but only for males. In response to a second attack, only rural males decreased their FIDs, whereas urban males showed low and invariable FIDs. Laboratory measures of sprint performance showed expected differences between the sexes, but no significant difference between urban and rural populations. Unlike the strong differences between males across habitats, escape strategies of females were similar in urban and rural areas, most likely because females generally rely on crypsis to minimize predation risk and are resistant to flee when approached. In sum, urban lizards have access to a more complex structural environment, with greater perch and refuge options, and have habituated to non-lethal anthropogenic disturbance. These extrinsic and intrinsic factors combine to result in lower risk aversion and may explain the ability to tolerate urban environments. Significance statement Rapid urbanization is at its peak globally, and many animals are forced to adjust to the associated environmental changes or face local extinction. Some species, however, seem to persist in urban areas, and we hypothesize that they behaviorally respond by being less risk averse. We used a multivariate approach to understand the escape strategies of the peninsula rock agama across an urban-rural gradient. Lizards in urban areas use a more complex structural environment, with greater perch and refuge options, compared to rural lizards. Urban lizards also allow closer approaches. Because of the differences in body coloration and size, escape strategies of females were less affected by urbanization as they use crypsis to minimize predation risk. All these extrinsic and intrinsic factors combine to result in lower risk aversion by urban lizards and may explain their tolerance of human altered environments...|$|R

25|$|Although Native Americans in the United States have {{resided in}} what is now Iowa for 13,000 years, the written history of Iowa begins with the proto-historic {{accounts}} of Native Americans by explorers such as Marquette and Joliet in the 1680s. Until the early 19th century Iowa was occupied exclusively by Indians and a few European traders, with loose political control by France and Spain. Iowa became part of the United States of America after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, but uncontested U.S. control over what is now Iowa occurred only after the War of 1812 and after a series of treaties eliminated Indian claims on the state. Beginning in the 1830s Euro-American settlements appeared in the Iowa Territory, U.S. statehood was acquired in 1846, and by 1860 almost the entire state was settled and farmed by Euro-Americans. Subsistence frontier farming was replaced by commodity farming after the construction of railroad networks in the 1850s and 1860s. Iowa contributed a disproportionate amount of young men to fight in the American Civil War. Afterwards they returned to help transform Iowa into an agricultural powerhouse, supplying food {{to the rest of the}} nation. The industrialization of agriculture and the emergence of centralized commodities markets in the late 19th and 20th centuries led to a shift towards larger farms and the decline of the small family farm; this was exacerbated during the Great Depression. Industrial production became a larger part of the economy during World War II and the postwar economic boom. In the 1970s and 1980s a series of economic shocks, including the oil crisis, the 1980s farm crisis, and the Early 1980s recession led to the collapse of commodities prices, a decline in rural and state population, and <b>rural</b> <b>flight.</b> Iowa's economy rebounded in the 1990s, emerging as a modern mixed economy dominated by industry, commerce, and finance, in which agriculture is a comparatively small component. Iowa's population is now predominately urban and has been increasing since the 1990s at a faster rate than the U.S. as a whole, although <b>rural</b> <b>flight</b> continues to be a problem.|$|E

50|$|The {{onset of}} the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the late 19th century removed many of the checks that had {{previously}} constrained urban populations. As food supplies increased and stabilized and industrialized centers moved into place, cities began to support larger populations, sparking the beginning of <b>rural</b> <b>flight</b> on a massive scale. The United Kingdom went from having 20% of the population living in urban areas in 1800 to more than 70% by 1925. While the late 19th century and early 20th century saw much of <b>rural</b> <b>flight</b> focused in Western Europe and the United States, as industrialization spread throughout the world during the 20th century, <b>rural</b> <b>flight</b> and urbanization followed quickly behind.

5000|$|<b>Rural</b> <b>flight</b> began {{later for}} Russia {{and the former}} states of the USSR than in Western Europe. In 1926 only 18% of Russians lived in urban areas, {{compared}} to over 75% {{at the same time}} in the United Kingdom. Although the process began later, throughout World War II and the decades immediately proceeding, <b>rural</b> <b>flight</b> proceeded at a rapid pace. By 1965, 53% of Russians lived in urban areas. Statistics compiled by M. Ya Sonin, a Soviet author, in 1959, demonstrate the rapid urbanization of the USSR. Between 1939 and 1959, the rural population declined by 21.3 million, while that of urban centers increased by 39.4 million. Of this dramatic shift in population, <b>rural</b> <b>flight</b> accounts for more than 60% of the change. [...] Generally, most rural migrants tended to settle in cities and towns within their district. [...] <b>Rural</b> <b>flight</b> persisted through the majority of the 20th century. However, with the end of the Soviet Union, <b>rural</b> <b>flight</b> reversed as political and economic instability in the cities prompted many urban dwellers to return to rural villages.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{migrants}} {{choose to}} leave rural communities {{out of the}} desire to pursue greater economic opportunity in urban areas. Greater economic opportunities can be real or perceived. According to the Harris-Todaro Model, migration to urban areas will continue as long as [...] "expected urban real income at the margin exceeds real agricultural product" [...] (127). [...] However, sociologist Josef Gugler points out that while individual benefits of increased wages may outweigh the costs of migration, if enough individuals follow this rationale, it can produce harmful effects such as overcrowding and unemployment on a national level. This phenomenon, when the rate of urbanization outpaces the rate of economic growth, is known as overurbanization. Since the industrialization of agriculture, mechanization has {{reduced the number of}} jobs present in rural communities. Some scholars have also attributed <b>rural</b> <b>flight</b> to the effects of globalization as the demand for increased economic competitiveness leads people to choose capital over labor. At the same time, rural fertility rates have historically been higher than urban fertility rates. The combination of declining rural jobs and a persistently high rural fertility rate has led to rural-urban migration streams. <b>Rural</b> <b>flight</b> also contains a positive feedback loop where previous migrants from rural communities assist new migrants in adjusting to city life. Also known as chain migration, migrant networks lower barriers to <b>rural</b> <b>flight.</b> For example, an overwhelming majority of rural migrants in China located jobs in urban areas through migrant networks.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rural</b> <b>flight</b> did {{not occur}} uniformly {{throughout}} the USSR. Western Russia and Ukraine experienced the greatest declines in rural population, 30% and 17% respectively.

Increased diversification of crops and labor shortages were primary contributors to the gains in rural population in the periphery.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} {{examples}} of <b>rural</b> <b>flight,</b> several factors have led towards China’s massive urbanization.

50|$|In modern times, {{it often}} {{occurs in a}} region {{following}} the industrialization of agriculture—when fewer people are needed to bring {{the same amount of}} agricultural output to market—and related agricultural services and industries are consolidated. <b>Rural</b> <b>flight</b> is exacerbated when the population decline leads to the loss of rural services (such as business enterprises and schools), which leads to greater loss of population as people leave to seek those features.|$|E
