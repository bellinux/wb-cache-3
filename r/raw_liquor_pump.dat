In contrast, when C. kluyveri H 588 was co-cultured with Methanogen 166 the levels of H 2 remained low, whereas CH 4 levels were observed to gradually increase throughout fermentation. The above result {{made it clear that the}} co-culture system resulted in significantly increased caproic acid production than the mono-culture system, suggesting an important role for Methanogen 166 in this process. We confirmed that in the mixed cultures of C. kluyveri and Methanogen, C. Kluyveri contributed hydrogen which Methanogen 166 was then able to utilize for the production of CH 4. At the same time, the consumption of hydrogen by Methanogen 166 alleviated the feedback inhibition of hydrogen on C. kluyveri H 588, thereby improving caproic acid production (Hu et al. 2005). This mutual relationship has been found to be particularly evident in the pit mud of strong aroma Chinese liquor, as both C. Kluyveri and Methanogen 166 co-exist in the pit mud where they form a symbiotic relationship with each other. Previous research has shown that Methanogen 166 is present at particularly high levels in aged pit mud (Ding et al. 2014), normally towards the bottom section of the pit with comparably low levels in upper regions. In the traditional brewing of Chinese strong flavor <b>liquor,</b> high quality <b>raw</b> <b>liquor</b> is normally obtained from the bottom layers of Zaopei, which may be due to the larger amounts of Methanogen present in this region, allowing for superior elimination of hydrogen inhibition during the fermentation process, thus enhancing the production of aromatic compounds.

The present study investigated standardized 48 -h acute toxicity tests with a freshwater cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia dubia, and a marine amphipod, Paracalliope australis, against <b>raw</b> supernatant BRR <b>liquor</b> (RL) versus liquors neutralized with acid (ANL), CO 2 (CNL), seawater (SNL), and a hybrid method (HNL). Based on 48 -h LC 50 values, the toxicity of the liquors to C. dubia increased in the following order; HNL ≤ SNL[*] 3 ̆c[*]ANL ≤ CNL[*] 3 ̆c[*]RL, with comparable responses from P. australis. The high toxicity of RL likely is due to high pH (∼ 12), alkalinity, and Al concentration. Toxicity of CNL likely is due to high EC and alkalinity.

Table 66, partly illustrated in figure 22, shows the number of fires, fire injuries, fire fatalities, risk rates, employees' working hours, and lost workdays for all metal/nonmetal mining categories by time period. For all metal/nonmetal operations (including stone and sand and gravel), a total of 518 fires occurred during 1990 - 2001; 296 of those fires caused 308 injuries and 4 fatalities (Ewhr = 4, 012 x 106 hr, In = 0. 015, LWD = 36, 204). Thirty fires and 26 injuries involved contractors. The greatest number of fires and fire injuries occurred at surface operations; the highest risk rate values were also calculated for surface operations. The number of fires increased during the first four 2 -year time periods (1990 - 1991, 1992 - 1993, 1994 - 1995, and 1996 - 1997), then decreased {{during the last two}} periods (1998 - 1999 and 2000 - 2001). The number of injuries showed a decrease throughout the periods, accompanied by an increase in employees' working hours. Twenty-five firefighting interventions by mine rescue teams in underground mines and at least 30 interventions at surface operations were required to combat these fires. However, 45 fires destroyed or heavily damaged facilities and equipment (including 19 pieces of mobile equipment) because of failure of firefighting methods, late fire detection, undetected fires, or fire size. Ninety-seven fires were detected late, and 30 fires were undetected. The ignition sources that caused the greatest number of fires were flame cutting/welding spark/slag/flame (169 fires or 33 % with 137 injuries), hydraulic fluid/fuel sprayed onto equipment hot surfaces (89 fires or 17 % with 46 injuries and 3 fatalities), heat source/explosion and flammable liquids/ gas/refueling fuel on hot surfaces (98 fires or 19 % with 73 injuries), electrical short/arcing (51 fires or 10 % with 16 injuries), and spontaneous combustion/hot material (46 fires or 9 % with 17 injuries).

40|$|Straw {{black liquor}} is {{relatively}} difficult to recover using the Tomlinson process {{because of the}} presence of silica in inorganic components. Gasification with direct causticization might serve as a promising alternative; however, the interaction between silica and direct causticization agents needs to be evaluated. In this work, desilication was achieved using a laboratory-scale membrane electrolysis cell adopted from the chlor-alkali industry. Then raw and desilicated straw black liquors were carried out through direct causticization with titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and recycled sodium tri-titanate (Na 2 O center dot 3 TiO(2)) at 850 degrees C using a tube furnace. The results show that these two agents exhibit different silica transfer mechanisms. When using TiO 2, approximately 80 % of the silica is retained in the solid residue after hydrolysis because of chemical interactions. Almost all of the silica transfers to the hydrolysis-derived white liquor when using Na 2 O center dot 3 TiO(2). This means that the process of treating straw black liquor by direct causticization might need additional lime causticization to improve the efficiency of sodium recovery. This observation also indicates that silica will not consume the direct causticization agent Na 2 O center dot 3 TiO(2) after the initial step using TiO 2.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of Natal, Durban, 2003. The South African sugar {{industry}} generates excessive amounts of {{sugar cane bagasse}} (~ 25 wt% of feed) as a byproduct during the extraction of sugar juice from cane. Although bagasse is extensively consumed in various processes, a substantial amount remains unexploited. The industry's core business is the production of refined sugar which involves among others, a step of decolourising <b>raw</b> sugar <b>liquor.</b> Activated carbons are well known adsorbents and their excellent decolourisation capabilities have been established since 1800 in the {{sugar industry}}. The possibility of making suitable in-house activated carbons from sugar cane bagasse to aid the decolourisation process of <b>raw</b> sugar <b>liquor</b> is {{of interest to the}} growing South African sugar industry. The purposes of this research study were to develop an understanding on the manufacture of activated carbons from sugar cane bagasse, produce suitable activated carbons on a laboratory scale, characterize them and subsequently determine their sugar decolourisation capabilities under simulated conditions. The application of the two-step physical method of processing was found to be the most effective and feasible route to produce activated carbons from sugar cane bagasse for the purposes of decolorizing unrefined sugar. A semi-batch process was developed whereby compressed sugar cane bagasse was pyrolysed under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min to the final pyrolysis temperature for a desired hold time resulting in bagasse chars with a rudimentary pore structure. These bagasse chars were subsequently subjected to partial and controlled gasification with a steam/nitrogen mixture at higher temperatures to produce the final activated carbon product. Both pyrolysis and activation were carried out in a pyrolysis furnace that was modified to represent a fixed bed reactor system. The process was designed such that it included a steam supply and a gas cleaning system. Feasible processing conditions were established by varymg the temperature, hold time and partial pressure of steam in the pyrolysis furnace. The bagasse chars and final activated carbons were characterized with respect to surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution, methylene blue number, iodine number and molasses number. The optimum pyrolysis conditions were found to be at heating rate of 10 °C/min to the final pyrolysis temperature of 680 °C for a hold time of 1 hour, which gave rise to microporous carbons. Increasing the steam partial pressure and activation temperature during activation of bagasse chars resulted in the gasification reaction proceeding at a much faster rate leading to well developed mesoporous activated carbons having high adsorption capacity for large colour bodies present in molasses and sugar liquor. This was achieved by activating bagasse chars at a temperature of 900 °C for 2 hours with a steam / nitrogen mixture of 1 : 0. 6 which resulted in 50 % bum-off being reached. Excellent powder and granular activated carbons were produced from sugar cane bagasse fibres by the established process with the latter being mixed with refined sugar prior to pyrolysis and activating for half an hour extra. A typical final activated carbon produced in this research possessed a BET surface area of 995 m 2 /g, pore volume of 0. 82 crrr'zg, iodine number of 994 mg/g, molasses number of 700 and methylene blue number of 256 mg/g. High ash content in the bagasse raw material tends to decrease the surface area and pore volume for adsorption of the final activated carbon. Both granular and low ash bagasse activated carbons possess high adsorption capacity to remove large colour bodies from molasses and brown liquor solutions and compare well with commercial Norit N 2 carbon. Approximately 80 % colour removal was achieved using 0. 5 g carboni 100 g brown liquor. The bagasse activated carbons were stable in acidic and basic brown liquor solution and maintained their high decolourisation potential. The ability of bagasse activated to replace commercial activated carbons has been proven in this study. The option of producing both granular and powder activated carbons provide flexibility of the sugar industry to choose between batch and continuous adsorption systems during sugar decolourisation. This research has established that the fact that excellent sugar decolourising activated carbons can be produced from South African sugar cane bagasse fibres. However, more research needs to be carried out in order for the sugar industry to take this project to the commercial stage and it is suggested that a pilot study and an economic study be carried out...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the response of}} pineapple mill waste to anaerobic digestion, a simulated mill waste with a COD value equal to actual mill waste was made from commercial pineapple juice for this study. Ammonium hydroxide {{was used as a}} pH control and a nitrogen supplement. The study utilized batch-anaerobic digesters in initial stages to find optimum conditions for long-term studies which were conducted in 9 -liter bottles with periodic removal of digested waste and addition of fresh waste. Seed was composed of digested domestic sewage sludge, bottom sediment from a canal used for disposal of pineapple mill waste, and fermented pineapples and pineapple juice. Principal studies involved three digesters maintained at ambient temperature as controls, two digesters with 75 mg/l of phosphorus added, two digesters heated to 90 °F, and one digester whose contents were mixed by recirculation of digester gases. The digesters were operated for sixty days. Analytical parameters were COD, sugar, pH, ORP, volatile acids, gas production, gas composition, alkalinity, and total bacteria by the Breed Counting Method. The results of the study showed that pineapple mill waste undergoes a rapid initial decomposition. A reduction in COD occurred along with a rapid drop in sugar concentration and subsequent formation of volatile acids. Following initial activity, there is a period of inactivity after which recovery from the acid stage occurs and a steady reduction of waste material begins. The test data collected indicated that <b>raw</b> pineapple waste <b>liquor</b> is unsuitable for anaerobic digestion unless it is heated, stirred, or treated with phosphate. After sixty days of operation, digesters at ambient temperature, those with added phosphorus, and those that were stirred produced a COD reduction of 40, 51, and 53 percent, respectively. There was strong evidence that pineapple mill waste may be satisfactorily treated anaerobically if it is heated and optimum conditions exist.
