5|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} March 2015, {{when it was}} revealed by the State Department's inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing <b>recordkeeping</b> requirements. The controversy occurred {{against the backdrop of}} Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{discharge}} from the military, Day returned to the Eagles in time for Opening Day on May 5, 1946. He threw a no-hitter against the Philadelphia Stars, despite his absence, in a 2–0 victory, allowing just three base runners via a walk and two errors charged to his teammates. Hampered by a lingering arm injury, Day nonetheless lead the league that season in wins, strikeouts, and complete games. That same year, in the Negro League World Series, he pitched in two games as the Eagles edged the Monarchs in seven games, winning the championship. He played his final season in the Negro leagues in 1949 with the Baltimore Elite Giants. <b>Recordkeeping</b> was poor during Day's career; partial statistics credit him with a 67–29 record, but league historians claim he won as many as 300 games.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of peak {{intensity}}, Dvorak intensity estimates reached T6.0, equating to a minimal Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h). A trough located {{to the north of}} the hurricane began to weaken, causing the storm to track in a more westward direction. Kiko weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Arena, on the southern tip of Baja California, with winds of 115mph (185mph). Kiko was thus the second major hurricane to ever make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Baja California since reliable <b>recordkeeping</b> began in 1949, with the other being 1967's Hurricane Olivia. Due to the small size and slow movement of the storm, it rapidly weakened, becoming a tropical storm by 1800UTC. Convection associated with the storm significantly diminished; the center of circulation became nearly devoid of thunderstorm activity early on August28. Shortly after emerging into the Pacific Ocean, Kiko was further downgraded into a tropical depression, and turned towards the southwest due to interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Lorena. Tropical Depression Kiko dissipated around 1800UTC on August29; however, its remnants continued southward before being absorbed by Lorena.|$|E
5|$|An eyewall {{replacement}} {{cycle and}} weakening convection {{along the northern}} side resulted in steady weakening starting on July10. Increasing wind shear prevented the system from reorganizing as it neared East China. Early on July11, the typhoon reached the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge and began turning {{to the north and}} later north-northeast. Chan-hom made landfall in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, or roughly 140km (80mi) south-southeast of Shanghai, around 08:40UTC. The JMA assessed the storm to have had winds of 140km/h (85mph) while the JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at 155km/h (100mph). Based on the JTWC estimate, Chan-hom was the strongest typhoon to pass within 160km (100mi) of Shanghai in at least 35years, and it was the strongest landfall in Zhejiang since <b>recordkeeping</b> began in 1949. Thereafter the storm accelerated north-northeast and moved over the cool waters of the Yellow Sea, prompting further degradation of its structure. Chan-hom weakened below typhoon-force around 18:00UTC on July11. The system's low-level center completely exposed on July12 as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Around 18:00UTC, Chan-hom moved ashore on the Ongjin peninsula in North Korea, southwest of the capital Pyongyang, with winds of 95km/h (60mph). By 00:00UTC on July13 the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while retaining gale-force winds, and six hours later the system dissipated over north-central North Korea.|$|E
5|$|Henderson had 468 more {{stolen bases}} {{in his career}} than Brock, one short of 50% more than the game's second-most {{prolific}} basestealer. In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the record established ten years earlier by Yutaka Fukumoto for the Hankyu Braves in Japan's Pacific League. In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he {{led the league in}} steals every season except 1987, when he missed part of the season due to a nagging hamstring injury, allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical <b>recordkeeping</b> for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader. However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history. (Tim Raines ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at 84%.) On July 29, 1989, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners' left-handed Randy Johnson, his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was hitless in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August 1983, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd Rayford described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signalling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.|$|E

25|$|The <b>recordkeeping</b> and {{development}} of the economic history of Taiwan started in the Age of Discovery. In the 17th century, the Europeans realized that Taiwan is located on the strategic cusp between the Far East and Southeast Asia. Two main European empires that competed to colonize it were the Dutch and Spanish Empires. Taiwan also became an intermediate destination for trade between Western European empires and East Asia states. The history of Taiwan as a colony of the Dutch Empire, Kingdom of Tungning, Qing China, and Empire of Japan between 1630 and 1945 was based heavily on economics.|$|E

Derek Harris, the TVR chairman, attempted to pressure Saidel into purchasing fifty cars per year (rather than the previously agreed upon twenty-five.) Saidel {{walked out of}} the negotiations and made it clear {{in a letter to the}} factory, dated 18 June, that he felt TVR's expectations to be extremely unrealistic. By July 1959, the situation at TVR was dire; there were significant inconsistencies in pricing and in financial <b>recordkeeping,</b> stocks of components were not being properly managed, the factory did not employ enough skilled workers, and there were serious doubts about the capability of the company's leadership.|$|E
25|$|Touching down {{at around}} 6:25 AM EST in northwestern Hall County, this {{powerful}} pre-dawn F3 tornado traveled into southern White County, leaving a 13-mile long damage path through rural areas outside of Gainesville, Georgia, before dissipating at around 6:40 EST. It heavily damaged Lanier Elementary School and unroofed North Hall High School, while damaging or destroying several businesses. The school system {{did not fully}} recover until the next fall. At North Hall, the gymnasium {{was used as a}} temporary classroom {{until the end of the}} school year, while students at Lanier were temporarily relocated in three other area schools that were not affected by the tornado. About 40 homes were completely destroyed and another 130 were damaged to varying degrees. 45 mobile homes were also damaged or destroyed, with 11 of the fatalities who were inside those structures. The other fatality occurred when a tractor-trailer was carried by the funnel and slammed into a school bus, killing the driver. Eight chicken houses were also destroyed and about 100,000 chickens were killed. 40 cattle were also killed by the storm. In addition to the 12 fatalities, over 150 people were injured. A police officer was also killed after being hit by a car while assisting a motorist who was involved in an accident during the storm. The fatality was not directly attributed to the tornado itself. Since <b>recordkeeping</b> began, this storm stands as the second deadliest Georgia tornado since 1950 and the deadliest since an F4 killed 18 on April 30, 1953, south of Macon. The damage figures were estimated at between $15 million and $20 million with the majority of the damage in Hall County.|$|E

500|$|An annexed {{territory}} {{became a}} province in a three-step process: making a register of cities, taking a census of the population, and surveying the land. Further government <b>recordkeeping</b> included births and deaths, real estate transactions, taxes, and juridical proceedings. In the 1st and 2nd centuries, {{the central government}} sent out around 160 officials each year to govern outside Italy. Among these officials were the [...] "Roman governors", {{as they are called}} in English: either magistrates elected at Rome who {{in the name of the}} Roman people governed senatorial provinces; or governors, usually of equestrian rank, who held their imperium on behalf of the emperor in provinces excluded from senatorial control, most notably Roman Egypt. A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed, but he could delegate various duties. His staff, however, was minimal: his official attendants (apparitores), including lictors, heralds, messengers, scribes, and bodyguards; legates, both civil and military, usually of equestrian rank; and friends, ranging in age and experience, who accompanied him unofficially.|$|E
500|$|In February 2005, three infants {{were born}} with birth defects to migrant farmworkers within eight weeks {{of each other in}} Collier County, Florida. [...] Because one of the mothers had worked in North Carolina and the other two worked in Florida, neither state's health {{department}} attributed the cluster to pesticide exposure at first. [...] However, when they presented their findings at the annual SENSOR-Pesticides workshop in 2006, they realized that all three mothers worked for the same tomato grower during the period of organogenesis while pregnant, and that they may have been exposed to pesticides. [...] The state health departments reported the cluster to their respective state agricultural departments. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services inspected the grower's farms in Florida and fined the company $111,200 for violations they discovered; the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services conducted a similar inspection of farms in North Carolina and fined the company $184,500. [...] After the investigation, North Carolina Governor Mike Easley assembled the “Governor’s Task Force on Preventing Agricultural Pesticide Exposure.” [...] It presented its findings in April 2008, which caused the state legislature to pass anti-retaliation and <b>recordkeeping</b> laws, training mandates to protect the health of agricultural workers, and funding for improved surveillance.
