40|$|Abstract—The {{remediation}} of {{fine grained}} soils contaminated with heavy metal is a costly and time consuming process. This is Due to high and strong sorption of heavy metals by fine grained soils, low hydraulic conductivity of fine grained soils and non degradable nature of heavy metals. Numerous researchers {{have demonstrated that}} the application of acoustic waves can increase transport <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> through the coarse grained soils. However the effectiveness <b>of</b> acoustics for <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals from fine grained soils like clay, considering in-situ conditions, is until need to be evaluated. This research is thus aimed {{to determine the effects}} of acoustics on desorption of zinc from illite and silica mixture considering in-situ stress conditions. A series of column test was carried out with and without acoustic excitation. The acoustics was applied with different frequencies, acoustic powers and excitation times. It is seen that the application of acoustics can augment the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminant</b> from porous media. The <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminant</b> can be enhanced with increase in the power level and excitation time. Index Terms—acoustics, illite, silica, zinc, column tes...|$|R

40|$|Wide {{variety of}} {{inorganic}} compounds such as nutrients and trace metals, organic chemicals, radioactive contaminants and pathogens are commonly present as contaminants in the groundwater. Migration <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> in soil involves important mechanisms such as molecular diffusion, dispersion under physical processes, adsorption, precipitation and oxidation - reduction under chemical processes and biodegradation under biological process. Cr (VI) {{is a major}} and dangerous contaminant as per the ground water is concerned. There are numerous research work carried out with concentrated efforts by the researchers towards <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> Cr (VI) <b>contaminant</b> from aqueous solutions. There are few studies relevant to Cr (VI) removal with respect to utilization of low cost admixtures and also soil type. In the present study, different low cost admixtures like rice husk (RH), shredded tyre (ST) and fly ash (FA) are used to understand the performance in <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> Cr (VI) from aqueous solution and also two different soil types are used along with the admixture. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} sorption capacity and performance of individual admixture and combination of admixture with soil in <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminant.</b> The fly ash, rice husk and shredded tyre admixtures are used and the results revealed that the shredded tyre showed higher performance in <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminant</b> concentration. Also, the soil which has more fine particle content (size< 0. 075 mm IS sieve) showed reasonable reduction in concentration <b>of</b> <b>contaminant</b> at the lower levels <b>of</b> <b>contaminant</b> initial concentration.

5000|$|The {{decrease}} of temperature {{is based on}} the increase of bonding strength using plasma activation on clean wafer surfaces. Further, the increase is caused by elevation in amount of Si-OH groups, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> on the wafer surface, the enhancement of viscous flow of the surface layer and the enhanced diffusivity of water and gas trapped at the interface. Based on ambient pressure, two main surface activation fields using plasma treatment are established for wafer preprocessing to lower the temperatures during annealing.

This procedure is generally complete in approximately 30 seconds, and the remaining (unwanted) liquid is pipetted away. Washes are accomplished by resuspending the beads (off the magnet) with the washing solution and then concentrating the beads back on the tube wall (by placing the tube back on the magnet). The washing is generally repeated several times to ensure adequate <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants.</b> If the superparamagnetic beads are homogeneous in size and the magnet has been designed properly, the beads will concentrate uniformly {{on the side of the}} tube and the washing solution can be easily and completely removed.|$|E
50|$|The solids {{processing}} {{capacity of a}} thermal desorption system is inversely proportional to the moisture content of the feed material. The presence of moisture in the excavated soils to be treated in the LTTD unit will determine the residence time required and heating requirements for effective <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants.</b> In order for desorption of petroleum constituents to occur, most of the soil moisture must be evaporated in the desorber. This process can require significant additional thermal input to the desorber and excessive residence time for the soil in the desorber. Moisture content also influences plasticity which affects handling of the soil. Soils with excessive moisture content (> 20%) must be dewatered. Typical dewatering methods include air drying (if storage space is available to spread the soils), mixing with drier soils, or mechanical dewatering.|$|E

5000|$|A basic {{electrokinetics}} remediation site {{contains an}} external direct current source, a positively charged electrode (or anode) and a negatively charged electrode (or a cathode) placed into the ground.

The <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> and prevention of plume migration are big influences in determining the arrangement of electrodes. Each electrode is encased in a reservoir well in which an electrolytic solution can be injected. The electrolytic solutions serve both as a conducting media (or pore fluid) and as a means to extract contaminants and introduce chemicals or biological entities. [...] Another use of the electrolytic solution is for control and/or depolarization of electrode reactions. Immersed in a solution the electrodes can result in oxidation at the anode site and the reduction at the cathodic site. [...] The oxidation and formation of an acidic front are by products of the process and cause varying degree of influence to the system. By pumping, processing and testing the electrolytic solution at each electrode site you can extend the life and efficiency of the system.|$|E
