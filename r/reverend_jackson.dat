5000|$|Captain Healy and the <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jackson</b> became {{allies of}} a sort. During visits to Siberia (across the Bering Sea from the Alaskan coast), Healy had {{observed}} that the Chukchi people in the remote Asian area had domesticated reindeer and used them for food, travel, and clothing. [...] With the reductions in the seal and whale populations which had arisen from growing commercial fishing activities, and to aid Eskimos for transportation, <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jackson</b> and Captain Healy made numerous trips into Siberia and helped import nearly 1,300 reindeer to bolster the livelihoods of Native people. These became valuable tools {{in the provision of}} food, clothing and other necessities for Native peoples. This work was noted in the New York Sun newspaper in 1894. While Captain Healy was more of a law enforcement officer, Jackson was a humanitarian. Convinced that Americanization was the key to their future, Jackson actively discouraged the use of indigenous languages, traditional cultures, and spiritualities. Because he was worried that Native cultures would vanish with no records of their past (a process which ironically his own educational efforts would accelerate), he collected artifacts from those cultures on his many trips throughout the region.|$|E

Various {{politicians and the}} grandson of the missionary couple, <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jackson</b> Wilcox, attended the ceremony. Mkhize said [...] "William and Ida Belle Wilcox sacrificed all that they had in solidarity with the South African people." [...] Their work was awarded the Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo also in 2009 - the highest South African honour available to foreigners. The Wilcoxes were also honoured in a speech by the South African President Jacob Zuma in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|After marching {{only half}} a mile, the youth’s agitation, derived from a rumor {{that the police had}} killed a Hamilton High Student earlier that morning, erupted into vandalism, looting, and rioting. The police reacted brutally to the riot, {{launching}} against both nonviolent protesters and the youth. Reverend Lawson and <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jackson</b> urged protesters to return to Clayborn Temple. The marchers retreated to Clayborn Temple, while police surrounded the building. “The interior of Clayborn looked like the aftermath of a war,” Kathy Pittman Black reported. The entire building was filled with many injured and terrified protesters. The police attacked those that tried to the leave the church with mace, tear gas, and clubs. [...] At one point, police even entered the church, swinging clubs and shooting tear-gas canisters.|$|E
50|$|St Luke’s Episcopal Church is {{the fifth}} oldest church in the diocese and was {{organized}} as a mission, established in 1850 by the <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jackson</b> Kemper, the Episcopal Bishop of the entire Northwest Territories. The first Episcopal Bishop in the Minnesota Territory was Bishop Henry Whipple, serving from 1859 - 1901. Bishop Whipple worked to provide proper treatment and justice for the Native Americans, and was known as “Straight Tongue” to all nations. He was allowed to pass unharmed throughout the territory, even through scenes of battle. St. Luke’s Episcopal Church was the only church in town that permitted Native and African Americans to their worship services. “Indian Joe”, who was a friend to whites, alerted Hastings residents of impending attacks, and is buried in St. Luke’s Cemetery.|$|E

5000|$|One {{night the}} {{immigrants}} are {{left on a}} pier in Stillwater. It is dark and rainy, and no one understands what they say; they are completely abandoned, until Baptist pastor Henry O Jackson shows up and offers the immigrants shelter, warmth and food. As Danjel prays, thanking the Lord for the food, they {{find out that they}} have a word in common: [...] "Amen".Robert tells his friend Arvid of his plans to go on the California trail and dig for gold and asks him to come along. Karl Oskar is highly skeptical, but his brother is firmly set on leaving ("The Dream of Gold"). The women are amazed by how Pastor Jackson handles household chores, and begin to understand that women are more equal in this country. The immigrants struggle to communicate with <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jackson</b> ("To Think That Men Like Him Can Exist").|$|E
50|$|The film {{opens with}} a report announcing the murder in New Orleans of <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jackson</b> Bird, a {{controversial}} evangelist preacher who used his powerful position on television {{to spread the word}} of God. Detective Cassidy (Horsley) is assigned to the case, and is led to his prime suspect: Claire Laurent (Lucci), the owner of a lingerie company called French Silk. Claire would have a strong motive for killing Reverend Bird, considering that he wanted to close down her company for thinking it was too obscene. Even though Claire denies ever having met the man, the media think of her as the murderer, leading to much negative publicity. Cassidy, who is known for being tough, falls for Claire after the first meeting. Following the announce of his death, Claire's model friend Martine (Belafonte) immediately flies over from New York to support her. Claire is unaware that Martine had multiple reasons for coming over to New Orleans, including to resume an affair with married Congressman Alister Petrie (Metzler).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Reverend</b> <b>Jackson</b> had {{considerable}} {{common ground with}} another important American in the region. Captain Michael A. Healy of the United States Revenue Cutter Service, commander of the USRC Bear, was also known for his concern for the native Alaskan Eskimos. During this time, Captain Healy, {{who had been the}} first African American to command a U.S. ship, was essentially the law enforcement officer of the U.S. government in the vast territory. [...] In his twenty years of service between San Francisco and Point Barrow, he acted as a judge, doctor, and policeman to Alaskan Natives, merchant seamen and whaling crews. His ship also carried doctors and provided the only available trained medical care to many isolated communities. [...] The Native people throughout the vast regions of the north came to know and respect this skipper and called his ship [...] "Healy's Fire Canoe". [...] The Bear and Captain Healy were reportedly inspirations for authors Jack London's and James A. Michener's famous novels of the Alaska Territory.|$|E
