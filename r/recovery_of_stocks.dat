40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{that changes in}} zooplankton community structure {{over the past four}} decades led to reduced growth and survival of prerecruit Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and that this was a key factor underlying poor year classes, contributing to stock collapse, and inhibiting the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> around the UK. To evaluate whether observed changes in plankton abundance, species composition and temperature could have led to periods of poorer growth of cod larvae, we explored the effect of prey availability and temperature on early larval growth using an empirical trophodynamic model. Prey availability was parameterized using species abundance data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder. Our model suggests that the observed changes in plankton community structure in the North Sea may have had less impact on cod larval growth, at least for the first 40 days following hatching, than previously suggested. At least in the short term, environmental and prey conditions should be able to sustain growth of cod larvae and environmental changes acting on this early life stage should not limit stock recovery.

40|$|The American Fisheries Society (AFS) {{recognizes the}} need for {{conservative}} and robust management of Pacific rockfishes because of naturally low population growth, the overfished state {{of many of the}} stocks, and complex nature of the mixed-stock fisheries (60 -plus species). The AFS recommends that catch information be collected on a species-specific basis, and that management targets also be established on a species-specific basis including species taken as bycatch. Such management will require accurate studies of discards at sea. Reduction in rockfish discards should be a management priority in all fisheries which capture significant numbers of rockfish. The AFS further recommends establishment of adequate fishery independent surveys to more accurately assess and monitor rockfish stocks. The AFS supports the establishment of systems of Marine Protected Areas to protect the habitat of Pacific rockfish and to promote <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks.</b> Such areas should be established along with traditional management measures to control fishing mortality. Regardless of the management strategy used, substantial decreases in fishing mortality must be achieved soon to avoid stock collapses. The AFS encourages its members to become involved by providing technical information needed for protection of rockfish to international, federal, state, and provincial policy makers so decisions are made on a scientific, rather than emotional or political, basis...|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variability in the fish component of the diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella (Peters, 1875)) in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean was examined using diet data from 10 sites in the region including a 13 -year time series from South Georgia. The fish species composition in the diet at each site showed a strong relationship with the local marine habitat/topography. The absence of formerly harvested fish species indicates a lack of <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> of Notothenia rossii Richardson, 1844 at South Georgia and Champsocephalus gunnari Lönnberg, 1905 at the South Orkney Islands. At South Georgia, Protomyctophum choriodon Hulley, 1981, Lepidonotothen larseni (Lönnberg, 1905), and C. gunnari {{were the most important}} species in the diet between 1991 and 2004. Variability in the occurrence of C. gunnari was driven mainly by annual scale processes, particularly those that influence the availability of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba (Dana, 1852)). The occurrence of the pelagic P. choriodon was primarily influenced by shorter-term water mass changes within the foraging range of the seals. The fish composition in the diet reflects differences in marine habitat/topography, as well as variability, at a range of time scales that reflect environmental variability and harvesting...|$|E

40|$|A {{bank failure}} can have various adverse {{consequences}} for the clients. The adverse impacts might, however, differ depending on who takes over {{the operation of the}} failed banks. In this paper, we show that how to manage the new banks is important in mitigating the short-run and long-run consequences of bank failures. In the analysis, we focus on clients of three large failed Japanese banks - Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, the Long-term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB), and the Nippon Credit Bank. We examine when the number of bankruptcies increased and how the market valuation changed for the client firms after the banks' operations were taken over by new banks. As for the clients of LTCB, there were dramatic increases of bankruptcies in the short-run but the surviving clients showed significant <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> their <b>stock</b> prices. In contrast, as for the clients of the other two banks, there was neither dramatic increase of bankruptcies nor significant <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> their <b>stock</b> prices. The result implies that "shock therapy" or "soft budget constraints" had dramatically different consequences in solving bad loan problems in Japan. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the <b>stock</b> market {{downturns}} <b>of</b> 2000 - 2002 and 2007 - 09 have very different proximate causes. The early 2000 's saw a large increase in the discount rates applied to corporate profits by rational investors, while the late 2000 's saw a decrease in rational expectations of future profits. In each case the downturn reversed the trends of the previous boom. We reach these conclusions using a vector autoregressive model <b>of</b> aggregate <b>stock</b> returns and valuations, estimated imposing the cross-sectional restrictions of the intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM). As stock returns are very noisy, exploiting an economic model such as the ICAPM to extract information about future corporate profits from realized returns can potentially be very useful. We confirm that the ICAPM restrictions improve the out-of-sample forecasting performance of VAR models for stock returns, and that our conclusions are consistent with a simple graphical data analysis. Our findings imply that the 2007 - 09 downturn was particularly serious for rational long-term investors, who did not expect a strong <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> prices as they did earlier in the decade. ...|$|R

A prohibition on fishing in 1999 was followed by a short-term <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> biomass, but then a sustained decline to very low levels of abundance. Demographic survey data show that despite the decline in stock, recruit abundance was maintained implying an increasing larval survival rate, and that the stock decline was not due to recruitment failure. To verify this hypothesis we analysed a 10 -year long data set of weekly catches of sandeel larvae at a nearby plankton monitoring site to determine the patterns of larval mortality and dispersal. We found that the loss rate of larvae up to 20 d age decreased over time, corresponding with the trend in survival rate implied by the stock demography data. The pattern of loss rate in relation to hatchling abundance implied that mortality may have been density dependent.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{conflicting}} interpretations of the monetary policy {{carried out by the}} Federal Reserve during and after the financial crisis of 2007 - 08. That policy has been labelled as quantitative easing. The first interpretation of that policy is that the central bank will continue to flood the market with money to cause inflation or at least inflationary expectations. A depreciation would eventually do the same job too. Another interpretation, partially based on Minsky's theory of investment, is that easy monetary policy carried out beyond the lender-of-last-resort intervention might have the aim of sustaining the price of investment and validating firms' plans. In other words, it would be complementary to fiscal policy with the aim of sustaining profits and investment. The problem is that the Kaleckian model Minsky was using hardly corresponds to the present situation of the U. S. economy. The interpretation here proposed is that the aim of monetary policy is the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> financial asset prices to sustain banks profits and to restore the value of household wealth. This design might be considered as successful {{if we look at the}} recent data. But those signals are not encouraging if we look at long term sustainability <b>of</b> policies. The <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> prices has encouraged speculation on anything possible by the big banks.

40|$|During the Second World War (1939 - 1945) herring {{fishing effort}} in the North Sea was greatly reduced. The {{traditional}} autumn herring fisheries by Belgian fishers on the Flemish banks around the spawning areas in the southern North Sea however, continued during WWII. Data presented here show a 10 -fold increase in the Belgian ‘autumn spawning herring’ catches and a 5 -fold increase in landings per unit of effort of Downs herring during WWII. It is argued that these increased catches are explained {{by a combination of}} factors including the sustained effect of a major increase in catch power, the effects of strong pre-WWII year classes and the effects of decreased fishing mortality during the 6 -years cessation in fishing on the herring feeding grounds in the central North Sea and in the English Channel. The data and information presented here represent a period in which a gap exists in time-series of herring catches from the North Sea and in the stock assessment time series which currently go back to 1947. The results are also discussed in the context <b>of</b> the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the autumn spawning Downs herring.

40|$|ABSTRACT Fishing {{pressure}} {{affects the}} behavior of reef fish, especially of fishery-targeted species. In this context, {{it is critical to}} understand if fish behavior is preserved in no-take areas (NTAs), which are considered the best instrument for the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>stocks.</b> Comparing the flight initiation distances (FIDs) of fish inhabiting multiple-use areas (MUAs), where fishing is allowed (including spearfishing), and NTAs is a useful approach to test whether NTAs can be effective as fish refuges. Here, we compared whether the FIDs of two target (Sparisoma axillare and Scarus trispinosus) and one non-target (Halichoeres poeyi) labrids are greater in the MUAs than in the NTAs. We also investigated whether group size (GS) and body size (BS) exert any effect on the FID. We sampled four MUAs and four NTAs in the Abrolhos Bank (Brazil). We found that only for the targeted species FID was shorter inside the NTAs and that the BS had a positive effect on the FID of all species. The GS and BS of the fish are greater in the NTAs than in the multiple-use areas only for S. trispinosus. Our study shows that fish, especially those species that are fishery targets, display an avoidance behavior against spearfishermen likely as a consequence of fishing pressure. We suggest that the NTAs in Abrolhos are not only important sites for the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>stocks</b> but also possibly act as a repository area of naïve fish (fish that allow human approach), for reefs open for fishing...|$|R

40|$|Widespread {{losses of}} {{production}} and conservation values make large-scale ecosystem restoration increasingly urgent. Ecological restoration by means of biomanipulation, i. e., by fishing out planktivores to reduce the predation pressure on herbivorous zooplankton, {{has proved to be}} an effective tool in restoring degraded lakes and coastal ecosystems. Whether biomanipulation may prove a useful restoration method in open and structurally complex marine ecosystems is, however, still unknown. To promote a <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the collapsed <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua), large-scale biomanipulation of sprat (Sprattus sprattus), the main planktivore in the Baltic Sea, has been suggested as a possible management approach. We study the effect of biomanipulation on sprat using a statistical food-web model, which integrates internal interactions between the main fish species of the Central Baltic Sea, with external forcing through commercial fishing, zooplankton, and climate. By running multiple, stochastic simulations of reductions in sprat spawning stock biomass (SSB) only minor increases in cod SSB were detected, none of which brought the cod significantly above ecologically safe levels. On the contrary, reductions in cod fishing mortality and/or improved climatic conditions would promote a significant <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock.</b> By this we demonstrate that an ecosystem-scale biomanipulation, with the main focus of reinstating the dominance of cod in the Baltic Sea may likely be ecologically ineffective, operationally difficult, and costly.

40|$|The <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> a <b>stock</b> after severe {{exploitation}} is {{of major}} interest to fish ecologists and managers alike. Understanding {{the dynamics of}} recruitment at low stock sizes {{is crucial to the}} simulation <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> as they recover. Compensation in recruitment has occurred in North Sea herring, and it was stronger after the collapse <b>of</b> the <b>stock.</b> The compensation appears to be a product of both increased production of larvae per spawner and increased survival to the juvenile stage. There is only slight evidence for depensation and the point at which North Sea herring has zero recruitment appears close to the origin. There is more variability in recruits per unit spawning stock size when the stock is smaller, this is probably {{as a result of the}} potential larger diversity in contributions from spawning components in an unexploited stock compared to an overexploited stock. Mimicking this dynamic in population models will increase the uncertainties in a projection <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> <b>recovery.</b> The lack <b>of</b> observations at higher stock sizes hinders our ability to compare the dynamics of recruit to SSB across the full range <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> sizes, however, recent apparent over-compensation at higher spawning biomass has resulted in less than one recruit per mature adult being produced per year...|$|R
