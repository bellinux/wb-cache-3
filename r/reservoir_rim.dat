Due to temporal and spatial decorrelation in dense vegetated areas, effectiveness of InSAR and D-InSAR observations were always under scrutiny. Multi-temporal InSAR methods are developed in recent times to retrieve the deformation signal from pixels with different scattering characteristics. Presently, two classes of multi-temporal InSAR algorithms are available- Persistent Scatterer (PS) and Small Baseline (SB) methods. This paper discusses the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterer (StaMPS) based PS-InSAR and the Small Baselines Subset (SBAS) techniques to estimate the surface deformation in Tehri dam reservoir region in Uttarkhand, India. Both PS-InSAR and SBAS approaches used sixteen ENVISAT ASAR C-Band images for generating single master and multiple master interferograms stack respectively and their StaMPS processing resulted in time series 1 D-Line of Sight (LOS) mean velocity maps which are indicative of deformation in terms of movement {{towards and away from}} the satellites. From 1 D LOS velocity maps, localization of landslide is evident along the <b>reservoir</b> <b>rim</b> area which was also investigated in the previous studies. Both PS-InSAR and SBAS effectively extract measurement pixels in the study region, and the general results provided by both approaches show a similar deformation pattern along the Tehri reservoir region. Further, we conclude that StaMPS based PS-InSAR method performs better in terms of extracting more number of measurement pixels and in the estimation of mean Line of Sight (LOS) velocity as compared to SBAS method.

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} study the {{mechanism}} {{of oil and gas}} coordinated development in oil <b>rim</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> three-dimensional visualized gas-cap reservoir physical simulation device was established to simulate the processes of oil and gas development at different gas production rates. According to experimental result, it is shown that migration speed of oil-gas interface was reduced with increasing gas production rates while migration speeds of internal and external oil-gas interfaces gradually became close, which effectively slows down occurrence of gas channeling, reduces production gas oil ratio and increases the swept volume of gas drive, so as to improve its development effect. Moreover, optimization of coordinated development methods of gas-cap and oil ring under three different conditions was studied as well,. According to optimization result, it is shown that optimal gas production rate for coordinated development of oil and gas was different under different conditions and policies. If well shut-in problem (due to gas channeling) is not considered, optimal gas production rate is small, since development years of reservoir will become longer and its development effects will become better. If well shut-in problem is considered, accumulative oil and gas equivalent will be maximized when gas production rate is between 2 % and 4 %.

40|$|Thin oil <b>rim</b> <b>reservoirs</b> have an oil column {{thickness}} of ~ 10 &# 150; 30 meters and are overlain with a gas cap and underlain by an aquifer. Thin oil <b>rim</b> <b>reservoirs</b> have shown {{to lead to}} a relative low oil recovery when being produced. Quite common is an early breakthrough of gas and/or water, also known as coning. This study was initiated in order to perform an evaluation of four different completion types in horizontal wells in thin oil <b>rim</b> <b>reservoirs</b> underlaying a gas cap and overlying a strong aquifer. The completion types studied are: &# 149;	Screens without Inflow Control Devices (modelled as perforated liner here) &# 149;	Nozzle based Inflow Control Devices&# 149;	Autonomous Inflow Control Devices&# 149;	Autonomous Inflow Control ValvesA short review of the reservoir and well modelling is given with special focus on Autonomous Inflow Control Devices and Valves. Four different reservoir models are studied, a homogeneous model with a single horizontal well, a homogeneous model with a slanted well, a simple heterogeneous model with a single horizontal well and a real heterogeneous model with a bi-lateral horizontal well. The study showed that if a well is located partly in a gas cap or very close to it the AICV completion performs an optimal job, by choking back the gas efficiently. NICD/AICD is the second best, while no-ICD is the worst case. In a homogeneous model the four completions gave the same results. A single high permeable channel into the gas cap made a smaller impact than expected, but the AICV showed to choke back the gas here efficiently. NICD and AICD completion results are very similar in all cases, which could be linked to the parameter used in the RCP function from the AICD in this study. In the real heterogeneous case, the AICV does clearly the best job the first years, and is better than the NICD/AICD alternatives. It is interesting that the no-ICD case gave the highest ultimate oil recovery.

To see {{the effect of these}} parameters on recovery, a three-dimensional geological model of a clastic reservoir from Upper Assam Basin has been used. This model was history matched for a period of 16  years on 46 wells. After successful validation of model on field scale and well level, performance prediction was carried out to see the effect of withdrawal rate, offset from water–oil contact, horizontal length, compartment length and nozzle size using vertical/horizontal and ICD completion. From the analysis, it is evident that application of advanced well completion, ICD, is suitable for such reservoir. Depending on the scenario, maximum cumulative oil production was obtained from ICD wells with 1.08  MMm 3 compared to vertical well with cum oil production of 0.63  MMm 3.

Rock composition and structural characteristics of the reservoir is the basis of the factors that can affect the compactness of the reservoir. The formation of the reservoir is mainly affected by deposition, diagenesis and late tectogenesis: deposition can affect the composition of minerals, the original physical properties of clastic sediments and others; diagenesis is the main stages of the densification of reservoir, where compaction, pressure solution, cementation and late dissolution are the causes of the densification of <b>reservoir.</b> Dissolution and <b>rim</b> chlorite cementation improve reservoir property; tectonization can have an effect of late transformation on the physical properties of clastic reservoir.

30|$|Despite the {{enormous}} advantages of proposed coning/cresting control mechanisms from the literature, {{they are either}} expensive from high-energy consumption (pumping water to the surface or re-injecting water to the aquifer zone during oil production) and downhole installations or damage the producing well due to influx of materials used as barriers to control coning/cresting. Hence a safer, practical, inexpensive cresting control mechanism applicable in both thick-oil and thin-oil <b>rim</b> <b>reservoirs</b> is essential for field operations. Therefore, this paper sets out to investigate experimentally the feasibility of using an electromagnetic valve to proactively control cresting in a homogeneous reservoir characterized by both a strong bottom aquifer and considerable gas cap drive mechanisms. This was possible using a simplified physical reservoir model. The goal {{of this study is}} to reveal the mechanism of producing lower volumes of cumulative water at higher cumulative oil produced and possibly higher oil recovery ratios (ratio of volumes of oil recovered from an oil reservoir to the initial oil in place) in homogeneous oil reservoirs with a considerable gas cap and a strong bottom aquifer. The mechanism of this novel procedure is based on gravity segregation, capillarity and density difference (acting against existing viscous and gravitational forces during cresting) such that at a time, half the initial breakthrough times (half the time it takes for water and gas to encroach into the wellbore of an oil producing well) the electromagnetic valve is programmed to close almost immediately to shut oil production temporarily and after a set time, enough for the distorted WOC and GOC levels to recede, production is resumed automatically.|$|R
40|$|The use of wells {{equipped}} with inflow control valves has steadily {{increased over the}} past decade. Most of these wells are used to control the inflow from separate reservoirs or separate reservoir zones. This solution is particularly attractive for high-rate horizontal wells in thin oil <b>rim</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Through the smart well technology, early gas or water breakthrough into the well can be delayed or even reduced. The use of Inflow Control Devices (ICDs) and zonal flow control valves (FCVs) offers an opportunity to evenly distribute the drawdown along the well, and therefore take corrective action if an early water or gas breakthrough occurs. In September 2011, Statoil completed Troll’s first subsea three-zone horizontal smart well. Just recently, anther well on Troll with a similar completion design was put into production. One {{of the most important}} objectives in the study of well Q- 12 BH, which forms the basis for this report, is understanding gas coning behavior.

The approach taken begins by conducting an extensive literature review into coning control in thin oil rims and horizontal well technology. Early production data of well Q- 12 BH is studied, because knowing production history is a key into creating simulation models. These simulation models will analyze if the well was put into production with the most optimal zonal valve opening positions and what could possibly be even better setting for such a well.

40|$|Drilling {{horizontal}} wells {{has been}} provided to be useful for producing oil and gas. This meant increased production by maximizing the reservoir contact. However, due to heel-toe effect an uneven influx of reservoir fluid to the wellbore is a challenge. This may resulting in early gas breakthrough and uneven inflow down coming. These conditions can limit sweep efficiency and reduce hydrocarbon recovery. One good example of conventional heterogeneous oil reservoir with gas drive is the Troll field. This is a large gas field with relative thin oil zone. Inflow control technology was developed and introduced during the recent years to overcome some of these challenges. Inflow control device (ICD's) have improved well performance compared to conventional wells. For high-rate horizontal wells in thin oil <b>rim</b> <b>reservoirs</b> this solutions are especially attractive. The objective of this thesis was to evaluated horizontal well performance in a heterogeneous conventional oil reservoir with open hole and ICD's completion for two phase flow oil and gas. Simulations were performed by using OLGA coupling with Rocx as the simulating tools. Tecplot was used to present oil and gas saturation profiles in YZ direction in the reservoir. One of the goal in the thesis was to simulate with data's from a real felt with conventional oil production and comparing the results. All data's are provided in tables in the thesis, were the Troll field is in detailed described. The simulations data's are taken from earlier testing/simulations from well Q- 12 BH that are located on Troll field. The goal was to simulate both the open completion and ICD's completion until gas breakthrough occurred. For comparative purpose the same input criteria in Rocx were used in all cases. After approximately 45 days of production in the open hole simulations, gas started to drained into the production well. The production flow rate was about 5000 m 3 /day and after 57 days of production gas breakthrough takes place. Simulation with ICD's was also performed {{and in order to}} compare the effect of the ICD's, different restriction were tested in three different cases. Conventional oil production with ICD completion was about 1700, 1500 and 1300 m 3 /day in the three different cases. Based on the simulations result it seems that most evenly distributed restriction is to be preferred over time regarding to total oil production. Gas breakthrough did not take place after 57 days as in the open hole simulations.

40|$|The area {{of smart}} well technology, or {{closed-loop}} reservoir management, aims at enhancing oil recovery {{through a combination}} of monitoring and control. Monitoring is performed {{with a wide range of}} sensors deployed downhole or at the surface. These sensors allow for capturing changes in the reservoir conditions, mainly the fluid movement, at different resolutions. Downhole sensors give information of the fluid entering the well and sample only the region immediately adjacent to the well. Reservoir-imaging techniques are based on downhole or surface sensors and image large reservoir volumes typically with a resolution at the ten meter scale. Control is performed by installation of downhole flow control devices that can regulate the fluid inflow from the reservoir into the well ranging from on/off to a large number of settings. Combining monitoring and inflow technology allows using control strategies that mitigate undesired events such as premature water or gas breakthrough. Premature breakthrough of undesired fluids can reduce drastically the oil production and may cause the production well to be shut down. Generally the near-well region in the order of ten meters is poorly imaged. However, in specific reservoir environments the monitoring of the near-well region is strongly required. For example, thin oil <b>rim</b> <b>reservoirs</b> usually have a thickness in the order of few tens of meters and are characterized by early water breakthrough in individual segments of the well. Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is an enhanced oil recovery technique used in heavy oil reservoirs, where oil is extremely viscous and steam injection is used to facilitate the oil flow. A pair of horizontal wells is drilled into the reservoir only a few meters apart to allow for steam injection and oil production; however, the steam chamber growth and the oil flow are largely unknown. In both these examples a better understanding of the oil displacement process in the first ten meters from the production well could help preventing early breakthrough of unwanted fluids and allow for an implementation of more effective control strategies. We have investigated radar technology as a potential tool able to cover the monitoring requirements needed in specific oilfield environments. This feasibility study was carried out through numerical modeling and laboratory experiments. Through the numerical simulations we conclude that a borehole radar system can be used as a monitoring tool to probe the near-well region of several meters. The main constraint is the formation water electrical conductivity; high conductivity makes attenuation and phase distortion too high for wave propagation. Water/steam front reflections are detectable in low conductivity reservoirs (? < 0. 02 S/m). A system performance above 80 dB is necessary to detect reflections in the range of 10 m (chapters 2 - 3). Additional reservoir constraints are given by a high degree of time-lapse heterogeneity changes of the EM properties and the length of the transition zone from oil to water bearing rocks. The effects of changes in the reservoir can be solved by increasing the data acquisition frequency relative to the rate of the local temporal changes. A gradual transition zone reduces the water reflections, which are not detectable when the transition is in the order of the dominant wavelength of the EM signal (chapters 2 - 3). Numerical simulations were performed for both simple and complex geological scenarios. A sophisticated analysis was performed coupling electromagnetic and reservoir simulations. This allowed to evaluate the GPR performance in a realistic reservoir environment. Plotting the amplitude of the two-way-time reflected signal as the water advances toward the production well, where the radar system was located, appeared in clear up-dipping events (chapter 3). The metal components of the wellbore casing can destructively interfere with the signal emitted by the radar sensor; however a high dielectric medium around the sensor can increase the amplitude of the reflected signal and overcome the interference problem (chapter 2). Through the laboratory experiments we conclude general considerations on the GPR ability in monitoring oil displacement process governed by water. Water was injected in a meter-scale sand box and all the water flooding experiments presented similar characteristics. As for the modeling results, the amplitude of the two-way-time reflected signal as a function of the experiment time resulted in up-dipping events ascribable to the water front advance. According to the initial water saturation and porosity distribution continuous down-dipping events were associated to the up-dipping ones, forming wedgeshaped reflection features. The monitoring of the flow reflection features could be supported by attribute analysis, in particular, instantaneous frequency demonstrated to be a powerful tool to enhance wedge-shaped events. The analysis of the GPR data agreed with impedance measurements taken simultaneously during the water flooding experiments. The main limitation to the GPR monitoring potential is the electrical conductivity of the residual water. The experiments at a high salinity water injection showed a strong attenuation of the signal and a reduction of the resolution (chapter 4). Through an analysis of measured and modeled GPR signal it was possible to take in consideration the effect of uncertainties on subsurface characterization through full-waveform inversion. Subsurface characterization through full-waveform inversion relies heavily on the accuracy with which the forward model represents the actual GPR-subsurface system. Model errors can propagate through the inversion procedure resulting in wrong parameter estimates. The relative errors in the measured Green’s function are mainly determined by the antenna transfer functions uncertainties. Averaging over a large number of transfer function sets leads to a high-accuracy Green’s function estimate from the data, which leads to small errors in the estimated parameters obtained from full-waveform inversion. Provided the measurement conditions are respected, the inversion experiment adequately reproduces the estimated parameters. As soon as the measurement conditions are not completely respected, e. g., presence of extraneous objects, inversion experiments indicated that the accuracy of the estimates improves when calibration measurements to determine the transfer functions are acquired as close as possible to the measurement location (chapter 5) ...|$|R
