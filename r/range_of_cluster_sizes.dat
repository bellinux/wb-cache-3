We investigated the validity and reliability of four language mapping paradigms that may be appropriate for individuals with acquired aphasia: sentence completion, picture naming, naturalistic comprehension, and narrative comprehension. Five neurologically normal older adults were scanned on each of the four paradigms on four separate occasions. Validity was assessed in terms of whether activation patterns reflected the known typical organization of language regions, that is, lateralization to the left hemisphere, and involvement of the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left middle and/or superior temporal gyri. Reliability (test-retest reproducibility) was quantified in terms of the Dice coefficient of similarity, which measures overlap of activations across time points. We explored the impact of different absolute and relative voxelwise thresholds, a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>size</b> cutoffs, and limitation of analyses to a priori potential language regions. We found that the narrative comprehension and sentence completion paradigms offered the best balance of validity and reliability. However, even with optimal combinations of analysis parameters, there were many scans on which known features of typical language organization were not demonstrated, and test-retest reproducibility was only moderate for realistic parameter choices. These limitations in terms of validity and reliability may constitute significant limitations for many clinical or research applications that depend on identifying language regions in individual participants.

We put upper bounds on the EDM <b>of</b> sodium <b>clusters</b> and find that they are orders of magnitude smaller than the predictions. This provokes an interesting question: how can one define metallicity in metal clusters? Our measurements are performed at cryogenic temperature 20 Kelvin. At this temperature the clusters {{are believed to be}} in their vibronic ground states. Ph. D.

40|$|A {{cellular}} automaton in which cells represent agents playing the Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) game following the simple ”win-stay, loose-shift ” strategy is studied. Individuals with binary behavior, {{such as they}} can either cooperate (C) or defect (D), play repeatedly with their neighbors (Von Neumann’s and Moore’s neighborhoods). Their utilities in each round of the game are given by a rescaled payoff matrix described by a single parameter τ, which measures the ratio of temptation to defect to reward for cooperation. Depending on {{the region of the}} parameter space τ, the system self-organizes- after a transient- into dynamical equilibrium states characterized by different definite fractions of C agents ¯c ∞ (2 states for the Von Neumann neighborhood and 4 for Moore neighborhood). For some <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> τ the <b>cluster</b> <b>size</b> distributions, the power spectrums P(f) and the perimeter-area curves follow power-law scalings. Percolation below threshold is also found for D agent clusters. We also analyze the asynchronous dynamics version of this model and compare results...|$|R
40|$|Homogeneous droplet {{nucleation}} {{has been}} studied for almost a century but {{has not yet been}} fully understood. In this work, we used the density gradient theory (DGT) and considered the influence of capillary waves (CW) on the predicted size-dependent surface tensions and nucleation rates for selected $n$-alkanes. The DGT model was completed by an equation of state (EoS) based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) and compared to the classical nucleation theory and the Peng [...] Robinson EoS. It was found that the critical clusters are practically free of CW because they are so small that even the smallest CW wavelengths do not fit into their finite dimensions. The CW contribute to the entropy of the system and thus decrease the surface tension. A correction for the effect of CW on the surface tension is presented. The effect of the different EoSs is relatively small because by a fortuitous coincidence their predictions are similar in the relevant <b>range</b> <b>of</b> critical <b>cluster</b> <b>sizes.</b> The difference <b>of</b> the DGT predictions to the classical nucleation theory computations is important but not decisive. Of the effects investigated, the most pronounced is the suppression of the CW which causes a sizable decrease of the predicted nucleation rates. The major difference between experimental nucleation rate data and theoretical predictions remains in the temperature dependence. For normal alkanes, this discrepancy is much stronger than observed, e. g., for water. The theoretical corrections developed here have a minor influence on the temperature dependency. We provide empirical equations correcting the predicted nucleation rates to values comparable with experiments. Comment: 38 pages, 21 figure...|$|R
