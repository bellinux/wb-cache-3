50|$|A head catcher is {{a device}} {{placed at the}} top of the {{lubricator}} section. Should the wireline tools be forced into the top of the lubricator section, the head catcher, which looks like a small 'claw,' will clamp down on the fishing neck of the tool. This action prevents the tools from falling downhole should the line pull out of the <b>rope</b> <b>socket.</b> Pressure is bled off of the head catcher to release the tools.|$|E
5000|$|Stem {{essentially}} just {{serves to}} add {{weight to the}} toolstring. The weight {{may be necessary to}} overcome the pressure of the well. Some variations of stem, called roller stem, may have wheels built into the tool to allow the tool string to glide more easily down moderately deviated wells. Stem give the hammering action to the tool string which in turn allows the jars to transmit the force given by the movement of the stems bars. Depending on well conditions extra small OD stems are use or extra large. The range can be from [...]75" [...] to 3.50" [...] OD and the stems normally come in 2 ft, 3 ft or 5 ft lengths. The connection to the <b>rope</b> <b>socket</b> or other tools can be a threaded connection or a QLS system (quick connect).|$|E

However all sizes {{and types of}} {{construction}} require an effective method for attaching the ropes to other structures. One popular termination technique, particu-larly for larger diameter ropes, consists of using a steel conical socket into which a polyester resin mix is poured, creating a joint which secures the individual wires of the rope. The UK Health and Safety Laboratory were contracted by the UK Health and Safety Executive- Offshore Safety Division {{to carry out a}} series of large scale impact tests on 25 mm compacted stranded wire rope (this rope size is commonly used for offshore cranes and diving bell handling equipment) to determine if rope's performance was affected by strain rate. It was noted early in the testing programme that under dynamic loading, the <b>rope</b> <b>socket</b> often failed, whilst under static loading the wire rope always failed. The experimental data showed that the force and energy absorbed when the socket failed was considerably lower than the minimum specified for the wire rope. This has particular significance for the offshore industry where the launch/recovery of diving bells often results in large dynamic forces being applied to the rope and ancillary equipment. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{applicability}} of a long-range guided wave inspection technique called “magnetostrictive sensor (MsS) ” for inspection of suspender ropes was field-evaluated on the George Washington Bridge (GWB) in New York City. From a test location above the sidewalk of the bridge, a pulse of 10 -kHz longitudinal guided waves was launched {{along the length}} of the suspender and the reflected signals from geometric features and defects in the suspender were detected without requiring any paint removal. The test results showed that, from a single test location and without scanning the sensor along the rope, the MsS technique could examine the entire length of the suspender <b>rope</b> (from the <b>socket</b> to the main cable including the region over the main cable band) that was up to more than 100 -meters (330 -feet) long. The field tests indicated therefore that the MsS technique has good potential for providing a very cost- and performance-effective method of inspecting suspender ropes including areas that are remote and difficult to access, such as the socket end of the rope below the sidewalk and the region over the main cable band...|$|R
40|$|Previously {{the authors}} have {{presented}} both theoretical and experimental work discussing the operating mechanism of a wire rope held in a tapered socket {{by means of a}} cast resin cone. The work reported here extends the investigation to address {{the question of whether the}} same socket fabricated with white metal operates in the same manner. To date, previous investigations have compared the operational efficiency of resin and white metal in terms of both strength and/or fatigue endurance. Some other work has analysed the operation of resin sockets or specific cast metal terminations. This paper seeks to draw the results from this work together, and, in addition to a theoretical analysis, presents experimental data obtained from a direct comparison of the operation mechanism for the same sockets filled with resin or white metal. Results show that white metal terminations have a very different distribution of stresses along the length of the socket basket from resin terminations, and a smaller but still significant amount of socket draw. For both types of termination the socket draw develops high frictional gripping forces which can transfer the load from the <b>rope</b> to the <b>socket.</b> The different stress distributions mean that the consequences of termination fabrication defects may not be the same for resin and white metal terminations...|$|R
