5|$|In 2012, Laucke was {{nominated}} for the Order of Canada Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2015, he was again nominated for the same award; the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be announced in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Launched in July 2015, Paul Allen {{is funding}} the Global FinPrint initiative, a three-year survey of {{sharks and rays}} in coral reef areas. The survey is the largest of its kind and {{designed}} to provide data to help conservation programs. The initiative is a partnership between Allen's Vulcan Inc, Stony Brook University, Florida International University, James Cook University and the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences. Survey <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be made available in summer 2018.|$|E
25|$|For example, if n = 100, and p =1/4, {{then the}} average number of {{successful}} <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be 25.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be needed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be in ft2.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be used later.|$|R
25|$|Averaging these <b>results</b> <b>will</b> {{show that}} Student X {{with the lower}} grades {{ended up with the}} higher overall average score.|$|E
25|$|For {{the mass}} start and team pursuit events, skaters who have {{achieved}} {{any one of}} the above <b>results</b> <b>will</b> qualify.|$|E
25|$|The {{provisional}} {{election results}} were announced at 18:30 (UTC+2) on June 12, 2011. The official election <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be announced when all votes are counted.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} compact <b>result</b> <b>will</b> {{be useful}} later.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} convergence <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be also employed.|$|R
30|$|Our main <b>result</b> <b>will</b> {{be given}} as follows.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, Koolies {{registered}} with the Koolie Club of Australia have undertaken a breed Specificity test to identify the Koolie genetically, the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> help discover and create stronger bloodlines.|$|E
25|$|So both methods {{yield the}} same result, but again F {{is more than}} a 1000 times Ka. The next case does not have this {{condition}} and the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> differ.|$|E
25|$|HERMIONE {{natural and}} social science <b>results</b> <b>will</b> provide national, {{regional}} (EU), and global policy-makers and other stakeholders with the information needed to establish policies to ensure the sustainable use of the deep ocean and conservation of deep-sea ecosystems.|$|E
30|$|The next <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be of {{interest}} later.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} <b>result</b> <b>will</b> {{be used in}} the sequel.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the world}} of {{international}} financial Jewry, both in and outside of Europe, should succeed in plunging the Nations into another world war, the <b>result</b> <b>will</b> not be the Bolshevization {{of the world and}} thus a victory for Judaism. The <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be the extermination of the Jewish race in Europe.|$|R
25|$|A Y-DNA {{haplotype}} is the numbered {{results of}} a genealogical Y-DNA STR test. Each allele value has a distinctive frequency within a population. For example, at DYS455, the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> show 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 repeats, with 11 being most common. For high marker tests the allele frequencies provide a signature for a surname lineage.|$|E
25|$|Election {{results are}} {{announced}} through live broadcasts by {{radio and television}} stations. Some newspapers print special editions to cover the election results. In most constituencies, the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> {{be out on the}} night of the election day. In some rural constituencies and constituencies that need recounts, the results may not be announced until the next day.|$|E
25|$|Double-blind {{methods can}} be applied to any {{experimental}} situation {{in which there is a}} possibility that the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be affected by conscious or unconscious bias on the part of researchers, participants, or both. For example, in animal studies, both the carer of the animals and the assessor of the results have to be blinded; otherwise the carer might treat control subjects differently and alter the results.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be used {{to prove}} Theorem 4.1.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be {{an important}} tool in our approach.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} <b>result</b> <b>will</b> {{be useful}} further (see [[1], p. 2]).|$|R
25|$|Then {{the public}} has to choose one winning {{existing}} slogan out of 4 current slogans. CANBERRA - THE NATION'S CAPITAL, CANBERRA-AGE FRIENDLY CITY, FEEL THE POWER OF CANBERRA and the Parliament House logo. The losing 3 slogans will then be phased out once the new slogan plates will be manufactured {{in the middle of}} 2017. <b>Results</b> <b>will</b> be announced in March 2017.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{collaboration}} {{can help}} to reduce costs dramatically. Firms can release a specific software or product to be evaluated or debugged by online communities. The <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be more personal, robust and error-free products created in {{a short amount of}} time and costs. New ideas can also be generated and explored by collaboration of online communities creating opportunities for free R outside the confines of the company.|$|E
25|$|Easterly {{believes}} that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, {{one of the}} main failings of aid {{lies in the fact that}} we create large, utopian lists of things we hope to accomplish, without the means to actually see them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic <b>results</b> <b>will</b> follow.|$|E
30|$|The {{proof of}} our <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be {{established}} through several lemmas.|$|R
50|$|The test <b>result</b> <b>will</b> remains {{valid for}} 2 years for admissions.|$|R
30|$|This <b>result</b> <b>will</b> {{be used in}} {{the proof}} of the {{following}} theorem.|$|R
25|$|In 2009 {{the same}} company started a project to use 23,000 liters of water in a {{seasonal}} storage tank, heated up by evacuated solar tubes throughout the year, with the aim to provide the house with enough heat throughout the winter months thus {{eliminating the need for}} any electrical heat to keep the house comfortably warm. The system is monitored and documented by a research team from The University of Ulster and the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be included in part of a PhD thesis.|$|E
25|$|A small {{investment}} fund can potentially yield a higher return {{because it can}} concentrate its investments in {{a small number of}} good opportunities without driving up the purchase price as they buy in, and later sell them without driving down the sale price as they sell off. Conversely, a large {{investment fund}} must spread its investments among so many securities that its results tend to track those of the market as a whole. As the size of the market controlled grows, the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be closer to market average.|$|E
25|$|In Sparta PvP, {{the player}} starts {{off with a}} minimal amount of resources, a few villagers and their scout. Map {{selection}} is random and cannot be chosen by either players. Champion mode PvP <b>results</b> <b>will</b> also determine your TrueSkill ranking {{which is used to}} determine a player's rank globally as well as to help find the player a match and opponents for PvP. Currently, in Sparta PvP, there is an option for 1v1 PvP and 2v2 PvP. Rewards from Sparta PvP include experience points, empire points, gold and Sparta points which can be used in the stores in Sparta for chests, gear and consumables.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} <b>result</b> <b>will</b> play a {{very important}} role in this paper.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} {{remains the}} same but the <b>result</b> <b>will</b> be completely different.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} <b>result</b> <b>will</b> {{be needed}} in the proof of our main result.|$|R
