40|$|A {{number of}} areas of {{research}} and laboratory experiments were identified {{which could lead to}} development of a cost efficient <b>remote,</b> <b>disable</b> satellite recovery system. Estimates were planned of disabled satellite motion. A concept is defined as a Tumbling Satellite Recovery kit which includes a modular system, composed of a number of subsystem mechanisms that can be readily integrated into varying combinations. This would enable the user to quickly configure a tailored remote, disabled satellite recovery kit to meet a broad spectrum of potential scenarios. The capability was determined of U. S. Earth based satellite tracking facilities to adequately determine the orientation and motion rates of disabled satellites...|$|E
50|$|At this point, unlike Wardriving no {{software}} or {{techniques are}} publicly available to enable Warzapping by casual computer users. It is predicted that, {{with the rise}} in popularity of <b>remote</b> <b>disabling</b> devices, such software will soon become available.|$|R
50|$|<b>Remote</b> vehicle <b>disabling</b> systems provide users at remote {{locations}} {{the ability}} to prevent an engine from starting, prevent movement of a vehicle, and to stop or slow an operating vehicle. <b>Remote</b> <b>disabling</b> allows a dispatcher or other authorized personnel to gradually decelerate a vehicle by downshifting, limiting the throttle capability, or bleeding air from the braking system from a remote location. Some of these systems provide advance notification to the driver that the vehicle disabling is about to occur. After stopping a vehicle, some systems will lock the vehicle's brakes or will not allow the vehicle's engine to be restarted within a certain time-frame.|$|R
50|$|<b>Remote</b> <b>disabling</b> {{systems can}} also be {{integrated}} into a remote panic and emergency notification system. In an emergency, a driver can send an emergency alert by pressing a panic button on the dashboard, or by using a key-fob panic button if the driver is within close proximity of the truck. Then, the carrier or other approved organization can be remotely alerted to allow a dispatcher or other authorized personnel to evaluate the situation, communicate with the driver, and/or potentially disable the vehicle.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} the first active hardware metering scheme {{that aims to}} protect integrated circuits (IC) intellectual property (IP) against piracy and runtime tampering. The novel metering method simultaneously employs inherent unclonable variability in modern manufacturing technology, and functionality preserving alternations of the structural IC specifications. Active metering works by enabling the designers to lock each IC and to remotely disable it. The objectives are realized by adding new states and transitions to the original finite state machine (FSM) to create boosted finite state machines(BFSM) of the pertinent design. A unique and unpredictable ID generated by an IC is utilized to place an BFSM into the power-up state upon activation. The designer, knowing the transition table, {{is the only one}} who can generate input sequences required to bring the BFSM into the functional initial (reset) state. To facilitate <b>remote</b> <b>disabling</b> of ICs, black hole states are integrated within the BFSM. We introduce nine types of potential attacks against the proposed active metering method. We further describe a number of countermeasures that must be taken to preserve the security of active metering against the potential attacks. The implementation details of the method with the objectives of being low-overhead, unclonable, obfuscated, stable, while having a diverse set of keys is presented. The active metering method was implemented, synthesized and mapped on the standard benchmark circuits. Experimental evaluations illustrate that the method has a low-overhead in terms of power, delay, and area, while it is extremely resilient against the considered attacks. ...|$|R
40|$|Finding {{participants}} for evaluations with specific demographics {{can be a}} problem for usability and user experience specialists. In particular, finding participants with disabilities is especially problematic, yet testing with disabled people is becoming increasingly important. Two case studies are presented that explore using asynchronous remote evaluation techniques with disabled participants. These show that while quantitative data are comparable, the amount and richness of qualitative data {{are not likely to be}} comparable. The implications for formative and summative evaluations are discussed and a set of principles for local and <b>remote</b> evaluations with <b>disabled</b> users is presented. ...|$|R
50|$|Despite the benefits, {{the ability}} to control a packet capture {{appliance}} from a remote machine presents a security issue that could make the appliance vulnerable. Packet capture appliances that allow remote access should have a robust system in place to protect it against unauthorized access. One way to accomplish this is to incorporate a manual disable, such as a switch or toggle that allows the user to physically <b>disable</b> <b>remote</b> access. This simple solution is very effective, as it is doubtful that a hacker would have an easy time gaining physical access to the appliance in order to flip a switch.|$|R
50|$|The MRU {{service is}} an {{important}} component of the National Registration System (NRS). The NRS is primarily for the purpose of establishing the legal documents required by the law (ID cards, Resident cards and birth, death certificates) in addition to recording marriages and divorces events. These records are the main source of vital statistics concerning Civil Status. Accuracy and timeliness of civil registration are essential for quality vital statistics and planning. The MRU is vital in ensuring that the objective of the NRS is achieved, especially for <b>remote</b> areas and <b>disable</b> (People with special needs) who can be served at their home because the mobile unit comes to them.|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in student numbers in further {{and higher education}} {{over the last decade}} has been dramatic, placing greater pressures on academic staff in terms of contact hours. At the same time public funding of universities has decreased. Furthermore, the current pace of technological innovation and change and {{the fact that there are}} fewer jobs for life with clear pathways for progression mean that more of us need to be engaged in learning throughout our lives in order to remain competitive in the job-market. That is the reality of lifelong learning. Students are consequently demanding (especially as they are having to meet more of the costs of education themselves) a more flexible learning framework. This framework should be able to accommodate all types of learners - part-time, mature, <b>remote</b> and <b>disabled</b> students. The revised Disability Discrimination Act, which came into force in October 1999, only temporarily excludes education from its remit and has already challenged university practices. (Another JlSC-funded initiative, Disability Information Systems in Higher Education, addresses just this issue: [URL] All this is set against a backdrop of the government&#x 0027;s stated vision for a more inclusive, less elitist education system with opportunities for all, and the requirement for a professional and accountable community of university teachers...|$|R

The current RESORT prototype and its interface specification support also synchronisation of single switch non-speaking motor impaired users over narrow bandwidth network channels in order to contribute to the emerging tele-rehabilitation field. The IP based RESORT system with its scaleable user interface is described explaining also the remote service API which allows to make already available RT software products ready to benefit from RESORT's tele help functionality. Experiences from two real life tests in Vienna with severely motor impaired non-speaking subjects are reported and an outlook of current and future activities is given...|$|R
50|$|As Bud and Doyle are {{receiving}} a pizza delivery at the dome, they learn Jen and Monique are attending an environmental party with other men. Bud and Doyle decide to outdo {{the party and}} hold one inside the Bio-Dome to win them back. The party backfires as it throws the experiment into chaos and Jen and Monique disavow the boys. The scientists prepare to exit out the desert through the door. Doyle intervenes and demands they all stay and restore the dome to full health, swallowing the key as a last resort. As the group gets a grip on the situation and begins to fix the dome, Dr. Faulkner, who had disappeared {{the night of the}} party, has gone insane and is starting plans to blow up the Dome with homemade coconut bombs. As Earth Day approaches, the team is successful in restoring the dome and on the night before the doors open again, Bud and Doyle discover Dr. Faulkner. He tells the two that he is rigging pyrotechnics for the door opening ceremony and gets them to help plant the bombs. Once Bud and Doyle are on their own with the bombs, they goof off with one of the coconuts and after a failed long pass, discover their explosive nature. They alert the others and try to exit the dome early, but the door cannot be opened until the clock hits zero, when the bombs will go off. Bud and Doyle run back into the dome to find Dr. Faulkner and get him to deactivate the bombs. They wind up finding him and through a chase and struggle, knock him out and use the <b>remote</b> to <b>disable</b> the coconuts.|$|R
50|$|The Israeli advance was {{spearheaded by}} Combat Engineering Corps sappers opening routes and {{allowing}} the ground forces to advance while dismantling booby traps set up in great numbers by Hamas, often set to detonate upon entry to a building. Improvised explosive devices (IED) were a concern for Israeli soldiers. One Israeli commander said that booby traps were found in a mosque and one-third of the houses. He said {{that some of the}} traps were designed to assist in taking IDF soldiers captive. All such attempts failed. The IDF used D9 armored bulldozers to ensure that paths were cleared of IEDs. These bulldozers were also used to destroy tunnels. The unmanned, remote-controlled version of the D9 (called Black Thunder) were also used. In one case an armored D9 knocked down a door, which triggered an explosion of a building full of explosive on top of the D9. The D9 survived the explosion and building's collapse. Combat engineers that inspected the rubbles found a tunnel, cache of weapons and remains of a suicide bomber. Viper miniature robots were deployed by Israeli forces for the first time. These were used for various tasks including the disabling of IEDs. Along with blocking mobile phone communication, the IDF employed electronic jamming equipment to <b>disable</b> <b>remote</b> operated explosives. Among others, The IDF used the new Bull Island system {{for the first time to}} identify booby traps in buildings. Bull Island uses a camera shaped like a tennis ball that can be thrown into a building to transfer 360-degree imagery to the troops outside of the structure.|$|R
40|$|A goal {{among many}} law {{enforcement}} and security professionals, and the National Institute of Justice, is to decrease the risk that an officer or security guard may encounter. One risk that officers confront is unpredictable persons who sometimes try {{to gain control of}} the officer`s firearm. The addition of user-recognizing-and-authorizing technologies to a firearm could eliminate the capability of an unauthorized user from firing an officer`s firearm. Sandia National Laboratories has been active in the research and development of nuclear security systems that include access and use control technologies. Sandia is being sponsored by the National Institute of Justice to perform a research and development project to determine the feasibility of a user authorized firearm, or {open_quotes}smart gun. {close_quotes} The focus group for the research is law enforcement officers {{because of the number of}} firearm take aways that have occurred in the past and the severe use requirements placed on their firearms. A comprehensive look at the problem of weapon take aways in the United States was conducted using information available from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement sources. An investigation into the end user requirements for smart gun technologies has been completed. During the remainder of the project, the user requirements are being transformed into engineering requirements. which will then be used to evaluate numerous technologies that could be used in a smart gun. Demonstration models will be made of the most promising technologies. Other potential applications are <b>remote</b> enabling and <b>disabling</b> of firearms, transportation of prisoners by corrections officers, military use in operations other than war, and use by private citizens...|$|R
