40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} the in vitro {{effectiveness of the}} macrolide <b>rokitamycin</b> and the phenothiazine compound chlorpromazine against Acanthamoeba castellanii. Growth curve evaluations revealed that both drugs inhibit trophozoite growth in dose- and time-dependent ways. The effects of both drugs when they were used at the MICs at which 100 % of isolates are inhibited were amoebistatic, but at higher doses they were amoebicidal as well as cysticidal. Experiments showed that when <b>rokitamycin</b> was associated with chlorpromazine or amphotericin B, <b>rokitamycin</b> enhanced their activities. Furthermore, low doses of <b>rokitamycin</b> and chlorpromazine, alone or in combination, blocked the cytopathic effect of A. castellanii against WKD cells derived from the human cornea.

40|$|A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of <b>rokitamycin</b> in 30 patients (23 male, seven female; mean age, 59. 9 years ± 1. 7 SE) affected by infective disorders of the lower-respiratory tract. <b>Rokitamycin</b> was available in 400 -mg tablets; 18 patients were given 800 mg per day, and the remaining 12 were treated with 1, 200 mg per day. Treatment lasted between seven and 14 days. The germs that were initially sensitive to <b>rokitamycin</b> were completely eradicated, in particular, four of four Haemophilus influenzae, three of three Streptococcus pneumoniae, two of two Streptococcus pyogenes, three of three Staphylococcus aureus, two of two Staphylococcus epidermidis, and two of two Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The amount of sputum was considerable reduced, and body temperature and erythrocyte sedimentation rate values were also significantly lowered. The pneumology symptomatology was efficiently checked by <b>rokitamycin,</b> which proved to be well tolerated in general.

40|$|Intranasal {{delivery}} {{is an alternative}} method to target therapeutics in central nervous system (CNS). In the study here described, mucoadhesive microspheres based on chitosan glutamate (CG) and containing <b>rokitamycin</b> were prepared by spray drying and in vitro characterized. Moreover, the influence of chitosan glutamate on <b>rokitamycin</b> absorption in bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was evaluated after nasal administration to rats. The in vivo results were compared with those obtained after nasal administration of loaded <b>rokitamycin</b> chitosan (CH) microparticles and after intravenous administration of the free drug. The concentrations of feed solution or kind of chitosan influence the RK entrapment and size of microspheres. All formulations increase the solubility of this poorly water-soluble drug, but CG is more able to increase the in vitro dissolution rate of <b>rokitamycin</b> than CH. CG microspheres absorb water quickly and then dissolve, whereas CH particles need more volume of water for swelling and gelling.

In general, 14 -membered macrolides such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, and flurithromycin were more active against streptococci and Bordetella pertussis than was the 15 -membered macrolide azithromycin, which was more active than 16 -membered macrolides such as miocamycin and <b>rokitamycin.</b> Clarithromycin was the most active compound against Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species. Legionella pneumophila was most susceptible to miocamycin, clarithromycin, and <b>rokitamycin.</b> Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Haemophilus influenzae were most susceptible to azithromycin. Azithromycin and dirithromycin were the most active compounds against Campylobacter jejuni.

40|$|The {{nasal cavity}} has {{received}} much attention as a an alternative route for systemic administration of drugs with poor bioavailability and biosensitive and {{high molecular weight}} compounds such as proteins, peptides, steroids and vaccines (Arora et al., 2002), and as a possible route for direct brain-targeting of drugs (Illum, 2004). The use of chitosan is an interesting approach in nasal drug delivery since it is a mucoadhesive polymer considered biodegradable and biocompatible with low toxicity (Sinha et al., 2004). The {{aim of this study}} was to design, prepare and evaluate rokitamycin-loaded microspheres containing different types of chitosan for nasal administration and brain-targeting of the drug. Sixteen microparticulate formulations containing chitosan base, chitosan glutamate, or two chitosan derivatives, N+-chitosan- 7 and N+-chitosan- 8, loaded with <b>rokitamycin</b> were prepared using a spray-drying technique. Different preparation parameters were set; the polymer to drug ratios 4 : 1 and 5 : 1 and the feed solution concentrations 0. 25 % and 1. 0 %. The microspheres were characterised with respect to properties such as drug content, particle size and particle size distribution, morphology and in vitro release of <b>rokitamycin.</b> The water uptake was investigated on four selected formulations and the corresponding drug-free formulations. It was further carried out a mucoadhesion test on the four selected formulations. The effect of the different chitosans and the different preparation parameters on the microspheres properties was explored. Finally, an in vivo experiment was performed to evaluate chitosan microspheres as a nasal drug delivery system for brain-targeting of <b>rokitamycin.</b> This study shows that rokitamycin-loaded chitosan microspheres can be prepared by a spray-drying technique and that the type of chitosan, concentration of feed solution and polymer to drug ratio influence the characteristics of the microspheres. The formulations have properties suitable for nasal administration and are promising as delivery devices for direct nose-to brain targeting of <b>rokitamycin.</b> Drug-loaded chitosan glutamate microspheres prepared from a 1 % feed solution with the polymer to drug ratio 4 : 1 show promising results in vivo; <b>rokitamycin</b> is absorbed into the bloodstream after nasal administration. Further, preliminary results show that <b>rokitamycin</b> is able to reach the central nervous system after nasal administration of loaded chitosan glutamate microspheres...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{administration}} of macrolide antibiotics on cytochrome P- 450 in liver microsomes of male rats were investigated. The macrolides tested were {{those with a}} 14 -membcred ring such as oleandomycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin and eryth-romycin estolate, and those with a 16 -membered ring such as <b>rokitamycin,</b> leuco-mycin and josamycin. Cytochrome P- 450 -metabolite complex was detected with oleandomycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin and erythromycin estolate, whereas no such effect was observed with <b>rokitamycin,</b> leucomycin and josamycin. The content of uncompleted cytochrome P- 450 in liver microsomes remained unchanged with <b>rokitamycin,</b> leucomycin and josamycin, decreased with troleandomycin and oleandomycin, and increased with erythromycin and erythromycin estolate, indi-cating that oleandomycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin and erythromycin estolate also affect the amounts of other forms of cytochrome P- 450. The administration of oleandomycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin and erythromycin estolate resulted in a dramatic decrease {{in the activities of}} testosterone 2 a- and 16 a-hydroxylases in liver microsomes. Supporting these results, a marked decrease (more than 75 %) in the content of P- 450 -male, a major constitutive form of cytochrome P- 450 in male rats, was noted with oleandomycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin and erythromycin estolate, while the decrease was rather small with <b>rokitamycin</b> and leucomycin. We conclude that the administration of the 14 -membered ring macrolides may affect drug and steroid metabolism not only by formation of P- 450 -metabolite complex but also by decrease in the content of P- 450 -male...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} whether 55 isolates of erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC? 1 μg/mL) carrying mefA and/or ermB genes {{would develop}} resistance to telithromycin. Fifteen isolates, carrying only the mefA gene, had the M resistance phenotype by their susceptibility pattern and their susceptibility to <b>rokitamycin</b> {{did not change}} after exposure to 0. 1 μg/mL of erythromycin. Of the other 40 isolates, 25 carried the ermB gene and 15 carried the both mefA and ermB genes, all of them showed high resistance to clindamycin (MIC? 128 μg/mL) and were resistant to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLSB resistance phenotype). Twenty six isolates with the MLSB resistance phenotype showed decreased sensitivity to telithromycin after exposure to erythromycin, although the elevated MICs of telithromycin remained below 1 μg/mL, the remaining 14 isolates did not showed an obvious decrease of their sensitivity to telithromycin (only two-fold dilution). However, by adding the telithromycin disk to the erythromycin-rokitamycin double disk diffusion test, the zone of inhibition around the telithromycin disk was blunted proximal to the erythromycin disk in all isolates with the MLSB resistance phenotype including the 25 isolates which were considered to have a true cMLSB phenotype because of their constitutive resistance to <b>rokitamycin</b> (MIC? 4 μg/mL). Furthermore, in 16 isolates, highly resistance to <b>rokitamycin</b> (MIC? 64 μg/mL), the zone of inhibition around the telithromycin disk was blunted to both erythromycin and <b>rokitamycin</b> disks.

By the double-disk test, 65 strains, all carrying the erm(AM) determinant, were assigned to the constitutive macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B resistance (cMLS) phenotype, and the remaining 20, all carrying the mef(E) gene, were assigned to the recently described M phenotype; an inducible MLS resistance (iMLS) phenotype was not found. The lack of inducible resistance to clindamycin was confirmed by determining clindamycin MICs without and with pre-exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin. In macrolide MIC and MIC-induction tests, whereas homogeneous susceptibility patterns were observed among the 20 strains assigned to the M phenotype by the double-disk test, two distinct patterns were recognized among the 65 strains assigned to the cMLS phenotype by the same test; one pattern (n = 10; probably that of the true cMLS isolates) was characterized by resistance to <b>rokitamycin</b> also without induction, and the other pattern (n = 55; designated the iMcLS phenotype) was characterized by full or intermediate susceptibility to <b>rokitamycin</b> without induction turning to resistance after induction, with an MIC increase by more than three dilutions.

40|$|Background: Streptococcus pyogenes {{can cause}} acute {{suppurative}} infections (tonsillitis and pharyngitis) and serious complications like rheumatic fever or acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Antibiotic treatment of streptococcal infections is recommended and penicillin is the therapy of choice, moreover, macrolides represent an important alternative particularly {{for patients with}} ß-lactam-associated allergies. However, increasing resistance of S. pyogenes to macrolides has been observed in some European countries (especially in Spain and Italy) in the last decade. This {{study was conducted to}} update our knowledge on this evolution. Materials and methods: A total of 128 clinical strains of S. pyogenes isolated from 933 throat swabs collected in the Clinical Microbiological Laboratory of Ovada (ASL 22) between November 2003 and September 2006 were tested for their susceptibility to erythromycin, clindamycin and <b>rokitamycin.</b> The phenotype of macrolide resistance was determined by the triple-disc diffusion test method (Giovanetti et al, 1999). Results: S. pyogenes strains isolated between November 2003 and December 2005 showed a percentage of macrolide-resistance of 15 %; more precisely 9 % with phenotype M and 6 % with phenotype iMLS. Only 3 of the 28 isolates (10. 7 %) collected between January-September 2006 were macrolide-resistant (phenotype M). All 128 isolates were fully susceptible to <b>rokitamycin.</b> Conclusion: Macrolide resistance rates determined {{in the present study were}} relatively low in comparison to the values registered in our country in the last decade. Efflux of the drug (phenotype M) is the predominating mechanism. This type of resistance does not affect the activity of macrolides 16 -membered (e. g. rokitamicin).

The application of various thin-layer chromatography, paper chromatography, gas chromatography, {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} and capillary zone electrophoresis procedures for their analysis are described. These techniques have been applied to the separation and quantitative analysis of the macrolides in fermentation media, purity assessment of raw materials, assay of pharmaceutical dosage forms and the measurement of clinically useful macrolide antibiotics in biological samples such as blood, plasma, serum, urine and tissues. Data relating to the chromatographic behaviour of some macrolide antibiotics {{as well as the}} various detection methods used, such as bioautography, UV spectrophotometry, fluorometry, electrochemical detection, chemiluminescence and mass spectrometry techniques are also included. 1...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{interactions}} between individual macrolides {{and a number}} of pharmacologi-cally active compounds that are frequently co-administered to patients with bacterial infections is reviewed. Theophylline is strongly associated with erythromycin interaction; clarithromycin may also interact with this drug. Azithromycin, spiramycin and <b>rokitamycin,</b> however, do not appear to have any effect on theophylline pharmacokinetics. The other therapeutic agents considered are cyclosporin, the antiepileptics, carbamazepine and phcnytoin, terfenadine, warfarin, oral contraceptives, agents used in the management of gastritis and peptic ulcer and zidovudine. With the exception of interaction with antacids, {{there is no evidence that}} azithromycin, unlike most other macrolides, interacts with any of these agents to produce clinically significant adverse effects. The explanation for this variation appears to be azithromycin's inability to induce and bind to the cytochrome P 450 IIIA enzyme system...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of sub-MICs of erythromycin (EM) and other macrolide antibiotics on the serum sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa S- 6 grown for 36 and 48 h on agar with 10 micrograms of EM per ml (1 / 10 th the MIC) showed significantly increased sensitivity to human serum bactericidal activity compared with those of bacteria grown on agar without EM (P < 0. 05). No changes in serum sensitivity were observed in bacteria grown for less than 24 h. This increased sensitivity was apparent even at a concentration of 1. 5 micrograms of EM per ml (1 / 67 th the MIC) in bacteria grown for 48 h (P < 0. 01). Among the other macrolide antibiotics tested, clarithromycin also enhanced sensitivity to serum, but there were no changes in the sensitivities of bacteria grown on agar with kitasamycin, josamycin, <b>rokitamycin,</b> or oleandomycin even at a concentration of 12 micrograms/ml (1 / 16 th, 1 / 16 th, 1 / 8 th, and 1 / 33 rd the MICs, respectively). P. aeruginosa S- 6 grown on agar with subinhibitory concentrations of EM showed decreased cell surface hydrophobicity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas oleandomycin and <b>rokitamycin,</b> even at a concentration of 12 micrograms/ml, induced a slight decrease in hydrophobicity which was approximately equivalent to that of 1. 5 micrograms of EM per ml. Among six other strains of the nonmucoid phenotype, three strains became more sensitive to serum by exposure to 10 micrograms of EM per ml for 48 h. In contrast, no evident correlation between EM treatment and a change in serum sensitivity was observed in six strains of the mucoid phenotype, as judged by the results of experiments with both 2 and 0. 4 % serum. These results show that EM at subinhibitory concentrations enhances the serum sensitivity of some P. aeruginosa strains. Since induced serum sensitivity was accompanied by a decrease in bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity, EM may render P. aeruginosa more serum sensitive by changing the cell surface structure(s) of this organism...|$|E
40|$|YM 133, the 4 "-O-(4 -methoxyphenyl) acetyltylosin, {{is a new}} macrolide. The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of YM 133 was {{compared with those of}} erythromycin, josamycin, and <b>rokitamycin</b> by an agar dilution method. YM 133 inhibited 90 % of the tested isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella spp., and anaerobic bacteria at {{less than or equal to}} 1. 56 micrograms/ml. The drug inhibited 90 % of erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes at less than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml. YM 133 showed activity against erythromycin-, josamycin-, and rokitamycin-resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml) strains of staphylococci, streptococci, Bacteroides spp., and Clostridium spp. Enterococci were less susceptible to other YM 133 -like macrolides. Unlike other macrolides, YM 133 showed killing activity, and the MBC/MIC ratios of YM 133 for several strains were 1 : 32, whereas those of erythromycin were 4 : 1, 024. In a time-kill curve study, the reduction of viable cells started within 2 h after the addition of YM 133...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: (i) To {{determine}} the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of ABT- 773, a novel keto-lide, against sensitive and erythromycin-resistant pneumococci; (ii) to subdivide erythromycin-resistant pneumococci into resistance phenotypes, more extensive than the conventional M and MLSB groups, by assessing susceptibilities to, and interactions between, erythromycin (14 -membered macrolide), clindamycin (lincosamide), <b>rokitamycin</b> (16 -membered macrolide), ABT- 773 (ketolide), quinupristin (streptogramin B) and dalfopristin (streptogramin A). Methods: MICs and MBCs of ABT- 773 were determined for 165 strains of pneumococci (113 resistant to erythromycin). Extended phenotypes for the erythromycin-resistant strains were {{described in terms}} of intrinsic susceptibility to, and induction of resistance by, the anti-biotics listed above. Results: Erythromycin-resistant strains could be divided into 10 extended phenotypes (desig-nated II–XI), two of which (II and IX) predominated. ABT- 773 at 0. 12 mg/L inhibited 109 strains (median 0. 03 mg/L). MICs for the other four strains (of phenotypes X and XI) were 0. 25 – 1 mg/L. MICs were only slighter higher when measured on agar in CO 2 than by the NCCLS method (in broth in air). MBCs were usually ≤ 2 × MIC, but for 10 strains (eight of phenotype X, one each o...|$|E
40|$|Chlamydia pneumoniae strain TWAR was {{isolated}} from the respiratory tract of a S-year-old girl suffering from pneumonia. The IgM and IgG antibody titers to TWAR were 1 : 32 and 1 : 128, respectively. Cultures and serology for other common bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens were negative. Although she was treated with 3 S mg/kg/day <b>rokitamycin,</b> TWAR was repeatedly isolated after treatment. Her 3 -year-old sister developed acute bronchitis, and TWAR was iso-lated from her nasopharynx. She was treated with 43 mg/kg/day erythromycin with prompt im-provement, and TWAR was not isolated after treatment. Although her mother, grandmother, and 8 -month-old sister suffered from respiratory illness during these periods, TWAR was not {{isolated from the}}m. The repeated isolations from the index patient suggest that infection was transmitted from sister to sister. This case represents the first reported isolation of TWAR from young children in the same household and the first from Japan.
