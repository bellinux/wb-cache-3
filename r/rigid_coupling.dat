40|$|The use of {{optimized}} {{rail vehicle}} bogies contributes to increasing {{the efficiency of}} vehicles (reduction of production and operating costs, minimize wear, etc.) and to achieve environmental objectives (less energy consumption by using lightweight, noise reduction, etc.). Current rail vehicle bogies consist almost exclusively of two-axle bogies with wheelsets. This typical structure {{is to be found}} {{since the beginning of the}} railway system and has proven itself in many areas. Another principle is found in the independently rotating wheels bogies, which have no <b>rigid</b> <b>coupling</b> between the left and right wheels as opposed to the wheelset. The <b>rigid</b> <b>coupling</b> leads to a hunting motion, which can lead to instability at high speeds. To achieve an increase in the critical velocity, measures are taken, that are leading to a more complex design and also to more wear. The lack of <b>rigid</b> <b>coupling</b> between left and right wheels allows a significantly higher speed limit. However, system-inherent property of the independently rotating wheel bogie is a less good ability to drive through curves compared to the wheelset. It is therefore necessary to consider the areas in which independently rotating wheels bogies can be used. Today they are almost exclusively in use in tram-vehicles. Both in the area of freight transport as well as in high-speed traffic the independently rotating wheels bogies could not prevail. In this study the properties and the potential of independently rotating wheels bogies will be analyzed and on this basis a concept for a bogie will be created. It will be shown that, contrary to previous assumptions, independently rotating wheels bogies can fulfill the requirements more efficiently than wheelset bogies, particularly in high-speed traffic...|$|E

40|$|Modelling of elastically <b>coupled</b> <b>rigid</b> bodies is an {{important}} research topic in multibody dynamics. We consider the problem of modelling what can be called flexural joints, where two essentially <b>rigid</b> bodies are <b>coupled</b> by a substantially more elastic body. For modelling general elastic couplings one {{would like to have}} generically applicable, lumped parameter, intuitive, Euclidean geometric, accurate models with desirable physical symmetries. The model constitutive equations should be easily and quickly computable. For purely elastic coupling the constitutive equations should be truly energy conservative: the configuration-wrench equations should be derivable from a potential function. Linear and angular momentum should be conserved. Quaternion-based and twist-based modelling methods are presented. The constitutive equations to calculate the configuration-wrench behavior are derived via geometric potential energy functions. Wrenches are computable given the configurations of the rigid bodies and all the stiffness matrices of the compliant element. For an arbitrary pair of elastically <b>coupled</b> <b>rigid</b> bodies there exist coincident, unique points on the bodies known as centers of stiffness at which translation and rotation are minimally coupled.

Static force tests were made with 1 / 20 -scale models of the B- 29 and F- 80 airplanes {{to determine the effects of}} rigidly coupling the airplanes together. The Douglas configuration differs from the rigid configuration tested in that it provides for some freedom in pitch and vertical displacement.
