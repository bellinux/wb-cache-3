It is challenging and important to detect faces precisely for face recognition {{system in the}} field of public security. In this paper, we design a based on context modeling structure named Feature Hierarchy Encoder-Decoder Network for face detection(FHEDN), which can detect small, blur and occluded face with hierarchy by hierarchy from the end to the beginning likes encoder-decoder in a single network. The proposed network is consist of multiple context modeling and prediction modules, which are in order to detect small, blur, occluded and diverse pose faces. In addition, we analyse the influence of distribution of training set, scale of default box and <b>receipt</b> <b>field</b> size to detection performance in implement stage. Demonstrated by experiments, Our network achieves promising performance on WIDER FACE and FDDB benchmarks...|$|E

Both execution documents of People’s Defense Commissariat and State Defense Committee, decrees of Council of War of the 1 st Belarus and 1 st Ukrainian Frontlines, Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany and reports by frontline political authorities and military units political departments, concerning personnel sentiment in respect of command by People’s Defense Commissariat to permit parcels sending to the Motherland, emerging problems and the ways to overcome them. The introductory article highlights the features of perception of the enemy country, its way of life and the everyday life of its population by Soviet servicemen, the reasons of such phenomenon as barakholstvo and the reaction of political bodies to the “new sentiment” in the troops, having emerged after the border crossing...|$|R
40|$|The main {{question}} {{addressed in this}} analysis is how the production of undergraduate and graduate education {{at the state level}} affects the local stock of university-educated workers. The potential mobility of highly-skilled workers implies that the number of college students graduating in an area need not affect the number of college graduates living in the area. However, if the production of relatively large numbers of university graduates by colleges and universities also affects the industrial composition in an area, then there may be an association between the production and use of university-trained manpower. The size of the association between the flow of educational production and the stock of skilled workers provides one indicator of the magnitude of the externalities provided by the higher education industry. We find that the strength of the link between individual location choice and the state of degree <b>receipt</b> varies with <b>field</b> of study and the level of degree. Overall, there is a moderate link between the production and use of BA degree recipients; states awarding relatively large numbers of BA degrees in each cohort also have higher concentrations of college-educated workers. For medical doctors, the long-term link between production and stock is muc...|$|R

Although women, {{especially in}} the United States, have been choosing small-business ownership attempting to escape their inequality in the labor market, small businesses owned by women {{tend to be less}} successful than those owned by men. This research is considered to be an observation research based on secondary data and in a way some primary data defining the barriers facing the success of self-employed women in the US and in Lebanon. In other words this topic is looking into women's entrepreneurship that has been increasing from year to year in the American market as well as regionally and internationally, more specifically the service sector. The literature surrounding the topic suggests that women's entry into small capitalism resulted from their movement into expanding, but highly competitive, industrial niches that are relatively unattractive to men, like consulting, training, and development. These woman-owned businesses are concentrated within traditionally female-typed fields with lower average business <b>receipts</b> than male-typed <b>fields.</b> This paper brings together the different points of views in order to shed light on women's inability to gain greater parity with men in the small-business arena in Lebanon {{as well as in the}} United States. The purpose of this study is to investigate gender differences in initial motivations for starting a business in USA and Lebanon, and finding solutions for women's problems. 1 bound copy: 64 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
