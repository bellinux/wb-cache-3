IGN's Jeff Harris said Syaoran's role is interesting because he sacrifices {{his relationship with}} Sakura and his own life to recover her memories. Active Anime's Christopher Seaman said the romantic relationship between them {{is one of the}} most mature parts of the series, and it helped balance the other fantastic themes, which added more variety for the series' audience. Kimlinger said their <b>relationship</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for some problems in the anime adaptation. Kimlinger also said Jason Liebrecht's role as Syaoran's English voice is better than Irino's work. However, Kimlinger praised both performances because of the way Syaoran's emotions are played.|$|E

The paper shows how knowledge intermediaries (KI) facilitate the intermediation between heterogeneous organizations that are characterized by relational proximity that is the base for reaching effective innovation. The research depicts how Knowledge Intermediaries reinforce the relationship’s DNA in an Epistemic Network founded on loyalty, engagement and commitment to improve the strength of a <b>relationship</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> by a shared vision and shared destiny...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the business model adopted by science parks in order to manage the complexity of openness orientation in innovation development. The research is based on case studies related to Italian science parks that belong to a wider research focused on innovation and spatial relationships. The research results are mainly ascribable to science parks’ ability to facilitate networking among tenants as well as between tenants and external actors that belong to an epistemic network. As described in the case studies, science parks have become increasingly characterized by a new business model focused on providing value-added services through networking. These actors thus become knowledge intermediaries that allow firms to identify innovation parties and transform them into innovation partners, thereby facilitating the shift from outsourced innovation to co-managed innovation. In this way, knowledge intermediaries support tenants and business partners in reinforcing the relationship’s DNA founded on loyalty, engagement, and commitment to improve the strength of a <b>relationship</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of a shared vision and shared destiny...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the famous “hymn” in Philippians 2 : 5 – 11 is {{considered}} {{from the perspective}} of the study of ritual failure. It is argued that the crucifixion of Jesus, as it is mentioned in this text, can well be considered as a ritual that, on the one hand, fails, given that it leads to Jesus’ exaltation rather than to his permanent death, while it is at the same time reinterpreted as a consequence of Jesus’ obedience rather than of his disobedience, as one would expect. Using the body of theory as it has been developed concerning ritual and its failure, it is shown how this reinterpretation of a ritual is more than “just” about ritual, but serves to carve out a space for early Christianity and its selfunderstanding in the web of power <b>relationships</b> that <b>made</b> <b>up</b> Greco-Roman society.

40|$|The current craze for the {{so-called}} relationship marketing in business markets must not mask the fact that, beyond economic and technological interdependencies between companies, business <b>relationships</b> are also <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of social interactions.

On the basis of an investigation into international project activities, this article develops a ritual approach for managing the extrabusiness phase of business relationships.

Catfishing is a recent internet phenomenon, of manipulating, deceiving and luring people into relationships, through creating an online fictional persona. In many cases these deceptions are used to create romantic or intimate affairs. Since the affair happens entirely through technology, one is able to hide their true identity and carry on the <b>relationship</b> through their <b>made</b> <b>up</b> character. The majority of these incidences happen through social media sites, such as Facebook, and internet dating sites where people are already looking for love, and therefore can be easily manipulated by peoples personas and deceptions.|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) That the {{outcomes}} of policy initiatives often diverge from initial policy intentions is widely known. In the realm of educational Information and Communication Technology (ICT) policy, {{the extent to which}} policy agendas are realised is somewhat obfuscated the complex, and often politicised, educational environment. The ‘undefined something’ that causes policy misalignment has proven to be elusive. This thesis outlines the journey taken to develop, execute upon and refine a framework and methodological approach to examining where, when, how, and why a large educational ICT policy – the Australian Digital Revolution (DER) / National Secondary Student Computer Fund (NSSCF) – saw mutation (realignment / misalignment) of its policy agenda. My approach was to blend the Actor Network Theory (ANT) for examining the macroscopic level of the policy environment (the structural <b>relationships</b> that <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the policy environment), with Luhmann’s Model of Autopoiesis for examining the microscopic level (the vectors between the actors which carry policy intent). Application of this new framework to the DER / NSSCF revealed several structures within the language of policy transmission that demonstratively gave rise to realignment, and thus mutation, of the original policy agenda. Furthermore, I identify how such policy realignment remains hidden from policymakers...|$|R

Semi-structured interviews with 10 couples were done, which were transcribed and submitted to the content analysis. All the couples reported marital violence related to alcohol use. Violence, mainly verbal and physical ones, was committed by both partners and it became worse due to increase of amount of alcohol ingestion. Other relational and professional difficulties, associated to continuous use of alcohol, were reported, in addition to the history of substance use and violence in the origin families of the participants. This study makes evident the complexity of the marital violence associated to the alcohol dependence, which must be considered for the prevention programs, interventions and the couple guiding – as a system that requires full attention...|$|R

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] English. The family in London of the seventeenth century resided at the intersection of practices heard from the pulpit and of generic forms those listeners might see in the theaters. Upon both of these ideals lie the inevitable valences of authority for the householder. Because the householder's relationship with each member of his family necessitated differing levels of responsibility, the householder likely maintained different expectations for each. Even though I isolate specific plays and relationships within this dissertation, each relationship affects the others, compounding the complex interactions within the home. This complex web of relationships is merely one small part of a much larger social web in the vast city. The treatment of the family as society in small, however, allows for a modern interpretation of the city, or at least {{a vital part of the}} city for many of its citizens. Putting the city comedies together with conduct books allows for a range of possible, socially acceptable behaviors that stem from both a concern for reputation outside of the home and a desire for concord within the home. These plays make clear the complexity of living in the city household - and thus the complexity of <b>relationships</b> that <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the real part of the city, the people. While ideals might be preferable, the actual relationships in the home require the flexibility that the plays suggest for new inhabitants of the city...|$|R
