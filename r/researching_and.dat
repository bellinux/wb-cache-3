5|$|Hand {{graduated}} from Harvard Law School in 1896 {{at the age}} of 24. He returned to Albany to live with his mother and aunt, and started work for the law firm in which an uncle, Matthew Hale, was a partner. Hale's unexpected death a few months later obliged Hand to move to a new firm, but by 1899, he had become a partner. He had difficulty attracting his own clients, however, and found the work trivial and dull. Much of his time was spent <b>researching</b> <b>and</b> writing briefs, with few opportunities for the appellate work he preferred. His early courtroom appearances, when they came, were frequently difficult, sapping his fragile self-confidence. He began to fear that he lacked the ability to think on his feet in court.|$|E
5|$|In April 1980, Voight's {{publications}} on landslides and avalanches {{and other}} mass movements {{attracted the attention}} of Rocky Crandell of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who asked him to look at a growing bulge on the Mount St. Helens volcano in the state of Washington. Voight foresaw the collapse of the mountain's north flank as well as a powerful eruption. His predictions came true when St. Helens erupted in May 1980; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the debris avalanche that initiated the eruption. After his work at St. Helens brought him international recognition, Voight continued <b>researching</b> <b>and</b> guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career, including Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, Mount Merapi in Indonesia, and Soufrière Hills, a volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. For his research, publications, and disaster prevention work as a volcanologist and engineer, Voight has been honored with numerous awards, appointments, and medals.|$|E

He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Understanding the Massey Lectures {{were part}} of the Canadian culture, Gopnik, who was born in Philadelphia but lived in Montreal between the ages of 10 to 25, wanted a topic that would be {{relevant}} to Canadians but also have universal appeal: winter.

Gopnik spent the next year <b>researching</b> <b>and</b> writing the book, alongside another non-fiction book he was working on at the time: The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food.

5|$|Narayan's next {{published}} work was the 1967 novel, The Vendor of Sweets. It was inspired {{in part by}} his American visits and consists of extreme characterizations of both the Indian and American stereotypes, drawing on the many cultural differences. However, while it displays his characteristic comedy and narrative, the book was reviewed as lacking in depth. This year, Narayan travelled to England, where he received {{the first of his}} honorary doctorates from the University of Leeds. The next few years were a quiet period for him. He published his next book, a collection of short stories, A Horse and Two Goats, in 1970. Meanwhile, Narayan remembered a promise made to his dying uncle in 1938, and started translating the Kamba Ramayanam to English. The Ramayana was published in 1973, after five years of work. Almost immediately after publishing The Ramayana, Narayan started working on a condensed translation of the Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharata. While he was <b>researching</b> <b>and</b> writing the epic, he also published another book, The Painter of Signs (1977). The Painter of Signs is a bit longer than a novella and makes a marked change from Narayan's other works, as he deals with hitherto unaddressed subjects such as sex, although the development of the protagonist's character is very similar to his earlier creations. The Mahabharata was published in 1978.|$|E

In this case, <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development has become a major need that can give alternative in solution of local development. The role of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development is demandding quality {{that can be used in}} the procces of preparing the planning of local development programs. In the context of increasing the quality of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development that is done by Bappeda, there are a very complex handicap must be faced. Some problem that must be overcome quickly is a relatively lower quality of the personnal on <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development, the policy of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development do not refer to five agenda of development at Central Java Provice, lack of authorithy and competence in implementing the function of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development and also limitation in facility of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development net sistem that is still by sector.
