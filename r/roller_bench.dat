The method used here consists in measuring the acoustic pressure on a double layer half-sphere array which base is lying on the surface of interest.

40|$|Advanced driver {{assistance}} systems are increasingly available on road vehicles. These systems require a thorough development procedure, {{an important part}} of which consists of hardware-in-the-loop experiments in a controlled environment. To this end, a facility called Vehicle Hardware-In-the-Loop (VeHIL) is operated, aiming at testing the entire road vehicle in an artificial environment. In VeHIL, the test vehicle is placed on a <b>roller</b> <b>bench,</b> whereas other traffic participants, i. e., vehicles in the direct neighborhood of the test vehicle, are simulated using wheeled mobile robots (WMRs). To achieve a high degree of experiment reproducibility, focus is put on the design of an accurate position control system for the robots. Due to the required types of maneuvers, these robots have independently driven and steered wheels. Consequently, the robot is overactuated. Furthermore, since the robot is capable of high-dynamic maneuvers, slip effects caused by the tires can play an important role. A position controller based on feedback linearization is presented, using the so-called multicycle approach, which regards the robot as a set of identical unicycles. As a result, the WMR is position controlled, whereas each unicycle is controlled, taking weight transfer and longitudinal and lateral tire slip into account. © 2006 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|International audienceVarious {{methods can}} be used to achieve a better {{understanding}} of road noise propagation from the road to passengersears. This paper deals with a decomposition of the low frequency structure-borne noise transmission paths at the wheel center in order to assess tire/wheel and vehicle effects. It has been performed jointly by a car and a tire manufacturer. This decomposition involves blocked forces and vibroacoustic frequency response functions, both requiring specific setups to be measured on a <b>roller</b> <b>bench.</b> As road noise is a random process, a principal component analysis has to be performed on tire/wheel blocked forces to properly handle dynamic excitations. Since the interface between wheel and suspension is rather stiff, the quality of tire/wheel blocked forces measurement strongly rely on bench test characteristics. In addition, comparisons between results coming from tire and car manufacturers may be distorted due to differences of road surfaces of rollers. Another difficulty is related to rotating effects that cant be neglected and which can alter the quality of the road noise recomposition. One challenge still remains to measure transfer functions in operating conditions. When handled with care, those items lead to pretty good results.

40|$|Motor vehicle {{ride comfort}} is mainly {{affected}} by reciprocating engine inertia unbalances. These forces are {{transmitted to the}} driver through the main frame, the engine mounts, and the auxiliary sub systems - all components with which he physically comes into contact. On-road traction vehicle engines are mainly characterized by transient exercise. Thus, an excitation frequency range from 800 RPM (≈ 15 Hz for stationary vehicles) up to 15, 000 RPM (≈ 250 Hz as a cut off condition) occurs. Several structural resonances are induced by the unbalancing forces spectrum, thus exposing the driver to amplified vibrations. The aim {{of this research is}} to reduce driver vibration exposure, by acting on the modal response of structures with which the driver comes into contact. An experimental methodology, capable of identifying local vibration modes was developed. The application of this methodology on a reference vehicle allows us to detect if/when/how the above mentioned resonances are excited. Numerical models were used to study structural modifications. In this article, a handlebar equipped with an innovative multi reciprocating tuned mass damper was optimized. All structural modifications were designed, developed and installed on a vehicle. Modal investigations were then performed in order to predict modification efficiency. Furthermore, functional solution efficiency was verified during sweep tests performed on a target vehicle, by means of a <b>roller</b> <b>bench</b> capable of replicating on-road loads.

The investigations are based on former work conducted {{within the framework of}} the EU-IP InMAR and make use of an existing test-car equipped with an active windshield. The active windshield consists of the passive structure augmented with optimally placed piezo-ceramic transducers. Main focus of the subsequent work was the development and evaluation of different control strategies (H 2, FxLMS) designed with regard to either local or global performance metrics. Due to the lack of a <b>roller</b> test <b>bench,</b> the structural excitation was realized by an electrodynamic exciter (shaker) lo-cated at the roof brace between the A-pillars. By this choice it was possible to emulate the struc-tural excitation of the windshield due to rolling and motor force harmonics.

40|$|Abstract. Validation and {{optimization}} {{of technical}} systems are central {{activities in the}} product development process. One {{part of it is}} the calibration and validation on a level, which covers the whole vehicle. The aspect, that plays the most important role in both validation and optimization, is the driving condition. Especially in the case of hybrid vehicles, state variables like the state of charge (SOC) have great influence on the operating strategy and therefore on assessment criteria. The article’s objective is to present a procedure, which performs the conditioning and brings the planned maneuver into an order, which reduces the total needed conditioning duration. Thereby a lot of time can be saved, according to the type and amount of the possible maneuver and state values. In addition to optimizing the order of conventional maneuver, the procedure can be used to optimize the list of maneuver in a DOE-Plan. Thereby the maneuver of the individual criteria can be re-sorted as well as the designparametervariation.

In terms of control systems, the presence of storage provides additional freedom to minimize the vehicle’s fuel consumption. In a previous paper [1] an analytical solution to the energy management problem for fuel cell hybrid propulsion systems was derived and compared with existing strategies like the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) [1 – 4]. An experimental study {{has been carried out}} on a Fiat Doblo, which was converted from a regular gasoline powered vehicle into a fuel cell hybrid vehicle.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to reduce driver vibration exposure by acting on the modal response of key contact structures. The footplate is one of the components with which the driver comes into contact while riding. For this reason, footplate geometry and structural properties were investigated with a view to re-designing this component in order to reduce driver exposure. Due to the massive chassis area on which the footplate is constrained, vibrations induced by engine unbalances easily propagate in quasi-steady conditions on all surrounding components, inducing a width frequency band of load excitation. Even though the footplate geometry allows for fairly high natural frequencies, these could occur in the excitation range. Therefore, the first step of the methodology proposed entails the use of a numerical and experimental (modal analysis) procedure to identify the local vibration modes of the original components to detect if/when/how the resonances of the above mentioned components are excited. Due to an awareness of the weakness of the original solution, structural modifications, using numerical models, were studied. The footplate geometry was modified to minimize nodal displacement of the footrest beam binding. All structural modifications were designed, developed and installed on the vehicle. Finally, in order to predict modification efficiency, both the new footplate and the original one were experimentally compared. The comparison was made by means of modal investigations and by positioning the reference vehicle on a suitable <b>roller</b> test <b>bench</b> in order to simulate real working conditions...|$|R
40|$|A very {{stringent}} {{problem in}} most of European cities is the individual mobility. This problem is mainly caused by traffic jam and arising from this are two particularly interesting environmental issues: pollution and noise [1]. Use of two wheeler vehicles does not represent the final solution to these problems, nevertheless they can supply a useful aid to ease them. Recently, two stroke engines are being replaced with four stroke engines. For small capacity engines this means a true reduction in exhaust emissions, especially unburned hydrocarbons (HC), but, {{on the other hand}} it involves a performance reduction, particularly for sudden accelerations, which constitute an essential requirement for these vehicles [2, 3, 4, 5]. Hybridisation can help to fill the gap between two stroke engines and cleaner, but less performing four stroke engines [6]. At the same time, it can help to lower fuel consumption, by means of a reduction in the revolution speed [2, 5]. This paper presents a study on a parallel hybrid scooter prototype {{from the point of view}} of a better matching between the characteristics of the internal four stroke combustion engine and of the electric motor. Wave fluid-dynamic 1 D code was used in order to create a model of the internal combustion engine. The model validation was carried out by the comparison between the simulation results and the experimental data obtained with the <b>roller</b> test <b>bench.</b> Then, some modifications were analysed in order to optimise the behaviour of the engine at a lower revolution speed of the engine, thus diminishing the specific fuel consumption of the vehicle.
